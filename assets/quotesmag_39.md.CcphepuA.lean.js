This is one of my friend's favorites, for whatever reason, and she saw fit to make me listen to it. In fact, she saw fit to make me STUDY it. So I listened to each song multiple times and analyzed her printed lyrics. I came to the conclusion that it was almost entirely without worth.

'Aenima' is too experimental and dissonant to even be placed in this genre. Just because a band muffles and adds effects and blurbs and grunts to their lead vocals and does stupid things that most bands don't, and throws in a few unexpected riffs and time changes in the process does not good music make.

First, there's a different bass player on this CD, hence that deep-digging, heavy bass is nearly absent entirely!! Did they think we wouldn't notice? (That was the back-bone of Undertow!) And if you listen closely you can hear the lead guitar wandering to fill in the vacant bass licks (this, in turn, steals from the guitar parts). Trust me. Also, the production is spongy and flat. And the songs wander way too much. Just when you think they're finally going to nail one, they digress, again and again and again. Very frustrating. I guarantee you will not sit through this CD from top to bottom. Strangely enough, their brightest point is also their biggest departure, \\"Hooker\\" is extremely powerful, albeit different. If you're not a diehard fan, skip this CD, you WILL hate it. As for Tool, can you get that bass player back?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus, people, it isn't THAT great . . .","review":"What the hell . . .there's GOT to be someone out there that doesn't like this band. Aenima has two good songs - Die Eire Von Satan and Stinkfist. The rest of it is average heavy radio grunge, nothing more. These guys are out to shock rather than musically impress. To me, if you've heard one of their songs, you've heard 'em all. It amazes me that people consider these guys \\"deep and emotionally moving\\". I find them fairly one dimensional; a band like Mr. Bungle outclasses these guys in originality AND depth by light years. It also amazes me that people call this band \\"metal\\". Every song from Undertow and Aenima is the same riff played in a different time signature. Then again, this is the nineties, the only decade that's musically WORSE than the eighties.

Melodic tunes accompanied by lyrics with dark undertones and hidden agendas make trying to figure out the entire meaning of a song just as much fun as thrashing around to the music on the album.

In the album Aenima, tool really sets you off with roaring guitars, pounding drums, and Keenan's vocals. To tell you the truth, its very hard to put in words to say how great Tool really is. Just think if there was a scale from 1 to 100, I would pick something like 100,000,000,000,000/or mabye more. There is no reason that you can hate this band, no reason at all.

This CD portrays that beautifully. You can listen to this CD while relaxing or while head-banging, or while in the shower singing notes you know you can't hit but you love to sing the song and have to but.. that's another story :) This is a great CD for any rock lover.

They are utterly incredible. I would love to use all the same adjectives that everyone else has used (read: scary, depressing, sad) but I don't see it as that. At most, I see it as dark. But like everyone has said, it's a journey, a journey that ends with a question mark, and a blank space, that you must fill with your own feelings. As for the intermissions... I don't care about them. \\"Message to Harry Manback\\" is GREAT... \\"Dier Von Satan\\" is awesome if looked at from a different perspective. It shows how simple minded most of us are.

Not many. Aenima stands up as an album that will be just as fresh and just as good in another 10 years. The album merges the dreamy with the aggressive. While lots of so called metal bands went for overblown macho bombast, Tool remains with a sound that is heavy, provoking and powerful. They do it not by doing speed guitar or up from your bowls growls and lame rap; they do it with music that has a real center, a true core. Maynard has something to say.

Maynard writes lyrics for people who can think, and I deeply respect him for that. But on the music side, this album falls flat. There's 15 tracks on this album, but about 6 of them are \\"filler\\" tracks. Meaningless noise or talking. That's hard to believe, but it's true. The other songs have riffs that are eaither corny or boring. \\"Aenima\\", the one catchy song on the album is very unoriginal.

'Aenima' is dissonant, unpleasant, and directionless to say the least, and their music is simply terrible!

The lyrics are about lots of things in life. Things that are not necessarily mainstream - however the sale of this cd has reached mainstream numbers. So in that sense it is a very mainstream cd even though I find the lyrics to have a very underground quality about them. Song number 7 on this cd is called \\"Hooker with a penis\\" for example.

I guess the only way to label this cd would be call it an experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shrouded Darkness All Around Me","review":"This has to be one of the best albums i own.

If you are blinded by the ideals of a decaying society.... TOOL is NOT for you. IF you are only into love at first listen.... TOOL is NOT for you. Tool is like a good movie: The more times you watch it, the more you see and understand. You can't sit down and listen to tool with preconceived ideals. You can't listen to tool with a closed mind. Hell, you can't even listen to tool and take them seriously. Tool is all about not letting anybody tell you how to think. Including them. Sit back, draw the world in for yourself, and develop an original thought of your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Although not as good as Lateralus, this album is awesome.

A bit different in style than Undertow and Opiate, which were more stright up edgey rock'n'roll.

I am a huge Tool fan, and according to some other reviewers out there, that fact alone classifies me as unquestionably dim-witted (oh, excuse me while I wipe that slobber off of my keyboard). However, if you are new to Tool's work, I highly recommend this album. It will give you a taste of the evolved Tool. If you happen to be \\"dense\\" enough to enjoy it, go for the gold and go all the way back to Undertow and see what you think of their older work. You'll hear the difference! Hard Alternative fiends need to try this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album by a great band","review":"Many people dont know Tool very well, and of those that do many dismiss them as being crude or strange.

No other vocalist can compete with Maynard, from singing duets with Tori Amos to earth shattering screams with Zack de La Rocha, he is truely amazing. But the thing about TOOL is not just Maynard, Justin Chancelor, Adam Jones, and Danny Carey are also amazing. Danny Carey is hands down the best drummer to ever touch a percussion instrument. And when you take all this and put it together to create something special that people can take within themselves and be inspired to create something as well. For all you non-believers listen to any one of their CDs, or see them in concert, and it will make you a believer. And for those people who said such bad things about them like Ditto Ellis and Self-fulfilling Prophecy, they need a metal tool slapped in their face, to help open up their little minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily said the best ever","review":"This is easily the best album ever!

This album is incredible. And from hearing \\"schisms\\" on the radio last night their fourth studio album Lateralus (to be released May 15th, 2001) will be great as well.

He brought in this CD to work and i sat down on my break and listened to it, i was amazed at it. Being a musician myself makes it ever more amazing to here it, they are such amazing musicians. When i first bought this cd, i bought Undertow at the same time, it scared me, maybe b/c i was listenin to it in my grandma's creepy basement, but soon it hit me that this recording is maybe the best cd, out of all 300 i have, that i have ever bought. It takes you through a journey of emotion from rage to depression to even a little fear. I would suggest anyone going to buy this album, b/c it is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"My girlfriends music","review":"I dont even own this album yet but i love it. My girlfriend owns it so that sorta means i can steal it every once and awhile hehe. Anyways I think this music is great. It really keeps me going and for some reason i think its the coolest makeout music. Dont ask why though. Its dark and deep. I LOVE THIS BAND!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never gets old.","review":"nima is one of the most origional albums that i have ever purchased. It is the first of TOOL's music that I have heard, and it sure set a positive future for my TOOL listening. After listening to this album I went out and bought Undertow, also by TOOL. And which later lead me to buying A Perfect Circle. Which features the lead singer from TOOL, Maynard. Like i said.. This cd never gets old like some one-hit-wonders. Everytime I listen to this CD, my love for the band grows larger and larger. If you are a fan of good music, i definitly suggest you chcking this band out... you will not regret it, and you will be giving a small amount of money for hours upon hours of absoultly magnificent, inspiring, beatiful, rich, MUSIC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is great","review":"this album is very moving emotionally and is just good music. Whoever doesn't understand that doesn't understand good music. The new album is actually better, but this is still an amazing album that deserves 5 stars just like any other TOOL album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool...A Sweeter View of a Bitter Darkness","review":"Tool defies the any genre. They are beyond any classification, and I think the band would like it that way. If the unique feel of the music doesn't tantalize you, listening to the lyrics will. This band is undeniably enlightened and twisted to a degree that true rock fans *MUST* appreciate. From Maynard's sharp vocals, to the enticing feel of the cords, to the perfect beat of the giant complexity of the drum set Tool uses, this band is incredible. Buy this album, listen to it, go online, go print out the lyrics, read the lyrics, then listen again. Just listening doesn't cut it with this band. You must understand Tool. When was the last time you took the time to analyze a song? This band has filled there songs with very clever content. Everything blends. After one song...You'll recognize Tool for the rest of your life. The cover of this CD alone should tell you something...Trust me..\\"I must persuade you another way\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest CD in existence","review":"When I first heard this CD in sixth grade, I immediately dismissed it as some lousy head-thrashing junk. Even so, I made a tape of it. Soon, I started listening to it incredibly often. It eventually became, and still is, my all-time favorite CD ever. Buy this CD now; don't mind the price. You will not regret it ever. Also: Taproot - Gift; Factory 81 - Mankind; anything by Deftones; Linkin Park - Hybrid Theory; Undertow, Opiate, Lateralus (when it comes out), etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece...","review":"This is one of the milestones in rock music for the 90's...It sounds so fresh and powerful years after it was released. Everything here is A-class: I give it 5 stars even for the CD package...I've read some negative reviews by people who just don't get it...it's like trying to explain quantum physics to a philosopher. So please, all you who don't like this album give us a break and don't take the time to write reviews for it. Just relax listening to ricky martin and stuff like that and let us \\"stupid\\" people in our nirvana...Anyway, if you buy this CD, get 2 copies minimum... As another reviewer says, CD's don't have great durability...Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hardcore? emotional? beautiful? good? in a word: no.","review":"I am an avid fan of the hardcore music genre and though i usually stay away from Cd's with explicit lyrics, everyone told me to give this a try cause it was \\"a wonderful and beautiful piece of hardcore music.\\" I am not impressed in the least. What I found was music so watered-down and sterile that it had to be saturated with profanity to create the shock and turn the heads that the sloppy guitar riffs and drumming that would make AC/DC look like jazz fusion would not. It makes me sick that the mass market embraces such an utter lack of musical ability and profanity. If this band only made an album every 5 years, like they have been, I would not be upset in the least. Pass this one up and spend your time reading or listening to real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overrated band of all time","review":"If there's anything more boring than listening to this album, it's hearing nerdy fanboys drooling over Tool. \\"Oh, Tool is genius, they play such insane time signatures, blah blah blah...\\"Look, Tool is nothing but snooze-core sludge rock. Their tuneless, repetitive music lulls you to sleep, and their lyrics really aren't anything to write home about. They play their instruments well but they can't write songs. If you want to hear something artsy and innovative, you're much much better off with Radiohead. At least Radiohead can write hooks.Music geeks and suicidal stoners might get a bang out of this depressing sludge, but anyone else should really steer clear. The most entertaining thing about this band by far is their videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different does not mean better!","review":"Tool is WAY overrated, and nothing is original here. Tool borrows techniques that many other bands have already done, and tries to come up with music that is supposed to fool the listener into thinking the stuff is original and groundbreaking! That would be O.K., IF the music stood on it's own. Nine Inch Nails did the same thing, and look at them now. Their '15 minutes' is over... way over. Tool will prove to follow the same pattern. Here today, gone and forgotten tomorrow. You can fool some of the people some of the time, but..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spine-tingling, Melodic, Poetic, and harsh. Great Album","review":"After Opiate and Undertow, TOOL released this Album in 1996. Tool is a different band to say the least, with poetic lyrics and many adult references, they are the kind of band some narrow minded poeple are offended by. After listening to many of the tracks, I came to the conclusion that this a fantastic album, with a spine-tingling metal ferocity that is unrivaled by any other band today, some songs start out slow but by the end turn into metal-filled barrages like Hooker W/a Penis, Jimmy, Eulogy, and Pushit. Maynard uses his voice more as an instrument then anything else, pushing the album to new hieghts. If you've never heard of TOOL, this is a great album to get started with. From its poetic lyrics to its harsh, eye-bulging metal expression this is one of the most original and deep albums I've ever heard. Give it a listen, and you shall be rewarded"},{"rating":"2","title":"TooL kicks major a**","review":"These guys are definitly one of a kind. With danny's intense drumming ,adam's cool guitar riffs,maynard's cool voice and his expressive lyrics, justin's kick a** bass fills, it makes this band hard to duplicate.I saw them in concert once and loved it.This is a band you shouldn't miss.Each album gets more creative and complex then the one before it.I don't know how these guys come up with their music as long as they keep doing it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"my god...","review":"Tool is one of the best bands of all time... buy this cd if you are ready for some original music that can stir your soul... i love it and couldnt live with out it.... buy it... now"},{"rating":"2","title":"An experience.","review":"It isn't that often when a CD is actually worthy of ranting and raving about, but this is one of those exceptions. Wonderfully raw and beautiful, each song building up to a climax, each song weaving messages that makes you think.."},{"rating":"2","title":"One song said it all","review":"Well, much like the one guy who hinted that an IQ would help in appreciating tool's music, I bought Aenema for one song, and that was \\"Forty Six and 2\\". After hearing that, I didn't think the rest of the CD could be any better. Imagine my surprise when I ran into \\"Eulogy\\". Anyway, fantastic album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A couple OK songs, but too artsy for me","review":"I bought this on the recommendation of a friend, and I wish I would have borrowed it from him first. I will admit, there are 2 or 3 good songs on here, but even those are too artsy and weird, and it isn't an organic weird, it sounds forced. I think, personally, that if you don't like at least 75% of a CD within the first couple of listens, it isn't worth it. I've listened to this about 100 times trying to let it grow on me, but I still think it is not that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on it's not THAT great.............","review":"There's GOT to be someone out there that doesn't like this band. Aenima has two good songs - Die Eire Von Satan and Stinkfist. The rest of it is average heavy radio grunge, nothing more. These guys are out to shock rather than musically impress. To me, if you've heard one of their songs, you've heard 'em all. It amazes me that people consider these guys \\"deep and emotionally moving\\". I find them fairly one dimensional; a band like Mr. Bungle outclasses these guys in originality AND depth by light years. It also amazes me that people call this band \\"metal\\". Every song from Undertow and Aenima is the same riff played in a different time signature. Then again, this is the nineties, the only decade that's musically WORSE than the eighties. With so much garbage out there, no one from this unadventurous generation is motivated to explore groups that crush this sorry band and no one wants to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent and way overrated","review":"This is probably one of the most overrated albums of modern times. Tool are not bad musicians but they tend to make a mess of albums - and this is their biggest mess of their career. Of the 15 tracks only 8 are songs while the rest is senseless filler segments sandwiched in between songs.Aenima actually starts well and the first songs show some progression from their debut. However the first filler starts on track 4 and here the album turns into an extremely difficult and frustrating experience. The other songs aren't as strong as you again struggle with more filler. Things pickup with \\"jimmy\\" and the title track before the entire album drowns in endless filler and noise.Had Tool stuck to the no-nonsence format of their debut we may have had a good album.Critics and fans will equate this to genious but these people are the first to be fooled by gimicks and concepts that often mask musical blandness."},{"rating":"2","title":"TooL's Best Album!","review":"Haters suck! TooL is one of the best bands that ever existed! If you one-starers think this album sucks, go buy a Limp Bizkit album to hear the REAL meaning of the word \\"horrible\\"! On to the album. It rocks!

This is all fact by the way. For fully developed brains only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool at their greatest...","review":"After just looking at the animated cover of nima, you get the feeling that you're in for something quite special. From the opening squeaks of \\"Stinkfist\\" to the screaming, pounding conclusion of \\"Third Eye,\\" you realize that you were correct. Tool hit something very unique with this album. Even the title is unique, a combination of the words 'anima' and 'enema'.Keep an open mind, and try to read between the lines, and you'll find this album integrates itself deeply into your brain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"if you want to know how good TOOL is, just get their albums. this review is commenting on some guy's statement that GODFLESH \\"stomps a muddy boot up TOOL's ass\\" or something like that. for those not in the know, GODFLESH uses drum machines. sorry, i will take danney carrey's superb drumming over a computer generated sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This cd is amazing.

At first I didn't really like them, after listening to Lateralus. Then I realized Aenima was just my speed. Sober is my fav Tool song but this is definitely their best work as an album. The thing about Tool is that they actually have something to say which is one of the main reasons why their music kicks ass!! By the way if you don't like Lateralus very much try this one. Its a heavier and more aggrivated Tool, which I will forever enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best cd Ever.","review":"Ive had this cd a Long time, from around when it first came out. There really isnt enough room on the page to describe how truly great this cd is. so i wont even start.

It heads the short list of albums I revere such as Black Sabbath's Paranoid and Down's NOLA. Even after a decade I still find myself probing the depths of it and admiring the craftsmanship of the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool at Best!","review":"What a great and refreshing new ideas we come along in this album. From Aenima to Hooker with a pennis, this album(like any other Tool album) provides with \\"unique\\" ways to say something so normal to all of us, our thoughts, our feelings...somewhere, somehow, somebody in the great plains at one time thought of making L.A. disappear. Thats why this band, satanist or not, are loved by so many fans, they write about common things. Undertow is a relative must if you get this album, for Sober being Tool's best song, but, if you ask me, all of their song are best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking.....","review":"When I first heard about Tool I saw the video for \\"Sober\\", disturbing, but I loved it! I knew nothing about the band, I even thought the lead singer was black! Well, times have changed and I got this album and my jaw dropped after listening to it. Though considered \\"metal\\" I couldn't stop listening to it. My conclusion? As my title says, breathtaking. I can listen to it all but my favorite songs are \\"Stinkfist\\", \\"H.\\" and \\"Aenema\\". When I first got on Amazon and looked the band up, I noticed all of their CD's had a perfect five stars, look up other \\"musicians\\" such as Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, the Backstreet Boys or anything on MTV, they don't have a perfect score at all. Why? Tool are just that damn good."},{"rating":"2","title":"the actually songs deserve 4.5 stars, but the filler shouldn't have been on here","review":"tool fans suck. they take everything i hate about prog AND pop and combine to make this uber-annoying person that i picture as a early 70's looking version of peter gabriel that shops at hot topic. imagine gabriel with that stupid reverse mohawk trying to convince you that KMFDM is actually a good band.i really wonder if all the people that gave this 5 stars actually listen to all of those annoying tracks that aren't songs every single time. i get it, but as they're completely seperate entities from the actual songs themselves they were made to be skipped. which i do. if i didn't have to skip them this would be 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal muscle in your face; in other words, TOOL rocks...","review":"Gripping, well blended lyrics, raw, in-your-face guitars, and a sound that more than epitomizes rock in the '90s, TOOL is the metal answer to the question, \\"is metal still alive today?\\" Hell, yes. AENIMA is a nightmare that rocks from start to finish. M.J. Keenan's voice drives in high gear with lavish melody,and backed by supernatural beats and otherworldly strings, this CD more than dislocates the jaw of modern rock. Labeled \\"the thinking man's metal band of the 90's\\" TOOL operates on an combustible mix of 150% rocket fuel and adrenaline!!! This album will scare you to death--you must own it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just incredible!","review":"So much insight. So much meaning. Only a select few can grasp the concept of what's inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone","review":"I would like to make the point that music is subjective. Not everyone will like Tool. Some will hate Tool. And some will love Tool. That's what makes music such a personal and intimate experience -- it's your individual interpretation of someone else's art.With that said, this rates as a 5-star album to me. I do not like what Tool the band stand for, but I *love* their music. Strange but true. For me, being able to push aside political agendas to listen to the music itself has always enabled me to appreciate and enjoy music that I otherwise would not have been exposed to."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums ever!","review":"I was about 8 when Aenima came out. I have it on tape. At 8 years old, I was more into grunge. But going through my old tapes, I found a couple albums by Tool that I just love. Aenima is amazing. A great follow-up to Undertow. I only wish I could've seen them live. Stinkfist is a great song that seems to be about an addictive sexual relationship. That's my interpretation, anyway. It's funny 'cause Maynard James Keenan has claimed that he's never had problems with vices/ addictions, but then how can he write so well about addictions? Eulogy is excellent. H. is excellent. Even the interludes are great. Aenema is definitely my favorite song off the album. The intensity and the rage in MJK's voice will give you goosebumps. Tool doesn't make the kind of music that you listen to. Tool makes the kind of music you listen to, you can visualize, and you can feel in your blood. They're in a genre all their own, and I will forever be a fan of theirs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Cd Ever","review":"Tool is my favorite band. I just started to listen to them in the last few years and i own all theyre cds. But the best one always will be Aenima unless they come out with a new cd then maybe there might be something better. NOthing can compare to Tools Aenima. The songs i think are the best are Third Eye, Jimmy and 40 6 and two. This Cd also has to be the funniest they came out with. the one i found the most heart stopping funny is Die Eier Von Satan. I thought it was some kinda evil thing when i first heard it but when i heard the translation I just started laughing. Well this is the best!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good but messed up","review":"I really like this album and consider it an inspired piece of work. The songs are intense and dramatic, and the musicianship is incredible. The lyrics are good. However, (and I know some people like this about Tool) the lyrics are pretty twisted and hateful. Don't listen to hard to the lyrics of the first track unless you've got a strong stomach. Regardless of that I love this album, I just keep thinking 'love not hate' when I listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anemia = the most rewarding album ive ever purchased","review":"*Change of oppinion* Sorry for offending some when i said Lateralus was better.

Wow! hooker with a penis, eulogy, stinkfist, H, forty six and two, aenima and Third Eye are all awesome!

Aenima is one of (if not THE) greatest albums ever made. \\"Eulogy\\" is deep and intelligent and \\"Jimmy\\" has complex lyrics that one would think about. \\"StinkFist\\" is among my favorite songs on the CD. \\"Hooker With a Penis\\" was the very first song I ever heard by TOOL, and still, I love it. \\"H\\" was a great track too. Yeah, I know that \\"Intermission\\" sounds like ICP, but I like ICP! This was deffinitely in the top 3 of my favorite tracks on the record. \\"Third Eye\\" was good, but come on! 13 minutes?!?! Needless to say, my definite favorite song on the album was \\"Aenima\\". This song is one reason you need to buy this album. Listen to it and you'll see why. The rest of them, are really good.

Bands who use their music to display the power and emotion they have in it.Don't get me wrong I'm not saying Tool is Floyd or that Tool is Zeppelin, but I'm saying elements are thereThis album is incredibly edgy.

From a fan of Rock and Tool's different sound, don't read or listen to the bad reviews, those people don't know what they are talking about. As for cruse words, who really cares. Deal with it!

I'm not saying the music's bad, but the songs just tend to DRONE ON AND ON without any sense of movement. Piece of advice guys: cut out about of minute of each song, and you've got yourselves a great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and brooding","review":"Perhaps my favorite band of all time is Meshuggah, a band whose musical ambitions resemble that of a nuclear holocaust. When i finally picked up this album expecting an experience similar to Meshuggah what I got was quite interesting. Obviously Tool lacks the insanely destructive style of Meshuggah but they are equals with them in how they present their music. Dark, vicious and sometimes repetative (as is Meshuggah, can't complain) they nonetheless are a highly enjoyable band. While I have yet to get Undertow this album so far is quite good, recommended to fans of both metal and alternitive as well as those who would like to see what a \\"calmer\\" version of Meshuggah might sound like"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"TOOL are the definitive modern band for rock musics capabilities.Never before or after this album had I heard more amazing and talented rock perfection untill Lateralus graced us in 2001.Tool seems to have no peak as each album peels back more layers and presents us all with even more fluidity and richness and talent in every movement.I have no tatoo's despite my love for music and if I was presented with the need to get one it would be the 4 letters of TOOL. Tool continue to help people open thier hearts and minds through thier precise and spiritual message to be real and live life fully one breath at a time, in a manner that rocks so amazingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a great album","review":"I've had this album since '96 and I didn't really get into it until I saw them live the following year. The album had to grow on me because I didn't understand what the band was trying to do with this album. This album will make you think, about the music its self and the lyrics. My favorite songs on the album are \\"46&2\\" which talks about evolving into the next step of existence and \\"Hooker with a Penis\\" which talks about \\"loyal\\" fans calling them sellouts because they've changed. Overall this is a great album.

So does this album. Now, I know that you loyal Tool fans will have me crucified if I don't give a reason for hating them. My basis? Their songs are boring and uninteresting. The only talent comes from their drummer. There is one good song and the rest are fillers. So Tool is indeed a disgrace to all things musical."},{"rating":"1","title":"(Really) Poor Man's Sonic Youth","review":"This is what Sonic Youth would sound like if they were: a) completely untalented), b) more concerned with time signatures and boring textures than with interesting compositions and c) obsessed with being metal's answer to both Uriah Heep and Blink-182. If you like hearing a useless piece of white noise that drones on for 14 minutes with no progressions and only a smattering of mumbled curse words in between, then \\"Aenima\\" is the album for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploratory music that vastly misses the mark","review":"Any music that you need a college degree to get through just ain't for me, Da Peace Dogg. I'm all about opening your horizonz and stuff, but dis album is just radiculous. Maybe if Tool did a \\"Behind Da Music\\" episode they might be more accepted and troo.Some of these songs span 10 minutes or longer!! What's up wit dat!! Plus, the guy singing seems to be on morphine or sumpthing, and I've never seen is face in videos or on TRL with my boy Carson Daley.

As an open minded individual with over 2,200 CD's from all genres, and a musician, I tried very hard to get into this CD, and after repeated listens, came to the conclusion that rock fans simply fall for anything these days! This disc is nothing but annoying disjointed grunts and blurbs amidst angst ridden chords that are very unstructured and boring. The vocals are also very weak and mediocre, with no range. If we were rating garage bands, perhaps I would have given them 3 stars, but given that many fans regard this as rock nirvana, I must conclude that they, and Tool are musically stunted bigtime!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IF THE VINYL IS COLORED, ITS NOT REAL!!","review":"According to the official TOOL website, these vinyl only came in black.

OK, my curiosity was finally peaked enough to go out and borrow this release, and listen to it 3 times. I guess it is a matter of personal taste, but I am with some of the previous reviewers who disliked it, even after a few listens. And I love hard rock and metal. Tool is a band that seems more concerned with creating sound effects with their instruments, as well as darker chord progressions. The end result is very dark and angry, but not musical nor groundbreaking in the least. If you really like good music, do NOT waste your money on this disc! It is indicative of how rock music has declined in quality over the decades."},{"rating":"1","title":"not exactly their best album","review":"very disappointed. Undertow is still my favorite.

I won't go into all the sophistication of it, that's been beaten to death.This is easily one of the top 5 CDs I own (of around 1000). If I didn't like it, I wouldn't have now bought it 6 separate times (due to being stolen, scratched badly, etc.) since it came out. It's everything a great rock CD should be. It's one of a few CDs (all of Tool's plus some others) that I can listen to all the way through. That usually takes awhile though, since I tend to listen to each song 4 or 5 times.Seriously, if you love great music and musicianship, get this. Otherwise, go get the new Buckcherry CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply outstanding!!!","review":"I will be short: this is quite simply one of the most beautiful albums ever made. It is outstanding in every respect!

I was hooked on this album for a good year straight. Aenima isn't anything sort of amazing and inspiring. In fact, most of Maynard's work has the same life-altering effect on me.Here's a band that made it into the mainstream but did not sacrifice any creative licenses on any song. Tool are as weird, funny, dynamic, and interesting as ever. Lateralus is a great follow-up to Aenima, but it doesn't quite reach the heights of this with so many excellent tracks like\\"H\\", \\"Eulogy\\", \\"Hooker with a Penis\\", \\"jimmy\\"... and the list goes on and on. Definitely pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock n Roll baby","review":"Tool is definitely different than ANY other band out there. Love this album for it's pure kick ass style. This is probably the hardest album from the band. I saw Tool live in Hawaii back in 2002 at relatively small venue.

Claire Dennis shows us a film with certain documental atmosphere, the terrible destiny that awaits for a French family owner of a coffee plantation, who is surrounded more and more until levels of struggling, the intoxicating opression of a political regime, that practices the common game of populism in order to create expectations around thousand and thousand people who expect to improve their horrid social condition.Dennis handles with firm hand this harrowing script, plenty of compelling stress and tragic finale, when you are not capable to perceive the light at the end of the tunnel.Isabelle Huppert (an artistic French patrimony) as always, shines with radiant splendor in this formidable and certainly not easy to watch movie.Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A poetic picture","review":"This film handily surpassed everything I saw this year--pure poetry in cinema. When a ragtag group of child soldiers emerges from the jungle brush to a melancholy jazz-like tune by Tindersticks, I could not help but think, These are the true Lost Boys. Shot for shot, Claire Denis' film blew me away with its composition. Rarely have I heard so much spoken in imagery alone.

At the beggining of the book a list of J. Serrin's papers is shown as well as an unique paper of him at the end of the book which is not enough to me by considering the title of the book.

Alternatively you could use one of the excellently detailed scene-by-scene summaries in books on Verdi (e.g Julian Budden or Charles Osborne)- as I do with similar performances of more obscure Verdi, like Alzira or I Due Foscari.- Too much applause?

Male/Female pronouns were wrong, names of characters were wrong- again, to the point of distraction and beyond.While the story (ies) were interesting enough, these mistakes made me feel as though someone had passed the task of digitizing the book onto their child in junior high school for extra money or something, and I found myself focusing more on that.

Definitely everyone of them deserves its own biography instead of an average 4.13 pages. So I had lowered my standard before I read it. Still I had been quite disappointed. All passages were columns published previously on IBD written by different reporters that not only the writing style but the focus on individual leaders fluctuated much between hard data/history and success formula, primarly on the former. I am sorry that I could gain little knowledge/insight (that I really wanted to learn \\"how\\" they succeeded) during the reading.

She includes many useful and meaningful meditations, working with Goddesses, as well as introductions to numerology and astrology. She also has information about herbs and color magick. I especially enjoyed her chapter called \\"Woman's Magic in Spirals and Cycles.\\" I liked how she articulated her belief about life and evolving consciousness moving and growing in a spiral fashion. She is a very good writer, and it was interesting to get a Brit's view of women's magic as a change from American writers' views. Her chapters are: woman's magic in sexuality, at home, in the garden, concerning special occassions, in spirals and cycles, concerning the goddess, and concerning the sisterhood. This book doesn't really go in depth about these important concepts, but it is definitely a terrific introduction. Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Informative...

Pike was the first one to use the phrase \\"engage\\". Only it didn't catch on because actor, Jeffrey Hunter was only in the first pilot.I hope to see more of Captain Pike with the new novel coming out next month from Pocket Books. I believe it's entitled \\"Burning Dreams\\" by Margaret Wander Bonnano.The chronicles of Pike's 10 year mission have a lot of unanswered questions.

And, I am a Cameron Diaz fan. The first mistake was casting a group of actors pushing thirty and have them try to act in a role with situations more accommodating a high school senior. My 20 year old daughter even thought they were trying to play a younger part, being older, and it didn't work. Secondly, the scenes are predictable and not very funny either. If you saw the previews for this movie on TV, then you saw the best parts. Thirdly, I really enjoyed American Pie (both), and this isn't even in the same galaxy, much less ballpark. It was difficult to finish watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only gave it 1 star because Amazon won't let me rate lower","review":"For years I thought Highlander 2 was the worst movie ever, but not anymore. This now rates as the worst movie I have ever seen. Watching the plot unfold was almost painful, as it seemed to make stops at as many stereotypes as they could cram in there. Maybe they didn't want to take the time to write real characters so they relied on exagerrations. You have the \\"Hey baby\\" guy at the club (who tries to get the girl into bed by leaving her alone on the dance floor at her showing the slightest hint of interest) you have the dirty old man at the golf course, you have the sleazy biker, the Something-About-Mary-ish gross out jokes (most of which are unfortunately not even remotely funny) I could go on and on. I'm not sure if the characters were supposed to be ditzy and shallow or if that was just a result of bad writing, either way I couldn't care less what happened to them, I just couldn't wait for the movie to finally end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid Dating Satire!","review":"Christina (Cameron Diaz), Courtney (Christina Applegate), and Jane (Selma Blair) have rules set up for dating that protect them from emotional distress if the one they are dating decides to dump them.

Christina and Courtney decide to take Jane out to party in order heal her broken heart. When Christina tries set Jane up with a stranger at the bar, it falls apart, since Christina seems to fall for the guy herself. The Sweetest Thing is a satire that attempts to make fun of those who play dating games, but it fails when the story vanishes and crude jokes become forced. At the end, the film does not function as a story and seems meaningless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbeleivable","review":"This movie was terrible.

There are plenty of jokes and gags follow that supposed to be hilarious and aren't. Granted, some movies are stupid but funny.

The three Hoties...Cameron Diaz, Selma Blair & Christina Applegate (as Christina, Courtney and Jane) really shine here pushing the envelope of romantic comedy. It's ribald but only implied, not truly offensive. Yes, it's a daring comedy but a breath of fresh air too. Mostly cliche until near the end when true, sobering feelings are expressed, Love almost triumphs...only Almost, as this is a spoof throughout, including the hilarious special features.

The story line is typical chick flick but it's boistered by the comedic talents of all three women who are in this film: Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate and Selma Blair. Casting these three lovely ladies in this film was a smart move. The handsome Jason Bateman's rising star is in here too!Like most people, I am really picky when it comes to comedies. I will see almost any sci-fi flick but when it comes to comedies, I'm about as picky as you get.I personally think Christina Applegate stole this film from Cameron Diaz. Why Christina Applegate is not in more movies, I will never know, she is down right h-i-l-a-r-i-o-u-s. The road trip and bathroom scenes are worth at least a passing viewing alone. Not to mention the church scene and the last scene of the movie.I love it when a movie can make me laugh this hard! Watch and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some giggles but mostly gags...","review":"I rented this movie when it first came out in 2002. I didn't like it. I just thought it was gross and quite frankly, a bit boring. My two best friends however think its the funniest movie, so they convinced me to watch it again because they thought I'd enjoy it now that I'm older. I did laugh a few times, but again, I just didn't care for it. Christina Applegate is really the only one who made me laugh. She's great. I'm not a Cameron Diaz fan at all. She just annoys me. And its not that I'm a prude either. I like American Pie and The Girl Next Door, ect., but I just can't get into this one. I think you either love it or hate it, and I hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst movie of the decade","review":"i could not believe how bad this movie was. the jokes are tasteless, that i can handle if they were actually in any way funny. they're not. the only cast members to display comedic talent in this film (parker posey and justin bateman) only have a couple of lines each. the film goes for shock value without wit or cleverness. this movie is a DOG. get orange county instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 hours that I'll never get back from my life","review":"Cameron Diaz is a very weird actress, because she can do good choices (like \\"gangs of new york\\" or \\"being John Malkovich\\") and then you see her in this idiotic so called movie!

Great casting. It was especially cool to see Jason Bateman, but it didn't deliver. I would recommend this if you like American Pie, you know, gross out humor with a heart, otherwise steer clear of this one. At the screening I went to everybody seemed to enjoy it, so I could be wrong. One more thing, Parker Posey was seriously underused here, and Diaz & Applegate had great chemistry. Couldn't save this movie though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful, awful","review":"I was looking forward to a fun piece of film, having enjoyed past works of Ms. Diaz. Was I ever disappointed! I could not believe that this film was penned by a female writer. And that she thought her screenplay was an accurate portrayal of women.

IM SERIOUS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something About Mary 2","review":"More .. Cameron Diaz dancing around in her underwear, and more old people talking about sex. This movie should have been titled \\"Something About Mary 2\\". A few of the jokes were funny, but most just made you groan. If you like gross-out slapstick like Something About Mary this is for you. If you like long set ups with punch lines that make you groan like Meet the Parents, this one's for you too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty Movie","review":"Nasty is the best way to describe this movie. I'm no prude by any stretch, but I was shocked at how raunchy and stupid this film was. Except for the dream sequence, the movie was like a decent romantic comedy when Thomas Jane (Mr. Right) was on the screen, which wasn't often enough. I first saw him as Mickey Mantle in the film 61*, and he is gorgeous and a great actor.Too bad this film had to go so far in the gutter."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!","review":"This is single-handedly one of the worst films I have ever seen!!!It is so bad, I can't even compute what else to say!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful","review":"I guess by now I though most people would be tired of the same old stupid plot encapsulated in a stupid comedy. This movie is a perfect example of how Hollywood can simply put out a piece of junk, tell the public it's good, and the public will buy into it. I haven't been this dissapointed in a movie in quite a while. No imagination, no real plot, just a bunch of low grade light porn moments. Having Cameron Diaz parade around in her bra and underwear just for the sake of all the guys with a crush on her is, unfortunately, enough to sell a movie. If you like stupid, unwhitty, grotesque humor, this one is for you, otherwise, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Grossest Thing","review":"This movie was a dreadful collection of vulgar sex jokes and scenes.

There was not even one good laugh in the entire movie. Diaz and Applegate seemed very shallow and the story had no appeal or common sense at all.If you want to see comedy, then watch \\"There's something about Mary\\", \\"Not another teen movie\\", or one of the Jim Carrey's movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the WORST!","review":"I can't believe the producers of this movie have the nerve to release this on DVD. We walked out of this disaster at the theater. This movie is definately NOT for anyone under 21. It's vile to say the least. Don't bother with this one...spend your hard earned money elsewhere. Amazon has lots of other great movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"A guy movie, only with girls in it","review":"As other reviewers have mentioned, this is definitely not the \\"chick flick\\" the previews made it out to be. Basically, if you're a guy who wants to see pretty, extremely thin women commit risque acts, this is your movie! See Selma Blair have sex with a guy in an elephant costume! Watch Cameron Diaz and Christina Applegate simulate oral sex while driving! Observe as Christina Applegate uses a urinal in a men's restroom. And so on. The movie is extremely raunchy and juvenile, but without the witty dialogue and distinctive performances of, say, \\"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,\\" or even \\"There's Something About Mary.\\" I give the movie two stars because it was entertaining, but the more I thought about it afterward the more annoyed with it I became. I would suggest you watch this on premium cable some rainy afternoon when nothing else is on, or rent it once it's no longer a new release and is therefore cheaper. That's what movies like this are good for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the worst movie of our time","review":"Awful, horrible, disgusting. This is simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

MAJOR DISSPOINTMENT!","review":"I knew this was a \\"silly movie\\" and certainly not an intellectual film, but \\"Dumb & Dumber\\" looks like an Academy Award winner next to this mess! This Stinks! PHEW! The sloppiness and unnecessary vulgar humor are embarrassing to watch and not worth the price of a rental. It's a shame really because all three of the actresses are fine, and with a decent script this could have at least been mediocre. I lost all respect for the movie, however, when the three women and others starting singing about something being \\"too big to put in here.\\" Wow, what a B-A-D M-O-V-I-E !!!! B-E-W-A-R-E !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny....for women","review":"I saw this film on tv one day and I thought it was decent.

I found that this is just a perfect vessel of human degradation, as it protrays the the female sex as sexually animalistic moral-free dirtbags, and the male race as soccer audience loving it! What's worse is that a supposed film star such as Diaz accepts a work of impunity like this one, and Selma Blair took it as a chance to expand her so-called career in 'acting'...getting wild and frisky in a bathroom cabinet with a man dressed as a bull dog. Please!Some porn channels broadcast better stuff for free, if you're that desperate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minus 8 at the least","review":"this was a really horrible movie.title should be \\"the brainless thing\\"Can be summed up as follows:shallow and one-dimensionalunfunnylacks subtletydisgusting toilet humora total waste of time and don't ever consider of buying it, waste of money too."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a girl thang!!!!","review":"To me, this film was hilarious. It's what women say when men aren't around. It's how we act when men aren't in the room. To me, I think it's not for men's eyes but what can you do?? Cameron and Christina paired together are the funniest people I've seen in a while and the movie makes it all worth while. So Ladies, if you're not going out tonight get invite your girls over and have a girls night. Get some popcorn and a beverage and enjoy the movie because it is funny. OH, remember it's a girl thang!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST MOVIE EVER!!!","review":"This is the WORST... movie Hollywood has ever produced.

You will spend most of your time pressing FFWD on the remote to end it as QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. Don't waste your time. Believe me, This DVD isn't even worth using as a drink coaster. A PIECE OF GARBAGE 100%."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Crudest Thing","review":"How did they every come up with a title like \\"The Sweetest Thing\\"? Another reveiw said PRUDES BEWARE! I am not a prude but I do not appreicate sick and perverted humor. I thought 40 Days and 40 Nights was bad. That was mild compared to this piece of [material] they had the nerve to call a movie. If this is all that Hollywood can churn out we, the viewing public are in big trouble! Churn is correct. That is what my stomach was doing through most of this so called movie. My husband and I sat at home and watched it this weekend. We kept looking at each other wondering when the comedy and romance was going to emerge in this swill. I ended up fast forwarding through the parts I could not bear to watch any more. At least I was not trapped in a movie theater where I could not fast forward and escape the huge chunks of this mess of a movie. Viewers beware! PU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to the end","review":"My fiancée & I watched this last night and both sat horrified at the stupidity of this Diaz vehicle. It tried to catch the essence of Something about Mary and never even came close.Left me with dismay over what women are really like and her embarrassed over the portrayal of females in relationships.Just dumb. It was that bad.Acting was poor, wasted some talented actors and ideas too. Plot was thin at best and never made you really care for any of the characters.The \\"dream sequences\\" and musical parts were horrible. Just when you thought it would end- more. Just bad. I had to leave the room.My fiancée apologized to me after it was over. It was just that bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't buy this version...","review":"This is a brief review. The movie clearlty polarizes people into the a total-waste-of-time camp and the unbelievably-funny camp. I am in the latter. Sophomoric, silly, incredible, and other words that combine into an hysterical film. So, there's probably a 50-50 chance you'll like it. HOWEVER, I picked up a cheap copy at Walmart: a mistake. I've learned. The R-rated version has deleted at least one extraordinarily funny scene. So if you want to really decide how good it is, get the unrated version."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it Zero Stars","review":"This movie was not funny, it was just crude and disgusting. These girls are good actors. I wish they would choose better material."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"One of the stupidest movies I have ever seen.

Now she refuses to speak to me!Actually, she's still speaking to me but refuses to forgive. This is the worst film I've ever seen. It makes Hudson Hawk look like Casablanca.Unlike Something about Mary, this film has no plot or redeeming qualities. The gags fall flat and feel contrived. Do youself a favor and skip this one.Or recommend it to someone you dislike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much sweet about this one","review":"It appears to me like they were trying to take advantage of the Sex in the City type of situational hype, but this one is a disaster from the start. The comic gags (falling during the wedding ceremony, getting blasted in the bathroom, etc.) just aren't very funny and I'll laugh at almost anything. When this was in the theatres I think 10 people saw it and if Cameron Diaz wasn't in it the number would have dropped to 3. No problem with the actresses, just give them something better to work with. If I want to watch Sex in the City I'll turn on the tv. Also, the unrated warnings all over this are odd since I didn't see anything in this one that would be unrated material. It looks like Cameron Diaz is using the same movie selection advisor as Gwenyth Paltrow. It's hard to believe that this looked good as a screenplay. Why would she choose to make a movie this bad?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sweetest Movie!!","review":"This comedy is an arobic workout, it so hilarious! Although, a little bit of sexual humor, this is still a great movie. The movie stars Chistina Aplegate and Cameron Diaz. The HBO sit-com type of humor, these girls play off each other so well.At times you wonder it is what you are hearing and seeing. There is NO nudity, but still enough for you to look twice. There is one scene where the girls are in the San Francisco restraunt and the start to sing about the...uh...wel.....an important part of male anattomy... I'll put it that way.If you get my drift. I had had tears running down my face. If want a girl road trip type of movie, then I strongly suggest this movie. It is well endowed in entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not another crappy chick flick...","review":"Not sure who this movie was for (guys, girls....?)

Words cannot adequately express just how depraved and disgusting this movie is."},{"rating":"1","title":"AKA -' The Raunchiest Thing' - Not for Everyone","review":"This movie is not for everyone. Although the actresses do well enough with the material, the material itself isn't so great in the first place. So, break it down:If you like three grown women acting as crass and raunchy as post adolescent boys in a frat house, then go see this movie.If you mistake disgusting musical numbers for humor, then go see this movie.(...)While some may feel this film contains vulgar humor, I found it contained no humor at all, and was just vulgar, period."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace to film","review":"I found this movie not only to be unbelievably degrading to women and men, but incredibly offensive. I'm sorry, but nobody wants to hear a man, let alone a woman talk about their genitalia and sex escapades constantly, as the characters do in this film. The plot is tired and repetitive, the script undeniably forced, and the jokes limited to fart and sex. The writers go to far in this film, and end up going backwards. The director and writer go all out in attempts to portray women in a different light, but succeed only in creating three, let's face it, unchaste (and that's in polite terms) morally corrupt women who try to act as men, but end up looking like desperate porn stars. One star, and I'm being generous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Chick Flick\\" that a Guy can like!!!","review":"Simply, this movie is worth buying. F-yeah!Miss Applegate, I STILL love you. ;^)"},{"rating":"1","title":"No audience connection","review":"I have no doubt that there is a story here, but the flow of this movie doesn't really want to let the story come out. The basic premise is two people find each other when they least expect it. In this comedy, the story is driven by one character's quest to find this love before it is too late. Hijinks ensue.What can go wrong with this? Comedy is largely driven by the seemingly unconnected episodes of our lives, but in this movie, the unconnected episodes just seem to distract. How does a song-and-dance number fit in? An unfortunate incident with the braces also seems out of place as it doesn't seem to drive the story at all. Selma Blair is a good actress, but her role in this film doesn't seem to mesh with the others.There are some funny moments, but they are few and far between. I would not recommend seeing this movie. The story doesn't connect with the audience at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is so bad it is just bad.","review":"This movie tries so hard to be outrageous and funny, it is just bad. I usually enjoy raunchy humor (ex.There's Something about Mary, American Pie) but this was just stupid. Occasionally it might make you smile a little and leads you to believe it may get better, but it never does. It just doesn't work and they try to throw in so many wild scenes that it just pulls you out of the movie. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because I did somewhat enjoy a couple of scenes and it had somewhat of a plot-although it did veer from it quite often. I would definately recommend not spending any money on this movie. If you want to see it borrow it from someone or check your cable stations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crude Imitation","review":"in which it is established that crude intentions alone do not a crude movie make. least not a good crude movie. it's possible that some of this looked good on paper but the translation is godawful. but then there's no hope for a musical interlude that begins with 'my body is the movie and your penis is the star'. the only possible audience for this travesty is the benighted pubescent who hasn't learned the difference between shadow and act and thus can revel in the imagined taboo subversion. else watch this only if you need your wince muscles tightened. will now return to the farrelly brothers with renewed appreciation."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just doesn't get worse than this.","review":"It really is a pity that there is no 0 star option. This movie is one of the most ill-conceived ventures to have graced (or disgraced) the screen. It's like one of those bad comedy routines where the comedian just won't get off the stage, but worse, because you can't throw eggs at your television. It's not just the script. It's not just the timing. It's not just the acting. It is an entirety that is worse than the sum of its parts, and, while I realize that I have presented little analysis in my criticism, I simply had to write a review. I could not stand by and let humanity suffer any more than necessary at the hands of one of the most worthless pieces of cinema ever known. I will grant it this, however. I am a reformed person after seeing it, because I am now convinced that I have glimpsed my own personal Hell, and it would be watching this movie over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good actors does not equal good movie","review":"I like Cameron Diaz. She's pretty funny, and she has been in a lot of movies that I like. Same with Selma Blair and Christina Applegate. Do not be misled. This is not a gender issue - it is an equal-opportunity flop.

I can say with some confidence that this did not further the career of anyone associated with this film. Whoever wrote the script, hopefully used a fake name. The laughs came so rarely, I forgot it was a comedy.

True, this movie lacks a deep plot or emotionally moving characters, but I didn't really expect that anyway. My girlfriends and I absolutly loved this movie and we pull it out when we want a good laugh or just some plain ol' girl toilet humor. Men beware!

While the trio of girl pals here are certainly fetching and shapely, their dialogue and shallow personalities definitely leave something to be desired.This movie left me cold, I don't think I laughed genuinely once.

This film takes three pretty good actresses, and has them re-do scenes that have already been done in American Pie 2, Porky's, and numerous other throwaway teen films. It is stupid, vapid, vacuous, and totally a tease on many levels. Howard Stern would probably say this is one of the great classics, because it promises the world, and delivers absolutely nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is 1 of the worst movies around!","review":"This movie was soooooo boring i was miss led by the title thinking i was going to get a good movie about three single girls but instead i got a got a movie that was terrible.

Can't figure out why such a talented actor would do this. I usually like Cameron Diaz too, but this was terrible. All I saw were 3 badly behaved women doing some very disgusting gestures and hung up on the male organ. Not a movie for a young audience. All the characters were shallow and I didn't like any of them even slightly. I didn't even like Thomas Jane's character if thats what you want to call it. If this writer really thinks this script is cutting edge for women's thoughts they don't know women very well. Any woman who acts and thinks like these characters is exactly that a character. This movie was so disgusting I can't even add it to my Thomas Jane video library.

Are they punk? Well, yes and no. With song titles like \\"Two Headed Sex Change\\" and \\"Bend Over, I'll Drive\\", what they are is a weird hybrid of punk, rockabilly and a dash of Screamin Jay Hawkins Voodoo and sexual inuendo. Their songs are often very funny. They can also be rude and vulgar, but not too much so. On \\"Look Mom, No Head\\" you get a good picture of the band led by lead singer Lux Interior, and female guitarist Poison Ivy. For me, \\"Dames, Booze, Chains and Boots\\" is worth the price of admission alone. Interior's vocal delivery is hysterical there. The Cramps are also a very tightly wound band. My introduction to them was a concert. They are really good musicians, whereas most of todays punk acts can't go beyond two or three chords.With all the much more serious music I listen to, it's nice to have such a guilty pleasure as The Cramps in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earplugs needed","review":"This is the noisiest microwave I have ever heard.

Reaching further and understanding the lyrics, it's clear that the group's message is about humanity.I'm relatively new to the hip-hop genre, and approach this music from a classical/jazz point of view. I find their production rhythmicly and auraly hypnotizing. Each group member blend their lyrics masterfully on each track.The Anthology is merely the tip of the iceburg of what ATCQ has to offer. I would make any newbies looking for real hip-hop to this listen to this album, then promptly make them get the rest of them.Musicality at this level will continue to live for years to come. Reaching the timeless plateau is certainly in reach, if it hasn't so already."},{"rating":"2","title":"The essential Rap album","review":"This is just great. But the album explains it all. It mainly is an anthology of TCQ's best songs. I probably would substitue one or two for two others but this still is da bomb!

I had heard of the Stonewall uprising but knew almost nothing of the details. Here through the eyes of a newcomer to the New York gay scene we see the horrors gays and transgendered were subjected to but also the strong sense of community that helped them survive the oppression. The film never resorts to caricature instead showing the gays and drag queens as very real persons all of whom I would be proud to call my friend. Give this film a chance even if you are not gay and especially if you are anti gay. It may just open your eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great version of the Stonewall story","review":"All accurate? Perhaps not, but a well told story. The actors do a great job in their roles and any liberties taken with history are either reverential or entertaining.

Let's see, the acting was next to terrible, the plot lacked anything dynamic, and for the most part it was just boring. It did have it's good points though (the most important one being that it eventually ended). There were some nice butt shots, unfortunately they weren't of very nice butts. There were some ok drag numbers.

He went to work on horseback, slept on the ground and got up and cooked his breakfast over a campfire.If there was one riot, you got one ranger, Mr Jackson, and he took care of business.New guys finally crept into the Rangers with new technology and laptops that he did not always understand and moved him to the side.However nobody could ever doubt his honesty, intensity, loyalty and ability to get things done his way.The next time I go thru Alpine I am taking my book to his office so I can get him to sign it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get to know a Texas Ranger!","review":"If you love Texas History and the Rangers, you will not want this book to end.

The heart of the Mechanics is the songs and the two great vocalists. Paul Carrack is a good singer but the songs here are weak. Only 8 real songs as one is an instrumental and there is nothing very catchy that stands out. Also very little guitar on this record. It sounds like an experimental recording and not a very good one. A sad way for Carrack to bow out but the new \\"Road\\" CD brings them back to a more traditional sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Glad to Have \\"Mike&\\" Back!","review":"Mike's music is innovative and his vocal sound is unique.

My favorite cut is \\"Fallen\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I wonder if these reviewers listened to the same CD as I. If you are a Genesis fan, you will probably not like this. Why? It's a very much sell out record, trying to appeal to radio and the 18-24 crowd. It's full of pointless urban sounds, tape loops and other nonsense that add nothing musical whatsover. The lyrics are particularly week, no Living Years here. There's no acoustic breath on this CD, no interesting musical selections, by far the worst CD Mike has ever been associated with. Go back to the basic's, his first, Small Creeps Day. But don't reward an artist, no matter how formerly great, with a album full of noise, little melody, and not an ounce of heart. Let me put it this way, Phil Collins Disney stuff is better. Okay, that should pretty much do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...]","review":"How could you not watch a movie with a cover like that!

The man-child proceeds to tear her dress off and put it on. He then goes on a murderous rampage, going by the name mangina. He kills, he mutilates, he eats their privates on a gory rampage.

For me it's a good size (not too large) and it looks a quality watch. One very minor critisism and that is that the Manufacturer's name is engraved on the side of the watch.

As is noted in several other reviews, this watch regularly stops running, sometimes losing a couple of hours, sometimes losing just minutes a day. One never knows even the approximate time. I've only had the watch a week and already replaced the battery hoping that was the problem. No luck. Were I to return the watch for warrantee service there is a large charge and 6-8 weeks of turn-around time. Clearly its not worth it and this one will just go in the trash. I should have paid attention to the negative reviews before I bought this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely pathetic","review":"This watch could be perfect, except they sent me a defective watch that was clearly returned by another customer.

I returned the watch, what terrible service."},{"rating":"1","title":"warranty useless","review":"Very disappointed!

This watch arrives with the 8932 number on the attached tag, but on the back of the case it clearly says 8932A. Why? Who knows? This watch was purchased specifically due to its claim that it is water resistant, it clearly states in all advertisements that it has a screw down crown. It does not have a screw down crown.If you look around and read through the reviews you will see again and again, people who actually have the watch realize it does not have a screw down crown.This means if water is splashed near the crown, it can go right into the watch body.Do not purchase this watch if you intend to ever get water near it. It is not a diver watch by any stretch of the imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch lasted 6 weeks","review":"Avoid this watch. I took a chance and bought this invicta \\"dive watch\\" because it was $20 cheaper than a similar victorinox watch.Now I see where that 20 bucks went.The first time I ever got the thing wet, not diving but swimming in a pool, it had water fogging up under the glass that never came out. Looked terrible. Then a couple weeks later the thing just died outright. A very poor quality, short lived timepiece whose manufacturer outright lies about its product. \\"dive watch\\", what a joke. Keep this POS away from water at all costs if you want it to last more than a week.I wouldn't buy another invicta watch.

Was it because the sweep hand would stick at the 25 min mark? I don't know. I'm sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth $30 dollars, let alone $65","review":"So, for $65 I don't expect a top of the line watch but I would feel I paid too much if I paid half.The bezel is difficult to turn, feels loose at times, and is very cheap. The \\"magnifying\\" spot on the face over the date looks and feels like a glued on piece of plastic which doesn't even magnify the date. The band itself feels cheap and rattles and squeaks while wearing it. The face also seems smaller than the description and images depict, though I can't find my ruler to measure.This watch also wouldn't function as a diver watch because, unlike another review commented, it does NOT have a screw down crown.Ultimately, if you want a watch which looks like a knock off Rolex Aquamarine from 30 yards this might suffice, but I am disappointed with this purchase and am going to be returning it. One of the more expensive Invicta watches might work better but I don't even feel like this watch would be functional in my day to day life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked it at first, but...","review":"Received this watch as a Christmas present last year. Up till last week, it was fine and I had no problems. The watch stopped working (I assumed a dead battery), and I called the company to request warranty service. They will cover any repairs to the watch, but there is a $28 shipping fee on top of my cost for shipping it to Invicta. Now, this was a $58 watch with S&H. The $28 charge for shipping back after warranty repairs seems a bit ridiculous to me. I actually really liked the watch, but will probably get some other brand rather than have it repaired. I will re-post if I send it back regarding the actual warranty service."},{"rating":"1","title":"A watch not for me.","review":"The watch is smaller than specs. and is like a woman with bad reputation...............I return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Repair","review":"On receiving this Invicta #8932 product, I immediately tried to set the date. It was impossible to set the day of the week. The stem did not reach the position to change the day of the week. I guess all Invicta watches need immediate repair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the watch","review":"I bought this watch for myself as a replacement for Model 5107 which I broke the stem on. This watch has a smaller face which I didn't like. I bought myself another very similar one with a larger face and gave this one to my dad. He loves it! Win-win!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My husband loves it!","review":"Originally, I ordered an Invicta watch and didn't even think to look at the size of the case. When it came, my husband said it was just too big to be comfortable. I know that younger guys like big watches, but my husband wanted a \\"normal-sized\\" watch. I exchanged it (free exchange, thanks!) for this style, and he LOVES it. He says it's the most comfortable watch he's ever worn. It really is a great looking watch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flaw design or manufacturing process","review":"It is a fairly good looking watch, the bezel feels a bit cheap but then again it is not an expensive watch. Upon arrival it would not work fine with the crown screwed all the way in, I had to wear it half way through so I would not become slow. This is obviously not any good, although after about a month's use I was able to screw the crown all the way in and it performed well. I replaced it with a Wenger Men's 72326 Battalion III Diver and do not regret it at all, in fact the Wenger became my everyday watch.I attempted to use the Invicta after about a month of no use and it was not running, I had to unscrew the crown for it to start working again. I suspect it has a design flaw which makes the mechanism stop when the crown is screwed all the way in. No more Invicta watches for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Metal Needs Better Finishing","review":"The watch looks great. It mimics the classic Rolex Submariner design and is very inexpensive. When I wear it on my wrist, I can feel that some of the edges on the case back, lugs and bracelet poke my skin especially when it slides slightly up and down my wrist. Next time, I'll spend a little more to get a watch that's more comfortable and go for a more established brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bang For My Buck","review":"This is hands down the best purchase I have made on amazon. I would have paid 4 times as much for this watch, I replaced my rolex submariner with this one, I bought several others as Christmas gifts for family members, Invicta makes amazing watches it keeps perfect time, the only negative thing I can even think to say is that the stainless steel band feels a little flimsy they should have made it out of solid stainless, but lets keep in mind this is a 50 dollar watch here people."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than I expected","review":"I have had this watch now for about a month and it has definitely exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting the quality to be as high as it is - the band alone is probably worth $25.00.I was very surprised that the dials stay readable(not bright)all night long. I have had more expensive watches that wouldn't do that. Also the date magnifier is really nice.I am very pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Invicta Diver Range","review":"My 8932 @ Approx $48 is at this stage ( 21 days) really somethingand I have no reason to believe that it will not remain as such.Finish and quality is superb and equal to my Cat and Seiko watches."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE WATCH","review":"VERY NICE WATCH,SO FAR IT LOOKS,FEEL,WEARS GOOD.VERY NICE WATCH FOR MONEY.I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BIGGER.i BOUGHT IT ON SALE FOR FIFTYFIVE BUCKS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invicta watches","review":"I ordered three Invicta Watches last Christmas, and everyone ofthe bands have broken. The watch itself has done all right, but the bands are really cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaking watch pins! Not a screw-down crown. Reasonable value.","review":"I bought this as a cheap alternative for daily wearing, to avoid any damage on my far finer Tag diver watch. The watch looks and wears well, but it's noticeably less solid feeling than my tag. For $60, I think it's a great value. The only real problem is that the item description says \\"screw down\\"; it's actually push down, without any real screwing involved.--UPDATE--The watch band broke about 5 months after I purchased it. It was $10 to fix. You get what you pay for. Changed review from 4 stars to 3.--UDATE--The watch band broke again in the same place, right where the chain attaches to the main watch body. Marked it down to 2 stars. This may be happening because of my lifting at the gym, but it never happened with my Tag Heur so I think that it's a design flaw of some kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful watch - but quality control is a bet","review":"I got one of the failures; the screw crown wouldn't tighten, and the second hand wasn't aligned to the hash marks. Since I didn't use it I can speak to the accuracy, but just out of the box it's gorgeous and a nearly perfect dive watch (thanks for the design Rolex). At the price, if you get a keeper you made a heck of a deal, but you're taking your chances. I still gave it two stars, if you get one that works right you'll give it six."},{"rating":"1","title":"invicta watch","review":"I think the product is worthless. Too much image for a very bad quality product. On my 7th day using it, I accidentally dropped it from no more than 2 feet high, and it stopped working. I took it to a jeweler, and he said the \\"machine\\" was broken and it had to be changeg, more costly than what the watch cost me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice, doesn't work as well","review":"I had this watch for two years. It certainly looks very nice, it was often mistaken for a Rolex when I wore it. It wasn't without its problems though, the time was never accurate, I had to reset the watch every week because the minute hand would run a little faster than it should. The key issue with this watch was that it wasn't durable for me. I never abused it or wore it while active, I restricted wearing it for business or outings. One day it just broke while I was in an important meeting, much to my embarrassment. I was sitting there and the clasp just came undone, without it having been hit or physically struck.For the price, it's not all that bad, but even for this low price point, I think you can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't loose the crown","review":"I bought an Invicta 8932 and nobody could loose the crown! That was so firmly attached to the body of the watch that I have to use pliers to switch the crown to be able to pull it and adjust the date and time. But it works fine. I gave 1 star but the clock deserves 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st piece died and second piece has slow movement.","review":"My first piece just stopped and without a warranty it was a goner. This second piece from Amazon was okay for 10 months until it slowed down. I replaced the battery but after a week, it again slowed down. I bought the batteries the same time as the watch. It should have lasted longer. I am ordering newer batteries before I send it for my 5 year warranty repair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it","review":"It's a fantastic watch. Surprised at quality.

As far as I know, there is nothing he dislikes about the watch. He did have to have several watch band links removed because he has a small wrist, but it is normal for him to do so and we expect that anyway.Hubby did have to read the manual to figure out how to set the day/date, but it wasn't too difficult.This was my first Invicta watch purchase and was great!! Because of this watch, I have now added many Invicta watches in My Wish List for hubby down the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I ordered this watch as a gift for my son who was graduating from the police department who wanted the Invicta watch.

The first purchased in 2007 and worn constantly survived at least 150+ Ocean dives, as well as cutting and splitting firewood, but sadly passed in an accident in the woodshop - - it saved my wrist from what could have been a very nasty cut.

It was bought two months in advance so it could no longer be returned to Amazon. (Nice policy by the way, we will never be buying ahead again.) It worked while in the box. The minute it was placed on my wrist to actually wear it it stopped. It would restart again and run but it basically does what other reviewers have said. It stops at times and just keeps lousy time.I bought a junk watch from ebay from China for $4.95 including shipping and it hasn't missed a beat.

After less than 18 months use, this watch looses hours and is no longer reliable.

The Invicta watch cost $10 more but feels like hundreds more. The watch fills my need for stainless diver look. It has a good feel and looks like a quality piece.The ratcheting ring is slippery, not particularly functional. Looks shiny and polished- in contrast to other diver watches with brushed finishes this one stands out. Band has row of polished links- has a bit of bling-ness to it.I am very hard on my watches, this one has survived several drops to hard floors. These usually finish off watches that are not engineered well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Rolex by cost but just as nice!","review":"I had always wanted a Rolex diver's watch but at $4,000 to $5,000 it would be hopelessly out of my price range. The Invicta looks \\"close enough\\" although not as beefy as the Rolex. I'm amazed at it's accuracy for such an inexpensive watch. It feels great and looks great. I only wished they used Tritium or something similar on the hands and face so it would glow longer. It's always a plus when you can see the time in the dark. I don't intend to scuba dive with it but I'm not worried if I take it snorkeling. In short, the watch is a bargain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunning.......but not reliable","review":"This is a beautiful watch.....well designed exterior, polished stainless steel, just a great look. That is where the praise ends for me. After about a week, the watch lost about 35 minutes of time overnight. I was really bummed because I really wanted this watch to work out. It is just very attractive. If you are on the fence like I was after reading the reviews, I would choose something else. It has some kind of design flaw with the quartz \\"motor\\". I ended up returning the one I ordered. I won't be ordering anything from Invicta again. Amazon should really consider NOT selling this watch with all of the problems others have had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a diver's watch!","review":"Crown does not screw down so contrary to Invicta' claims this is not a diver's watch.Amazon's return policy is brilliant and there was no argument about replacing the watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch the size","review":"Be very aware that this is a 39mm watch. It is for the smaller wristed man.The watch is exactly as described, but the subtle size difference can be easily overlooked. I wear the 43mm watch in the pro diver and it is for the larger wrist. I bought this for a friend who had commented on how much he liked mine and I missed the size difference. Fortunately, he is 5'5\\" and has a smaller wrist so it all worked out. A standard submariner is 40mm so this one is a bit smaller. Still for the price it is a great little watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value!!

We'll see...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor excuse for a watch & poor service","review":"The watch stopped within the first 30 days and I should have returned it but since it started up again I kept it. It stopped frequently and the last time it stopped I could not reset the time because the stem had fallen out - sent it in for service and Invicta wanted $126 + postage to repair. I told them to keep the watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small!","review":"This is one of several Invictas I've purchased, and I've been pretty impressed. However, this model is so small that it hardly qualifies as a men's watch--and I'm a fairly short guy. I've seen watches this size advertised as ladies' models.The second problem with this watch is the clasp. It almost takes a pair of pliers to loosen the safety clasp. While it's nice to have a tight fit, when you can't take the watch off, it's a problem.Timekeeping is fine, and I still recommend Invicta watches to others. But unless you're a really small guy, this watch is simply too small for wearing. (You could, however, give it to your wife or girlfriend;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price and quality","review":"The watch looks nice and have a reasonable price. The watch container is a yellow box that should not be so big in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"I got mine for around $40. This Pro Diver watch from invicta looks and feels great and in some respects is more substantial than the $5k watch it's styled after. The band is quite heavy and yet comfortable with solid stainless steel links. I am totally satisfied at this price level, and would venture to say that it is worth about 10 times what I paid and would still be a bargain. I should mention that the band was quite long when I got it and I needed to remove a couple links to get a perfect fit. This is normal with any watch with removable links. You have to know what you're doing, however, or pay $10 for a watch store to do this for you. The rotating bezel is perfectly aligned and has a good feel to it. Overall, fabulous product and I would highly recommend this watch to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value!!","review":"I am really happy with the quality of this product. Very nice looking.

I first noticed that the bezel is very difficult to turn. I thought if I kept working it, it would loosen up. It hasn't so far. Next I noticed that the time keeps stopping periodically. I know it's a quartz, but even early on I expected the watch to keep running in the beginning. Then I look at the warranty card. I admit this is the first time I've had to, and I notice that Invicta wants a $25 check for return shipping. They send me a defective watch and they want money to essentially fix it. I don't think so.....I'm used to very quality from Invicta, so I am very disappointed in this watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Product.

I had another Invicta previously which was very nice, waterproof, heavier bracelet, etc. That's what I thought I was buying with the 8932 model. Unfortunately it is not as heavy and the face is slightly smaller. My fault for not truly measuring. The actual one I found at SAM's Club for $109. I highly recommend it and made the purchase for myself (as backup).

Covering their favorite subjects like S&M, cheesy horror and sci-fi flicks and the drug excesses typical of 80's hair bands, the Cramps have created a ravenous cult following that rivals that of the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Lead singer Lux Interior is funny, witty, explicit and makes fun of Elvis Presley. \\"Stay Sick!\\" includes the fun of \\"Bikini Girls with Machine Guns.\\" My personal favorite is \\"Creature of the Black Leather Lagoon,\\" which pays homage to the monster and perfectly blends camp with vamp.

These are middle aged people, embarassing themselves and purposefully writing dirty songs. At least Poison Ivy can see that she is an exerienced retro guitar player but Lux Interior, he looks silly by now!\\"Gravest Hits\\" was cool, different and excitingly gutteral, \\"Songs our Lord Taught Us\\" was a more complete musical work, \\"Psycho Jungle\\" peaked this form of music and then it was all down hill from there.All bands, especially punk ones, when they stayed together they became proffecient song writers and instrumentalists, except for the CrampsTheir best, most original stuff was from their beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honorable Mention","review":"Excerpts from Ghostwriting by Andrew Crofts was quoted many, many times in the novel The Ghost: A Novel (HARDCOVER) by Robert Harris.

The UV Haze had a worn case, when opened was mis-repacked with the instruction manual between the filter and the packing foam protector. The manual was well worn and obviously USED a lot. And of course the UV Haze filter was SCRATCHED. This is a glass filter with no coatings so it takes a real good ding to scratch it with a nice deep 1/4 inch scratch.I could spend $5-$10 to return it for an exchange, and maybe I will not get a damaged one again, and maybe I will. I question any company that re-stocks an obviously damaged and very worn item.

The force of \\"Intolerance\\", \\"Prison Sex\\" and \\"Sober\\" at the start of the album set the stage for the rest of it. Engaging, angry, intelligent and exploratory this established Tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Heavy Metal","review":"It's too bad Undertow, one of Tool's best albums, is really best known for \\"Sober\\", one of it's worst songs, shrewdly made to be a hit single just to attract people to the real music. But hey, if it works, good. On this album, Tool is far from \\"Lateralus\\" territory. There are no fillers here, just great songs with great lyrics by Maynard. \\"Prison Sex\\" is chilling. You Look So Precious. Bottom is a great song that has a great part with Rollins in the middle. The title track, 4 degrees, and flood are all great too, but perhaps the best thing here is Disgustipated, not exactly a song, but is far from \\"rambling or pointless\\". It is probably not fashionable for a heavy metal band to make a song about this subject but they did and they did it good. This CD is better than most things you will find coming out today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this.","review":"I love Maynard anyway. So, no matter if it's Tool or A Perfect Circle, I'm pretty much sold. I do like Undertow. However, 10,000 Days is my ultimate favorite Tool CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd gets better after the third song","review":"When I first put Undertow on, I said \\"oh NO!\\" and I really wanted to turn the radio off. I am glad I didnt because from \\"sober\\" until the end, \\"undertow\\", rocks. You can feel the anger, and emotion in \\"Undertow\\". This Cd will move you, unless of course, youre dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"More straightforward than their newer albums","review":"Undertow is more straightforward than nima or Lateralus. There's no guessing where one song ends and the next begins; there are no quirky little interludes. Each song stands firmly on its own. While Tool has never been much for the \\"A-B-C-A-B\\" sort of song structure, Undertow is definitely more conventional than their newer albums. The whole album is very powerful, dark, and meticulously produced. You get the feeling that every single note on the album couldn't be any other way. Perfection was an obvious goal here, whereas their newer albums feel more improvised and intentionally thick. Even though each song is musically/structurally diverse, the overall range of emotion is minimal compared to nima or Lateralus.The songs from Undertow and Opiate were largely written in the same timeframe. They specifically picked their heavier songs to be on Opiate, reserving the more dynamic and creative songs for Undertow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tool Album!","review":"This is a really good Tool album the first one I bought really. I personaly like this better then Aneima. I dont however think this is Tools best album that prize goes to Laterulus. This album has some really good songs such as the hits \\"Prison Sex\\" and \\"Sober\\" but the deep cuts are great as well like \\"Intolerance\\" \\"Bottom\\" \\"Crawl Away\\" \\"Swamp Song\\" and \\"Undertow\\". You see the first seven songs are the best the last three are just alright, but their still not bad. Adam Jones plays some of his best guitar on this album, and Maynerd James Kennon sounds awsome like usuall! The Drummer is great as well. Dont be fooled, this is way better then Aneima so pick it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD!!","review":"This is one of my favorite Tool cds.The vocals (like always) were absolutely awesome on this disc.Maynard knows just how to blend his awesome melodic singing with his unique screams to make a very good vocalist.The music is as great as Tool's music always is.They really know how to do what they do.My advise:GO OUT AND GET IT!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"This is probably the darkest Tool album in their catalog. To me, Maynard's vocals on this album sound like he's suffering instead of moving with the music, and this compliments the emotion of the music perfectly. Songs like Prison Sex, Disgustipated and the \\"hit\\" Sober are all about emotion and sadness. This is the album that got me into Tool, which are my favorite band of all time. I guess I could thank the idiot that broke my heart and got me to hear Sober a billion times."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent album that delivers on every promise","review":"This sophomore effort is a genuine article of precision from a band who defines it. The absolute masters of the \\"new\\" class of metal rip through you at a torrid pace. Songs like \\"sober\\" explore the question of psychic sanity and singer and lyricist maynard james keenan is purely genius in his eloquence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"There is nothing to complain about on this album. It's very artistic and very active. They usually sing about religious hypocrisy. Tool has a very positive message and tells you to question authority and don't be a follower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool is exceptional","review":"I absolutely love Tool. And Undertow is probably the reason why. Every song kicks butt. No track is boring or gets nerve-racking. The bass is awesome and Keenan's voice is I have to say, beautiful. Tracks such as Swamp Song and Flood have great rythm that some other bands just aren't capable of. This is definitely a great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is definately the best band yet!!!!!","review":"This is a got to have cd, it's packed with awsome lyrics and a good vocalist to back it up, what really gets me to like tool is the \\"fact\\" that the band never gets old, the cd's seem to change every time you listen to them they are so packed with mind boggling lyrics and head rushing guitar riffs that you hear something new every time you hit play, so i recommend that you buy this cd and the other two (opiate,and nima)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool's Worst Album And Still Pretty Good","review":"I know a lot of my fellow Tool fans disagree with me with this, but I tink Undertow is Tool's worst album (not including their EP, which was not that great), in fact, if you ask me Tool has consistently gotten better (Lateralus, the most recent, is the best). None the less this is a good album, although the singles, \\"Sober\\" and \\"Prison Sex\\" are probably the best songs on the album. I like the title track a lot too. This album is definitly worth buying if you are a Tool fan or a fan of this kind of music, but I will say that Tools other two full lengths are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent music","review":"Maynard's lyrics are really complicated, i think you can find different meanings according to your moment, but it's great to have music like this.Great guitar and bass in all the songs.Favorite tracks: Swamp song and prison sex.These guys really care about their job, they are giving us talent not faces (hello! pop artists)they don't put faces in their videos instead they release very strange, artistic videos with amazing music.You need to be smart to enjoy TOOL, so if you don't like it, take a guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"WoW!!!","review":"This Cd is fantastic! It is one of the best rock albums of all time by one of the best Rock groups, Tool. Of course without Maynard james Keenan, Tool would be good, but he takes them that step further above the rest. The lyrics are both haunting and overwhelming, and the way in which MJK sings them adds to the whole picture. The guitars have a very gritty atmosphere about them which helps the whole grunge prospect from Tool. Undertow, is, like any Tool fan should know, completely unique, as is all other Tool albums. Never expect a similar album from Tool.Undertow is possibly the most aggresive, although Opiate has the most aggressive lyrics, but in Undertow Tool have advanced. Aenima has much more depth and layering, but Undertow is just great hard rocking stuff!Nice One Tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best Tool CD","review":"but this CD is still awesome. Although there is a bit of filler, a lot of the songs are filled with meaning. It's also the DARKEST Tool CD yet. The best song on this CD is \\"Disgustipated\\", but other quality songs are \\"Intolerance\\", \\"Prison Sex\\", and \\"Sober\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"ORIGINAL AND UNDUPLICABLE AND VERY REAL.","review":"HAVE LISTENED TO TOOL SINCE THE GIRL THAT TURNED ME ON TO THEM IN 1993.

DOORS RULE THOUGH."},{"rating":"2","title":"more, more, more, awesome","review":"tool strikes a chord that I have never felt before. All No comparison with anyone. I'ma drummer too but tool gives anew meaning to raw rhythm. Gotto hear more like a fix for ajunkie. Simply, they strike achord that to be there for a jam would be euphoric if not orgasmic. I am female if ???.How about it guys can you come out to play??!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"Undertow is, overall, a good album. Although I'm probably in the minority on this one, I think \\"Bottom\\" and \\"4\\" stand out on this album, followed up by \\"Sober\\" and \\"Prison Sex\\". \\"Bottom\\" and \\"4\\" were the songs that most indicated the direction the band was going, and though they don't have memorable choruses or riffs like \\"Sober\\" and \\"Prison Sex\\" do, they are still more memorable songs overall.So yeah, buy this CD if you're a fan of good music, but if you're on a limited budget, buy \\"nima\\" first, then System Of A Down's self-titled CD, then Radiohead's \\"Kid A\\", and then Undertow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly powerful lyrical genius","review":"This band has forever changed my perception of powerful, emotional music. Each song is driven by some dark event and really brings out the edge in this band. From \\"Intolerance\\" to \\"Disgustipated\\" is the epitome of aural addiction. My life would not be complete without this album. The song 4 Degrees must certainly be the highlight for me BUT all the songs are masterpieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overall","review":"First tool disc; good recording quality and some interesting tunes.

Yes, millions can be wrong including pedroza, daniel aka pebozo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Overrated","review":"After reading the majority of the previous reviews i thought I'd give tool a try.....big mistake. The music is repetative and monotonous and the singer just annoys me with his shocking lyrics. There is no meaning behind the lyrics just poor music. I've studied music for the majority of my life and I know what talent is and this band seriously lacks it. I Don't see how anyone can be a \\"fan\\" of this band, they obviously have no respect for music. Listen to \\"Atomship - The Crash Of 47\\" if you want talent in this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Undertow\\" is an ESSENTIAL part of any rock library!","review":"At 38 years old, I suppose most Tool fans would consider me a bit long in the tooth to appreciate their music. After hearing their songs on our local rock station (KSJO-FM, San Jose, YEAH!) they really grew on me to the point where I just had to have their catalog! \\"Undertow\\" is unquestionably my favorite so far (waiting with baited breath for the new one to come out next week...). Even after MONTHS of listening to it almost every morning during my workout (my gym music rotation has been Undertow/Aenima/Mer de Noms for the past 8 months) I have not gotten the least bit bored - it's an extremely motivating CD to listen to while doing hard cardio.I never tire of listening to Maynard's vocals - surely he is one of the most vocally gifted artists recording today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undertow is Awsome, but get the real one.","review":"Undertow is one of the Greatest albums ever.

Maybe because i heard the magnificent Lateralus before i heard this one. Now when people criticise Tool for songs sounding the same i'll know why. It's because of this album. The songs on this album are generally strong but thier is a real samey feeling about every one. The guitar's are in the same key in every song and they drag on for 6 minutes. Every song has the same angsty mood. I suggest you get Sober off the net and spend your money on Aenima or Lateralus rather than this mundane affair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh... it's...kinda okay...","review":"I just don't understand the appeal of this album. When this debuted, I picked it up on a whim, and hated it immensely, causing me to ignore Tool entirely for the next howevermany years. After finally listening to the excellent Aenima and Lateralus, returning to this actually removes the bias I once had, but that doesn't mean this is any good. Almost totally devoid of their later prog sound, I get bored almost instantly with their 'crash and yell' style of alt rock/metal. Somehow, I sat through this whole mess long enough to pick out a few sunspots. The drumming is decent, not on par with their newer sound, and the song Prison Sex, however obvious, isn't too bad of a song. Otherwise, the spoken portion of Bottom is incredibly stupid, and the meandering Disgustipated makes me want to tear my hair out in blood soaked clumps. I can't believe the praise this album recieves when Tool's future was so much brighter. Even Opiate was slightly better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art Punk","review":"I miss this sound. These were the scariest punk rockers around at the time. Maynerd Keenan meant every word of what he said, and the lyrics are still more visceral than most anything you'll hear on the radio today.

Undertow is Tool at their peak and when they were 100% passionate about what they were doing. This album is incredible and 10,000 is terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Undertow Has Me...","review":"Heavy and thick, Tool's Undertow made a fan out of me. Actually, the first Tool album I bought was AEnima (also excellent), but the first Tool song I heard was Sober (off of this album). Interesting video for that song. Anyway, Metal heads and Progressive Rock fans everywhere should give Tool a try, and Undertow is a very good place to start. I also have AEnima, Lateralus, and 10,000 Days as well. Many say that Tool went downhill with their newest offering 10,000 Days, but I'd say that it really isn't that bad. It may not beat the juggernauts Undertow, AEnima, and Lateralus, but it is worth a listen or five. Long live Tool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Best Tool CD","review":"This CD is way better than Aenima however it still lacks what Lateralus has. This CD is creative, and if you buy the old version with a black CD tray lift it up there is a hidden picture. The best song: Prison Sex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does it get any better?","review":"Wow...Tool never ceases to amaze me with their intricate style and playing abilities. This is just a cd I can put in from time to time and just listen to it all the way through. Beats the hell out of these bands like Linkin Park and Story of the Year who continue to pollute the air waves with crappy music and hold up space for real talented artists trying to make it for one reason only...and thats not money but PASSION"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and Foreboding","review":"Tool expanded their \\"Grungy\\" sound from their debut into full-fledged metal with multiple artsy touches on this record, which would indicate the far more complex efforts that would follow. On its own, Undertow is pretty straight-forward HEAVY Metal with many underground influences and a sludgy/doom feel to it, coupled with light signs of progressive. The songs depict bleak, dark, evil images [the videos help too] of dispair, drug-induced anger, abuse, intolerance, etc. The album also losely follows a Water theme [Bottom, Swamp Song, Undertow, Flood]. The ending is an extremely odd \\"song\\" [or statment, or sotry, or something] which ends this dark album on a strange note."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different meaning every time!?!","review":"Undertow begs for the listener to see, hear and especially FEEL what it is all about. From the lyrics, art and the music itself you receive an explaination on what Tool thinks about life, isolation, love disguised as sex, sex disguised as an oulet to understanding oneself, politics and disorder.In the begining of the album you hear what sounds like someone hitting a bong (hookah for our eastern friends) ironic huh, the first track is intolerance and you hear that sound when in actuality it is a scuba divers lungs filling up with water and suffocating. But I digress eveyone has an opinion on Tools music and regardless if I agree with what people think or not opinions are useful. I happen to have a tatoo of the minds eylet from aenema on my forarm... and I could go on and on about how it represents a minds eye and not a \\"regular\\" eye.That's the thing about Tool you think you know what your getting from them and they surpass expectations in a vast majority."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's no choice but to confront you, to engage you, to erase you..","review":"My soul must be iron... This record was so refreshing in 93. A band of true artists. The music is everything. This record rocks. Weird, arty videos that don't show the band at all. A frontman who is not a typical frontman. Performing Live, he is a shadow. Again, because it is the music, not the personalities or looks. I love that about this band. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best hard-rock band today?","review":"Perhaps the best hard-rock band extant, all of their albums to date play like a pretty respectable \\"Greatest Hits\\", churning out one 4-star rocker after another, interupted only by the occassional 5-star doozie. Hall of Fame sure-shots, it's quality material that will hold up well over time, making all of their albums to date almost mandatory purchases. Yeah, that good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only grunge-metal album you need.","review":"This easily blows Alice in Chains and Soundgarden out of the water. Beacause of its great riffs, lyrics, and songwriting in general, I gave it 5 stars. You don't have to skip a single track (except for the 59 blank ones) because every song on here is really good.Just a precaution, though. This is one of the angriest (not heaviest) albums I've ever heard. Each song features Maynard conquering his personal demons instead of singing about weird occult-ish stuff. If you can't handle the occasional well-deserved cuss word and consider yourself to be generally at peace with the world, then please stay far away from this album. If not... especially if you have a major anger-management problem, prepare to be amazed.I think this just might be the best Tool CD out there..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Original Ruled, But this IS the original.","review":"Well I have the original version of the Undertow cd which by the way is fantastic. But I wanted an edited version so I could play the cd in public without offending people by the profanity. I was sorely dissapointed when this cd arrived in the mail. The music is not censored at all. Only the artwork. So now I have 2 copies of the cd. That is totally unacceptable and I don't think it should be sold as an \\"edited\\" version. It's a friggin trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"creepy band","review":"I am a fan of both chevelle and a perfect circle.But if you ask me to choose between them?I would say tool.why?because chevelle and a prefect circle have similar vocals.But,Tool blew me away,the first time I heard sober I knew that this band was way better than chevelle and a perfect circle.That doesn't mean that they aren't any good.I recommend Point #1 and Wonder what's next by chevelle and everything by a perfect circle if your fans of this album.The reason I would pick Tool over Chevelle and a perfect circle is because of their unique sound that overruns the other two.maynard is in a perfect circle but was the best in tool.This is a great album and tool has easily become one of my favorite bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maynard has a different style","review":"This CD is great...I learned about Tool through Rage Against the Machine (the best band in the universe.) I really like how Maynard sings, it's quite different than hearing Zach de la Rocha scream. I also think the humor is great. Buy the CD and you'll know what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool- What more can I say?","review":"This album is one of the most phenominal albums! This is one of the few albums where every song is great. I was hooked when i first listened to it. Even though Aenima made tool \\"popular\\", or even worse \\"mainstream\\", Undertow, has the energy and bite that Aenima lacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest album of all time.","review":"Those who do not say that this is Tool's best album have obviously not listened to this one enough. I've listened to the CD almost a thousand times and I STILL find things I haven't noticed or appreciated.From the get go, Intolerance puts you on the edge of your seat and makes you want to punch a whole in a wall dealing with frustration and ignorance. Prison Sex, Sober, Bottom, Crawl Away... what more can be said about these incredible songs that push your emotions around like hockey players do to a puck? Undertow has to be my favorite song of all time.... lyrics, voice, music, and that strangely heavy/bluesy rhythm at the end of the song, define Tool's musical epiphany. Undertow is a must for any metal/rock/hard-rock enthusiast."},{"rating":"2","title":"THINK!","review":"Listen to this one-third of the Tool experience and prepare yourself for a musical/mind blowing experience that takes you from the lowest low to the highest high, in search of that elusive answer that hides in the dark corners of our minds........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why can't we not be sober?","review":"Although I'd rate it slightly below Aenima it is still one of the best c.d.'s around.

They make the music for the music and not or stardom. I would also recommend listening to a Bill Hicks cd to see where they get some of their views"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still crazy after all these years","review":"Today this album may not sound so original, but keep in mind that it was released seven years ago.

I'm a senior in high school now and I still give mad props to these guys!! Undertow was the album that swayed me with that awesome song \\"sober\\", then \\"stinkfist\\" came along off of AENIMA and BLEW ME AWAY!!! These guys are so cool because they're so hidden. You never see them in any of their videos (unless Maynard is one of the clay-mation dudes) and yet almost every metalhead I hang with loves Tool!! This and all of Tool's CD's are must haves!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it a miss","review":"This debut from Tool is overrated and is not as interesting as their other albums. The songs and vocals drag on in a repetetive and way and the is little going on to keep me listening.However, tracks like prison sex, sober and bottom are the best they have written - these display more dynamics and variation. Another strong point is that there are no \\"filler\\" segments like on \\"aenima\\" between tracks to distract you."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"Let me admit right now- this band isn't my thing.The opening song called \\"Intolerance\\" features a loud, grungy guitar riff to open the song. I can tolerate it. I understand it was somewhat original back in the day (even though the idea of opening an album with a loud, heavy grunge rocker has been beaten in the mud in todays world).Many of the guitar riffs sound like they're recycled from old Black Sabbath records and songs such as \\"Sweet Leaf\\". The looping guitar riff from that song finds it way on numerous occasions on this album somewhere, and I simply won't tolerate that.The lead singer has an annoyingly overbearing \\"nervous\\" angry sound to his voice that I have trouble accepting as good. All the vocal melodies sound the same. It's like falling in a big pot of grunge riffs and vocals and having a big spoon come down and stir you around and around for over an hour. That's my experience with this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"learn to swim...please","review":"tool is boring to me i cant stand them except that one song learn to swim and the new one placabeo or whatever the hell they named itwhy do they have to be so damn complicated with choosing names dammit"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"Sound repordiction is poor despite tape being classified as good.

Sorry, but Tool are 2nd level musicians only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again just a mediocre album.","review":"Again I was told from a friend that Tool was a great band with amazing sound etc. This is yet another album that shows me anyone who overrates Tool this much is a Tool.

I searched Indonesia for a month looking for their album but to no avail. Well I am happy to see Amazon has this for sale (even if it's only the single). I hope some label in America picks up their album. The single is amazing, I still have it in my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Enjoyable","review":"Is this a great book in the sense that Frank Herbert's Dune is? No. Did I enjoy it more than books 3 and 4 in the Dune series? Yes. In fact, I had thought this would be the most enjoyable of the Prince Roger series, and, for me at least, it did not disappoint.Perhaps, as others here have said, some of the plot could have been better, but some of the characters more than made up for it. During the girlfriend rescue, for instance, there's this guy who keeps quoting movies and such. The only horrible sequence that stands out in my mind is when Roger does his meat-cutting routine. I liked the knife-wielding Rastar. His star-shaped meat shouldn't have been bested by Roger's octahedron-shaped meat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space opera at its best","review":"For those who have read the first three books of this tale the last in the series is quite satisfying. There is always the hope that after a little while the authors will drop one more book into the story to see where everyone ends up. These characters are just to good to let them fade away."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT QUITE HONOR","review":"Overall, a good read. It drags in places and isn't quite up to the Honor Harrington books,Obviously sets the stage for more to come. Hopefully, they will be a little better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mess","review":"Hard to say how these two authors could have gotten so far off track, but they did. Decent enough first three book's plot scatters off into subplots, tedious space battles orchestrated for mysterious purposes, mutinous Marines rallying behind a \\"Prince of the Blood\\", and the escape of a dimly seen evil personage. By far the weakest of the series and hardly a credit to either Webb's or Ringo's skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Few has FEW things to recommend it","review":"This series has taken us to The Mountains, The Sea, The Stars and now The Pits.This is (in my humble opinion) the poorest of this series by Weber. I happen to be a Weber fan (which tells you that I don't mind some fluff in my books) because I like to be entertained and not have to focus too much on leisure reading.This book struck me from the 3rd or 4th page as just a way to finish a book and make money.Bad characters are TOO bad - action sequences are good, but that is this book's ONLY redeeming value.The things the BAD PEOPLE do is just beyond common sense and thebasic premise that a bunch of retired Veterans could take over a Galactic Empire is beyond LUDE-E-Crus if you know what I mean.I WOULD NOT purchase this book if I knew then what I know now.I own every book David Weber has written, but I would have skipped this one. I recommend you do so.Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Satisfying Installment","review":"While I found this to be a very satisfying conclusion to the three books that went before it, I would like the authors to continue with the series taking up where Roger is confirmed on the Throne of Man. I was left wanting more of the Throne of Man's struggles with the Caravazan Empire, the rebel military forces and expecially the play of the reluctant rulers of the Throne, Roger and Nimashet."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Few","review":"The fourth novel in the Prince Roger series takes place off the planet of the first three books. Prince Roger is fully capable of being a leader and leads the remnants of the Bronze Battalion back to Earth to rescue his mother. Same good writing that Ringo is capable of and held my interest throughout the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fitting wrap-up to a long journey!","review":"The story was tightly written, with believeable intrigue, and engagning characters. The main character was orre booding than in the previous book, but the wrap-up at the end was quite satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, and Not the Last Book","review":"A disappointing book. Previous books in the series dealt with science fiction themes; we watched Prince Roger develop from a brat to a true leader while he and his troops faced challenges on a remote planet.This book is a spy novel, and not a very good one at that -- the SF in the book isn't relevant to the story. The authors also include several side plots that aren't germane to the story as a whole. For example, after the story is essentially over, fourty or so pages go by in detailed explanation of space battle tactics; those pages could be replaced by a couple of paragraphs (\\"and he escaped\\").This isn't the last book of the series. One of the evil bad guys escapes at the end, and unless Prince Roger (and we) are very lucky, no doubt he'll be back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eloquent and moving","review":"Enduring a devastating artillery barrage; the company commander bleeding to death; an American soldier lying dead in the snow just minutes after singing \\"Silent Night\\"; an emaciated prisoner thrilled to find a partially rotten turnip; sorrow at the firebombing of Dresden; escaping from the dreaded Russians with the help of his brother -- these powerful images will never be forgotten by readers of this superb memoir of a young soldier taken prisoner by the Nazis in the Battle of the Bulge.

This is the only bib you need - wash it and wipe it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Bib","review":"A very clever idea - using plastic snaps to create the bib pocket - so at the conclusion of use, the bib can be made completely flat for cleaning. Also, the flattened bib folds easily for packing in a diaper bag. The snaps are color-coded (white/ivory) to aid in the pocket-making. My daughter found several bibs in this style when her first was learning to eat by herself. She's now almost five and though those first two bibs have been washed into oblivion, we were happy to find them offered on Amazon. The bib is made of a plasticized fabric (fabric side toward the child) which easily washes in a clothes washer, though they should be hung to dry, as drying in the clothes dryer tends to make them stiff/brittle. They've been washed with a bleached load to eliminate tomato-sauce stains or odors. This smaller-sized bib is perfect for 'first feedings.

What I never knew!","review":"JFK: The Case for Conspiracy spells out all the information that the Warren Commission never told America. As young as I was in 1963, I remember that awful day well. In those days, there were only the three Networks, NBC, CBS and ABC, and all three had no programing other than the Kenndy Assassinastion. We believed what the media told us. There was much the media did not tell us because the government covered things up. We have come a long way from those days. This DVD beautifully lays out the case for Lee Harvey Oswald not being the person who shot Kennedy, inspite of the Warren Commission's assertion that he was the lone gunman. Every history teacher who teaches about this time in American history needs to watch this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent historical documents.","review":"I always figured that there HAD to be other films of the actual assassination of Kennedy November 22nd, 1963. And, there IS! This DVD has them. With brief commentary by Robert Groden, describing what is being filmed, this collection is only part of mountain of evidence that this WAS AND IS A CONSPIRACY.Shocking graphic detail as only home movies of that era can present, this collection puts the event in perspective from many different angles and positions in and around Dealy Plaza.Thank you Robert Groden for this contribution to what any thinking person already figured out...Kennedy was killed by several gunmen in different locations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment on video quality but NOT the Content!!","review":"I have disappointed because of bad quality of DVD. It's Mastered from a used VHS casette. You can see even head distortion on bottom of the screen. Beause of bad quality it didn't made any difference than other videos. I have a download from internet that shows JFK Centered and it's crystal clear picture. I can manage it frame by frame. Other cameras are showing the incident incomplete. I think some one cencored the film rolls. Why they sell DVD in VHS quality. Let them sell cheaper CD version instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"Bland! I purchased this in hopes to gain a more in depth understanding of what happened that fateful day in American history. The films all show without a doubt that the shot came from the \\"grassy knoll\\", but fail to provide any more interesting information than that. The voice over is lifeless and useless. Save your money on this one. However, any idiot that still believes the government had nothing to do with the assasination should be made to endure this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Film to see","review":"Now here is a film that I had the pleasure of attending a private screening for in LA that will blow your mind!! It is a film which is based on new evidence (which was discovered) in the JFK assassination; this evidence was discovered shortly after the film was complete.It is an amazing film, very well written and directed.I have ordered my copy and anyone who is interested in JFK and the theories behind his assassination should order this film.http://www.amazon.ca/Frame-Mind-Carl-T-Evans/dp/B001M45O90"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanna know who is behind JFK assasination?","review":"First, you must watch a documentary film by Aaron Russo called \\"America: Freedom to Fascism\\". This film is available on Amazon or you can watch it free on Google Video. I call this film \\"How John D. Rockefeller and Friends Stole America\\". Then to get a complete picture, you must read the article located here www.john-f-kennedy.net/thefederalreserve.htm. After watching the film and reading the article, I promise that it will be very clear to you that men that run the Federal Reserve Bank are behind the JFK assasination and every president of the USA after JFK knows that but is either too scared to tell the public about it or is in on the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"jb2448","review":"Classic case if you want it to be there, it is!These guys see things that are only blurred blowups.Under there theory all of humanity is to blame.Such BS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Erotic, Violent, Revenge.","review":"Fast moving, tense, kidnap, rape, murder, and a happy ending.

These patriots harbored the genuine hope that the Americans were going to intervene against the Soviet-imposed Communist regime in Romania.Dr. Stroia's life was one of endurance through the turmoil of the 20th century. A survivor of the Red Holocaust, his story is a page of authentic history, one that is not found in textbooks. The authors have gained my sincere admiration for this excellent book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A reminder for future generations","review":"Writing this book must have entailed an immnese amount of work. This compelling story will remind the current and future generations of Romanians about the price Dr. Stroia and others paid in order for us to enjoy a better life. Therefore, I find the fact that the story has been published personally gratifying."},{"rating":"2","title":"One man's story...","review":"An amazing and horrifying story detailing the good and evil of human nature through one man's real life experience under a brutal communist regime. Dr. Stroia chronicals his experiences with both the objective voice of a clinical physician and the subjective voice of human emotion caught up in an environment of terror and fear. Ultimately, this story is of triumph of the human spirit through the tenacity and courage of one man. Truly an inspiring story and a history that needs to be known."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major issue with lining","review":"I bought this costume for my 2 year old son who loves Elephants. When I got it I quickly found out there was an issue with the lining of the costume. We went to try it on him to make sure it fit. The legs on the intieror didn't line up right. Therefore I still can't tell you if it even fits him correctly. When you look into a costume or any pair of pants for that matter, you should be able to see clear holes to the feet. This was not the case. Now I have less than 2 weeks till Halloween and haven't gotten confirmation from this company if they have any in stock without this defect. And they still have this product listed on amazon while supposedly investigating the matter. So buyer beware.The costume is incredibly cute and I am hoping that the company will make this right for my son. So I hope that this is just a one time fluke."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's an elephant without feet","review":"The product image on the website is old according to the customer rep in BrandsOnSale.

So use your judgement before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT RECOMMEND!","review":"First, let me start by saying that the quality of this costume SUCKS. It's scratchy and too simple to be anything more than a gray piece of fabric. It is also a 4T. It says 2T-4T but the costume clearly has a 4T size on it when you get it. Would not have fit my 2 year old. I returned the product and paid my own shipping. Then, the company charged me a 25% \\"restocking fee\\" on top the shipping I paid to have it sent and the shipping I paid to send it back. So basically I paid an extra $30 for NOTHING. *****DO NOT BUY THIS!**** The \\"Cuddly Elephant costume\\" also sold on Amazon is much more cute and soft!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good camera - except for red eye","review":"Happy with the features, functions, and performance of the camera in all except one area. The red eye reduction function is useless. I'm aware of the physical reasons behind red eye, and undertand it can never be completely eliminated. But most of the photos I've taken of friends and family are absolutely terrible when it comes to red eye. I had a compact Pentax zoom 35mm before this, and the red eye reduction with that camera was outstanding.

Great picture quality and relatively easy to get started and use. A bit heavier than I would like and I hate the lens cover. Should have a regular on and off switch and a more reliable lens cover.

A friend of mine recommended anything by Logitech, and needless to say, I wasn't disappointed. I've compared these to the full-fledged four speaker models and only in the most strenuous of circumstances do they differ.The speakers are attractive and easy to set up. The subwoofer can be hidden under a desk out of the way without any decline in sound quality. The tweeters can be mounted on any wall using a single thumbtack.No complaints at all after a month of use. These are perfect for a small scale setup but will easily fill an entire room with rich, well produced sound. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahora, todo el mundo puede ver lo mejor de Selena!","review":"I feel a deep loss in the death of Selena, she was truely a great role model for all races, \\"chicana\\" or otherwise.

Selena also provides guest vocals on God's Child, by David Byrne, which sounds out of place on this album. Much better is her duet with the Barrio Boys on \\"Wherever You Are.\\" For this version, the \\"Boys\\" recorded their vocals in English. To fill out the album, the music to five Selena oldies but goodies was re-recorded with Selena's premortem vocals glued on for authenticity. This practice would be continued on subsequent compilation albums in which those who are not Selena would record new instrumentation and then glue on Selena's original vocals or some distortion thereof so that they could sell it as new Selena product. And the fans bought it, and loved it! Personally, I tend to avoid compilation albums that do not contain the original hit versions. I would recommend the compilation All My Hits over this album.

I had enjoyed the very underrated Psycho City from a couple of years earlier and expected more of the same. Well, I was completely thrown for a loop by the fact that it was an entire album full of ballads. What always made Great White ballads--especially the legendary \\"Save Your Love\\"--stand out was that they were surrounded by quality rockers. The lack of energy and hooks on this album was very disappointing. I sold the album back after a few listens. This experience almost kept me gun shy from buying the 1999 effort \\"You Can't Get There From Here\\" by these guys. Fortunately a friend lent it to me and I found out that it was a much improved effort. I have six Great White albums--but this one is certainly not one of them.

It is not intended for that purpose and would not perform well.The picture is a little misleading, as there is no handle or loop at the top end of the bag. There is one at the bottom. What you do is allow the hanger(s) to extend through the top hole, and then gently fold the bag and loop the lower handle loop over the hangers. This lets you carry or hang the bag in shorter areas.A good one size fits all type bag. A full tux with about four hangers fits fine in it. It offers good protection and is simple to use and carry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for music, really.","review":"Ehhh, It's just not worth 80 dollars, if you made me tell you how much I would have paid for it, maybe 45-60. Maybe. There is a constant hissing in the background, and music is worse. When you hear the cymbals of your favorite rock band, it hisses worse still. And of course the overall sound quality is not worth 80 dollars. I have been forced to use other headphones just because of how awful these things are. I would just get a regular Blue tooth headset, or REAL headphones, or ear buds. These just are not ready for music yet... Other than that, you can tell these are of high quality, they are good headphones, just not for music. Maybe phone calls... The mic works VERY well. It is a cool feeling to walk about while talking on skype.Wirelessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed headband","review":"The good electronics in this headphone are ruined by the cheap, poorly designed headband. I purchased this product because I wanted bluetooth wireless headphones, with noise cancellation, in a folding design to replace my Sennheiser wired headphones. The bluetooth in these headphones works perfectly - easily and reliably pairing with my Sony iPod transmitter. The headphones charge easily from a mini-USB connector and the battery retains its charge for a good length of time. However, as noted in other reviews, all of the products good features and negated by the headband, which is cheaply fabricated and poorly designed. After only two uses, the headband refuses to stay open and is therefore extremely annoying and uncomfortable. The bottom-line: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Premium price, quality mediocre","review":"Pairing these headphones can be complicated and inconvenient.Sound quality is fair, with a constant \\"hissing\\" noise in the background.The headset is fairly lightweight, and not uncomforatble. Although it's not particularly comfortable either. I also don't notice that much benefit from the so called noise reduction feature. If I had to do it again, I would by something else. Sound quality just isn't all that good. Having to charge it using the USB port of the computer is rather inconvenient also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived unusable","review":"Apart from having a general appearance of less quality than its price might suggest, This item arrived without the proper dongle for charging.

Very disappointed :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Try something else","review":"I usually don't find myself writing reviews. However, I feel the need to save people some of the drama with these headphones. The issue I have is not a defect.... it's just how the product was made. I have bought 2 pairs of these and both easily lose reception with the phone it is paired to. I keep the phone in my pocket and still manage to lose the connection. I've gone back to using the uncomfortable Best Buy store brand bluetooth stereo headset... they keep a better connection and last waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay longer. As for the \\"noise-cancelling\\" the only cancellation comes from the fact that the headphones do a good job of covering your ear. Save your 8 hr battery life by turning off the noise cancelling... it's not doing anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Spend the $","review":"If all it were trying to do was to be a bluetooth headset it would be okay and the sound would be okay.

There is nothing new offered on this album, and all the songs sound like rejects from the debut. In end, this is a fun listen the first time, but it isn't as memorable or affecting as the group's earlier works. You probably won't take it out of it's case more than once. However, it is 97% better than anything else on Epitaph."},{"rating":"1","title":"SIMPLY BAD!","review":"The Cramps are one of my favorite bands but this CD is terrible. Just Lux and Ivy going through the motions. Very disappointing! Instead, I highly recommend that you check out Songs the Lord Taught Us (one of the best recordings ever--no bad songs on the original album), A Date with Elvis, Psychedelic Jungle/Gravest Hits, and Stay Sick in that order.

I found it to be nothing more than 270 pages of ego and self aggrandizement. The text is full of errors that interrupt the reading and the writing is amateur at best. The book seemed more like bragging than actually presenting any meaningful theory or philosophy.

Allan Moore is both and that style permeates the whole analysis of this 1971 breakthrough album by Tull.The interesting thing about the 33 1/3 series is how variable and eclectic the variety of writers are. The thing that hits one most about this specific book is that unless you really know the album inside out and Tull's greater musical history, you are hampered from the outset and the greater part of the book proves pretty unfathomable. Every song gets dissected with a musical surgery analysis that drains any desire to go and listen to the album further and the numerous footnotes to other books, articles and websites (including a fair number by the author) leaves you wondering if you have ended up in some heavy version of a music pseuds corner.One of the least enjoyable of the series I have read so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A thorough review of decision making principles","review":"This well written book presents a comprehensive and unbiased review of decision making concepts.

My buddy Travis recorded their first stuff for his studio project at BYU and I will have to say their sound had evolved and continued to change (inenjoyable ways) as time has gone on. My favorite of thir new songs personally is \\"State Of Mind\\" which is really way outside the norm for them but a fun one. You will enjoy this...

The individual submissions tend towards repetition, with an over-emphasis on defining terrorism, and not much justification for the strategies they propose to combat it. Generally, however, the essays just don't cover much ground, and the discussion helps no one but professional philosophers. Any one with a practical interest in combating terrorism, be they military, political, or in any other field, would find the book unhelpful.The Chomsky and Sterba submissions are interesting, but others, such as Philips', are just plain weird. Philips' solution to long-term terrorism is to give in to the demands of fundamentalists, and take our society backwards to meet theirs.

Just accept the fact that god created the universe and all its physical laws. Earth is also his creation and it formed based on how he created the universe.

Use these for your neck and shoulders as well as any muscles that hurt from too much excercise. I cut them in half, avoiding the charcoal \\"dots,\\" and use regular tape to secure them to my legs, arms, shoulder--where ever I need them. They provide better relief than any creams or salves.

If you'd rather address a problem than pay it lip service, this book is not for you.Death March by Edward Yourdon gives a much better overview of the issues around burnout, but is primarily focused on a software development environment.

Great production and a perfect example of how raw yet powerful BOC was live. Buck is at the top of his game and blisters the lead solos from beginning to end. The Last days Of May (A True Story) has a hauntingly brilliant and beautiful yet all too short lead guitar solo.

I'm amazed that some people can read this book and still claim that the young-earth view is some kind of 1960s novelty.WRONG -- as Dr Kelly shows, it's the billions-of-years interpretation that's the novelty. No-one had thought of this before some conservative exegetes felt the need to harmonise with the views of Hutton and Lyell in the first half of the 19th century. Even allegorizers such as Origen and Augustine recognised that Genesis allows only for Earth to be thousands of years old. Dr Kelly cites people such as Basil the Great and Calvin to prove his point. Critics also ignore the 19th Century Scriptural Geologists, documented by Dr Terry Mortenson's Ph.D. thesis at Coventry University, UK, outlined on the Answers in Genesis site."},{"rating":"2","title":"A symphony of Scripture and science on the theme of creation","review":"Dr. Kelly's reverent scholarship shines in this thought-provoking and persuasive case for a straight-forward interpretation of the Genesis account of creation. His exegesis is solid, shunning speculation, and by plain teaching of profound biblical truth he opens a door to glorious meditation on God's greatness and goodness. The scientific elements may lay the ax to the root of unsound presuppositions held by evolutionists and induce a major paradigm shift when duly considered.Thank you, Dr. Kelly, for this satisfying contribution to the debate and this precious gift to Christians committed to a high view of Scripture and reason.About me: 48 years old, former electrical engineer, now a Reformed Baptist pastor for about 20 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudo Science.","review":"This book is a typical example of the pseudo-science we see today from Creationists.As it becomes impossible for them tp deny the fact of evolution,so they have changed tack and come up with absurd ideas that Genesis is a scientific record of how the world began.In fact it is just one more creation myth of ancient Bronze Age religions,based primarily on Babylonian myths.Believe this anti-intellectual nonsense and you have to disbelieve all modern science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infuriating","review":"I have not read too many books by Christina Dodd, but the ones I had read prior to Rules of Surrender were wonderful. This book simply made me angry. Our hero has been off with the bedoins in the Sahara for 13 years or so and has adopted their annoying male chauvinism. I found nothing lovable about Wynter and could not figure out what their love or attraction was supposed to be based on. What are we supposed to see in him? Charlotte does not seem to like him and yet decides she's in love with him. He was overbearing and seemed to browbeat her into submission. He had awful opinions about women and their subservient roles and second class emotions. To top it all off, the love scenes were all coerced and read like rape fantasies . . . definitely off putting.I did not enjoy this book. I spent the whole time reading it expecting her to slap him and yell at him, which never happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining read","review":"This is an entertaining, fast moving book with believable characters.

Just because someone doesn't fight, no means no. Perhaps I am being a little overzealous, but when a woman gets hauled off to a tent and has her clothes ripped off by a domineering barbarian, I don't care - that is gross. I found myself actually pitying the heroine for being so weak. I only finished this book so that I could give it a proper review. It wouldn't be fair to not finish it and then rip it to shreds. I will never read another novel by this author and she has nearly turned me off of the whole historical romance genre forever. Horrible book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fabulous romance from one of the best","review":"Christina Dodd has been one my favorite authors from her very first book and RULES OF SURRENDER certainly reminded me why. As a writer, her \\"voice\\" is incredibly unique and she manages to come up with a fresh idea in every book. This book captivated my attention from the first page to the last.

Unfortunately, the \\"hero\\" -- whom we're supposed to find irresistibly sexy and masculine -- is an overbearing boor who forces himself on the heroine at every opportunity. Apparently the author thinks that sexual harassment, assault, emotional manipulation, and date rape are sexy when they're in an 1840s setting. I can't agree. Deserves its single star because the initial scenes of the governess with the children and their grandmother are charming and well written. Unfortunately, that plot gets lost in pages and pages of really unpleasant, mostly nonconsensual sex between the governess and her employer. Ick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my idea of a good time.","review":"The book was boring, tiresome, unsexy and not at all romantic. The set up was unoriginal. The one real attempt at creativity-the male lead's years in the desert-was a complete turn off. Is the reader supposed to find romantic a man who enjoys and longs for a society where women at little better than animals? I also found it disturbing that he molested her and publicly humiliated her until she gave in to his wishes. The heroine crying herself to sleep after the marraige(which takes place late in the book)? Not my idea of romantic."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL... How in the world did this book get a 4 star oveall??!","review":"One of the most boring romance novel I've read this year, maybe in 2 years.

Who wants to read about a dull, up tight governess who has zerop sense of humor? Add a hero who says the dumbest things that are just roll-your-eyes silly, you get a romance book thats very hard to finish reading. Not to mention these two seems to have zero chemistry.THIS book was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dodd or Dudd?","review":"I was surprised this book turned out to be a dud. Christina Dodd stories are usually entertaining, full of wit with lots of romantic tension. This story lacked all of the above. The hero had no personality. I pictured him as Tarzan, especially on how he spoke and thought. He did not believe a man could love a woman based on his early teachings with the desert nomads, so you can imagine the anguish the heroine had throughout most of the book since she loved him. She should have been named Jane. Now, all that was missing was Cheetah the chimp, though I do not think his humorous antics could have saved the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surrender your heart","review":"This first of the Governess series is a romp thru Regency England with a touch of the Middle East and a glimpse backwards at some friends from previous novels. Lord Wynter Ruskin has finally come home with his two children and his mother, Lady Adorna Ruskin has hired Lady Charlotte Dalrumple to tutor her granchildren into proper English decorum. What Lady Adorna does not tell Lady Charlotte is that she has one other pupil she is to tutor in proper English manners - lord Wynter. Lord Wynter, who having lived with the Bedouins in the desert has picked up some very strange habits!The dialog is witty, and so humourous, you will find yourself with quite a few belly laughs and the addition of the children who in their innocence 'do say the darndest things' - well suffice it to say, that Ms. Dodd never fails to satisfy in the dialog department.Definitely a refreshing and enjoyable read. I look forward to the next two novels in this trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actions Speal Louder Than Words","review":"This is the first book I have read from CD since A Sandleous Evening, and I enjoyed it. I loved the fact the we got to see what became of Adorna and Jane. In the begining of the book Lady Charlotte seemed like and intelligent woman, but toward the end her emotions and stupidity took hold and she failed to see what was right there in front of her eyes. Lord Wynter loved her more than anything in the world. When a man wants a woman happiness more than anything else, that's his love for her coming through. She didn't have to sulk and cry, because his actions spoke of his love and I am sure that is more important than words to any woman of the 19th or 21th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensual, Romantic and Funny","review":"I've read several of Dodd's books and find each one done tastefully and romantically.

The other negative reviews are right on the money. I usually read a romance about every two days and I have been trying to finish this one for over two weeks. I just don't like Wynter at all.

This book - literally - made me nauseous. Essentially rape in the guise of romance and marriage.

I skimmed the rest of the book hoping there was some sort of redemption, but no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh this was just awful!","review":"This book was really terrible. I didn't like the hero at all, and didn't like the heroine much better. The hero was ridiculous with his bone-headed \\"adopted\\" eastern cultural views and his daily habits. The governess just silly. The attraction between them made no sense at all. I can take some very creative plots and this could have been pulled off it the characters had somehow been made believable instead of just caricatures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fun, fun!","review":"I adored RULES OF SURRENDER. It's a great book to curl up with for an evening, and some of the scenes were laugh-out-loud funny. At first, Lady Charlotte and Wynter seem like complete opposites, with Lady Charlotte so prim and proper, and Wynter a male chauvinist to the point of being hilarious. I loved every minute of their witty dialogue. And the love scenes -- hot, hot, hot! I'm going to recommend RULES OF SURRENDER to all my friends. It's Christina Dodd at her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise - terrible execution","review":"Having enjoyed Ms. Dodd's Lost Texas Heart series, I picked up this book with fairly high expectations. The premise - a lady hires a governess to teach ton etiquette to her family recently returned from Arabia - held a lot of promise. I expected playful dialogue, some wit, the usual knot to unravel, and a happy ending. What I got was an overbearing male who goes through absolutely no character development, a wishy-washy heroine, and a rape scene - the kind where the heroine says no, means no, and after it is over, decides that since she was married, it was okay.Also - as someone living in the Maghreb and the Middle East, and having experienced and studied the history of the Bedouin, I was rather offended by Dodd's erroneous observations of the Bedouin culture.If you think men should get everything their own way, and being female means you have to revolve around your man as the Earth revolves around the Sun, then read this book. Otherwise, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work","review":"I really enjoy Dodd's writing but found this particular novel unsatisfying. The storyline had so much promise, but I saw little character development and little growth. I kept waiting for something, such as the heroine to use her backbone, or for the hero to become enlightened but came away disappointed. Don't bother with this one unless you like your heroes to be chauvinistic. I read this after reading book 2, Rules of Engagement which I suggest getting from the library. I am not going to bother with the 3rd book. Life's too short to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this","review":"As one review said, \\"It is very 'King & I.\\" But, it was just way too slow for me!

It's extremely well-written, thorough. I particularly liked the history of northwestern Pennsylvania. I've read Judson's book and approve of the quotes the author used. I was a little disappointed that the narrative stops after Gettysburg but can understand the author's choice in ending at this point. I would rate this 5 star except for the poor proofreading/editing. This is a day when a \\"manuscript\\" goes from disk to print through a computer and too many little errors were allowed to remain in the text. . . not when it concerned facts, thankfully, and therefore is the reason I can give it a high rating, but the errors broke the harmony of the written word.

Over time the white bunnies become light gray even with weekly washing. (I am not going to bleach the bunny). We keep three in rotation, and I now keep an emergency bunny still wrapped. The blanket material is perfect and the satin/silk material does not wear out. The construction is quite solid and we have only had 1 out of 6 bunnies loose their stitching on the bottom. I wish they were made in the USA, but they are made in China and designed in California. I have noticed several version improvments in the materials used but not in the fur for the ears, head, and arms.

Good thing we had a clean one as a backup! Buy several so your baby never sleeps alone. The best feature is the arms, which makes it very easy for my little boy to hold on to him.

I decided to buy a spare so that I could rotate them during bedtime and she would have two that smelled and looked the same in case one was lost. I received this one from Amazon and it is nothing like my original. It feels like a cheap knockoff. The velour and satin are thin and synthetic feeling, the bunny is not stuffed as full and the \\"fur\\" is not as soft. And... the pink color that was inside the bunny ears washed off after being put through the machine once!!I recommend that if you didn't buy your first Bunnies by the Bay from Amazon, you don't buy your replacement here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Love Love","review":"Our daughter loves her \\"la la\\" she won't sleep without it.

I gave it to her thinking it was cute but not having any high hopes that she would attach to it. My son never had a lovey so I didn't expect her to have one either. Boy was I wrong! She is IN LOVE with this bunny. She snuggles with her bunny every night and really can't sleep without it. She is 1 now, and we are ordering a second one as a backup since I can't imagine life without this bunny! It washes up quite well - I just throw it in with other laundry (on cold) and since we usually need it right away, I dry it in the dryer even though the tag says to air dry. The bunny part has lost some of its softness but with the way she drags this thing around, I have a feeling that would have happened anyway!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He's addicted","review":"I just ordered our third and fourth. My son got his first one when he was 3 months old. He's 2.5 now and he can't sleep without it. He chews on it all night and by morning it is soaking wet. He just called me upstairs now to tell me the one he has in bed is wet and he needs to trade. Two isn't enough for us any more! With all the chewing, they get gross pretty quickly, but they clean up just fine in our washer and dryer.I don't love that we need to order two more of these, but I love to see how sweetly my son cuddles it and how he lights up when he sees it. It's soft and cuddly and very cute - and we don't let him have it outside his crib, so it is an excellent way to bribe him to go to bed at night and naptime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT gift!

I would recommend purchasing 2 of the same style - this way there's always a spare in case one has to be washed or gets misplaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blanket","review":"A good companion for my daughter.

Oh my, it was working instantly! since then, she falls asleep with no nipple or etc with this bunny in her arm! So now i am stopping breastfeeding and this helps it too as she doesn't need my nipple to fall asleep! Very impressed about this bunny.Update. My first one, now 23month, went everywhere with this until 2 months ago. She would not sleep without the bunny. We called her \\"mrs. Bunny\\". She now prefers a big blanket, not a blankie. i wish she stayed with this little one, sigh. I got another one for my second Daughter, 6 month.

He predicted a day where you might see traffic jams lasting hours which would shutdown large cities. He predicted days where medical waste would close the beaches of Southern California.All of these overly-sarcastic and ridiculous visions of the future have come true.This places us at the beginning of _The_Sheep_Look_Up_.This book should be a must read for everyone over the age of 14, to help us as a society understand the seemingly innocuous consequences of consumerism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Telling stories and making you dream...","review":"If you like movie soundtracks, you will love this album.

It seems to be more of a recount of all the headlines the newspapers had. Spent way too much time debating the 13 verses 15 victims. The fact is 13 people did not have a choice about dying that day and 2 of them did. I personally know some of the victims families and the writer did not do very good research on some of her facts. There are a lot of people willing to talk about Columbine who just want there 15 minutes of fame. They did not know the people they talk about. I wish the book was not a \\"religious one\\" but rather a secular one. I have read the books on Cassie and Rachel and they were excellent. This book seems more to be sensational, negative, and tries to wrap up some sort of spiritual spin on it. Though I did not disagree with many of the things written I do feel that the writer overall just wanted to make a buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"saturated with religious fat","review":"Like others said before, the book does shed some light on the characters involved and affected by the massacure but the author's religious beliefs sometimes outshine the subject matter. Her stance on the shooters is at least somewhat sympathetic so I praise her for not making them out to be one-dimensional human beings with the KILLKILLKILL feelings dominating their personalities. But her writing is often punctuated with other's words and not her own.Also, the whole pretending she's a columbine mother is rather annoying as well. So, if you're a seasoned columbine expert you don't need this book but if you're curious and just recently got interested in columbine/don't know your information/whatever the book would be good to check out from the library(but don't buy it!) its a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Dark trance From Israhell!!","review":"This album is an absolute gem of an experimental trance project gone perfect. Dark Soho have managed to combine all elements of trance music into a soundcape from the underworld. The first track is my fav. with a nice slow build up before hitting fast dark beats and nice heavy guitar riffs that fit in perfectly. The album leads on to more of the dark Israely trance but with a real gothic twist in the sounds and nice breakbeat drum loops over the top of fast bass kicks and bubbly dark 303 lines. A must by for those who like their trance dark and hard!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"tic-tacs=bad stomach ache...period!!!","review":"I love tic tacs...I love that they are only 1 1/2 calories, and that they are just so minty!!!

But the entire time it seemed like the set up to a joke that never has a punchline. It's like you're all set to laugh but the laugh never comes. I chuckled a few times during the movie but mostly it was depressing. I also didn't like how all the wives in this movie have 6-pack abs but all the men were fat.

You can tell this movie was made by men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic Vince Vaugn vanity project","review":"I knew I was in trouble when the opening credits rolled and Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau were listed as the writers. This is another of those unfunny vanity projects that sound great at the pitch meeting but fall apart in the execution (See: Tropic Thunder). Everything was packed into this movie to ensure marketability except funny, well-paced jokes. And I liked Vince Vaughn in Wedding Crashers and Dodge Ball. Jason Bateman better watch that he doesn't sink his comeback by making these losers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it - not funny","review":"This was a terrible movie... and it's not funny. I'm not sure why some reviewers \\"laughed throughout\\" unless there's some chemical enhancement ongoing. There weren't many jokes and few situations were funny. Maybe some find facial expressions hilarious and don't need much else. I don't categorize it as comedy or romance. I'm extremely disappointed in Couples Retreat, especially given the cast, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vince Vaughn Going Through the Motions","review":"No, this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, and if I had never seen the previous Vince Vaughn flicks (Swingers, Wedding Crashers, Four Christmases, etc.), I might have been impressed with his witty banter with Jon Favreau, but given that I have seen Vaughn's earlier films, Couples Retreat had none of the required punchiness to carry the film. As other reviewers have mentioned, it was extremely predictable. Despite my past support of Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn, this movie has me thinking twice about bothering to watch any of Vaughn's future films, similar to the effect that Funny People had on me regarding Adam Sandler's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!","review":"I loved Swingers and I love, generally, whatever Vince Vaughn. But this movie is horrible. Not even funny. Oh god, it was sooo bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable I think.","review":"I expected to like this despite the bad critics reviews. I liked \\"The Break Up\\" even though a lot of people didn't because they found it uncomfortable to watch Aniston and Vaughn fight, this was like that only not as funny (IMO of course). It started off ok but went nowhere. I guess this is what they mean by forgettable because I watched it a week ago and I can't remember what I disliked so much about it, just a waste of time I guess. If there was half stars I'd give it 2.5 because there were some funny parts... I'm rambling again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I have ever seen.","review":"I typically don't take the time to write reviews, but I felt compelled to speak out against this movie. It was absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. Seriously, it really was. I have seen some really bad movies, but this takes the cake. It was way too long, no real story line, and aside from 3 moments I didn't even crack a smile. I am seriously contemplating a class action lawsuit against Vince Vaughn's Wild West Production Company. I wish there was a way I could go back in time and get my 2 hours back. I will be cursing Vince Vaughn on my deathbed for robbing me of that time. Jason Bateman should also be ashamed.

Not that I'm trying to put it all on him, because I think the writing and directing were probably the culprits, but I made an effort to see this film because he's one of my favorite comedy actors and has played some great roles. But this movie is more than forgettable, it just ain't funny! I thought the movie tried too hard to be visually funny rather than delivering funny lines per say and for me it just didn't work. Sure there were a couple of chuckles here and there, but basically the movie was very flat and sappy at times as well.Final Grade: C-"},{"rating":"1","title":"watch it if you don't have anything better to do, but it will be precious time lost!","review":"You can glimpse the plot of the movie from the title, it is exactly what it says, only completely lame with over-the-hill actors getting richer while wasting our money!

Having Vince Vaughn in this movie is a total insult to him; another example how having funny people in a stupid movie doesn't make it funnier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Q: How do you know a movie is bad?","review":"A: It has Vince Vaughn in it. Lasted about 45 minutes into it this time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and you've seen the funnies already","review":"Unfortunately this is one of those movies where most of the funny parts you saw in the trailer. Vince Vaughn has a couple of good lines but the whole movie itself was rather boring and dull. I guess this was supposed to be romantic comedy but there have been much better ones as it doesn't quite go well in any direction. My advice? Just stay away. Much better movies to spend your time on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misunderstood","review":"I'm also compelled to come to the defense of this movie.IMO, the negative sentiments about it are a result of wrong expectations.Couples Retreat is really a romantic utopia about reviving the passion in long term partnerships.It's very funny and actually quite intense at times (in a surprisingly serious way).To appreciate its wit and humor, though, one needs to have some awareness of the dynamics in long term relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Bad","review":"I love Vince Vaughn, but this was just awful!

The other three couples were tricked into going. They thought it was going to be a lot of free fun. But after their first day they found out they had to fallow the program to fixing their marriage in order to stay. Fixing a marriage that they didn't know needed fixing.

It kind of sucked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couples Retreat = A Couples Treat","review":"My wife and I went and saw this in theaters and knew right away it was a movie we needed to own.

Gorgeous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just plain bad...","review":"Having read a handful of reviews prior to watching this, my bar was set pretty low but this failed to elicit even a chuckle. The movie rapidly sways between American Pie caliber phallic jokes (which fall flat) and painfully dry Lifetime-level relationship drama; I have no idea what kind of viewer they had in mind when they made this thing. Save your time and money, and watch any prime-time half hour comedy at random, which is sure to provide the same level of entertainment. The scenery was the single redeeming item here.

Vince Vaughn, the comic genius of our time, swings for the fences in this uproarious couples comedy that should not be missed. The Academy has always been biased against comedies, but they are to be ashamed if they slight Mr. Vaughn this time around. Just from the constant stream of trailers-for both the theatrical experience and the dvd/Blu treatment-one can see that this film deserves high praise. Humor of this magnitude is a rare treat to be savored, and this film, along with Vince Vaughn, will always have a special place in American Cinema.

When we heard these two actors where going to be in \\"Couples Retreat\\", we knew we were going to laugh the entire movie. As the movie starts, the viewer finds that each couple is having problems in their individual marriage. However, Jason Bateman's marriage is the one marriage that is heading toward divorce. Jason Bateman's character and his wife's character convice the other couple's to go away on a vacation with them to this retreat where they promise each couple that they will get to have all the fun while Bateman's character and his wife will undergo intense relationship counseling to save their marriage. Bateman and his wife's character are unable to afford the trip without the other couple's going because of the group vacation rate. When all the couples get to the island, the laughs start rollin.

We both won when everything works out for all. The product placement is over the top in this. Apple, Fruitloops, Guitar hero, Sandals resorts and many more were irritatingly obvious.I was glad to see Kristen Bell (From Hero's) But her talent is wasted in this lame script.If we didn't make a game out of this We would have turned it off 30 min in.

Instead, however, I ended up witnessing the single worst piece of trash ever to be considered a motion picture.It was as if the pathetic attempts at comedy were written by a ten year old with a crap sense of humor.

At times, it just kind of stalled. It drug on and on at points. It started to kind of fall apart. They had the story going, then they tried to do to much. During the last 20 - 30 minutes, it really dragged on and on. If you like Vince Vaughn, then you should at least rent this. I wouldn't recommend you buy it though. It just was not good enough for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good book for transitioning your kids to raw food","review":"this is a good little book to get you started in the direction of transitioning your kids to raw food. when I first bought it, I actually got it for myself (I'm big on getting kids books when I begin something - guess I'm a big kid inside!) Anyway, I figured that I'd try it for kid-tested foods that I might like. The author doesn't feed her kids 100% raw, at least at the time of her writing and I like that she writes about how she follows the rhythms of the seasons and her kids. Certain times they are hungrier than others and she honors that. She talks about how her kids behavioral and physical problems were healed with raw foods. Very interesting little read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring story and practical advice in a quick read","review":"This book is good for anyone who wants to improve their diet for any reason. My husband experienced a marked improvement in his ADD from eating raw, so I know the author is accurately describing her child's transformation. Stoycoff pours her heart out about being a parent and bucking mainstream culture. The book is not all honey and roses. It goes through the trials and tribulations of a family's journey toward better health. The kids aren't made out to be little robot-angels, but regular kids who have to be convinced to eat healthy food. This book is especially good to empower people to consider a choice other than meds for kids with behavior issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS GUY STINKS......","review":"as a reporter and a writer, there isn't a cohesive paragraph in this mess of a book.

OK, the five-line musical notation might not, but if you're reading that, you're not a real bluesman in the first place - everyone knows bluesmen don't read music.But seriously, on that point, Robert Johnson isn't meant to be played note perfectly - if you listen to his own recordings, you'll see he didn't play it the same way twice himself. So what this book gives, a pretty accurate verse and chorus from each of his songs, should be more than enough to get you on your way.And if it isn't - if you don't immediately feel imbued with the spirit of the great blues masters, then here's what you do - to hell (ahem) with a note perfect trascription: just head down them cross roads at midnight..."},{"rating":"2","title":"another kof","review":"king of fighters is a game where if you have played one you have played them all. the games are basic fighters. this game has several returning characters. only a few of them are interesting.

If you are a beginner just getting into SLR photography, you will be much better served by getting a couple of prime lenses (I recommend 50mm and 80mm) of higher quality.

Kid Story tells the story of the kid in Reloaded that is obsessed with Neo, so it is good to know the story behind him.

I continued to play the CD for the days I stayed in the hospital and every person who came in - nurses and drs commented at how peace filled and calm the room felt and as a result, myself and baby were as well.

This CD is marvelous for accompanying your yoga or meditation sessions or even for playing while you're studying, just to get you in a quiet mood. The first \\"song\\" on the CD is a fairly random presentation of the bell tones, while the second one sounds a little more like a traditional song with a tune.

If you are looking to get a new lens that will give you some nice shots than the Canon 50mm f/1.8 is a great choice. It will allow you to add some creativity, depth, nice dreamy backgrounds and excellent bokeh to your shots for a nominal cost. The camera is sharp and a little unforgiven when taking close up shots so keep that in mind and its best to back up a few feet than normal. There is no auto zoom but that's why you were given feet to move forwards and backwards if you need to frame the shot. The quality of the lens is similar to the stock lens that comes with most camera kits so no worries there about quality. The lens is light weight and basic but overall for the value you get it provides great shots, depth of field and most of all added confidence that all beginners need.

For portraits and stills it's a decent lens for the low budget novice but for action shots, like surfing, it focuses way to slow and at full 300mm extension the pictures are kind of soft.

No prob for me since I most always use a tripod while photographing.Have not experienced the lens extending out fully when aimed downward like others have.

The lens is exactly what I wanted and a great addition to my inventory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth every penny","review":"This lens is cheap, and for a reason. It won't focus sharply when the aperture is wide open, so it's hard to get shots with a narrow depth of field but sharp focus on the subject. Its high f-number means you pretty much need sunlight or a tripod to avoid camera shake, and forget about action shots unless it's full sunlight. It also has very bad chromatic aberration; this may be corrected by a UV filter, but I haven't tried it. It shows purple halos around dark objects when they're set against a bright background.The lens does have very nice autofocus, though. It's very fast, especially after it's found the general distance of your subject and it just has to make minor corrections for different shots.Overall, this is a good lens for learning to frame shots and use a zoom lens, but its quality is low and it's not good for much more than learning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great budget lens, but the picture quality is terrible.","review":"Pros: VERY cheap telephoto lensThe amount of zoom is greatIt takes clearer pictures at lower zoom than higher zoomIt matches my camera?Cons: VERY cheap telephoto lensTruckloads of chromatic abberation!

But even in ideal conditions (good lighting, fast shutter speed, tripod mounted), it is still a subpar performer. The images aren't crisp and sharp and the colors are a little flat. It does allow for a nice enough bokeh (background blurring) when taking photos of someone 15 feet away or so. Generally that isn't easily accomplished by the 18-55 kit lens.Good photos can be taken with this lens... but more photos will be lost due to blurring or simply not being crisp enough.If you are on the fence as to whether you will use your DSLR, then this may be a good option. If it turns out you really like it, then invest in the 55-250mm.

I have used this lense about 4 times. I like the reach but that's about it.Sorry but this lense just doesn't do it for me as the focus is slow and the images are just not sharp. Honestly if you want something I would suggest the 70-300 usm or even the 70-200 f/4 L. The build quality on this lense is cheap. The focus ring is small (obviously most of the users will be using autofocus anyways). The filter does move whenever you focus (not good). There is no image stabilization either.I wouldn't recommend this lense unless it was pretty much free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing lens","review":"The price is fabulous if we compare it with the quality of the lens.I used it for whale watching and the pictures were awesome.

All of a sudden you get a message that the lense can not communicate with the camera, ( Clean your contacts ) well clean your contacts all you want it will not fix the problem. The problem is internal in the lense. The good news is you can send the camera off to Canon with an estimate repair cost of about $ 130 dollars, the bad news for a few dollars more you can buy a new one. Bottom line do not buy this lense buy a better one for a few hundred dollars more, in the end you will get much better pictures and it will work much longer then the year mine did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good item","review":"Great lens.

Well was I wrong, the build quality on this lens was very low, and I did not get one image worth saving. everything was grainy or soft especially when reaching out.

I'd definitely recommend it to other beginning photographers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great portrait lens","review":"I am a non-professional photography enthusiast. I purchased this lens for the specific purpose of shooting indoors at long range without a flash. As long as I lean on something stable, and take my time focusing, I can get maybe 2-3 out of 10 shots in focus. This is due to the lack of an image stabilizer, which is why the price of this lens is very affordable. The same lens with image stabilization runs a couple of hundred bucks more. This lends is great for nature photography in outdoor light (preferable bright) with a tripod, and taking portraits, which I love to do. I am now investing the extra few bucks in another lens with an IMAGE STABILIZER (Canon) for indoor use at long range. If you are looking to shoot sporting events, or indoors at long range in dim light, invest in a lens with image stabilization. Otherwise, this is a light lens that takes fairly clear photos in natural light or indoors with a flash. Love Canon products, and love Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! -This lens took action shots.","review":"My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California.

Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for money","review":"Reading some of the reviews here, it is clear I must be getting old. When I started taking pictures the one thing one looked for in a lens like this would have been that it was one touch, in that the zoom and focus were on the same ring. These days people are spoilt with auto focus and auto program modes in the camera let alone IS. So let me get to the point. For the money this is a beautiful lens. As long as you keep the shutter speed above 1/focal length you will be able to hand hold it. Remember that on a digital body there is a 1.6 adjustment factor. So at maximum zoom you need to keep the speed at 1/500 or better. Yes this needs good light and a higher ISO, but in most cases it should not be a problem. If you are 35mm user you have another stop or so to play with. I recently took pictures of a regatta from the committee boat at maximum zoom, hand held on a Rebel XT body with no problem. With an effective focal length of 480mm this is quite impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lense on a budget","review":"I am on a budget college student who picked an expensive hobby!

Although you cant compare it to a $500-700 lense with IS ;look at the price. If you are on budget like me and looking for a decent lense, this one will get the job done. I found that at 300mm it get a little blury if you dont use the tripod, but still this lense give an exceptional images. I love to go to a park and sneak up on birds, very happy with the quality.

Great equipment costs a lot. This lens is great compromise. I never thought I would need a telephoto zoom, but Amazon made it an easy decision to purchase when with a discount for buying a new camera brought the cost to $30. I'm glad I jumped at the chance. Even at full price, this lens is a great value for its construction and capabilities. This is definitely the next lens to step up from the kit lens. With the proper person, the proper camera, lens hood and filters, this lens takes fantastic images. Images from the dog show this weekend are visually stunning. If you feel that you can have good camera control with a steady hand (as this lens lacks image stability), and you are looking for a great entry level telephoto zoom lens, then this lens is a fantastic choice.

With a relatively slow aperture and no stabilization, it's a very demanding lens to use on aircraft, but if you know its limitations and compensate for them, you can get some truly outstanding shots. Its shortcomings have helped make me a much better photographer from a technical standpoint.Four stars because you just aren't going to find a better lens at this price for the EOS series (until Canon makes a better one). Highly recommended for beginners or casual photographers who just want a little more reach, but if you are a serious photographer that shoots with high-dollar gear that does a lot of your work for you, this lens will probably piss you off and you should stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad lens for the price","review":"I purchased this lens with my Canon T1I DLSR. The reviews of the lens were not very good, but seeing that I could get a rebate that made the lens about $[...], I went ahead.

However, on the plus side, in bright light, the lens focuses quickly, and produces clean, clear, crisp photos.

The red color actually has a little bit of a metallic sheen to it, so this thing is not only very practical, it looks cool, too.Another good Grundig product is the Blackout Buddy - a smaller, plug-in device that you leave in a wall socket until you need it ... it's a flashlight, radio and clock all in one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got a dud!","review":"I'm very disappointed.

The only thing that shows signs of life is the charging lamp, which lights up on the dynamo being cranked.This item was gifted to me, and now I learn that Grundig/Eton do not have any service centers in India, or even Asia.

The well known composers are here, i.e. Bach, Vivaldi, Handel, and it also may introduce listeners to baroque composers they may not have heard before, i.e. Marcello, Locatelli, Torelli. An all around great Baroque experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Names Around the World","review":"I purchased this book years ago as a resource for names to use in my novels.

Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur is quite possibly the greatest work of English literature and the source of the Arthurian legends, as we know them today. This legendary tale of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table is an exquisite story of adventure, love, honor, and betrayal. Throughout the whole of Malory's story there is the underlying theme that a thing's making is ultimately it's undoing, be it kingdom, man, or quest. Not only is this theme evident in this story but in his own life as well. Le Morte d'Arthur is a truly legendary work of art, given new life in this splendid rendition by Keith Bains."},{"rating":"1","title":"yech","review":"This book was terrible.

Possibly the best Who story(and Dalek story) in years.

The Daleks themselves are fantastic, as is the small cameo appearance of Davros, and the deadly Special Weapons Dalek!

The situations were so realistic and dramatic as well and those two things have you wanting more and more. I truly did not want this book to end! I can say one thing that I walk away with after reading this book is to make sure you lay all you cards out on the table and your expectations when going into a marriage and make sure that both parties agree to avoid any problems in the future.

The dialogue contains cliches and \\"clever\\" one-liners - I felt that the basic story was intriguing enough to deserve better dialogue. The revelation of the originator of the three-quarters scam was utterly predictable, as were many of the plot twists. Bobby's daughter, Maggie, was a sweet addition, but completely unbelievable as an adolescent computer hacker. No one could be that intuitive and well-adjusted. It was somewhat difficult to keep track of the ancillary characters thrown in here and there, for what seemed to be an effort to lend depth to the pension scam. These underdeveloped characters only succeeded in providing additional opportunity for sometimes tiresome vulgarity. It's unfortunate that the predictable plot and weak dialogue tarnished what could have been a fun mystery novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book has a good idea at the core of it, but the characters are shallowly drawn and the writing is incredibly amateurish.

I don't understand why the show didn't do that well. It's so amazing! Maybe it didn't have as many viewers as they'd like but the religious viewers the show did have really LOVED the show.

The stories are very exciting and make you want to keep watching episode after episode.A few of the lines are a little dated, of course, but that's reasonable, I think, and there's not so many of them that you notice.

It takes place in a dysfunctionally corrupted Seattle. It was like a futuristic Robin Hood!I liked Max (Jessica Alba) because she had different personalities on screen. She wasn't always a badass. She's nice & outgoing with her friends such as Original Cindy and her closest partner Logan. However, when the bad guys get in her path she plows through them. She applies her ... attitude when neccesary, especially with her boss. She's quick, daring, sneeky, street smart, and sexy.Dark Angel was by far one of my favorite shows alongside \\"Smallville\\" and \\"Witchblade\\" (which also got taken off the air).

I have been a soap addict for 2 decades, but once I saw Dark Angel for the first time, I couldn't get enough. It has surpassed All My Children as my favorite tv show. It has even surpassed My So-Called Life. I am so addicted to Dark Angel that some of the DVDs are wearing out and people tease me about it. I've also read all the books I could find.As far as making Dark Angel into a movie or a renewed series, I am all for it!!!! I was terribly distraught to find out that there's not a third season. However, nobody could replace Jessica Alba as Max Guevera. Except maybe the girl who played the younger Max. She's probably old enough by now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great script, Great Cast, Great Acting, Bad timing","review":"Like every fan of Dark Angel I was [mad] when it was yanked from the air. It died much to early and should have had a long run, I think FOX pulled the plug too late for the writers to properly bid farewell. Sadly the show was too early to be properly welcomed by viewers, and if it had made its debut now it would have outstanding ratings.

If I could draw one parallel from the cinema, its Tank Girl - its got a modicum of style, a painfully offbeat demeanor, no substance and a grandiose vision, but Tankgirl was over in a couple of hours - did i mention Season 1 was on 6 discs? I wish Jessica lots of luck whatever she's doing right now because she is talented but this was not a good showcase for her and if you listen to the director's commentary you will conclude that talent was not overabudnant at every level of Dark Angel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserved Cancellation","review":"Awful and stupid junk about a supergirl and her wheelchair bound boyfriend (THAT sure was clever!).

I liked the cat and mouse game between Max and Lydecker. The second season is where the problems started. It was more about Max chasing down the freaks she let out of Manicore than anything else. It got old watching her chase down a different hybrid each week. I'm probably not the only that feels this way: as ratings diminished during the second season, it was moved from it's nice Tuesday spot to Friday (the touch of death), and eventially cancelled.Overall, this was still a solid series, but it's ashame the storyline didn't continue on the path it was on during the first season."},{"rating":"1","title":"awesome but flawed","review":"i was so excited to see it in my mailbox this morning and early too. i was almost done with the first episode when it started skipping and pausing for long periods of time. i thought maybe i got a fingerprint on it or some sorta smudge. nope a huge scratch on a brand new disc. fun. wont even let me watch the 2nd episode or any of the other ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"The first season is really good.

His subpar chemistry book is purposefully filled with errors each and every edition for the sole purpose of cranking out a new edition in a couple of years. For, Mr. Zumdahl is a smart man. He knows that a new edition means buying new books at a price ranging in the 90-100 dollar range, which, in turn, means more profit for the Chemistry money-making machine.

This book covers a wide range of topics, and teaches them for different levels. NOT ALL OF THIS BOOK IS FOR BEGINNERS.

His recent efforts have been composed almost entirely from unusual sources: coffins, people vomiting, kitchen sinks, punching bags and various machinery. After all, the liner notes mention 635 separate items used for this album's creation, while the packaging cleverly gives us pictures of all of them (49 items per page).If all this unbridled and eccentric sampling would throw you off, it won't once the record begins: it is unfettered and bouncy electronic music, albeit balanced with jagged political lyrics. However, these are sung by the lovely voice of Dani Siciliano (mainly), and make for a terrific listen. If you are only used to the smooth jazzy quietness of \\"Around the House\\" from Herbert(as I am), this will be a pleasant change, and a perfect summer record. One of the year's strongest albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supreme Disappointment","review":"I had listened to a handful of early (or earlier) Herbert tracks and remixes through other artists and was really interested experiencing the rest of his music.

If I had to label it that label would be \\"showtune hell\\". Bodily Functions is masterpiece compared to this.

Understanding Herbert's classical piano background, I expected a deep and nuanced interpretation of house that could combine interesting danceable beats with a solid 4x4 backbone, but some rhythmic variation and interesting found sounds from the claims of so many odd samples used. The first thing that put me off was the terrible vocals, which combine the cheesy and trite lyrical stylings of the worst diva-house with the shallow wording of your local folk music open mic. The rhythms were also boring, none of the more interesting layering ontop of the standard house beat, but a very shallow and superficial interpretation you would expect to find on a Casio keyboard.Stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding....","review":"To the reviewer who makes reference to house music, PLEEEEEEEEAZE learn your genres and don't insult house music with trying to even slightly compare this to house!!!

Herbert does spark the odd interesting sound here and there- but that hardly makes for complete, well rounded and great music. To me this is your typical self indulgent experimental electronica that just doesn't make it. I'm not a regular reviewer, but after hearing this CD and then seeing it compared to house, I had to write- for the sake of fellow house lovers!

Oh well, if ou want Whitney this Chirstmas, get My Love is Your Love instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've heard better","review":"This album feels quite rushed, she wanted to escape the media's so she decided to make a new album. Many of the songs got a lack of a good hook and Whitney's normal vocal power is not there. Hit single \\"whatchulockigat\\" is one example of a dull song. There's a cover of \\"You Light Up My Light\\" which will soon be forgotten and \\"Things you say\\" a Missy Elliot written song. \\"My love\\" is a duet with husbund Bobby Brown, i've heard better work them both, Bobby Brown that used to be so good back in the day. There are 3 Babyface songs though which are ok, and \\" One of Those days\\" is probably the album's highlight. But apart from that, his album is quite weak, When Whitney decided to make a studio album we certainly have higher expectations then this. This album is more or less about \\"leaving her alone\\" then giving us fans a nice xmas present."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now it is time for me to speak","review":"this album is awesome and it really puts you in the zone because i can understand where she is coming from and she is being real and i was never a big fan of Whitney's and let me tell you i love this albums better than all the album's that she has ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better luck next time","review":"Whitney....Whitney overall I have always been a fan of Whitney, but lately I have been so disappointed with her music. Whitney if you are out there, I miss you!!! I hope that you bring quality back to your music!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Whitney Rocks","review":"I absolutely love this CD. I think she has captured the essence of the vibes behind the songs. I love the videos for \\"One of those Days\\" and \\"Try It On My Own.\\" This is Whitney doing what Whitney does, rocking the songs. She can still make you feel her emotions as she sings. Whether she is talking about having a hard week, the love she and Bobby share, loving your man period, or telling folks to get out of her business, she rocks it. Some of the songs you just find yourself moving to. I ain't got nothing but love for Whitney."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job Whitney!","review":"I was very pleased with Whitney's latest work. It's more upbeat and clearly more leaned to an R&B flavor and less Pop which is great in my opinion. Go Whitney!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album!","review":"Highly recommand this new Album of Whitney! It's great to hear in any way! I like the sound of the music, no song is for skipping away. I can hear it over and over again. I can't understand people who tell that it is not good!Whitney sounds great in all the songs. There are serveral tracks, who can be a smash on the charts. I'll hope it for Whitney, that she will have a huge success with this new CD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LIKE IT","review":"Altougth \\"Just Whitney\\" is not as good in vocal arobics as her previous albums, the lyrics are strong and she conveys want she is taking about well. The one songs that she really shows some of the strength she used to utilize is \\"You Light Up My Life\\". A good album, however the vocals could and should be stronger. I also recommend : Thelma Houston- \\"Best Of\\"(Import)\\", Nayobe-\\"Please Don't Go\\" and Robin S.-\\"From Now On\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Whitney, wonderful album","review":"\\"Just Whitney\\" is simply a wonderful album. Beautiful songs as \\"On My Own\\" and \\"You Light Up My Light\\", great duet with Bobby Brown (\\"My Love\\"), every song could be a hit!!Very Very recommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to it twice","review":"Give this album a second listen. I hated it when I heard the first 6 tracks. Dear John was the song that spoke to me. Then I heard unashamed and realized where she was going. Whitney is sharing her heart and soul with us. She is not trying to mesmorize us with vocal exercises she is telling her story. I decided to listen to it a second time and I love this album. She is doing more here to let us know who she is and I for one appreciate that. I actually think the album vesion of Whatchulookinat is better than the Thunderpuss version. I am getting the full intention mix next. Buy this CD it is really inexpensive right now (because not everyone is aware of its true potential) it will get more expensive when the other singles are released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mercifully, it clocks in at less than forty minutes!","review":"I kept waiting for the SONG that would make this a worthwhile purchase, but it never came. A fellow Amazon.com reviewer, of whom I trust immensely, had warned me.Why didn't I listen to him before forking up my hard-earned cash???Maybe, Whitney was trying to play catch up with those \\"come latelies\\" that seem to have dethroned her as one of pop royalty. This mismatch of throwaways is so much beneath her that this album is an embarrassment for all concerned.I mean, if she had even taken the chestnut \\"You Light Up My Life\\" and made it into one of those dance tracks that she does so well, she might have gained another star.And whom is she trying to convince of her devotion to husband Bobby with \\"My Love\\", him or herself?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all....","review":"I love Whitney Houston and picked up her new CD last Friday - quite frankly I thought it stunk....I even played it twice thinking it was me, but I didn't hear one song that I really, really liked."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DIS-APPOINTMENT","review":"Just Whitney should have been called Where's Whitney.In half of the songs you can't even recognize the once famous voice. She's lost it.I used to be a huge Whitney Fan, but this CD was a total disappointment for me.She can't even carry a tune anymore!!!!She offers many fast beat fast singing songs because she knows she can't sing ballads anymore.I saw her live on ABC and she TRIED to sing Jesus Loves Me, where she totally trashed the song with her scratchy voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down...","review":"What had happened to Whitneys strong voice. She couldn't even singe these songs live on Good Morning America last week. Its all the drugs she's been doing, and carzy Booby! She needs help. People Mag. gave this a horrible rating.Mariah Carey's new album, Charmbracelet is the best album out now. Buy Mariah, Whitney didnt do so good this time,maybe next time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um... No.","review":"Im sorry yall, but this CD is weak. Truly I think all the rave reviews are coming from the die hard fans who would stand up and applaud for a bowel movement from this woman. The voice is weak, the music is either overmelodramatic or pseduo-hip. One of those days is a catchy song, simply cuz the samples used are.The CD length was proof that she simply didnt have anything much to say.Try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Terrible!!","review":"Poor Whitney. Can there be a WORST R&B album release in 2002, than Whitney's new cd \\"Just Whitney\\"? The music on here is not only bad, but she acts like that somebody MADE her record this album. She sound so angry about EVERYTHING, that it was a drag to even listen to this cd. But what is worst about this album is its only about 35 minutes with 10 songs. C'mon now, Whitney. We are in an era where artists do at least 14 songs and about one hour worth of music. She needs Clive Davis back in her career because this album is not happening. Pass on this one, for sure!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What do you expect from a title like...Just Whitney Anyway?","review":"I have no problem with this cd or the artist's work it represents. That said, every artist has peaks and valleysin their careers. No one can stay on top forever. Theinterview Whitney did with Diane Sawyer is her business.People get real! When you sign a contract with a recordlabel for 100 mil. you can do what you'd like. She reallydoesn't have to record another album anyway. The big standout track on this one is \\"Tell Me No.\\" You go girl!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whitney's Voice Is Gone","review":"I sampled this cd and couldn't believe what I heard. Whitney's voice has is just.....gone. She can barely hold a note now. It was getting bad on the \\"My Love Is Your Love\\" album but it was tollerable there. But now it's just...terrible. Not only that, there's really no good production on this album. Even if there was, I could take the sound of a cracked out Whitney. I miss the old Whitney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"How sad. Frankly, despite Houston's personal problems, I was quite shocked when I listened to this CD. Whitney's voice is just a shadow of what it used to be. The power and conviction she once possessed are gone. On this very short set, Houston delivers one disappointing performance after another, the worst being the dreadful \\"Whatchalookinat\\". L.A. Reid approved a $100 million dollar contract for her to churn out a piece of crap album like this? No wonder Mr. Reid was recently booted out of Arista. \\"Just Whitney\\" has turned out to be the troubled singer's worst selling album to date. And with good reason. Hopefully, Houston will put the pieces of her life back together before she records another album. \\"Just Whitney\\" is shear torture to listen to and she should not subject the public to another project like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately a dissapointing album!","review":"This is a very dissapointing album that was deservedly dead upon arrival in music stores.The numerous drug escapades, run-ins with the law and other problems have been highly adverse to her career and this newest album simply shows an even clearer example of the decline and fall of a great artist.The music is dry, bland, and narcissistic (Correct my spelling if I'm wrong) and this album just misses the mark on many levels. I'm not saying that this is a terrible record by any means but there's nothing that will grab you on here and I feel very dissapointed for this reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Whitney Not Worth The Money","review":"When I purchased 'Just Whitney' on the day it came out, I had high hopes that it was going to be an album that showcased herself as an incredible vocalist and artist. However, \\"Just Whitney\\" seems not to be an album that truely represents her, but maybe in reality it does. It is a very short album with only two songs that are noteworthy. These songs, One Of Those Days and Try It On My Own, are classic examples of what made her a superstar. However, the rest of the tracks are ordinary, washed up tunes and formula that virtually every artist uses. This album is untimately not worth the while of purchasing, except for the two songs listed above."},{"rating":"1","title":"one word","review":"BORING! nothing original, nothing that stands out, nothing on here that justifies running out and buying this CD....bottom line, SAVE your MONEY! P.S if I could give it 0 stars, I would in a heartbeat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful - Less than 1 star","review":"This is definitely the worst attempt at a comeback I have ever heard. Her voice has had it. As another reviewer said \\"Washed up\\" just about says it all. This is merely a poor attempt to fit in, if you will, with the fresh young r&b talent of today. The TV interview - sickening the way she tried to protect Bobby Brown. She looked out of it. A total waist of time if you buy this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did Whitney go?","review":"I LOVE Whitney Houston. I think they was once the most talented vocalist of all time. She could sing and make the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end.But this CD sounds like Destiny's Child's baby sister singing. Nothing against Destiny's Child.If you're looking for a great comeback CD that makes you think \\"Wow - she's back!\\" buy Charmbracelet instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"She is a HOT MESS!","review":"That is all- if there were o stars, I would give that to her!Don't support an addict!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Her a Break!!","review":"Wow.. I think when this album came out people were so critical because of all the negative things that they were reading and seeing on tv BUT if everyone concentrated on just the \\"MUSIC\\" this is a pretty good album. To me it seemed everyone was so QUICK to just trash it because Whitney and Bobby Brown were the producers. SO WHAT if her voice did not sound the same as it did when she was in her early twenties and yes maybe she could have takened better care of it but despite all of that, her voice was still sounded alot better than so many singers you hear today.

I'd definately recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 1st Whitney Album....","review":"When I bought my first Whitney album, the first week of its release. I was quite proud of my purchase, and looked forward to really getting into her album. With any album it takes time to adjust to it. And, once I passed that stage - I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Unashamed\\", \\"Tell me no\\". Of course, now I enjoy the entire album.What I can say is this in not a traditional Whitney album, meaning its not what ur totally accustomed to. It's a new Whtiney, wiser and a person reaching out/ branching out to her fans, and support base. I encourage whitney fans and supporters/ others to buy this cd to learn, listen to Whitney on her Platinum selling album: Just Whitney! Change is Good...."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE USA NEEDS TO GET A GRIP !!!","review":"I avoided this cd becuz of what i kept hearing.....that her voice is shot and thd songs are poorly written and sung! etc.....i happened to be in the UK over this summer and caught a glipse at the video \\"Whatchalookinat\\" and was impressed!!!! Whitney looked good and the song, clearly slamming those who are HATIN', was a jam!!!!!!!!!!!I purchased the cd and listened!!!! ITS A DAMN GOOD ALBUM. \\"Dear John Letter\\" \\"Tell Me No\\" are some good songs. I love the guitar.....\\"Love that Man\\" is cool, although i am a bit tired of the \\"Love My Man\\" theme. Bobby is cool....i have been a fan since New Edition but i am a biggger Whitney fan. The voice is matured a bit but the cd is a groove and quite better that other cd purchase i have made recently.Buy this cd if u are a fan or not. ITS GOOD!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment!","review":"I'm being nice by giving this two stars. I only like one song on the entire album.

May she rest in peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED...Mediocre Work At Best!!!","review":"Whitney has lost her outstanding voice. The things she has been doing has killed her famous voice that made her a star. The only single on this album worth anything is \\"One of these days\\", thank goodness Nelly remixed it. And the cover of \\"You light up my life\\", is down right awful. I dont like the songs at all, she uses them to tell us what she thinks of her life, and what she thinks is really sad to me. \\"Unashamed of the choices she's made\\"...its laughable. I use to be a great fan of her music, but I just don't know anymore...She has just deteriorated so much, \\"the great voice\\" is gone...I wish her the best of luck. Maybe her next endeavour will be better, but you know, the voice is just not there anymore...so sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Whitney needs help, ya'll!

Try again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money and spare yourself the disappointment","review":"I'm a big Whitney fan and I was really looking forward to this album so when it came today in the mail I couldn't wait to listen - I would have better off listening to the snow melt outside my window.The album is melancholy and does not show any of the depth and range of her voice. It seems like it was put together to just get her out there and show the world despite all her problems she can still sing - Well she failed!!! She would have been better off waiting till she could put some soul and power in her songs. I'm very disappointed in her and for the other reviewers for saying it's a great album - shame on them - this album lacks passion and as a result I will never listen to it again. I'm going to put one of her other GREAT CD's instead. Sorry Whitney, this wasn't even a good attempt..."},{"rating":"1","title":"well, maybe the next one will be better....","review":"I can easily say that vocally this is Whitney's worst album ever. It sounds a lot like \\"My Love is Your Love\\" with all the hits taken off that album. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Whitney fan, but there's definitely something missing from this set. I hoped that after listening to it a few times it would grow on me a little more, and it has, but not enough for me to be glad I got it. The songs range from sounding fake (\\"Try it on my own\\") to being extremely cheesy (\\"My Love\\" \\"Whatchulookinat\\" and \\"Unashamed\\") to just plain unnecessary (\\"You Light Up My Life\\"). The only good points are \\"One of Those Days\\" and \\"Tell me no.\\" The former finds Houston sounding her best in a laid-back r&b groove. The latter, though definitely lacking in vocal quality, comes closest to sounding like a true Whitney anthem."},{"rating":"1","title":"An all new low for whitney","review":"What the hell went wrong Whitney? dont you even try to use your voice anymore I mean this is just plain pathetic I only bought it because I have all of her other albums.

But the question is where's it gone?I don't want to get into her personal life, thats her affair, but when she spends an entire album trying to justify her personal choices it becomes very bizzare and a little sad.co-produced by her partner in crime bobby brown, with tracks written by babyface and missy elliot amongst others its a patchy affair. 'tell me no' is a fabulous rant with a slammin gitaur lick but thats about all I liked. her voice sounds ravaged at times, and has lost the gorgeous purity that set it apart. now she just sounds like every other belter and i can't tell you how sad it was to realise that.i hope she packs up the ciggies (and whatever else!) soon and sorts her voice out, theres no reason she couldn't, but then again as she sais in 'tell me no' she'll always do it her way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's be Honest... This is a sub par album... Don't Lie","review":"I have listened to this album atleast five times and with each listen I become more dissapointed. I think it is noble for fans to be noble, but individuals have actually submitted five star reviews. If this is five stars, what seperates her earlier work. The albums where she actually sang with emotion and vocal control. First, the album is too short. Second, Whitney shows some disdain fro her fan base by releasing such sub par material. Third, how could Arista allow her to release such an album given their faltering marketshare and her excessive contract. Fourth, just as the recent television interview and Whitney's continued criticism of the media... putting out an album less than worthy of the plastic it was printed on shows that Whitney needs to realize that her celebrity is fading and consumers have other choices... i.e. Deborah Cox, Kelly Price, Fiath Evans, .. and she is no longer the only one holding a Diva can sing card these days...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should I buy, or should I not?","review":"I am a long time fan of Whitney Houston and there was once upon a time when I would buy her music just because it was Whitney. Now I am very hesitant about purchasing ANY of her music because the one single I heard on the radio did not sound good at all to me. The reviews I have read have helped me alot in reference to purchasing her c.d. I would advise anyone who is thinking about purchasing her c.d. to listen to it first before you purchase it. It is so sad that Whitney Houston seemed to have lost the talent that the Good Lord gave her to drugs. She was once a classy lady and now she is hooked on drugs. I too saw her on the Diane Sawyer show on ABC. Not only did she seem to have been high on something, Bobby looked VERY HIGH. I hope one day soon she comes to her senses, leave Bobby and let go of the drugs and be a real mother to Bobbi Christina. Whitney I am begging you to please get help before it's too late.Be Blessed.DD"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Fall for Whitney: Commercial Fluff","review":"Whitney Houston arguably has the most beautiful and capable vocal range of any female in the last 2 decades, but sadly this album disgraces her talent. After a suprise comeback with great songs like \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" and \\"My Love Is Your Love\\" on her stellar previous album, this album reflects her lack of focus on both vocals and artistry. None of the songs challenge the talents of her voice at all, nor do they even make you want to dance. The songs are empty and lifeless, devoid of emotion. Perhaps personal problems in her life have taken a toll. Suprising that many other reviewers here on Amazon just can't grasp what a failure she has produced in relation to her skill.

I believe in growth, and experimenting with new ideas, but the vocals are not there.I would have been satisfied if you put out a CD of remakes, using your powerhouse vocals. Whitney has a unique way of adding pizzazz to older songs to make them her own. Although there is a cover of You Light Up My Life, it lacks gusto and emotion. Come on Whitney get it back together, I am still a fan, and will always be one. However, please select better material for your next release and realize that you are not in the same age group as Britney and the likes.

Her recent (and laughable) interview with Diane Sawyer did not help matters. Her comment that she makes way too much money to use crack was pathetic.It is truly sad to see such a talented person throw her \\"God-given gifts\\" into the garbage. I love these people who give praise and acknowledgement to God for their talent, and then proceed to ruin and/or jeopardize it with their lifestyle. It is hypocrisy at its worst.Whitney, if you are so \\"anti-media\\" and want people to leave you alone, then clean up your life and get on with it. Otherwise, do us all a favor and just retire and go away to a quiet place where you can count your millions. Contrary to what you may think, you do not qualify as a \\"diva\\"; so stop acting like one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"I didn't expect this to be a good album. After all, Whitney has been receiving constant bad press, and her recent live performances have been lacking (the voice has often been hoarse and cracking).But I'm glad to say \\"Just Whitney\\" is actually quite good, with a fine selection of mid-tempo R&B cuts mixed with classic Whitney ballads. That the album is getting mixed reviews only proves that Whitney is at an interesting point in her career: does she go retro and keep singing ballads, or does she try to be a bit more edgy and sing Missy Elliott-style songs? Well, on \\"Just Whitney\\", she does a bit of both and it works.The album is short, but it is concise, and it is a consistent listen, much more so than \\"My Love Is Your Love\\", even if none of the songs will be as popular as \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" or \\"It's Not Right But It's OK\\".\\"Just Whitney\\" will be remembered mostly as one of Whitney's least popular albums, but it is worth checking out. You may enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leave her personal life out of it....focus on the music....","review":"Aside from Whitney's personal drama, this is a very good CD. It doesn't quite have the stamina that her past albums have had, which so brilliantly showcased her awesome vocals & beautiful power ballads; however, overall this is a very good CD. Surprisingly, I really like the remake of \\"You Light of My Life\\". She does a great job performing this song including all the other tracks on Just Whitney. Before I go, I also have to comment on those people who choose to review her personal life rather than her talent & music (just like M.Carey). Leave it alone; nonetheless, I do hope her strong faith in the Almighty God will guide her \\"Through the Rain\\". Whitney, take care of yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an improvement but not her best !","review":"The content of the CD is wonderful. Whitneys range is definitely not what it used to be and probably will not get there again. The producing was solid and the lyrics were wonderful. Whitney still has a strong voice, but those days of hitting and holding the high notes for Whitney is over. This album indicates a new day for Whitney and I enjoyed the music. Let's embrace the change and welcome her back to the business. Welcome back Whitney!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Whitney???","review":"What happened to Whitney's voice??? Her voice now sounds tired and it seems that the vocal damage is permanent. Four years ago, I assumed that her strained voice in MY LOVE IS YOUR LOVE was only temporary issue but I guess it wasn't... Obviously she still has problem with her voice.Better songs in JUST WHITNEY --> ONE OF THOSE DAYS, TELL ME NO, UNASHAMED.The worst songs --> YOU LIGHT UP MY LIFE (the original is much better than this version), TRY IT ON MY OWN (lyrically okay but the musical arrangements sounds flat or cheesy. I almost find this \\"lyrics/music mismatch\\" comical...), DEAR JOHN LETTER (just boring.)If you expect her BODYGUARD voice in JUST WHITNEY, you will be disappointed big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh..What happened!","review":"There is a reason why the first 2 singles off of this album have bombed on the charts (\\"Whatchulookinat\\" peaked at 96 & \\"One of Those Days\\" at 84)--they are BAD! Whitney has a great voice..more so with her past efforts than now...but something is lacking here. It sounds as though these songs are not complete and needed more treatment in the studio and she just can't belt a tune out like she used to be able to. It is a shame that someone with such vocal talent allowed herself to ruin it and is now forced to sing such laughable, lackluster songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queen of the past.","review":"Whitney may had been one of the most important singers in the 80's and 90's with incredible sellings and hits like \\"I'll always love\\", \\"I wanna know\\" or her latest hits from 1999 \\"My love is your love\\" and \\"Heartbreak hotel\\". But this latest work is nothing compared with her past works. The album has good songs like \\"One of those days\\" or \\"Whatulookinat\\" but the rest in not good at all.This is the first time that Bobby Brown takes credits in one of her albums and the answer is not good.As an example I can say that not only in the taste of her public but in the charts the album went nowhere it debuted at #9 but dropped very fast, it only recived Platinum status which is good for any singer but if we compare her charting and selling history we can say that this album hasn't been a hit at all.It seams that wen singers sign a new record deal they get nerviuos or just don't work as hard as they did, because we have 2 examples of that, Mariah and Whitney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Washed Up","review":"Whitney used to have an elegance about her and her music. Used to. Now she sounds like any other over-produced \\"artist:\\" generic lyrics, a sound that's hardly original, and basically no warmth whatsoever. This is so bad that not only did I not buy the album, but I deleted the MP3s I downloaded of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whitney at her best!","review":"I would have to say I am extremely happy with this purchase! I recommend it to everyone! She is back to her old days on songs like On My Own. She is in her new days with the old school cuts: Things You Say and My Love. And then there are the hopeful single worthy songs Unashamed and Tell Me No. And the single One Of Those Days.You better not \\"Tell Me No\\" when thinking about buying this album...."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Do You Get ....","review":"When you mix a shrewd, druggie who has serious marital problems with a wannabe gospel singer who sings such songs as Jesus Loves Me? Whitney Houston. A singer, once adored, who hasn't made a good album since the 80's. If it wasn't for her stellar voice, she would have gotten zero stars from me. Sorry if my review makes people angry, but the girl has seriously lost it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just......AWFUL!","review":"This is the best she could come up with for her 100 million dollar contract!?! Her voice is all scratchy (probably the effects of her admitted drug use). Her songs are dated. Didn't Leann Rimes just remake \\"You Light Up My Life\\" a couple of years ago? (and did it better I might add)This album is better than the 1 star Mariah Carey album Charmbracelet; therefore I gave it 2 stars. There are at least two good songs on this one. \\"Tell Me No\\" and \\"On My Own\\" come the closest to sounding like classic Whitney, but that's the problem...Classic Whitney is tired and dated now. Mariah and Whitney have a problem. Unlike Madonna, they don't have the brains to re-invent their sound and this will be their downfall. If all you do is brag about your vocal ability, you better take care of that voice because you are nothing without it. Such is the case with Whitney."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE IS THE BEST WHITNEY I HEARD IN A WHILE","review":"Great cd, all the right lyircs and the song Tell me no is the best when she says iam reaching for my dreams and yall so quick to say what i can't do ,tell me no and I'll show U I can , Love that man is the whitney from the 80s pop its funky and pop 80's and the smooth groove one of those days,the funky Watchlookinat song, the ballads Try it on my own and You light up my life are awsome,the r&b song Uashamed and Things you say are good too, My love is awsome love track and the classic style Dear john letter is great,boy this cd rules,despite all what she has been trough or done whitney has not lost a beat ,she back and she here to stay.THE CD IS GREATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whitney's back..","review":"Whitney's newest and long overdue cd ROCKS. Her voice is as clear and strong as ever. I bought Charmbracelet this past weekend and was SO disappointed that i gave it away today...This cd is the best of 2002...."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Tell me no\\" and \\"Try it on my own\\"","review":"Whitney has proven that she still got it. Her soulful voice reminds me of the Whitney I used to know. Two of the songs I could truly relate to is \\"Tell Me No\\" and \\"Try It On My Own\\". Whitney clearly expresses herself in the entire album, however these two songs seem to come from the heart. In \\"Tell Me No\\" she sings of her determination to continue with her music inspite of what others have to say. She sings with the confidence and assurance a woman who is determine to live out her dreams. \\"Try It On My Own\\" shows us the more mature Whitney Houston. Once again she shows her strength and determination to make it inspite of the demands from others, Whitney is determined to make it on her own. The entire album shows strength and courage. Other than the song \\"Whatchulookinat\\",I definitely give the album two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Every Woman","review":"As far as I'm concern, this is one of Whitney's best albums to date. As listeners, we are confronted with a complex, multifacted woman: risk taking and sincere (TRY IT ON MY OWN), sensuous (ONE OF THOSE DAYS), sensual and sexy (THINGS YOU SAY), defiant (WHATCHULOOKINAT), self-realizing and unapologetic (UNASHAMED), passionate (MY LOVE feat. Bobby Brown), reminiscent of days gone by and grateful of what she presently has (LOVE THAT MAN), contemplative and courageous (DEAR JOHN LETTER), formidable and challenging (TELL ME NO), and appreciative of a power greater than anything human (YOU LIGHT UP MY LIFE).If you want the classic Whitney feel, pick up this album!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whitney...","review":"This album falls to the bottom of my list. There's only one song I find a little interested in and that is \\"One Of Those Days\\". It's a somewhat catchy song you can listen to while cruising in your car. But it's not a Whitney song. This album is not a Whitney album in my opinion. She needs to sing with more power and more drama. She needs to bring back those old hit songs that made her famous...\\"Didn't We Almost Have It All\\"...\\"Greatest Love Of All\\"...\\"I Will Always Love You\\"...just to name a few. After all is she trying to compete with younger R&B singers in this album? (Ashanti...Aaliyah...ect.)She used to have her own competition with such artists as \\"Celine Dion\\"...or \\"Mariah Carey\\". I just hope her next album is more Whitney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whitney Houston is now just a has been","review":"This cd is really horrible. Whitney was one of the best singers in the world. I loved her earlier work like \\"i will always love you\\" and the more recent \\"it's not right but it's okay\\". This cd was put together quickly and sadly Whitney has lost the thing that made her great. She is now just an average singer. She needs to leave the incredibly ridiculous Bobby Brown and concentrate on her career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a train wreck.","review":"What words do you use to describe a train wreck such as this. Although there are a couple of decent songs ('Unashamed', 'One of Those Days', 'Try It On My Own'), most are forgettable re-hashed pop/r&b stuff ('My Love', 'Dear John Letter', 'My Love'). Ms. Houston takes a step back from My Love Is Your Love to the early 90s... no good collaborations here... no Faith Evans, no Missy Elliott. The duet with Bobby Brown doesn't even sound like they were in the same room at the same time. And the worst of all is 'You Light Up My Life', a song that should never have been covered. Certainly this is her weakest effort to date. Bad songs, bad arrangements, bad lyrics... just bad all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Unfortunately, Whitney's substance abuse has had a disasterous effect on her voice.Her voice sounds strained, hoarse,under-powered and in no way resembles her once powerfully glorious instrument. You can hear better singing at any Baptist Church on any given Sunday!This is a tragedy of epic proportions. The tracks that I listened to almost brought me to tears. It is a cautionary tale of what addiction and self-indulgence can do to the voice...to the soul.However, this is an old story...Billie Holliday, Anita O'Day (among others) come to mind.It reminds me of what a miracle Chaka Khan is(She still has her voice)...maybe heroin is less destructive to the vocal mechanism than crack cocaine.Again, this is a sad day for those of us who loved and admired the talent of Whitney Houston."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS C.D SUCKS D I C K","review":"Ok, what the hell. How can some one bare to listen to this cd with out laughing? The whole c.d is just HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, AND ONCE AGIAN....HORRIBLE.

Her voice is amazing. However, her latest work Just Whitney is not very good. Her tone has deepened dramatically. There are no more ballads that have meaning in her work. The overall album seems unfinished. These songs don't seem to match Whitney's vocal abilities. Yes, I know she has some issues right now, but it seems as though she is trying to go more urban and steer away from the adult contemporary music. However, that is what she is known for. This album is a HUGE let down to me. Even the ballads are mediocre. What is happening to you Whitney? Why did ARISTA allow you to come out with this album? ALl eyes are on you at this time but yet you come back with material that fit a teenager like ASHANTI or MONICA. Please come back with the DIVA worthy material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her voice sounds great","review":"Bought the CD this morning and listened to it - it is great - her voice sounds A M A Z I N G!All the nonsense you hear about her \\"losing it\\" and being \\"washed up\\" is garbage - she sounds great, the CD is great - a MUST BUY!I'm ordering 2 more for gifts.(her remake of You Light Up My Life is pretty amazing, by the way)"},{"rating":"2","title":"just whitney gives it her all","review":"As u know we all grow older. Whitneys voice is deeper in register and at first was taken back by her vocals on \\"tell me no\\" aswell as u lite up my life and \\"try it on my own\\".but these songs work well with her new deeper voice . She sings from the heart and her range is great. All the songs have real meaning and u learn from them where she is right now in her life.She seems to be happy with Bobby on \\"mylove\\" in \\"my love is your love\\" she seemed to be having some problems in her marriage with \\"its not right but its ok\\" heartbreak hotel \\"i learn from the best.but in her new cd she has refound her love.

The fact that it has a volume control is a plus. The unit gives the impression of being very delicate, even flimsy. The clip that secures the metronome to the ear is so flexible that it comes off very easily. The buttons are positioned such that it's difficult to handle the metronome without accidentally changing the settings or turning it off. The beat sound is a rather annoying chirp rather than a solid click. Price is high for what you get. I would have given it three stars if the first one I bought hadn't been essentially DOA, but since it was, I am giving it two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes I'm biased and yes it's good!","review":"First off I must admit to some major bias as the author is my father. That said, I have to say that this book is both entertaining as well as a very useful guide and reference if you're planning to hike the A.T. The book has a engaging, highly readable style and the chapters are well organized and informative.Some of the chapters I found most useful in actually preparing for a hike are Ch.9 Lightweight Backpacking, Ch 12.

Found this replacement on Amazon. Brand new. Outstanding! Even got it early. Charged it. Inserted sim card. Right from the get go started messing up. Losing calls(in and out). Losing messages like crazy. And this comes at a very small point in time when I have to be in touch with an elderly family member, otherwise it wouldn't be so important.

I have ceramic magnets that CAN lift that much weight, but they are much larger.After receiving two of these magnets, I tested both of them on a small, solid steel, 10 lb. anvil. They would not lift the anvil off the ground. Then I tried several other steel objects that weighed LESS than 10 lbs. I finally got it to lift a 6 lb. object.Be warned.

It is way too vague for someone who has never used a dovetail jig before. I mean sure I figured it out but the manual was kinda a fill in the blanks puzzle. It took some messing around to figure out what in the world it was trying to tell me. After you get passed that it is a great item! It is really too bad that Porter Cable did not take more time with the manual and make it so dumb guys like me could figure it out a little easier!The only other thing that is kinda a negative is the bits, I have so far not found any in my area and have not found that many online either, but I am sure as time passes they will show up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed - Does not live up to the other golwing reviews","review":"It's o.k. but the instructions need a lot of help.

I don't know who is developing manuals these days but this one is not for the guy that's new to dovetails. If this is a first time jig for you get a KELLER JIG, the video shows how simple this can be done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"I love making different types of joints for my projects. I'd always wanted to use half blind dovetails on drawers, saw the 4212 did that and a lot more. It was delivered (free) in 2 or 3 days after ordering, It took a couple hours to read the instructions, set it up and start cutting. I'm just a weekender that likes to make sawdust, but the 4212 was just what I needed. One minor problem is availability of replacement dovetail bits. I'm sure when this jig gets a little more widespread, the bits will too. Great tool, I'll give it 5 stars when bits are more available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really happy with this Porter-Cable Product.","review":"This should be simple to use but there is something either wrong with mine or the design of it.

It is easy to use and Goof Proof.I find that slower is better and the cuts come out looking better.I would not recommend for cutting plywood. It shatters even if you go slow.I make my cabinets from laminated pine.This is a super nice jig."},{"rating":"2","title":"PC Dovetail Jig","review":"Item arrived promtly from Amazon.

The left offset guide used to make the half-blind dovetails is made by bending a piece of metal in a brake press. My offset guide was not bent square, which caused a lot of alignment problems with the pin board and tail board. Being this offset guide is so critical with alignment between the pin board and the tail board, I would not recommend this product. I hope I can find an after market offset guide to remedy this problem. I am trying to contact Porter Cable in hopes of a solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was expected","review":"The jig is on its way back to Amazon! Looked nice outside of the box...first I tried a trough dovetail, after 45 min of adjustments finally was able to cut a decent one.Next tried a half blind one...first I noticed that the template was warped about 1/32\\", second adjusting the template took about 8 hrs.! finally again was able to cut a decent joint but not perfect.Next I tried a box joint, after two unsuccesful tries, I packed everything and sent it back.Now I will do what I should've done in the first place and look for the best price on a LEIGH D4!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product 5, Poor documentation 2","review":"I am impressed with the dove tail jig. It is robust and a precise tool. Once it is figured out, it is amazing. However, the documentation is poor at best. I had several hours looking reading, watching videos on UTube and the DVD, and still had problems at first. There are three things that I complain about. First the photos are small and poor quality, the second is the sentence structure is hard to read since the put what should be lists in a paragraph form, and most irritating, drawer part A in photo one, is part B in photo two and so on.It is confusing to have part A in your hand and resolve the steps in photo 1, only going to photo 2 the part in your hand is part B. I admit starting with a rabbit half blind was probably not the best place to start. I finally found an expert to come to my shop and we figured it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st DT Jig and quite happy","review":"I must admit that as I read these reviews, I was prepared for some poor instructions and difficult setup.Scanned the instruction and went through a half dozen attempts without clean joints.\\"Read\\" the instructions \\"again\\" :-) and they cleared it all up.3 more test joints to set and correct tightness and I'm cruising.Next month I'll move from blind dovetails for the kitchen drawers to through dovetails for the jig box to hold this beautiful tool.The reason for 4 starts is that nothing is perfect. It does deserve a 4 1/2, though.Happy camper"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality item","review":"Very well made. Excellent instruction manual.

Colson contends that the kingdom of God is within a person. It is not an external means of control exercised by political power. In the Epilogue he cites Winston Churchill's last words, \\"there is no hope.\\" But Colson counters that statement by explaining that spiritual things are not based on the circumstances of this present world.On the other side of the coin, however, Colson presents specific examples throughout history where Christian have actively been involved in politics and government because of their belief in the eternal, unseen kingdom of God within. Having an awareness of things eternal, while contributing in this life is the balance he is seeking to describe."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Christian books I have read","review":"This book helped formulate my theology concerning political affairs.

I've done this with other books as well as some of the games the \\"Chess Life\\" columnists illustrate, but I have yet to see a book that literally explains EVERY move until Chernev came along.I found it much better, if not more time-consuming, simply because Chernev does not miss a move.

The owner of a chess bookstore recommended this book highly. I decided to read it and everything in the other books I had read started to make much more sense.Any player who carefully reads this book will increase playing strength by 100-200 rating points within a relatively short period.The opening chapter explaining how to attack the weakened king position is worth it alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Learning","review":"Abundant diagrams in this book allow the reader to follow the games without setting up a chessboard. Most, if not all, other chess books have maybe 2 diagrams per game, and the author evidently expects the reader to be able to follow the game and all of its complicated variations by just reading the notation. For players below master strength, this expectation is unrealistic. Logical Chess, Move by Move, is an enduring classic because it is not over the head of the C player, and the author intends it to teach beginners, not impress other masters.

The suction cup is oversized and appears to be higher quality that the original. The construction appears to be very sturdy and high quality. The only downside is that it's a bulkier and collapsing it takes more steps, this is only an issue if you keep in a small glove box.

So when I wanted to replace my OEM mount for Garmin 205W, I didn't had to think twice to get another one from the Arkon family. But honestly, this one was a let down. As some other reviewers had suggested, the ball size on this product is a bit too small to fit into my OEM holder that goes around my Garmin 205W. As a result of this, whenever I want to enter the coordinates or set the destination on my Garmin 205W, it gives me a hard time as the GPS unit keeps rotating around the small ball of the Arkon holder.

After I moved mine it not only didn't improve the performance, the sensor fell off because the contact surface was no longer sticky enough. It will give you an initial accurate reading of the outdoor temp, but within 15 minutes or so it goes up - a lot. In a cold climate it's absolutely worthless. I wanted to know when the temp was close to or below freezing for obvious safety reasons.

Then I would cut the ends of the board off and keep trying until the board was to short to cut dovetails and I would get another 1 foot board and and start again. I went through about 16 feet when my bit nicked one of the teeth and now the template is ruined and I have to buy a new one at $51 and still can not got it aligned right. The manual is very vague and there is no company video online. I sent an e-mail to the company but they never sent me a reply.

Irving, while taking a break from writing novels, decided to pen a short autobiography, but he brought his usual sense of humor, ability to develop characters, and readable style to the project. The story does an excellent job of explaining the life events and people who have shaped his character and writing, which I think is very useful when trying to understand and appreciate his other books. I think this story itself is some of Irving's best writing and is certainly worth the short time it takes to read.

The core group of Gecko followers will LOVE this release, and those who are new to the Geckos will be delightfully suprised, and will be searching for the Geckos previous releases. Vocals by Evelyne Taylor, especially in \\"Is it True?\\" and \\"Love in the Morning\\", are spectacular. Add to it the fact she also wrote these, and that's some pretty amazing talent! Tim Taylor is the humorous one of the group with his \\"Ballad of Slider Red\\" and \\"Cartoon Music.\\" The newest addition to the Banded Geckos is Grey Howell, and his violin is the crowning touch on \\"Going Home.\\" Overall, one of my favorites ever - catchy tunes, clever lyrics and incredible talent out of this Santa Fe group."},{"rating":"2","title":"a Lean approach to machinery maintenance processes","review":"Provides the insight that as an organization leans its manufacturing processes, it must also address machinery maintenance processes or reliability suffers.

Worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Citizen X","review":"Very good movie. I caught about half of it on broadcast and was so interested that I bought the movie. Reading about the actual case on Wikiepedia and watching the movie (five times), the actors brought to life not only the persuit of the criminal, but the average lives of Soviet citizens during the 1980s and early 1990s.

Like \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" remarkable. I applaud the entire cast and everyone involved in the production. The casting couldn't be any better: Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland, Max von Sydow, Joss Ackland and Jeffrey DeMunn (who just wrapped up a two-season run in an equally memorable role as Dale on AMC TV's \\"The Walking Dead\\" and) who brings to life the eerie and evil Citizen Chikatilo.For fans of true crime thrillers or \\"Criminal Minds\\" or \\"The Walking Dead\\", don't hesitate to order this great film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantabulous","review":"This is a wonderful book!!

You can have a perfectly agonizing hour and half, and just about 45 seconds in, you start to wonder how much more of this you have to endure just so you could say the movie absolutely sucked. The story is horrible, acting is horrible, set is horrible, and for an action movie, the action is horrible, too. Only redeeming quality is what seems to be a pretty cool looking belt buckle that Kenshiro is wearing. I'm seriously amused that someone bothered to do this and present it to the world, but then the world is full of crap.

'Beauty From Pain', 'Anthem', and 'Pure' are some of the better songs on the album.The music is really geared for teenagers and young adults. It is especially appealing for young girls. This is good, clean rock with a positive message. A couple of the issues that are addressed in their songs are bad relationships and eating disorders.

You learn to live day by day. That kind of became our family's mantra and when I heard \\"We Live,\\" I was stunned because it sums up exactly the sentiment that had been learning to live by.So I think this album is great for people dealing with hardships, teenage girls in particular.

Inappropriately titled and classified. Should be called something like \\"Funny Urban Legends for the Modern Male\\" or some such crap and classified as fiction. I give it 2 stars because it's a great collection of tall tales and it made me remember some of my own silly stories. As for his website, great job at compiling a good collection of stories that we've all heard but usually in the form of \\"my cousin's best friend's brother goes to [insert school] and said [insert Tucker Max story] happened [insert time] ago.\\" I've been in the army 13 years and guess what, pieces of his stories I've told a decade or so ago. As for the rest of his stories, I've heard from buddies and sometimes the ones I heard before Tucker Max, were funnier. Overall, Tucker should pat himself on the back for putting together this comedic book of myths and legends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loads of Laughs","review":"This book was HILARIOUS! I couldn't stop laughing. If you like drunken stories, than this is the book for you. If your'e easily offended steer clear. There are plenty of times when Tucker brings a girl back to his apartment and the hanky panky happens. If that would bother you, don't buy the book. Otherwise, you should find it really funny. There were times when I had to stop reading I was laughing so hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome piece of literature","review":"This book has some very funny stories. Anyone who drinks can definitely relate. I know I have been in some similar situations. There is more too the book than college drinking stories though. Max wrote most of the stories a few years after they happened and you can see how he developes as a person by the way he comments when narrates, however, this is not for sensitive people by any means. Totally worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucked","review":"All the hype and the good reviews of this book made me buy it. Golly, it was horrible, crude, stupid and rude. Boy, do I want my money back and the time it took to read the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An instant classic","review":"I bought this book in the airport on a two hour layover in Salt Lake City (I can't believe they sold this book in the Mormon capital). I couldnt put it down. It was one of those books that tells a story that you wish you could live. Tucker Max has lived the Great American Male Dream. It's exactly what you expect it to be from the minute you read the first page. All American males between the ages of 18 and 30 should read it to realize how great life could be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wild lifestyle in Puritan America?","review":"- What an irony. But anyway, although all these drunk vomit stories can get a bit tedious at times, overall the book is not bad. Unlike similar ones about \\"random romp experiences\\" (e.g. \\"The Game\\" by Neil Strauss), this one is short and didn't tire me at all, you can breeze through it and and have lots of laughs. I guess on a more serious note, I like this book for its insights about women, which are very true and useful to keep in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are we promoting?","review":"Would someone please explain why you are helping this guy by buying his books? Seems to me you are not only paying for but also serving him his beer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This book is so bad that it's hardly worth the time to write this. Yet, I feel a sense of responsibility to try and prevent at least one person from this torture. The publisher should have held on to the good title and saved it for a real book. This book is not even remotely funny nor does it have a point. It is a bunch of stories no different from those of any group of obnoxious friends who do things just so they can later tell their friends about how 'crazy' they are. I'm also afraid that this book may incorrectly create the impression that all guys are like this to whatever degree. I can only assume that this guy also came up with the slogan 'what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas'. Nice job genius!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self absorbed","review":"Okay, there is some humor in the book, and it is a page turner, but really, it gets old reading about this guy. He admits right out front that he is a jerk. You read the book and in the end you admit that he is a jerk. If you want a quick, light read give it a try. If you want to save yourself a few dollars and a few hours, just accept the fact that he is a jerk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.","review":"If you have never seen Tucker's site, this book will probably be really entertaining. If you have read his stories on his site, you have read over half of this book. [...]Also, his stories are fairly entertaining if you are college-aged or below, but adults that have led fuller lives will probably not appreciate the plot of his stories, but he does have a great writing style. Hopefully, his next book will contain original material."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book sucks","review":"If you want to read page after page of some self inflated drunken jerk who degrades women to an all time low then you might enjoy this book. personally i thought after the first two tales of his drunkin, vomiting, screwing, that this was pretty boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I ever read","review":"I laughed all the way through this book.

I was pretty indifferent to the stories; they didn't make me laugh or make me mad. What I couldn't handle was the way the author wrote. While it's clear this guy is proud to be an idiot, the style and grammar in which he wrote likened him to a 9th grader.I just don't know how people could stand to read something so badly written! Of course it doesn't help that the guy is a joke... but maybe that's the point?It was just stupid all the way around. If you want to read something then please find a book that makes you think, even if it's just a little bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not the misogyny; it's the boredom","review":"Have you ever been drunk? Have you ever done stupid things with your friends? Have you visited a strip club? Have you ever screwed over somebody?

It IS that boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"insecurity at its finest","review":"As another reviewer stated: crude; yes, stupid; yes, funny; NO, I have to totally agree, this book is far from funny, its obnoxious at times, and tedious to read. Tucker Max boasts about getting laid and making fun of women which is all the book is really about.Dont expect the character to shift his mindset or ever grow up; there is no moral story. Maybe I'm being ridiculous for wanting one out of tucker but it would have made the story more interesting to see this immature insecure guy realize his faults then grow up, but unfortunately that didnt happen. If youre into an insecure guy getting drunk and laid maybe this book is for you, but I didnt find anything about it funny and had to force myself to finish the book which was really a waste of time.I threw it out afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Just disgusting. I have to wonder if some of the stories are factually correct because they seem \\"embellished\\". I enjoy outrageous crazy stories but being female and human with a soul, I really can't find the way Tucker uses, mistreats, insults and disrespects women even remotely funny. Much the same way, a POW survivor might not enjoy reading \\"funny\\" stories from the guards. Sure they have a perspective - but it's not one we should entertain. Tucker is a misogynist. I wonder how many of these women are in therapy thanks to Tucker Max. If you like this humor I would suggest Augustin Bouroughs, or even Ozzy Osbourne's bio was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fra-tire pulp fiction trash","review":"If you hate women and pretty much people, buy this book. Otherwise stay away, as reading it will make you feel dirty and disillusioned with humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"I went into this really wanting to like it. I have read several \\"tell all\\" memoirs that I have laughed harder with every chapter,and grown to like the author more as the book went on. However, in this case, the opposite happened. Tucker is a misogynistic narcissist. I hope you'll read this and save your money. Reading about somoeone who debases women for a living and only loves themself is a trip I'd rather not take. Thank god I didn't pay for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget Max Tucker - I feel like a Max Sucker after spending money on this drivel.","review":"To avoid redundancy from many of the previous reviewers, I'll simply say \\"What a disappointment!\\"While my friends and I could easily go beer for beer and story for story with Mr. Tucker, I can't help but think we would want to pound the snot out of this guy if he hung with us.Save the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to grow up.","review":"I'm pretty disappointed after reading this book. I'm disappointed not just in the book, but also in myself for reading the whole thing. The book contains nothing more than stories of Tucker getting drunk, hooking up with girls, getting drunk, insulting people, and getting drunk. I'm sure many of us have met someone who just can't seem to mature past high school or college. That's this guy, and he thinks he's awesome because of it. Tucker Max should have stuck it out as a lawyer, because he definitely should not be writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst read ever","review":"After reading the first two pages I decided to stop torturing my mind with such inane, stupid and meaningless stuff. This book is a TOTAL TRASH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I decided to read this book after reading Iain Gately'sDrink: A Cultural History of Alcohol, where Mr. Gately quotes a part of \\"I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell\\". After picking this up, I just couldn't believe how poorly Tucker Max writes and how disgusted I was by his exploits. He claims to be repentant for his past behavior, but I truly find that hard to believe.Overall terrible, and I would not recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not very funny","review":"This book was mildly entertaining but not once did I feel like I was going to laugh out loud. It is offensive to those that are offended by frat house stories, if that is you I would stay away from it.

The women that put up with guys like this only have themselves to blame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Tell Anyone I Read This!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Max Tucker is quite a pig...but's he's honest about letting his drinking and sleeping about screw up whatever opportunities he had as an attorney. All the drinking and puking and indiscriminate sex does get tiring but honestly, I laughed a lot. There is nothing to respect in this guy except that he managed to turn excessively bad behavior into a best-selling book. I'm reluctant to recommend this or admit that I read it. Having said that I will have to see the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"mildy entertainng for awhile","review":"I hope they serve been in hell, is a mildly entertaininig book to read, i don't read very often and decided to read this on deployment, for awhile its hilarious, but only because it really brings back stupid things that you did in highschool or college. i give this a 2 star because although ive heard some stories from a third grader that are funnier, some of the stories he talks about are hilarious because i could relate to them. I read this book because i wanted to read about how big of a douche bag this guy really is, and he is a pretty big one, high iq + duke law degree doesnt mean you cant have fun, but should be smart enough to realize when your an alcoholic, this guy gets his kicks off demoralizing woman, and making fun of fat girls. I hope he writes another book on him getting his ass kicked after writing this book, that would be a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets old really fast","review":"This book isn't worth more than a couple of brief comments.

It is poorly written (he went to law school?!) and the 'humor' is so juvenile it is ridiculous. If you are anywhere near a half respectable/decent human being you will find this book revolting. In no way am I a 'prude' (I am actually bordering on a 'dirty old man') and I love a good sex or drunk story as much as the next guy, but even I found this a tough pill to swallow. If you are under 17 years old and enjoy 'toilet' and or misogynistic humor, you may love this book.

Unfortunately, after reading a few of the stories, I was just bored with the whole thing. Ok dude, we get it. You are a bad guy. You like to drink. You have hooked up with some girls. I guess if I had never done any of the above, I would be able to live vicariously through such a book. I even checked out his website and the only thing that I really found funny is the fact that this guy has got to be close to 30 years old and he still hangs out in fraternity houses. It's probably time to move on with your life. I can't believe people are stupid enough to pay for such badly written stories. I guess this was my brother's payback for not getting him a present last year."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fun read.","review":"It's not Hunter S.

The author does not deserve a penny more in profit for bragging about his dysfunction and promoting drunk driving. Perhaps --- If this Tucker Max is a real person---and these stories are real---he'll mature, hopefully someday, and use his love for writing and write a paperback about his extended stay in alcohol and sexual rehab for redemption.Tucker is all about numbing himself from reality through countless wasted sexual encounters, and I don't know how many times he referred to woman as \\"fat\\" or \\"fatty's.\\" I do wonder if all the stories are entirely true. Tucker Max is like the bully on the playground who craves attention---negative attention. Don't buy this paperback, but if you're curious, borrow from the library. I was disgusted by page end. SAVE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Read this With a Conscience YOU Won't Like It","review":"First off, to all those who didn't like the book because it was too college partylife, or this guy adds nothing of substance, or begin to think this brand of humor was not funny, you read a book titled \\"I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell\\". That said, I thought this book was incredibly funny. I couldn't contain myself most times when I was reading it. The cool part is that these were real stories. Tucker Max isn't out to be some profound author, he put this out to make some money off his own hilarity. I'd recommend anyone read this book with the frame of mind that this guy does everything a moral person is conditioned not to do. When reading you find yourself wishing you had the courage to at least go out and experience life they way Tucker Max has. Great book, fun read, and potential Bible to any guy under 30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fitting commentary.","review":"I'm not sure why Amazon removed my first review for this book, but I'll keep this short, just the same. It's fitting commentary on modern western culture to see someone so shamelessly lauded for being a louse, but such is the sad state of our world.At any rate, the stories read poorly, like the transcript of a conversation - it doesn't translate to the written word very well. Typos and clunky sentences abound. One can read much of this on his website for free, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A+++++","review":"This book was hilarious.

And he is so irrevent, so disrespectful you just got to love him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Think When You Read","review":"I wish they would allow me to give this book four and a half stars.While the writing mechanics can be rough at times, but that's the only flaw to be found here. In a way, Max's writing takes Gonzo Journalism to the next level. He not only inserts himself into the story, he makes the reader feel as if he or she is part of the story, right there with his motley crew of miscreants wreaking havoc and mayhem on the world.Max's keen insights into the people, and the into the dark corners of the human mind allow this book to transcend it's humorous genre. Those who read his work and merely think, \\"he's a alcoholic bastard appealing to testosterone-fueled frat boys,\\" really are missing the point.This isn't just a book about getting drunk and getting laid. It's a book about life, and the lessons learned therein. There are great subtleties in Max's writing, and one should read it with an open mind.I wouldn't hesitate to give a copy of this book to my mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING BOOK!! Great stories, good life lessons","review":"I am only 3/4 into this book but it is the best thing i have ever read. Note i dont read alot so it takes something great to keep me interessted. This book is for the college student, or guy that has a story about there best aka worst night ever while drinking, this guys has lived it all and is sharing with everyone. I only wish i can accomplish in life what Tucker has achieved in a few short years. Some of you will say this is stupid, and yes most of the stories make you think what an idiot but they also make you think i remember this one time, and make you smile, cry and laugh so hard you fall on the floor and gasp for air.

The reason that I read that far was to just ensure that there wasn't anything 'more' to the stories. I also recently watched the \\"movie\\" and was reminded of how horrible of a person Max is.The fact that these are 'real' life stories is even more disturbing.I'm by no means a prude but to have the things he did and said to girls.. and just had them lined up to do the same to each one was horrible.Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"D-Bag Stories","review":"Thus book was written by a 9 year old or at least that's about the level of the writing. I would say 90% of these stories are BS. Tucker Max has the face of Michiel Phelps and a dough boy body, I highly doubt he gets decent looking females as often as he speaks of.

I bought it because I guy at work told me that it was hilarious. This book did not once make me laugh, not necessarily because the events chronicled in this book had no comedic value, but because the chronicler has the writing talents that you would expect an overly cocky post-teenaged alcoholic to have.

Wow."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell","review":"You wouldn't think a woman would like this book, since it's filled with more misogyny than you can throw a stick at, but I appreciate the man's honesty.

It is fun to see a guy's perspective on trying to meet chicks and all the other shenanigans Tucker gets into are interesting reads. The first few chapters were so funny I often laughed out loud. Everything is written very well. It's amazing that he seems to recall events so well even though he was intoxicated for a majority of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"I couldn't get past page 50, and I'm no quitter. I couldn't even stick with it figuring it HAD to get better. This guy is anegotistical little twit and if this book was actually on the NY Times bestseller list I fear for the future. Stories aboutvomiting, one nighters and drunken brawls.....wow. Lame. If Max has any brains, why doesn't he use them to go out and dosomething decent instead of bragging about his awful behavior. What was the guy who OK'ed this for publication thinking. I guessif people think they can make a buck they'll do anything. Pathetic. Note to Max: stop while you're ahead. If you dont' havea serious case of something yet, you will. Stay out of my neighborhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"At the most, only mildly entertaining","review":"I was pretty disappointed with the book. It was -at the most- only mildly entertaining at some points. By the end I was pretty bored of his repetitive accounts of getting drunk and getting laid.I consider myself a pretty crass, crude kind of chick. I live with male roommates; it's rare that anything offends me and I'm a huge fan of dirty jokes. I found myself offended not so much in Tucker Max's stories, but at his huge ego and the fact that he lacked respect for anyone but himself. I just thought he was incredibly obnoxious. I could imagine him as one of those loud, drunken thirty or forty year old guys you would see sitting at the corner of a bar desperate for anyone to listen to stories about the outrageous things they used to do.This book was basically written by Tucker Max as a form of bragging rights. It's nothing more than a book of compiled drunken stories you would hear from your college mates. Nothing too original; we've all been there, done that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes funny, potty humor","review":"Read this on vacation after my step-daughter's recommendation. Some of the stories are good but tended to get old after awhile - same story over and over again with different body excrements. It is disturbing that there are that many stupid women who would find Tucker Max attractive, especially after reading his website and wanting to be another one of his \\"stories\\". The most disturbing is that my 16 year old daughter picked this up and read some of it before I had a chance to see it first. But on the other hand, a good lesson for a girl to learn before going to college who won't want to be treated like the dirt Tucker thinks they are and the men/boys who idolize him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God I am not the only one...it sucked","review":"I had heard a lot of good things about this book and just the idea of the book made me excited to read it. I imagined I would be reading some of the most amazing, witty, brilliant party stories ever printed. I hate expectations...they always let me down. Most of the stories could be told by any one of us males who went to college, party, and like girls. Nothing special in this book. And as every one else has mentioned, the writing was poor. I found myself reading Tucker quotations two or three times and then realizing, \\"Oh, that was suppose to be funny.\\" Nothing clever or witty about any of his observations or put downs. Him and his friend's call a girl who wants to be pissed on \\"Princess pee pee\\" Wow, that is hilarious, if your 12.How did we all get tricked into believing this book was unique or good? This lame book gives college kids every where the possibility of being authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Douche","review":"This guy fits right in with the legion of delusional douchbags. The list included fans of ENTOURAGE, Goldman Sachs bankers and now this guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Hilarious","review":"Tucker Max is like that crazy college friend that everybody has that just never grows up. I am not saying thats a bad thing! These stories remind me of situations that I have come across in my life. Not only are they really funny, but they allow me to look back at some of the crazy party and bar escapades I have had and laugh, which now a days is something the we all need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware of extremem laughter","review":"For those with a sense of morals and values, this isn't the book for you.With that being said to everyone else, this is a must by. Tucker Max puts the outrageous stories of his life to paper and has had a success that has created a new genre of books.Although a lot of what you will read may seem hard to believe, the book does its purpose with entertaining us. And a book that does that on a consistent basis is hard to come by.If you are going on a long trip and aren't easily offended by a huge jerk and a manuscript of debauchery, I would say why not. I feel a lot of people should read at least a few stories \\"I Hope the Serve Beer in Hell\\", but before opening it up I give fair warning...you may laugh so hard you hurt yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self absorbed alcoholic , rinse and repeat","review":"The plot involves an alcoholic who is convinced he is entertaining when he is drunk and verbally abusive. He has sex, rinses off and repeats. You read basically the same stuff over and over again. The tedium of his life is a quite a yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected...","review":"I expected a funny story, one that would keep me up because I wanted to reach the conclusion due to it being a great read. Disappointment ensued after those thoughts. This was an awful book, to say the least. It was indeed demeaning to both men and women. The thought of a man sleeping with so many women, even a few in a day, just seems so ridiculously disgusting. Each and every story was the same--Tucker gets drunk, he finds a girl, he somehow manages to sleep with the girl, and then he leaves. End of story. There were few qualities of this book that made it the least bit appealing. It was, however, like a car crash--I couldn't stop staring. Unless you enjoy tasteless prose (prose being a word which may give too much credit to this book), then don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being a college student, this book is hilarious","review":"This is definitely the only book I've ever read and literally laughed out loud multiple times. The book just puts you in a great mood... I can understand that a lot of people can't appreciate his immature nature but just lighten up and take it for what it is. The guy is really funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely funny, slightly offensive","review":"The book is a series of chapter-long short stories, the kind you would likely hear from a frat boy or maybe your boyfriend's single best friend (you know that a**hole). The narrative is tailored to this kind of audience as well, stylistically. The problem is, as much as I wanted to fume and be offended by the slack-jawed low-brow sexist musings of a law school graduate-gone-writer, I couldn't help but laugh out loud. The stories are funny as hell. The situations are incredulous, cringe-worthy in awkwardness, and probably inflated, but all the same they're entertaining and memorable. It certainly isn't the kind of book that deserves high-brow discourse, but it doesn't purport to be. Overall I think it's a quick light-hearted read for those days when you just feel like being dumb for a few hours of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel tricked","review":"i ordered this book and it came with the movie cover! i wish i had been warned. now im some loser walking around with a movie cover book. I feel played. im going to keep it cause im too lazy to return it, just know that im upset. Will i buy from them again? yeah sure, why not? but i wont be happy doing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny enough to be worthwhile","review":"What was I thinking? I like college stories, too, but this book is a series of the most ridiculous college stories about bodily fluids you've ever heard, mixed with some disrespect for modern grammar rules and a few spelling errors. I laughed a couple of times, but not enough to make this sad anthology of Max's ridiculous conquests worth the trouble. When Tucker sleeps with a girl with an IQ over 50 and has her proofread the story, maybe I'll read that, but I think I'm safe for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seen it, read it, bored by it...","review":"I was anticipating a laugh out loud romp through sexual awkwardness driven by alcohol or immaturity. What I found was definately immaturely and poorly written and lacking in every sense of originality. The stories were predictable and, quite frankly, something you see in every sexually comedic movie on the planet. Do not waste your money or good reading time on this over-rated book or his followup for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun at first..","review":"The book is fun at first but after 2 or 3 experiences it gets boring to read about another drunken rave and another sexual encounter. It's just like when you are in a bar with friends living it up. Fun when you experience it boring for others who haven't been there to hear about it more than once.All in all a dissapointing read and I am sorry I spent money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile and offensive","review":"I was disappointed in this book. It seems very juvenile and degrading to women. And the women participating in these \\"scenarios\\" are not the typical woman. What will Tucker Max find to write about as he hopefully matures? I didn't even think it was well written. Just found a few humorous, non offensive statements or excerpts...otherwise thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a read","review":"I dont really care to read. I was in AK on a business trip and a friend was dying laughing while reading a story so he had me read it. I did and, while childish, thought it was amusing. When I returned home I told a friend about it. I was ordering some items from Amazon a couple months later and asked if she wanted me to order anything for her to save shipping and she surprised me by telling me to order the books I told her about. When it came in I read it and thought most of the stories were actually quite funny. It took me 3 months to read a real 400pg book but I read this 330pg book in 4 days. I agree he is a douche and I personally couldnt act that way but it was still funny and I actually laughed out loud several times. I will say I found Slingblade to be the funnier of the characters, probably because he mirrors my own thoughts quite well. I can't guarantee women will be as amused by the stories but I would still recommend reading it for things to watch out for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Amazing book! Some of the stories in this book are mind blowing. It's nice to live vicarious through Tucker, and be able to walk away from the book with your conscience intact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical, Warped - not for the prudish","review":"I grew up with lots of friends, guys and girls, and I know people like this. Tucker Max may be a little more extreme as he says it out loud, but he makes being a \\"male whore\\" funny and provides insight if you haven't been friends with guys like him. Don't read it if you take life too seriously because you'll miss the humor and just be offended. It's a quick read and a good laugh, but watch out for a couple of disgusting episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"HI-LARIOUS-NOT FOR THE RESERVED","review":"HILARIOUS BOOK. Loved it so much, I read it one 1 roundtrip plane ride. I also gave it to my husband to read and he did the same. This book is for those who dont mind a story about a 20 something who does terrible things to girls, gets away with everything and really lives life recklessly. You won't get anything from this book except entertainment....fun but reckless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Slightly degrading, but hilarious nonetheless. Laughed the whole time I read it, and afterword thanked God that my moral standards are SLIGHTLY higher than the respective author's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Everything you have heard about this book is true. Its a shameless account of drunken debauchery and using women like they are toys. Its sick, twisted, perverted. It is brilliant and amazing. Tucker Max tells several short stories about his life. Not about his childhood, or his emotions, or work and school. About going out with his friends. About getting drunk. About hooking up.I bought this book at LAX and by the time i landed in ATL i was done. I called my brother, my mother, everyone and anyone. I told them to go buy this book. I am telling you to buy this book. If you know how to have fun and are not uppity you will love this book too.And Tucker seems like a pretty cool dude. I dont get the hate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was an interesting read while doing the bike a the gym","review":"This was my entertainment when I was working out on the bike and elliptical machine at the gym. It is entertaining, but this treats people like crap, yet I want to read more? Dunno, it was entertaining, so I guess I give it a positive review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tucker Max is a god","review":"This is ranked right under the bible for me. I always use to tell my friends random stories bout getting the B-I-T-NESS but Tucker blew every story away with even his lamest ones, this is a must read book. i read it 3 times over my deployment in Iraq and every time it took me away from the whole war thing"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have a sense of humor and can lighten up, YOU WILL LOVE IT","review":"I have seen multiple reviews with people condemning this book as being too narrow or too repetitive, however anyone who reads Tucker Max knows that this is just how he is. John Grisham writes about law, Stephen King about horror, and Tucker Max about sex and alcohol. Thats just how it is.You don't have to be like Tucker to find his work funny. He is, self admittedly, a despicable human being who only thinks about himself. But his stories will make you laugh out loud!Would I recommend this for my mom? No. But I sure as heck have told all of my friends about it, as my book has already been passed around like a freshman sorority girl \\"trying to adapt to college\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hear Enough Drinking Stories in Real Life","review":"If you like reading about drunk people vomiting out their noses, this book is for you. I did not find anything redeemable about it. There is nothing lovable or interesting about these drunks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Waste Your Time/Money","review":"I have read some of Tuckers stories,they are available online. Recently, I borrowed this book, only to find out it is more of the same! Its basically the same drunken,wild,smart-ass frat-boy antics,embellished and put in print.His ability to write is mediocre at best,and the \\"wild and crazy\\" stories grow tedious.If you really love the stories on his site,and(ideally)have a below average IQ,then this book is right up your alley.I cant believe this made the NY Times bestseller list(albeit #30,or so),and that its getting such great reviews here. It must be all the brownnosing groupies from the Tucker Max messageboard.Some 'well read' fans have compared him to Hunter S Thompson, or even more laughably, Charles Bukowski. Its hard to believe they were able to put down the crackpipe long enough to finish Tuckers book, much less read a novel by Bukowski.Never underestimate the stupidity of people.Spend your cash on something worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I had read a few pages in the bookstore and found it funny. But when I got the book and began to read, it was just one tale after another of really disgusting and destructive behavior.Sure there are a couple amusing stories, but for the most part, not too many redeeming qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny","review":"I'd heard this was a really funny book, so, when it came up on Amazon Prime, I borrowed it. I made it 3 or 4 chapters in before I couldn't read any more. It may be funny to some people, but to me it's just a jerk talking about stupid things he did in college. Not only that, most of it involves objectifying women to the point that they're not worth talking to if you can't have sex with them. Who knows, maybe in the end he figures things out, and isn't such a jacka$$, but I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"this is so gross. oh my god. so bad. my parents took the book off me and put it in the garbage. i don't blame them for taking it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is horrible","review":"As a writer of fictional literature, I must say that Tucker Max is boring and cannot write to save his life. Duke must have lowered the bar when this guy was accepted! I cannot believe the publishing industry would even publish this crap because there are so many good writers out there that deserve the media attention that this loser is getting! If I wanted to read something shocking, original and literary, I would just open up a chuck palahniuk book and call it a day. I just can't believe that people blindly give him money for this crap and keep fueling his fire. That says a lot about how moronic our society really is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you dig crazy, depraved, and often times vulgar humor-then this is the book for you.","review":"Most people would probabley find Tucker Max's antics as described in this book offensive. But if you are an a-hole like me you wil find him and his stories funny as hell. I laughed my butt off reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, Really BAD.","review":"I, too, have written about 4 different negative reviews on this book over the last year and all of them have been deleted for some reason.I dont appreciate it because if you dont want an honest opinion, then dont allow people to review books here anymore.I found this book at a thrift store and thought it might be a funny read. Having never heard of this person, I didnt get past the first couple of chapters before I realized that this was basically a cry for attention from the \\"author\\".What this book boils down to is a *very* poorly written, juvenile account of someone with low self esteem making a fool of himself. The grammatical errors are atrocious as are the choppy sentences and poor paragraph structure.I didnt find it funny, well-written, or in the least bit entertaining. I found it to be a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Waste of Time","review":"Recommended by a friend that I will never again trust, I quit on this book half-way through. It is utterly pointless garbage. What is most offensive about it is that it isn't even well-written. This guy sounds like a frat-boy braggart, and his stories are no more creative than those you might overhear in a bar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"A never ending monotony of drinking stories. If you've ever listened to a friend embellishing a drinking story, then you've already read Tucker Max's \\"book\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland, boring and pathetic","review":"Tucker Max simply reinforces the notion that what's really cool when you're 20 becomes really pathetic when you're 30. I threw this book into the trash after a hundred pages because it's nothing but anecdotes about getting drunk interspersed with stories about sex with low-class women and the occasional meditation on fast food or GI Joe toys--and I'm a party college alumnus. At least the similar behavior depicted inThe Real Animal House: The Awesomely Depraved Saga of the Fraternity That Inspired the Movieis couched by the fact it's being done by teenagers in an isolated New Hampshire college in the early 1960s.If these stories really interest you, just read them for free from his blog and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Just Isn't Funny","review":"Maybe there is something wrong with me? In any case, if you read one story in the book, you've read them all. It's just not a funny book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rats","review":"I was really hoping for a good read. Just a rich, spoiled brat talking about how he and his bros like to drink, poop and chase equally shallow women.Gee, I hope Tucker's mommy is proud of him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be unreadable for anyone over the age of 13.","review":"I only made it 9 pages in. That's all I could take of Tucker Max. This \\"man\\"-baby is everything that is wrong with a good deal of the men today. He thinks his drunken antics are funny. I think they are sad and pathetic. But hey, I'm just a grown woman, what do I know? Please continue to be an inebriated failure, it suits you well."},{"rating":"1","title":"such a bore...","review":"I had really high hopes of being mindlessly entertained with a witty, hysterical, easy read. Well...didn't happen with this book. It had its high points of laughter early on, but just became totally repetative and absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. We have all lived these tales...done them, and been the recipient as well. But, you don't see most of the world droning on thru endless pages about it. I only made it 75% of the way through...so perhaps it was the end quarter that gave it so many decent reviews?! Save your time, avoid this book. But if you are still looking to get a taste of it, visit a local frat house or dirtbag beer bar instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was returned for a refund","review":"Due to the great reviews,I had to check this book out.WHOOPEE!!Its the same \\"wild n krazy\\" stories told over and over again. Maybe its just me,but it got old real quick.The book isnt half as funny as his fans are saying. Actually what I found most funny were the obvious embellishments/exaggerations to the stories. Another humorous note,is how the protagonists(Tucker and company) seem to think they are so cool,so fun,and toolishly continue to pat themselves on the back for it throughout the whole book.My other complaint is his style of writing leaves a lot of room for improvement. Very mediocre,and defintely not good enough to carry such shallow, anemic material.I dont want to speculate on how/why this book is getting so many rave reviews, but in my opinion, it truly is a one star thats being overrated. In five years,his books will be sitting in basements collecting mold,and people will say,what the hell was I thinking when I bought that??"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is just too hard to read!!!","review":"This book is just too hard to read, every chapter or so my eyes tear up from laughing too hard and I have to put it down. Like right now about when he accidentally shoots his load in his own eye and ends the story with a \\"FU Karma\\" lolI found this book by the F'd up title, then read the review that someone bought this for a friend then returned it because they thought it would have offended them, pansy. So anyways I bought this for my friend, started to read it, and got him a Rubik's cube or something just as lame, oh ya merry Christmas Danny. haha"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who does this fool think he is?","review":"A recent college graduate, I ordered the book in hopes of an easy, entertaining read. A colleague had suggested it, and said that it was written in a \\"voice\\" like mine. I was bored after the first three pages. Actually, maybe the first three paragraphs. I did not live a particularly crazy life during college, but felt that any of my friends could have told me much better stories that would have meant something to me because I knew the characters involved. Tucker, YOU HAD TO BE THERE. SORRY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I got mine in the mail yesterday. This book is hilarious.My favorite story by far is \\"Everybody Has 'That' Friend.\\" I'm sure I'd be terrified and reduced to a bowl of melted jello by SlingBlade in real life, but damn if he doesn't make one of the best characters ever.\\"Welcome to every day of my life\\" at that moment is one of the funniest things I've ever read. Five reads later I still lose it when I read that. I loved this story.There are problems with the book, yes, but still I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious read","review":"In this book, Tucker Max gives us many stories about various events that have occurred in his extremely interesting life. Often hilarious, he draws of some of the stories available on his website, plus many new ones to entertain his readers.Sensitive readers beware: this book is not for you. Tucker's escapades may easily offend.Despite that, however, I found the entire book hilarious, laughing out load many times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"I am of the generation which this should appeal to.

Just did not want it in my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHOCKINGLY GOOD","review":"This book was one I had a hard time putting down. Tucker tells stories that will have you rolling. He is a real jerk, but you cannot help liking the read. If all the things he has done are indeed true, he does need to know if they serve beer in hell. I would recommend this book for someone over the age of 18. I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone has already said this....","review":"BUT this guy is a complete jerk. I know, I know. That's his thing; he says that up front. Sometimes being a jerk and writing about it can be brilliant like Charles Bukowski or David Sedaris. Other times being a jerk is just lame and not funny.

Hopefully someday soon Tucker will get addicted to drugs so we get some junkie stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real story here","review":"This was so disappointing.

Unfortunately, this book seems more a study in misanthropy than a study in humor. I did laugh from time to time, but not nearly as much as I'd hoped. The whole book ended up coming across as dark and sort of depressing to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read in a minute...","review":"I'm not a party loving human being, and I certainly never was. In fact I am a stay at home mother of 2, who has only been intoxicated like 3 times. That being said-this is the best book I think I've ever read. Obviously not for it's intellectual goodness, or educational value. And it's true, I may even have a first class ticket to hell for laughing until it hurt at the insanity that this book lends, but that's not going to stop me from giving copies out as Christmas presents.I have never laughed as hard as I did at numerous stories in this book, and I really could not put it down. There are a lot of things I want to say in this review, but I'm pretty sure Amazon would not be happy.Anyway, read the book, you'll be glad you did, whether it is for the sheer hilarity of it, or the pure disgust.

In the beginning Tucker Max does accomplish this but after a few pages it just becomes repetitive. Mostly everyone who went to college has their share of stories about debauchery. Take Tucker out of his area (ie with Doug in Texas) and everything definitely is out of his league. His tendency for alcohol could become very catastrophic for him in the future. As he gets older, he does become wiser. He finally figured out how some women can be just as ambitious in the sexual realm. But has slipped into being \\"that\\" friend.

Tucker Max belittles them, and finds himself to be some kind of hot shot after he does whatever he wants with girls. I think he is pathetic, and needs to seriously grow up.

Although I think it could have been funny it was not. Too many times the jokes come at the expense of someone elses feelings. Although Tucker tries to write off the way he treated people and his attitude at the time these stories took place as him just being young and immature, this doesnt wash with me. Being young does not give anyone the right to be a complete ass. This book is written by a rich guys kid who thought the world revolved around him and no one else mattered on any level. This kid was a punk and I am glad that he is the exception to the rule. I was no angel when I was at his age, but I was never as mean spirited or self centered as this jerk.

It can be entertaining, if you enjoy the shameless shenanigans of people that are douche to the core. Simply put; the guy is an absolute douche. I had to stop reading, because personally I can't stand guys like him and I felt my own shame in even reading a few pages of his crap. I do enjoy my vulgar humor, but only when it has tact and doesn't come from a scumbag.

Some of his tales of drunken debauchery and sex are amusing, but these themes are repeated so many times that it is almost as redundant, irritating and disgusting as it is amusing. If you like tales of drunkenness, vomiting, sexism, drunk driving, and unprotected sex, this may be the book for you.

Tucker Max is the most engaging writer of our day. Don't let some reviewers convince you that these stories are the embellished drunken ramblings of an over-ripe college boy. The stories are intriguing in the way he recounts events and issues he encounters. But, most of all, they are entertaining and enjoying. Already looking forward to his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"The beginning was a bit funny and he gave him self away in his reaction to energy healing.What I found interesting is how in one chapter this guy brags about hurting and causing a woman bodily injury!(He's probable like a secondary rapist - that is someone who hurts someone who's been raped and thus doesn't know how to take care of herself) Then he acts like a pathetic baby when he suffers a little bit of abrasion and hurt. Okay he gets upset when he gets hurt but brags when he causes someone else pain?! I don't know about you but I think this is pretty pathetic and will not support this guy in contributing any money towards his movie and I'd burn the book. It's really gross. I don't even feel sorry for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only book I have ever thrown out.","review":"This book is the worst book I have ever had the misfortune of owning.

I will admit, the first handful of stories where very funny but I began to see a tend. You read a few stories you've read the whole book. It just becomes a constant cycle of \\"This one time when I was drunk\\" or \\"This one time a slept with this chick and something weird happened\\" or \\"this one time my friends and I had a crazy night on the town\\". As I read I had a feeling that Mr. Max may have indeed had some crazy things happen to him but doesn't take a lot of imagination to just make these stories up. He does have a need to entertain his audience. So I'm calling B.S. If you want a couple of MTV's Jackass type chuckles then this is your book. Otherwise I found it to be a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Try","review":"This book has absolutely no redeeming qualities. It is a waste of time, money, and any effort spent recognizing its existence. I wrote a more detailed review yesterday, but it was promptly deleted by either Amazon or the author. As a result, this review is a little more succint and to the point. The book is worthless drivel--bottom line. I wonder how long this review stays up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny","review":"Really? A best seller? He's just a womanizer with no remorse, no apologies. What a great model for young men... save yourself time and don't read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Book","review":"Greetings,Do not purchase this book. I have no issues with the content of the book; just the poor writing style. The book is so poorly written that I question if an editor was even involved. Much like his life, the writing is equally shallow. I assume the author wanted to replicate the atmosphere one experiences when friends get together at a bar and tell stories. He just fails miserably.I do recommend his blog. His writing style, or lack of, is much better suited for short blog entries. His lack of focus, which plagues his book, is not a problem since the entries tend to be shorter.Overall, I equate this book to watching monkeys throwing feces at each other. It's really funny for the first three minutes but it gets really old really fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously??","review":"The book is a joke. This guy was the \\"cool kid\\" in a school full of, lets be nice, not so cool kids and used that to his advantage when building his \\"reputation\\".

The only thing that he did was write down his stories (I'll give him that). Take this review for what it is worth.."},{"rating":"1","title":"i hope they serve beer in hell","review":"a waste of time and money. i bought this book because the sample was quite funny and the book got good reviews. however, the content quickly deteriorated and was repulsive. it made me sick to think of the people who were mocked and mistreated by the author and his friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillarious!","review":"A very crude, but funny read.

I'm not offended by the subject matter, I just thought the writing was bad and the stories were made-up (not to mention predictable and boring). TM comes of as kind of pathetic -- it seems like he's overcompensating. He really really wants to be the jerk he keeps telling us all that he is, but he just comes off as insecure.

When I don't...no wasting time here. While a \\"best seller\\" and many \\"great\\" reviews, I'm led to believe that Tucker Max has simply gone from bar to bar to get drunk individuals to give him a \\"great\\" review.

I'd go back in time and NOT buy this garbage. IF you like drunken frat boys engaging in homoerotic, misoginistic acts of idiototic drunken debauchery, then, by all means, this is what you want. But if that doesn't sound appealing to you, or you didn't just graduate from college and want to relieve the stupid things you did while partying, then ignore this book. Give no credence to people who recommend it. This book is a disgusting look at various sex acts that should have been left in the \\"author's\\" head and not written down and shared. I can't say enough bad things about this book, I wish there was a negative rating system, I wish I could delete this book from existing in my head. Failing that, I guess I can warn people about it. This is not a feel good, bad boy learns from his mistakes and makes good, just a juvenile look at bodily functions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter BS","review":"I'd gamble that none of this stuff happened. The book starts off as mildly amusing, but after the 50th time of Tucker abusing a bunch of guys in a bar (who miraculously never beat the living daylights out of him), making fun of fat girls (which only makes the hotties want him even more), then taking one home only to have her defecate or vomit (delete as appropriate) on his penis, I got bored and threw the book out. Maybe this is all just satire and a big joke on us, and he no doubt thrives on those people who call him what he is, but don't buy this book and give this moron any money or encouragement to continue his (alleged) activities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I would recommend buying a cheap porn novel then reading this book. Its a collection of stupid stories of Tucker Max being drunk and making out with a bunch of women. His language is derogatory and stories are no doubt made up. I don't know why I purchased it. I sincerely regret buying the book. My money probably could have been put to better use by donating it homeless guy begging for money on streets. To summarize, won't recommend buying it, unless you are addicted to porn."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS","review":"This book is.... not really a book at all. It's a sad bunch of \\"a drunk, waste of a human\\" accounts of a boy who clearly hasn't grown up. We've all had the drunk stories, he's just had too many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frat lit: Here's the entire book:","review":"Tucker Max is a spoiled rich kid. He has a lot of sex and drinks a lot. He doesn't respect women. That said, the writing is punchy, and I laughed out loud two or three times. Ultimately boring and a chore to finish. Life's too short to waste the time reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Cares","review":"Heard this was funny from an acquintance, just a stupid frat boy trying to one up his peers. Waste of time. I feel bad for his body, and for the dumb chics who flock to sleep with him after reading this... Mind blowing that someone would want to degrade themselves in this fashion and most likely come out with the gift that keeps on giving, who knows what STDs this guys is carrying around. Despicable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being a jerk is awesome","review":"I completely loved this book. It's definitely not for the faint of heart or weak stomachs. It is completely raw and in your face. Tucker Max is totally offensive and and not the least bit apologetic about it. But somehow you love him for it. He made me laugh so hard til I couldn't breathe and cover my mouth to keep from busting out laughing in public. You must have a good sense of humor to really enjoy his stories the way they were meant to be. That is without judgment of how terrible a person can be and seeing how awesome that is and how far that actually takes. Apparently, being a complete jerk. Isn't that bad"},{"rating":"2","title":"So funny","review":"This book is so funny! I laughed out loud a majority of the book. This guy is a total ass but he knows it and owns up to it. To those of you who read it then were offended, you knew what you were getting into. Great book. Highly recommended if you want to laugh!

So upset that I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should we rethink free speech?","review":"Offensive, sexist, irresponsible, racist and makes me want to rethink Free Speech!A one-joke book that is unfunny. Are drunks really that funny? Think about the most obnoxious people you know and avoid- welcome to the world of Tucker Max and his friends. Tucker Max has talent for self-promotion. In another era, Tucker Max would be selling cheap suits on late-night television but thanks to the magic of blogging he's a net-hero! A lot of this book is truly cringe-worthy awful and yet you can buy promo gear on his site! Has America gone mad?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This is the biggest piece of crap ever. How this ever became a best seller is mind boggling. Why anyone would publish it is even more mind boggling. There is some poetic justice in the fact that the movie bombed.

If this book was sold as a collection of college myths and legends I might give it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant.","review":"I won't give this two stars for the fact that the author is obviously, what he is. I do not enjoy narcissism, nor do I enjoy around 300 pages of it, unless it is making fun of it, which this book does not do. The stories themselves could have been interesting, had they varied. I found it redundant, and irritating that people actually recommended I read this. After the anal sex story, I just set it down and forgot about it. I do not recommend this book unless you enjoy reading about someone else's sex life, over, and over, and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repedative, poorly written and dull","review":"If you've ever been to a bar, gotten drunk or did something embarrassing or regrettable you've probably got a better story to tell than any that you will find in this book.Basically every short story is the same repetitive crap.Here's the formula.Egotistical jerk gets drunk, has sex with mildly retarded girl, treats people poorly then makes a fool of himself.Now Repeat the above formula 20 times and publish."},{"rating":"2","title":"PURE GENIUS!!","review":"Tucker Max should have a monument erected in his honor!

If that sounds like a fun night out, this might be the book for you! I don't really care how much of its true. I'm sure there is, at the very least, a huge amount of exaggeration, considering the book is coming from someone who proudly calls himself an arrogant @#$hole and drunken buffoon. Would he be above making up a few more details to sell more books? Really though, the whole thing is so lame that its hard to care too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was I thinking?","review":"I bought this book thinking it would give me a humorous look at dating behaviors from the male perspective. What I didn't realize is that this guy is a complete sociopath. Aside from a few chuckles I got from the pure absurdity of a couple of the stories, it was utterly unenjoyable.Sooner than later, this jerk is going to wake up and be a lonely old man, and college freshmen will no longer be inviting him into their dorm rooms. I think he is already about 34, so he is almost knocking on that door. What a painful loser. I am sure by then he will write a book about his long journey towards redemption to atone for the disgusting way he has lived his life thus far.I won't go into any more detail because I was totally disgusted by this book, and I want to forget that I ever read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stab my eyes out and give me back my hour of life I spent reading this.","review":"Bought this for my college age son. Read it first. OMG. This was the most horrifying book I think I've read in ages. Yes, there are occassional laughs, but at whose expense? Why would anyone think it's okay to write about boozing yourself and becoming an idiot? Don't get me wrong, I went to college, and I'll admit, the boozing thing...I did it. But good God, you can't live your whole life in a drunken stupor.Thinking I just didn't get it because I was an adult, I passed this book on to my 21 year old son who laughed a couple of times, then came in and said, \\"Mom, what were you thinking buying me this book? This guy is an idiot.\\"Passed it on to my brother who basically said the same thing. None of us are prudes. None of us have a holier than thou attitude, we just didn't think a whole book of drunken debauchery was funny..sad for Tucker Max's life yes, funny all the way though..no.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Hi, I'd like to start off by saying I am a U.S. Marine and I am also currently deployed to afghanistan. I normally do not write book reviews but in this case the book is of great help. I normally spend my time on daily 3, 4, 5, or even more hour patrols. Whenever I sit down and get break I think to my self why, why the F*** do i do this. Then I read one of the random stories on this book and I forget every single problem I have, because I am to busy laughing my A** off. Well the book is well written and every single story is funny and you might even relate to one of these stories, I know I have. If you like to laugh at other people or like to get together and tell drunken stories with your buddies, then you have a sense of humor like mine and you damn well better read this book. This book is a definte buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is kind of bland","review":"I really would expect more audacious stories from a book with such a clever title, but these stories are just so common - same old, same old college humor. I have heard all of these stories in one form or another from my overweight, working-class friends who are still stuck in their glory days, drinking beer and telling exagerated tales about the women they (allegedly) debouched. C'mon, seriously... If you're going to make up stories about your youth... and publish them in a book... for god's sake be more creative. I gave this book a shot, and after the second chapter I was pissed that the author got a royalty for writing stories that I had already heard a thousand times before. But... you have my money, Tucker, so you win. I give this book two stars because the title was cool enough to make me spend a couple bucks to buy it at the airport"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Inanity","review":"This book is very funny for about 50 pages. Unfortunately its 300 pages long. I got through the entire thing because its like watching a train wreck. After a while Maxs sex and vomit get exposed for what they are...just plain stupid The guy cant even write...better get a decent screenwriter for the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not Enjoy this book","review":"In the final analysis this book wasn't funny or interesting. Kind of a waste of time. The stories are either highly exaggerated or outright fabrications. Frankly, I've heard most of them before so there's nothing new here and nothing memorable in the re-telling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book. But where did my first bad review go??","review":"Why did my bad review disappear? I'm not buying anything off Amazon again if they're censoring the reviews, that's what they're there for. This book is awful, just a bunch of half-true stories with predictable endings. It's pretty easy to think of hilarious dialogue when you have months to think about clever comebacks. I did laugh out loud at several parts of the book, but I rolled my eyes at the book's stupidity many many more times."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written and just plain not funny","review":"This is in fact the third negative review I've written for this book. For some reason they keep on getting deleted. The \\"writing\\" consists of extremely repetitive stories about getting drunk and yada yada. I partied in college plenty but came out with better stories. I agree with another reviewer that if you haven't gotten out much you might find this amusing. Otherwise, it will just put you to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over and over and over...","review":"A book about getting drunk and hooking up. Again and again and again and again. It reminds me of an old National Lampoon story of O.C. and Stiggs. It's funny at first, but becomes monotonous and dull by the third chapter. The book is a lot like a drunk person...entertaining for a few minutes, then just annoying. Bottom line - Read a couple of his tales on his web site and skip the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice job Max","review":"THe man is hilarious, and inspiring. We should all hope to be maxlike and the haters out there are the sort of sad and pathetic people that deserve the mocking that he dishes out in the book and on his website.

While the humor is at times sophomoric, I found myself laughing throughout--sometimes at the comedy of the story, other times in embarrassment as I saw glimpses of my own life. If you've read Chelsea Goldstein's Hook-up ChroniclesHook-Up Chronicles, this book is the male equivalent. Like a circus clown being arrested, or a mime being hit in the face with monkey-flung poo, we'd never admit to enjoying these stories, and yet we just can't help ourselves. There is no way I'd display this book on my shelf, but like other immoral pleasures, I do have a copy of it tucked under my mattress!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique funny (frat style) stories","review":"Hillarious.

Actually, this is not entirely true, the night actually extended into the next morning. At 8:30 am I finished the book and went to bed. I figure that is poetic for this book as the author had many late morning outings while living the stories that make up this book.Overall I thought the book was great for what it is. It isn't a master piece, it isn't a crime novel, it is a funny book written about funny stories. If you want to laugh while reading then read this book. If you want to me be cry from laughing so hard read this book. If you want to cry from a romantic love story that takes your breathe away, then this isn't the book for you.The next day I told all of my friends they need to purchase this book because they will enjoy it too. Telling some of the highlights cause me to laugh so hard they were often times to get out.Simply put, if you are looking for a fast, entertaining, and funny read, then you can't go wrong with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downright hilarious","review":"Stuck in an airport with a flight delay, I ventured to the bookstore to pick up a book for my husband and myself. The gloom and doom of my chosen book was forgotten due to the overwhelming guffaws coming from my husband. I have never heard him laugh so hard. This book, my friends, is just funny. Needless to say, Tucker Max is raunchy, disgusting and an egomaniac, but at the same time you get this feeling that he is superhuman, that he is untouchable and almost godlike. His stories will have you rolling in the aisle, literally!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can't Help But Laugh.....","review":"So, I normally don't write reviews, but this book had me laughing from beginning to finsh. I mean it's so vulgar and derogatory that you can't help but laugh. This book is not for eveyone though. If you don't have a sick sense of humor and an open mind steer clear. I am a FEMALE and although Tucker Max is indeed a egotistical womanizer he's hilarous. His friends are hilarous. Take this book for what it is people.

I have used Steiner 7X50s in the military and other high quality optics, and these little 10x30s beat all the others for my home use.Pro's: (IS) really works. Affordable. Light weight.

The focus knob is very smooth and easily operated by one finger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Design Flaw...Must Always Hold Stabilization Button","review":"Must always hold stabilization button when using the binoculars. This causes your hands to be tense, which increases your shaking. The stabilization button should have been a click on/off button. This becomes a major flaw if your looking at anything for more than a few minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon image stabilizer binoculars","review":"Performance of the viewing and stabilization is very good.This is the 3rd pair of these binoculars that I have used and the stabilizing mechanisim is what stops working.I use these as an employee of ABC sports for college football so they do get quite a bit of use - but it is also a MAJOR problem when the mechanism stops working DURING a broadcast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon 10x30 IS binoculars","review":"Marvellous. Imagine you have a medium power binos always with a stand only 650grams. The view is obviuosly better than those of 7x or 8x. Once you press the button and can feel what a wonderful invention in your hands. You certainly would hope not to go back to unstabilised ones.Comfort, excellant optics are the first and instant impressions while I use it. The color rendition is perfect. It can be grouped into the world class like Leica and Swarovski. Balance on hands is just very good. The Canon's engineers nust pay thosands of hours in designing the body.It should be treated very careful. I think lots of sophiscated mechnical and electronic parts are within the bino.I just love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Binoculars","review":"I bought these binoculars to use for my birding and wildlife observations. They are perfect in every way. I love them. The IS feature is GREAT!! I give them a rating of 5 stars. My 12 year old grandson came to visit here on the farm and has been using them and loves them..he says that they are \\"awesome\\"..need I say more"},{"rating":"2","title":"Image Stabilizer Binoculars","review":"Great product for the price.It's tough to hold a 10X binocular steady, but when you hold down the stabilize button it locks on. You can also pan while locked down to track something moving such as wild game or airplanes, etc.Low light viewing is not so good, but I'm not willing to pay the premium to get that, nor carry the extra weight that would go with larger lenses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lee","review":"I had never owned or even held a pair of high-end binoculars before; but with two major upcoming vacations (Alaska and Vietnam) I decided to entertain the possibility of investing in a pair. Once I narrowed my choice to the Canon 10X30, I bit the financial bullet, and ordered two pairs. I received them from Amazon.com within a few days. It took all of five minutes or so to load the batteries, attach the strap, and adjust the lenses to my visual field. When I began to look through the lenses and the IS activated (after about 6 seconds on the first try)....the images were simply \\"AMAZING\\". It sounds cliché ....but truly words cannot describe the viewing delights that this instrument offers. Well worth the extra bucks I so reluctantly paid for them. I really look forward to using them on my upcoming trips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice binocs","review":"These are great binocs. The image stabilization affects the quality and ability to focus a bit but it works very well.I like the design very much and the carrying case is good.I am totally satisfied with my purchase and the delivery"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just back from 3 weeks on Safari!","review":"Bottom line...this was the ideal combination of features and weight. I didn't use the IS feature too many times but I was glad to have it. Some recommend a 40X but I think the added weight is a negative at least in this setting. You are either close enough to the animals or, the animals are hiding in the brush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Binoculars nice - Canon service and case not so good","review":"Got these binoculars for my wife at Christmas this year so they are about 3 months old. We went on around 5 short hikes when the stitching binding the strap to the case came completely out of one side dropping the case to the ground. I emailed Canon expecting an apology and a new case. I got the apology, but it was with an explanation that the cases have NO warranty and I was out of luck. After spending over $300 on this product by a well-known company with a high reputation and owning it only 3 months, I expected better. The binoculars are nice, but what happens when the strap on your unwarranted case breaks, drops and breaks your binoculars, and you call Canon? Very poor quality cases. Right now I cannot use the binoculars because I have no case and have to figure something else out. So what good are great binoculars you cannot use?Binoculars - 5 stars; Case - 0 stars; Canon - 1 star"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I ordered these on a whim as I needed a pair of binoculars for watching ships and birds. The binoculars are nice and when you press the button to kick in the image stabilization feature you see this technology shine. These are absolutely fantastic for long range work as the image stabilizer easily compensates for the motions of your hands as you hold the binoculars. These are also good for close up work. I was watching birds with them today and they're nice as they stabilize the image and allow you to focus on details you can't perceive when you are trying to hold a pair of binoculars steady."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"I wanted to buy a pair of binoculars for my husband, thinking he might begin the astronmy hobby he has often mentioned. First I bought a pair of Nikon 10x50s...mistake. They were too heavy...I couldn't hold them steady and looking at the sky was pointless through the unsteady gaze. I returned them immediately, bit the price bullet, and bought these. We both love them. Haven't used them for the stars yet, but brought them to an Ironman race and could watch my sister swimming in the race...unbelievable. My dad had his favorite automatic focus binoculars at the race, but our Canon was still better. Crisp, clear, beautiful, and the stabilization changes the entire experience. If you can afford them, buy them and you will not regret it. Makes details pop like never before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minor note","review":"Christian does a very good job of describing this album, so I just wanted to point out the one thing he missed - this is BC's second album.

In my humble opinion,it's best described as 'ambient progressive'. Tracks that make this import title a true keeper are the spaced out \\"Advert\\", \\"16 Second Swarm\\" and the thirteen minute, atmospheric \\"Wide Open Killingfield\\". Also liked the bonus two-track EP, but I don't understand why they simply couldn't tag those songs onto the one CD. Good release to have,just the same. Might appeal to fans of Flower Kings, Translantic, No Man and Flying Saucer Attack."},{"rating":"2","title":"What?! No One Else Knows This Band?","review":"If you like Porcupine Tree's more ambient and spacious work, you should really like this album. It features the headman and vocalist of Porcupine Tree. Although he provides no vocals on this one, mmostly due to the fact that all of these songs are instrumentals. Now if you're looking for something thats 2 to 3 minutes in length, and conists of a set up like verse chorus, verse chorus Chorus. GO SOMEWHERE Else. This band has no time for ignorant pop lovers. This is very spacious, ambient, spacy, sometimes psychedlicy, electro-y rock. Bass Communion Pwowns you like no tommorow. Because tomorrow's gone (as Porcupine Tree would say)."},{"rating":"2","title":"PURE CRAP?

They fit fine and the kind we bought had an odor block and that was dandy too. We have used about 10 or so of the bags and about half of them have had rips and tears in them upon taking them out of the trash can. The plastic lining that you tie the bag with will constantly rip through the bag if you aren't extra careful. Tonight was the last straw when I had to double bag our trash because the bag completely ripped and there was no way to tie it. I really wish I wouldn't have bought such a big box as I will definitely stick to a different brand next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame hefty bag","review":"I purchased these bags from walmart and I am disapponted with the quality. (Hefty 13gal. drawsting unscented odor block 85 bags). The drawstring breaks very easily. Not near the Hefty quality I expect. If I wanted this quality I would have bought the Walmart brand. Is everyone going to this? I pay the extra money to know that I get the best. But now I think that I should go with the cheap stuff. It performs the same if not better"},{"rating":"1","title":"'Garbage bags' is accurate","review":"This is a premium-brand bag with the quality of a store brand. I've used six of these bags and torn three, all just below the blue straps. They're thinner than past Hefty bags.

I was able to watch the Mavs beat Portland from the third level of the new AA Center with the best view I'd see all season! They are so clear, I could see the winces on the players' faces as they struggled to rebound, pass, and make baskets. I love that the case and strap are included at no additional charge.

Canon is a brand you can trust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Photography Like a Pro - brief synopsis","review":"This book is a more-or-less well written manual; however, I must admit that a lot of the information in this book is not very well presented, and often confusing (especially if this is a first time that you are encountering the subject). More detail should have been given to differences in aparture settings, and examples were lacking. Depth-of-Field was poorly explained, and while this book starts out with something as simple as a single-use camera, about 50% into it, explanations are assuming that you are very familiar with the concepts before reading this book. I must say that if I were a true beginner, I would not benefit from this book very much at all. I am not sure if there ever will be a book that will have a smooth transition from basics to advanced techniques, and will include many examples, but this book fails completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Informative Book","review":"I got this book as a gift for Christmas. I think this book has all you need to know about film and the type of camera you might want to buy. It also helps you understand lighting, film, and creative things to do with photography!

I drink it mixed with nonfat milk and it thickens up and is very rich. True, it is not easy to blend. I use a hand-held flat wire whisk and get most of it blended, but it takes a bit of effort. I'm going to buy a personal blender just for this. It provides lots of energy and fills me up...no need to eat for a LONG TIME afterward.

I've never bought a CHRISTMAS ALBUM from any artist before. It's just not something I would listen to very much, and also the reason why 5 years after this release I am just now buying it. Had I heard it before I would have purchased it sooner. Came across Kenny singing Silent Night on the internet and that started my search for this album. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE him singing Silent Night and \\"Just A Kid\\" (Could listen to them all day over and over, such a great voice). Pretty Paper with Willie Nelson also wonderful just so many great songs on this album. Even though it's a Christams CD I can honestly say I will listen to it year around!! YOU GOTTA HAVE IT!!

Great Price!!!","review":"We love Spiru-Tein, it makes a great healthy meal replacement and it fills you up. I am a chocolate lover but I prefer the Vanilla for this product. It is one of the only Vanilla's that doesn't seem to sweet to me. It is the best mixed with milk, even skim milk works. Don't mix with soy milk, or you get a thick strange texture, and I haven't ever tried it with water because it is just too good with milk. I don't think any other product comes close to flavor and it is packed full of nutrition. This is a product we will always have in the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I have been using Spiru-tein for over a year and a half now. My nails grow like crazy, and there is hair growing in other areas that was not there before. I have to shave more, which was not why I brought the product. It was mainly to get my thinning hair on my head to grow. Maybe I'm using too much, but it says a cup. It has definitely helped my thinning hair to grow.

Sad that so many people took advantage of her."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste?","review":"I am so glad I borrowed this book and didn't read it. I read the book in one day. It is a page turner because you think you are eventually going to get to some detail, wrong. If you have heard about the men you have slept with then you have read the book. The most interesting part of her book was her upbringing. The rest of the book was the same scenario repeated with different men; sex, drugs, alcohol and then they leave.

But after hearing all of the preliminary reviews about this book, I thought it would be different.What suprised me about this book was that I found myself very interested about her early life. This seemed to be the most genuine part of the book. Everything else seemed to glorify her very dangerous lifestyle.I would have given this book 3 stars, but I gave it two because of the format in which it is written. I felt like I was reading one of those required 8th grade English class novels. I have seen comic books that were tougher reads than this book. As far as overall content and substance, it was just an average book to me. No big woop."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I have to admit that I was hesitant about purchasing this book because of all of the negativity that I have heard about Karinne Steffan, but I am glad I read this. She is no different than many other woman in society today. Her story is encouraging and reassures us that it it doesn't matter where you come from but where you are going. So many girls and women strive to have the lifestyle, fame, and money that being a hip hop chick brings, but Karrine shows us the downside to it all. I have much respect for her after reading this book and hope she continues on her road of accomplishments."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought it would be better","review":"Should of been better.

I believe that the only people who believe this is a good book are people who probably don't normally read. It's like a really bad journal that some how got published.

Being a ho was hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD","review":"This is not what I thought that this book was. This is not a tell all book like it was being advertised. This book was just a write up of all the things in her life that she thought others would like to know. This book leaves so many question like \\" who is PAPA? She is telling this story I think to get back at the people in the industry who wouldn't help her. She was basically being a groupie that did any and everything to get people to like her. And for her to say that she wrote this book so that other girls wouldn't go through what she did is just a lie. She wrote this for attention. This book sucked and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Well for starters, I picked up this book after reading an interview that Ms. Steffans did with VIBE magazine last year. I had expected this book to talk solely about Ms. Steffans and her perspective of her life as a \\"Video Vixen\\" (aka Video Ho)but my expectations weren't fulfilled. The most disappointing aspect of this book was that Ms. Steffans just seemed to be \\"throwing dirt\\" around about a lot of people with big names. I thought it was very tasteless and tacky to highlight a few \\"big\\" names and then to cower and leave out everyone saying that the ones she left out were still her friends. I almost laughed aloud when I read that statment. But, to top of all of the mud slinging, the book was very poorly written. I'm not sure how this book got throught the publisher. There were many typos and fragments throughout the book. If you have nothing better to do I would suggest renting this book from the local library, but rest asure that you won't read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superhead Please!","review":"Ok lets all be honest here. We all got this book to read about all the famous people karrine has slept with undercover. We all read books about women that grew up poor, abused and on drugs. There are enough book like that out. Why pick up this one, cause we want to know all the NBA, rappers, R&B singers, and Entertainers she's ran through. I've read Jenna Jamosons book and it's basically the same way with less names. Karrine acts like she is a victim and blames her up bringing on how she is today. I know 2 women today that went through the same struggle or even worst and didn't have to result to strippin and porn. You do that because you want to no one forces you! She brought out this book for other reasons and it don't start with \\"Letting go the past\\" or \\"To get in touch with God.\\" It's sad to see this sista like this. She doesn't respect herself and bringing out this \\"Tell all\\" book is not gona help in anyway. So SuperHead Please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Triumph!","review":"If you like your books spicy and poorly written, you'll like this book. You'll also like Star Jones new book. Ms. Steffans is a survivor. Yes, she's flawed. But isn't being flawed part of being human? It reminds me of a song by Journey, called the \\"The Wheel in the Sky.\\" Check those lyrics and you'll instantly see the parallels. It's also been bandied about on some chatboards that Ms. Steffans life was the basis of the movie, \\"The Remains of the Day\\" starring Anthony Hopkins, but I rented it and I couldn't make the connection.She was recently featured in the February issue of the trade magazine \\"Hip-Hop Music Video Actress\\" and she revealed that among her role models are Patrick Swayze, Neil Peart the drummer from 70s supergroup Rush and John Updike. She also said that she knew a incredible secret about Kimora Lee Simmons. What could it be?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blows More Than Just The Lid!","review":"Karrine Steffans is one hot & tasty piece of caramel. Her book details the little talked about life of hip hop's videos and the women who act the hoochie mama in them.Also of interest is a couple of porn scenes that Karrine has done with black porn stud Mr. Marcus. The shots have been put out by Vivid (leave it up to that racist company to release black women & men only when the woman is a news item and some nastiness of her on video has turned up) titled, \\"Superhead\\". She does it all but only with Mr. Marcus.Too bad there aren't any with her and a white porn stud. I would love to see her in interracial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damn shame","review":"I have to give it to Karrine for enticing people to go out and purchase this easy to read 5th grade level essays put together to form a book. Karrine is a hoe. If she wanted to inform girls out there who aspire to be video girls then why were the names and places and secrets of these industry men put into the story. She could have easily told the same story without ever saying their names. She wanted to exploit them so she could feel better about her ho-ing. She LOVED every man that touched her. And the sad part is that if she is willing to write a book about laying on her back to get where she is, then she is willing to exploit or do whatever to keep her lucrative lifestyle afloat. I did not like the book it took me forever to read it because every page was a disappointment. She never revealed who Papa was but revealed the major players so we would go out and buy this worthless book."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting,sad&Manipulative","review":"Karrine Steffans has a Sad story to share along with being interesting,but in the end it has alot of Maniplative elements at work here as well. the Names in all forms of Entertainment are what sell the Book.Steffans is seen as a Sad figure but I don't ever feel sorry for her.I feel sad for Her childhood,but certain things that she allowed to go down don't bring any Sympathy from me.Hit&Miss Book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexpurgated Trash","review":"This book belongs in the trashcan. This woman was a sleazy social climber who allowed herself to be passed around a circle of irrelevant \\"rap moguls.\\" The most offensive part is when her editor or co-writer try to pass this woman off as some sort of empowering female role model. Whoever decided to publish this book is a real pervert and another reason black people are viewed merely as sex objects or athletes. This book sets black publishing back by 50 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ramifications Of Abuse","review":"I was recommended this book by a friend and in reading it was immediately drawn in. The honest in which she shares her story is astounding. Goes to show you we really do not know what really happens in Hollywood or how some of the top names in the business have gotten there. It also goes to show that in some cases women such as this beautiful woman have led a life filled with abuse. For other page turning books along the line of this one with the same type of page turning power read NIGHTMARES ECHO/Katlyn Stewart and A PAPER LIFE/Tatum O'Neil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whistleblower!!!","review":"Karrine Steffans was really in need of some money because all of her wells ran dry so she put out and hater novel. Why did she have to name certain names of men, they do have families and images to protect. What goes on in the dark should stay in the dark. She has no regards to these mens images just because she does not care about hers, does not mean she had to bring everybody down with her. If she was a changed woman, why was she on a cable channel doing an interview saying that she still had alot of different men around her son, but her son had to call them \\"uncle\\". And when each man came around they had to put an dollar in her son's piggybank! She is still installing those gold-digging ways into her son with no remorse. This book is for the women who want to know the ups and down of the industry if you are gulliable enough to get sucked into it headfirst like Superhead did! What kind of woman has respect for herself is cool with the nickname Superhead?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This was a pretty good book.

She went from being put out by her mother and doing inapropriate things to sipping crstal with the big ballers in the rapping industry. Only trying to support her son was the only thing on her mind, but to me i would have tried to get a job the honest way to make it and not think about the fast money. I like how she did her share of the dirty work with still one intention to make it for her and her son and in the end thats what it came down to. If i had to read this book all over again, i would and reccommend it to anyone with similar intrest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Happy I Borrowed It","review":"This book was just okay for me.

No one can bring you happiness but yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite interesting","review":"I was ignorant and saw the cover thinking \\"I don't want to read about a video ho\\"...but after assurance from friends I read the book and was shocked. Not at the men she slept with but her demented past which lead her down a path of pure self distruction. Karrine has been conditioned and is mentally damaged by abuse on so many levels. This book is not for the judgemental. Step outside of your box, look on the inside, and put yourself in her shoes. It's a hard pill to swallow (no pun intended). There was one person she protected in the book by not revealing his name, I think it's R. Kelly, after all she was young when she first met him."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"Just horrible book.

I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Mean to be rude, but...","review":"I had an somewhat of an idea of the storyline and do not want to pass judgement. This woman made Jenna Jameson look like a choir girl! First of all, it seemed more of a tell-all about the guys (and girls) that she slept with and second of all, she did not update on how she has improved her life. It seems to me that writing a tell all might have been the way to go to some quick dough. Yes, I know she was abused and had bad relationships and etc, etc, but for goodness sake, what is the lesson learned here? If a young girl reads this book, she may be fascinated instead of educated. In regards to Jenna Jameson, at least she has cleaned up her act, settled down and gotten married, and now is CEO of her own company even though she is still in the porn industry. No disrespect, but this book was more of celebrity trash than a \\"cautionary tale\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but lacking substance","review":"Although the events of the book are so interesting, that I had a hard time putting it down...there is no positive message. Karrine claims that the book was written to empower young women who use sex as a replacement for self-esteem, but I had a hard time finding this moral in the book. After everything she went through, she still sleeps with celebrities and craves the party scene. Where was the growth and lessons learned?If you're looking for an entertaining and quick read, this is the book. If you're looking for substance or something to introduce to our young, vulnerable women...stick with maya angelous, jill scott, and alicia keys.

However, if you're looking for some real deal entertainment, behind the scenes love and drug affairs, and hot 'n' steamy sexcapades with well-known A-List celebrities, then honey, this Bud's for you!!! I've read plenty of review and articles about Karrine's novel, life, and decisions, most of which have been negative. Disregard them and thank Karrine for giving us a bit of an inside view (pants, clubs,hotel rooms, music studios, or movie trailers) of celebrity life and romance.

That time came when she had her son but instead of properly taking care of him she pushes him off on others so that she can pursue money and sex. She claims, in her book, that everything she did was in an attempt to give her son a better life but I don't see it.I checked this book out from the public library. So, I am glad I didn't purchase it for my library.If you feel that you have just got to read this book, then borrow it from a friend or go to the library. I love Amazon.com for buying my books. But, this time I must suggest you not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid","review":"this book was stupid. there really wasn't much confessing going on in this book. what she talked about are things people heard about on the radio or read about her online."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am dissapointed!","review":"This book is what it is and Karrine is what she is. I was hoping the book would be a little less basic, even though I do appreciate her candor. I feel sad for her and understand where she is coming from on certain points. I felt she missed giving juicy details where there were plenty of opportunities to do so. She could have made this book even better being what it is. This what happens to women who have no self respect. I think that it is definately what not to do! Sad that she threw herself at all of those worthless men who cared nothing about her because they were famous.Anyway, my main point is that for what this book is it is really missing something big.I commend Karrine for writing to try and better herself but I hope that she will leave that life all together for her son's sake. I feel really bad for that kid. He will probably spend his life with a very distorted view on women and relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, worth the money","review":"I purchased the book on my lunch break. I was so tired of hearing the radio personalities discussing \\"SuperHead\\", I had to see it for myself. I started getting really into this book from the first few pages when I realized that she is a native from my homeland, little St Thomas. I felt sad, in some chapters, mad in others when I read of all the domestic violence that actually began in her own mother's womb. She has lived a life scattered with abuse, drug experimentation, poverty, homelessness and sexual promiscuity. Luckily she has survived, with a story to tell, a beautiful son and a bright future with a rather wealthy, supportive better half... Bill Maher. If you have read this book, and feel cheated because there is one celebrity lay that she refuses to disclose, have no fear book two is on it's way out.....but psst don't say you heard it from me, but ummmmmmmmmm PaPa is Snoop D o double G.Who knew..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankful for my life","review":"As sad as this book left me feeling, I truly believe that this woman has not learned from her mistakes. All the men she thought she loved were never there for her when we needed them the most, but yet she still went back to some of them. I wanted so much for her to tell off Ja Rule and Irv Gotti, and off course Diddy. These men treated her like dirt and there was nothing she could do about it. I hope young girls could learn from this woman's mistakes and abusive lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Ms. Steffans claims that this book functions as a cautionary tale to young girls, yet, in reading it, it felt more like she was bragging. She seemed proud of the fact that she was able to bed some of today's most popular hip hop artists and have them repeatedly come back to her for more. It didn't seem like Ms. Steffans was very ashamed of her behavior either.Yes, she talked about the downside of being a \\"video vixen\\" (i.e. a glorified prostitute); the drugs, lack of self-worth, poverty etc. Yes, her childhood was touching and very sad. I have great sympathy for her. I'm just skeptical of her motives for writing this book. Was it for money? Recognition? Ego? Only Ms. Steffans knows..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some secrets better kept","review":"Total waste of money. The focus is not the industry or lessons learned from them but is more of an autobiography of her life and how screwed it was and still is (no references to change in behavior). Borrow it if you can, very easy read but not worth keeping. Sad story but could have been more of an inspirational book. It's obvious the selling point was the people she put out there and not the experience itself (some weren't even worth mentioning because it made her look used)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time!","review":"You can tell its a bunch of lies from the minute she says she \\"starred\\" in that movie and all those music videos.

But I think that this book was written to put people on blast more so than trying to help people! She is far from being finished with her bed hopping sexcapades. I don't feel this book gives any inspirational advice. It states alot of mistakes and wrong doings, but she doesn't really give any insight to what she has learned from going through all this. I mean she ended the book speaking about her romp with Usher.The only inspiration you would get is from seeing how pathetic she looked and choosing, on your own, not to want to look like her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supper Head???","review":"The book was reviewed by my book club and we all thought she went a little over board. It was not to help young girls like she keeps telling the media. It was to breakup homes and make being a hoe some type of goal to aspire to. The book was an easy read but it was likely fiction or a truth stretched so thin you can see through it. I do not recommend it because it lacks substance. She glorifies he nick name supper head but fails to tell her secret skill of sacking major players. Two thumbs down !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and senseless","review":"I became very bored with this book within the 1st 2 chapters. ow that she's spread herself so thin, what else is there for her to do next?

That is written proof for years to come that his mama is a hoe. She hates her mother, but he will hate her more. She is very selfish and money hungry. I did not buy the book I got it from the public library and I am glad. She is the worst then trying to ruin others lives. Some of these men are married, it's bad enough you did the dirt, but why hurt the wife, too. You are not helping anyone. Young girls reading this book won't be inspired to live right. You just exploited your dirty, filthy self to the world. You will never have a husband. You should be sued."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is pure nonsense","review":"I feel sorry for Karrine Steffans, but she CANNOT write! Her editor sucks! She should have had someone else edit her work because neither she nor her editor can proofread. She brags about being a novelist without going to college...that's BS. She clearly should have gone to college or taken some type of writing class, but since she didn't her book turned out like this. I felt like she kept saying the same thing over and over again...and I couldn't even finish the book. I was so bored with the content and the way in which it was delivered. This girl needs help...I do feel bad regarding the horrible things that have happened to her. However, she needs to get a life and this type of nonsense is not the way to go...I'm sure the second book was just as useless as this one...Let's get it together people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confessions of a video vixen","review":"It's really just her story and what she went through.

Reading this book was the biggest waste of time. All I could think about was Howard Stern's theory on strippers and porn stars. They all come from broken homes, have been raped in the past, etc. She definitely fits the mold. The whole book was about being a victim.. She's a victim of making bad choices, and that's it. How can I feel sorry for someone who continiually stresses about how lonely she is, and yet up until the very last page she's dropping her panties for everybody and anybody. Boo hoo.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to the interview....","review":"on Hot 97... apparently she didn't know her baby's father and wife were on the line... for a minute, I felt a little sympathy, until you hear the other side of the story... too funny, AND they had audio of her. Made most of her allegations lies, AND she left the radio station. They did convince her to come back, but it was crazy... I recommend you guys listen to it. Just like Nas baby mother, it's all about making money, though she said it wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still in denial!!!","review":"I am sorry to see that she felt justified with dedicating this mess to her son. I do not think she wrote this book to help anyone. I think she wrote it not only for the money, and the notability but to get back at men that left her high and dry (literally)!! She contradicted her statements in the beginning of the book with the end of the book. She only told parts of the story that would make you feel sorry for her. She left out any parts that would make her take responsibility for her own actions. She claimed her son was her reason for being but never spent anytime with him. I promise you if you read this book you will find yourself wanting to put it down and ask for your money back. The only thing that will make you keep reading it is to see who she slutted it out with next!! DO NOT PAY FOR THIS BOOK!!! IF YOU CAN BORROW IT THEN DO THAT!! BUT TRUST ME YOU WILL THANK ME IN THE END!! AND IF YOU ARE DEAD SET ON BUYING IT I WILL SALE YOU MY COPY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cjwhite","review":"I really can not believe that she slept with all those men!!!And I also agree with another review that she should have waited until she was older because she really does'nt explain how and if she got out of that life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video Ho","review":"I only purchaes the book to find out what the hoopla was all about, but only found out that she is truly a woman that needed therapy, she doesn't realized that the names that she named in the book could damage many families and hurt many lives.I don't suggest anyone else buy the book, since reading it I have passed it along to friends who feel the same way. If I were her, I'd keep a low profile in NY, she is not very well likd here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Real","review":"This book was a good attempt at characterizing the life of Ms. Steffans. I think it captures the essence of living and learning life's lessons. I read this book in one sitting, so I can say it's an attention keeper. I think that she told her story honestly and didn't glamourize the things that she did. She did explain her state of mind in how she viewed her sexual experiences with entertainers glamourous at times, but in the end she was disrespecting herself.Overall, the main 'intented' point of this book is to warn teenage girls that fantasize about this type of lifestyle that it's not what it's cracked up to be. 'Yizette' endured a lot of pain and humiliation and in the end when she needed her male 'friends/lovers' they wouldn't help her and she had to turn to God. In the end, she grew spiritually and gained greater respect for herself as a woman and a mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"topman","review":"This is a story that is unbelievable written by a young lady of colour that is completely out of control. The grammar is poor and the plot is empty. The book is similar to Wilt Chamberlain's conquest of how many women - in this case how many men in the hip-hop and professional sports she was able to \\"bag\\". I purchased this book in hope that I would discover and learn something new, and it was not the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the $$","review":"I bought the book out of curiosity. I wish I was able to return it! While I admit I wasn't able to put it down, I became annoyed with each turn of the page. I've heard her on several stations here in NY and even found myself drawn to the drama she created on one of the stations. I've even heard her mother's side of the story. At the end of the day she has to live with her actions and the life she's led, and the people she's hurt. Are the stories true? We all know there's three sides to every story.. Perhaps the book would have been a better read had the names been changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAKE LYING B*&$H","review":"This book is full of lies. Listen to the interview onHot 97.com with G Rap and his current wife Ma Barker. That's all I have to say. Oh, and for all yall wanting to know who is poppy is, it is supposed to be Method Man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it is written on","review":"This is the tale of a sorry female who blames her selfish and disgraceful behavior on her mother. She blames it on being dragged up instead of beign brought up like many young girls. I hope that the young ladies that rread this and see it for what it is trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a pathetic story, written by a pathetic person","review":"I guess I'm getting too old to see the value in stories like this. I can't identify with the hip hop generation. There is no real story here. It's more like a collection of incidents. The subject goes about recalling numerous sexual and drug filled relations with the rich, famous and infamous celebrities. This book was reccommended by a friend. From now on I'll ask that he not give me anymore recommendations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delusional overtones","review":"This book was just okay overall. There were really no great highs or lows to be honest. While I understood some of the issues Karrine faced, I honestly felt she was a bit delusional at times. Some of the descriptions of relationships with mega stars such Shaq, seem very vague and almost make me wonder if any of it actually happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vixen huh? That's what you call it???","review":"I think this is a great book to read if you need to pass the time or if you want to know some things about today's hottest stars (men). I had never heard of her before this book, and I still haven't heard anything about her besides this book. I do feel like she did not accomplish her 'intended' purpose in writing this book. While it is meant to be inspirational, as well as warning young girls not to follow in her footsteps, it turns out to be \\"I'm talkin bout all the men I slept with\\" kind of book. Now it just so happens that this was the kind of book that I was looking for. She does make herself look bad in this book however, but it serves one purpose, and that's entertainment. I would recomment this book to those who want to know a few facts about Kool G Rap, Ice-T, Ray J, Shaq, and a few more..."},{"rating":"1","title":"rambling","review":"Just a bunch of rambling I felt like I was sitting in front of her while I was in the waiting room of the docters and she was one of those people who just had to tell you her life story... it would have taken 30 minutes for her to finish this rambling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Video Vixen","review":"I know that the music industry has its flaws, but in Steffans books it really shows that it can be worst. To be honest the book was informative about that. Personally I think she might be telling the truth about these things because alot of people seem to be upset with her. I think that she was finally someone who decided to come out with the truth and do some name dropping. Most of the men she had relations with are or were married with children and they wanted to protect them from the truth. Which is what America does anyway. If these things in her book really are the truth then I commend her on taking a stand and informing people these artists are not as innocent as they put themselves out to be. Last and not least I think people envy her because they are actually scared to come out and say the things she have said. I believe that she's not the only one who was doing this but there are more women who are in these videos who do the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Whole Story","review":"I didn't like to book because I don't think the entire story was told. She did not talk much of the others guys like shaq and Jay Z. I think she could have elaborated more. And when Bobby went out to buy drugs, I think him and her did them together in the hotel. I just don't think the entire story was told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Working Girl - ...But not very honest","review":"I read this out of sheer curiosity with a very open mind. The book is nothing more than an attempt on the authors part to legitimize and validate the oldest profession in the world. It is inconceivable to me how a woman can \\"fall in love\\" with EVERY man that gives her some money for sexual favors. She plays the victim. How many women have been sexually assaulted, raped, and otherwise violated never resort to a \\"tell all book.\\" She is in fact pimping us with her nonsense throwing around a few famous names. She got PLAYED AND PAID!!!Most men do not pay for sex, then support the prostitutes they frequent. Don't waste your money. 5 Stars to her \\"editor\\" for making this indeed readable because it is doubtful all Karrine can do is what she is \\"famous\\" for. She is an admitted drop-out and illiterate lady of the evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"at home in mitford","review":"i love this book. it encourages us to keep reading and not to put the book down.i cannot wait to read the next book in this enchanting series.it is the best book that i have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video Vixen","review":"Karrine Steffans is a highly unlikable character, which is kind of hard to imagine since I usually feel a lot of empathy towards people who have been reportedly abused and also raped. Not one word from her ilicited anything but disgust from me. Yes, this is an entertaining read, but this book did not make me care about her. She says she wrote this book as a cautionary tale, but when asked, in an interview, would she have lived her life diferently if she got a second chance, she said that she would not, that she would have chosen the same path. I would not suggest this book unless you just really need to know about what some of the celebrities are like behind closed doors"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusted!","review":"I only had sympathy for her when she was raped and being abused by her Mother. I read the the book being so angry with her with having sex with almost everybody in the sports & entertainment indusrty. After reading the book I wanted to take 20 showers and take several HIV tests. I think she was brave for being open about her personal life but I feel is wrong for her to name all of those artists (Except for PAPA)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What waste of money and time!","review":"I had hoped to read about the behind the scenes music video business the exploitation and the ups and downs of the \\"average\\" video vixen.

If I wanted to read soft porn, I know where I could go for that.It seemed that almost every known black celeb just happened to be a good friend of hers personally and that some of them also dated her for months . Hmmm!wonder how she manage to fit in these extensive dalliances with all the times she was stoned out , acting , doing videos and partying. Must be a great manager of time and a very organized person.

Karrine stays with him for as long as she can bear until the birth of her son , Naiim and then she escapes for her son's sake and begins to depend on wealthy friends, until she lands gigs as a video vixen.Vulgar and edgy, this book is a must read for anyone intrigued by the hip-hop industry, fast money, or fast women.--I.

I watched some kind of show late one night talking about videos and all the half naked women in the videos. They mentioned Karrine and her book. I knew that this was going to be a great read.....that was the reason why i ordered it. Karrine i admire you for your honesty and how you went about getting what you deserved.

It's so sad that this is the images that our daughters ae looking at and up to, this girl whether she is or not is a high priiced Wh**e. I was so dissappointed after reading this book, mostly because I kept waiting for the turning point, when she realized that what she was doing and how she was doing it was wrong. But, that point never came, she said that she wanted to save young girls from making the same mistakes that she did, but the only way to do that is for her to change her lifestyle. As much as she said she hated her mother, is probably how much her son is going to hate her, just imagine him pickingup this book 10 yrs from now and reading these things about his mother.

I remember her from this video with Mr.Marcus and you can see why they call her superhead. I read most of the book in the store. It really is a quick read and after a few chapters it just repeats itself. I'm just wondering why she doesn't mention the porn movie in her book since she wants to put all her business out there.

I have to say that it is an interesting look at what is going on behind the scenes in the world of hip-hop. I gave this book a 2 star review primarily because I generally did not care for the content. The author goes on and on about the fact that this is a cautionary tale for girls considering getting into the fast life as a back up dancer when it really seems like a vengeful smear campaign against people she allowed to treat her badly. Personal opinion aside, the book is shoddily put together and demonstrates a poor grasp of the English language as well as a general lack of understanding of basic grammar. In addition, the author tends to lose her thread easily and goes off on tangents that are gratuitous at best. I would say that this book is worth a read if you have nothing else in your library AND you don't have to pay for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turner!!!","review":"This book gives you a first hand look at the behind the scenes antics of a video vixen.

I suppose if you really wanted to look deeper, you can find the lessons of don't do drugs, don't drink yourself to death, even when things are looking down, you can always turn yourself around, etc, etc. However, most of the book was just name dropping and who the author had sex with. In the intro, the author says that she wants to tell the young girls who aspire to be like her the true story. However, I would definitely not hand this book to a 13 year old aspiring \\"video girl.\\" I'm glad the author has picked herself up and dusted herself off, but the book would be most interesting to people looking for fluff or little tid-bits on those in the hip hop industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A SKANK!!!!!","review":"She makes all women look bad.

I cannot stand when dumb women proclaim to love \\"dey thugs\\" but then complain about the lies, cheating, beatings and disrespect they encounter.TOO DAMN BAD YOU DIRTY HOES!I will say this, writing this book is the smartest thing this walking biohazzard ever did. You see she will age. She will wrinkle. Ain't nobody gonna want her used up, stanking, disgusting arse and maybe she should have been thinking about making money other ways.The book is taudry, raunchy and tacky but that is what sells in this day and age.

I feel ripped off by you too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to finish it...the worst!!","review":"This book was the worst! When I told people I was reading this book, many said \\"Why would you read that?!?\\" and now I know why they said that. Karrine tries to make you feel bad for her through out the book but I all I could feel was disgusted and embarrassed for her. I thought her life story would be interesting but it's not. She just goes on and on about how she \\"thinks\\" she loves this guy and that guy. It was pretty pathetic. Don't buy...it's a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"vidoe vixen","review":"This book was good.

I was looking for a book that would be a confession of an intimate nature and fast pace so when I saw the audio book of this at the local library I immediately borrowed it. Awesome tell all book! but I don't know why someone would buy a copy of this and display it at their house. Your better off displaying a autobiography book of Jackeiey Pedroe in your house....Jackeiey Pedroe who???

I admire Karrine Steffans for having the courage to tell her story, and Oh My what a story!!! Seriously I could not put this book down, even though throughout the whole book I kept thinking \\"What the he** is wrong with this woman??\\". She gives away her body (and self respect) as if she were a piece of gum!?! Yet the voyeur in me still found the book very addicting and hard to put down. Definitely not literary genius, but very entertaining all the same!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lessons To Be Learned","review":"This is a must read for African American young women that are at risk of falling into this lifestyle.

I did not think that this book was that good because I didnt see much growth. At the end of the book I still felt as though she was the same person that would hop in the bed with any celebrity given another chance. Her story could have been a lot better if she would have developed it more. This book was NOT worth $26.00."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the world of a freak!","review":"This book was very entertaining in the beginning. I can understand why she did some of the things that she did, but not all. Some people react differently to certain situations, and she is certainly one of them. She slept with so many different people, I'm surprised she doesn't have AIDS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever!!!","review":"Karrine really doesn't deserve any sympathy...if that's what she was looking for. To name the men & give details the way she did was uncalled for. If she was a man, they'd have to repossess her \\"playa card\\" for that. Maybe this was another way for her to continue the lifestyle she had become used to. Most girls in videos are in their late teens, early twenties so possibly that counted her out. And let's not forget the fact that EVERYONE but Biz Markie has had her so she's literally a has been so I guess she had to do something. The book was garbage & disrespectful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confessions Review","review":"Very interesting tell-all book. I had mixed emotions ~ feeling pity and sadness for the author, and then feeling angry that she continuoulsy allowed herself (and her child) to be put in so many compromising situations. My heart goes out to females who fall short and bow to weakness; the ones who can't find their way, who don't know, respect and appreciate their worth, and their person. I do admire, the ones that fall down, and get up. It is a good read..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This could have been a great read, cautionary tale","review":"This is one of the most poorly-written books I've read in a long time. Rambling, improper grammar notwithstanding, Ms. Steffans had the opportunity to write an interesting story that might have made a difference. Instead, despite her supposed efforts to expose the mysogyny for what it is, she never really gets to why the world of hip hop can be so incredibly destructive to young women and our society as a whole. She claims to love her son above all, yet her actions don't bear that out. True, she had a very dysfunctional and painful upbringing, and bless her for wanting to turn her life around. But she misses the boat by glamorizing the men with whom she has sex/the 'relationships' themselves and not discussing HOW she is making this change and what she is doing to help others who might slip into a similar path of self-destruction. I was hoping to feel inspired by a young woman's battle for self-respect and responsibility; instead I was bored silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video Vixen","review":"Not very good writing in my opinion, I understand it's her first book, but what about the editor? The author tended to skip around a bit, which made some parts a bit confusing. I would only recommend this book for readers who have nothing else better to do, or read. It has no social value at all. The author claims she is trying to prevent young girls from making the same mistakes she made, but it seems she continued to make them the majority of her life. Even after she realized these people were only using her for sex. A very sad life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should read for information, but nothing else","review":"A good friend of mine, who I consider a literary junkie, recommended this book to read as interesting. It was just that...interesting. I did think that Karrine's story was sad and unfortunate, but who doesn't have a sad story these days. Some people recommend this story as a good postive read for youth, but I disagree. If you want your youth to read about drug and sex life in the fast lane, and how it can get you a $7 million dollar book deal, all without recognition to the Supreme Being that made it possible, then let your kids read it. Make sure they read the part about how she really hasn't changed; just now she recognizes that she must love herself first before she does her dirty work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Insight","review":"Good insight on how sexually promiscuous gold diggers/groupies like her are made in today's societies.

If this was the first book you've ever picked up in your life you might enjoy it. To Other people who like to read allot, it felt like an illiterate child wrote it. Explanations went on and on and so many sentences were added at times that it didnt make sense. It reminded me of my first college essay when you wrote about something you didn't care about but you were forced to write more pages than you could muster so you threw in a bunch of random junk. By halfway through I got the jist: whore meets powerful man with money, whore sleeps with man who abuses her thinking she's found love, whore ends up alone. Rinse, recycle, repeat. Don't waste your $$. I can't believe this moron was on NY Times bestsellers..dont believe the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT waste your money on this book !!","review":"What a total waste of money. You'll find yourself getting incredibly frustrated at her antics...and then you'll get mad that she's even getting a cent of royalty from your money.

Blames everybody but herself for her addictive behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book!!!","review":"I could not put this book down...read it in one day. For all you people giving one and two stars...what in the world did you expect from this book? It is meant to be superficial, scandalous entertainment, and it had plenty of that. As for her dropping names in the book...that's the best part. Who would want to read it if she didn't name the people she was having sex with. I'll bet the wives of the exposed men are not too happy right now...oh well, get over it. I especially enjoyed the part about Vin Diesel...WOW!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick but pathetic read","review":"The author attempts to paint herself as the victim in this book. The only victim is her son who she has ignored most of his life. This is a great story on how low a human being will go in search of fame.

Speechless is all I can say and that who would have ever thought Vin Diesel had it goin on like that:0"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading","review":"I found this book rather enlightening. It gives the reader insight into a world we only can speculate about. Karrine doesn't create a fantasy world for the readers. She has truly put a 'real' perspective on what goes on during videos and what goes on behind the scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A PAGE TURNER.","review":"The book for me was interesting enough to want to keep reading. Everyone has a story to tell about their life, and she tells hers. I am sure it is how she remembers it.

To the young man in the corner with the fat gold chain, Timberland boots, and #1 Billboard Rap Single.Just sad what this girl went through as a youngster and then subjected herself to as a young woman.

Get it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT AND SPICY","review":"THIS BOOK IS A PAGE TURNER I FINISHED IT IN ABOUT A DAY IT IS VERY DRAMATIC AND WILL MAKE YOU FEEL EMOTION. I THINK SHE TOLD HER STORY VERY WELL AND I COULKDN'T PUT THIS ONE DOWN."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't much of a page turner","review":"I give Steffans props for using real names in her book. With 'Hiding in Hip Hop' and 'Celebrities between the Sheets' leaving the reader to figure out who is who, I am glad she didn't go that route. The book was interesting but far from great. Steffans tends to over explain her actions, as if the explanations would excuse her behavior. If it look like a freak and act like a freak, it's a freak <----Steffans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ghost writer book","review":"This book was sensational and interesting. I enjoyed this book as it's full of emotions, phases an individual gone through the distress, the loneliness, the need to belong what Yizette, or Steffan went through in her life.The many obstacles she overcomes, the roll-a-coaster ride of enjoying her grandmother company and support to being taken away from her and place in isolation and danger as she had no support.The many abuse that she endured, the homeless free spirit she yearn for, the finer things and then the friends who said no when you need them the most. However through all that was happening she managed to get the faith and pray to God and her prayers to God were answered. God surely can make miracle come through and how one can developed patience, reflex on the past, look to the future that brings something bigger and better n beyond the dark clouds there is always a silver lining awaits every1 no matter what the situations. This book is a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Trash","review":"I am surprised I was even able to finish this book. The woman really needs to get a life, be a better parent and stop writing trash!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"I quite enjoyed this book, as you can see by my rating.I was expecting a simple story about how a woman with no discernible talent, education or self-respect basically slept her way to fame. And it is that, but also so much more.Her story is very engaging. It was interesting to see the dynamincs between her and her parents and how that affected her relationships. And I must admit that her sexal escapades with industry bigwhigs made for juicy reading.Steffans was a drug addicted stripper who is now a New York Times best-selling author. Sure, she didn't take the route that many of us would deem respectable or ideal, but her journey of self-discovery and triumph makes this book a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting Read!","review":"I thought this book was really great and I couldn't put it down. Karrine's life story is very sad, as is the road to being \\"famous\\" as \\"Superhead.\\" I thought it took a lot of courage to out all these famous men and her sexual excursions with them and it was also fascinating to read about. While you may not agree with her actions as basically a prostitute, it's still intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"damn good book","review":"This book is great, I cant beleive this writer is only 17.

I am a huge Neil Patrick Harris fan, and Amy Sedaris often has moments of comic genius. Here though, their talent is squandered while navigating a script that was miraculously made in the first place. There is a reason this movie is direct-to-DVD, and isn't worth watching for anything. I am no prude, but there were scenes in this movie so inappropriate within the context of the premise, I found myself offended. Many scenarios are forced and silly (the bad kind of silly), and the movie couldn't end soon enough for me. You were warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another No Subtitles Bomb","review":"We gave up trying to hear the poor quality of dialogue from this DVD after 10 minutes. The actors do not speak plainly and the Director tries to make whatever they are saying unintelligible by drowning it out with music, New York traffic sounds, etc. I know...it is my fault...I should have checked for subtitles before ordering. I ALWAYS do that for foreign films, but have sometimes forgotten to or have taken chances on American ones. Yesterday we watched the wonderful new \\"Jane Eyre\\" with Mia Wasiskowa and Michael Fassbender, so everything was not a loss.This DVD will go to the landfill with our garbage tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"I ordered this for the sole purpose of gifting it to Rick Santorum.","review":"I bought it and sent it to his campaign contribution address, because hey, it's a pretty clear way to send a message, right?

This book depicts the hatres, bigotries and misconceptions portrayed by both clubs. Murray also shows us how each club has parlayed their sectarian beliefs into a multi-million dollar business, not just in Scotland but throughout the world. And through it all both clubs deep down realize that each one could not exist without the other.

As homeschoolers, I am often told that I'm not preparing my kids for the \\"real world.\\" This book is proof that incarcerating 30 age-mates is not the \\"real world.\\" My kids were shocked at how cruel the kids were to each other, the lies they told to each other, their teacher, and their families. They were even more disappointed that the children were not punished for their actions.Even for someone who is pro-traditional school, I would not recommend this book. Lucky Lunch Day is a very unlikely event in this day of closed campuses. The meanness displayed in it should not be glorified in the search to \\"fit in.\\" The message given was that it's acceptable to do whatever it takes to have a \\"best friend.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes! Ugh! Don't get this set!","review":"This is a slapped together collection of event footage that has no accompanying coherent or interesting or informative narrative along with it. Really sloppy and uncaring assembly here. You could care less about what is on the screen.I cut my teeth on the truly excellent Bud Greenspan tv series back in the seventies that made me an Olympic fan ever since. Bud carefully & lovingly crafted his stories about one competitor for each show and wove together the human story of background, desire, striving and excellence in the pursuit of victory. His series are masterworks. Watch them if you can find them.But avoid The Olympic Series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bud Greenspan This Isn't","review":"These DVDs were just a waste of money. I'm a big fan of filmmaker Bud Greenspan and his documentaries on the Olympic Games. When I purchased this product, I believed I was getting DVDs of Greenspan's work. In fact, I found these DVDs on Amazon by typing in Bud Greenspan's name on the search line. Clearly, he had absolutely nothing to do with this product. I feel like I was duped and wasted by money. I'm very disappointed with Amazon for leading me to believe Bud Greenspan had anything to do with this product. Shame on Amazon for its quality control. Come on, guys.

This album was disappointing though. First of all, tamia voice is too beautiful to sing all those pop, dance, wack tracks that she have on this album.

I just pray that Tamia sticks to ballads and away from Missy and Dallas! ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS CD...","review":"I love every single song on this cd!

LOVED IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice, Terrible songs","review":"I wore out Tamia's first CD and bought the second one in hopes she would come with an album equal to or better than the first. However, it appears as though she hit a sophomore slump. I think Tamia has a wonderful voice, but it was wasted on this CD. The songs were nowhere near that of her first album. IMO, Tamia should go back to what worked before. Except for a remake of \\"Love Me in a Special Way\\", the quality of the songs was not very good.I'm sure it's important for an artist to grow and try different things. In this case, I'd recommend going in different direction than what she tried here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good voice does not a good cd make","review":"I brought Tamia's new CD based on loving her first one. Plus while I thought her first single from her new CD was cool, I loved the second song on the single \\"Tell me who\\". But alas Tamia has went the route that most R&B has taken lately. Nothing new to add, just the same old tired and old blahness. It's CD's like this one that make me rejoice to know that at least in this category of music if not for anybody, at least you can count on Mary J. Blige to always deliver. She has the voice, and the music to back it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I totally agree with \\"music fan from Brooklyn, NY\\"","review":"I totally agree with \\"music fan from Brooklyn, NY\\", it was stupid.I was in love with her first album,and it was so good.Really I bought A Nu Day before her self-titled album.And was very dissapointed with it.I wanted my money back, too.To me all the songs on there were horrible but Stranger in my House, and Can't No Man. But my friend had her first album and was playing it on the C.D. player,and I had to get it.I fell in love with it immediatly. If I were Tamia I would have been ssssoooo mad at Missy Elliot for messin' up this album.I will never take a chance on a Missy produced album again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful voice, but not used to it's full exent","review":"I have loved Tamia's sound since she first arrived on the music scene with Quincy Jones, but for some reason she's not living up to her potential. The QUALITY of the music just isn't there. The only 2 tracks that I really like are \\"Love Me in a Special Way\\" (re-make) and \\"A Stranger in My House\\". Some of the other songs, especially \\"Long Distance Love\\", just don't have the R&B flava! It's as if she is trying to get into the meaningless pop sound. Her voice is just too strong and beautiful for that. I hope that she what works for her soon, because this just isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth $15.11","review":"Tamia is very beautiful and very talented but like the last cd, she has very ordinary music. I bought this cd for \\"Stranger in my house\\" hoping that the rest of the tracks would grow on me but they didn't. Nothing on this cd approaches the strength of that song. \\"Tell me who\\" is a decent \\"I think you're cheatin'\\" on me songs sung with great attitude. \\"If I were you\\" is a syrupy but likeable ballad. Tamia's strenghts are definitely ballads. All the dance tracks are horrible. \\"I can't go for that\\" was a bad choice for a remake. Snoop Dogg and 213 are the stars of the remix while Tamia sounds like a regular back up singer. The best thing about this cd is that is an enhanced. You get a Tamia video and Tamia screen saver. Someone needs to help Tamia with material selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Effort","review":"Tamia's first CD that really didn't get much airplay was on point. That was one of the best CD's I had in my collection at the time of it's release. I looked forward to her new project, however, I am greatly disappointed. I don't understand who is picking her material. There are maybe two songs on the CD that are worth listening too. Stranger in My House and Love Me In A Special Way. The rest is totally not up to parr. She has a wonderful voice, and I hope that she is able to collaborate with someone who can showcase her talent in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"after Quincy Jones it's down hill","review":"after working with Quincy Jones it is all down hill Musically.with Q Tamia showed hope.but this is all formula driven R&B.Love me in a special way the classic from Debarge&the Great Mind Of El Debarge sounds good here.but the Re-make of Hall&Oats's I can't go for that (no can do)is weak.Brian Mcknight did it better on his debut album.She has Talent but this is no justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Disappointed","review":"What makes the album bearable? Tamia's lovely vocals, her ability to belt out a track is a thing of beauty. She is no doubt my favorite singer right now.Why is this album bad? The production. The over producing or lack there of, take your pick, really brought Tamia down. Only two songs stand out, \\"Stranger In My House\\", which isn't all that great and the remake \\"Love Me In A Special Way\\", which makes every other song on this album sound elementary.Maybe it was high hopes, after all, I loved her self titled debut, and been in love with her since \\"You Put A Move On My Heart\\" dropped in '95. \\"Nu Day\\", is a definate pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This cd is boring and lame. Tamia has a nice voice and I don't understand why she would waste it on some silly mainstream pop. I was exptremely dissappointed with this cd. All the tracks sound somewhat alike and after a while you just forget them alltogether, cause the songs really don't make a lasting impression. Oh well...maybe she does better next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Nu Under The Sun","review":"Tamia has an amazing voice, but that is it. She has yet to carve out her personality and stand out from the other R&B divas. The only good songs on the album where 3 (Can't go for that),6 (Long distance love),and 13(Can't go for that remix). She's great on the uptempo tunes, but the ballady stuff doesn't make ample use of her voice. They always cut her off. They don't let her soar. The production overpowers Tamia.

The purpose of this book, I think, is to scare unhappily married people out of getting divorced.

It is essentially a selected collection of phone logs between Dr. Kissinger and his cohorts during the Yom Kippur War and the last days of the Vietnam War. If you are halfway interested in politics and history, there is nothing in this book that you don't already know, other than being able to glean through the actual words spoken by the policy makers of the time - what was \\"behind the scenes\\" was not startlingly different than what was on the TV screen.I am disappointed with this book, not least because I am much impressed by Dr. Kissinger's other work, especially his defining tome: Diplomacy.I am thankful for the tip given by the previous reviewer from Amsterdam, pointing out where to get the declassified information from the NSA.

Much of the artwork looked like animated two-dimensional impressionist paintings. There were some 3-D images, but they weren't on screen long enough to appreciate them.

This DVD might be OK as background for a party, something to be ignored most of the time; but watching it as a movie just gave me a headache."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reply to Carlson","review":"The book is an edited collection of essays protesting what its authors regard as the undue hegemony of liberal/progressive/PC ideology in clinical psychology. Many of the opinions expressed are reasonable, well supported by fact, and long overdue. Meanwhile, even those I find wrongheaded are largely to the left of Fox News, the WSJ editorial page, and Mussolini. The citations in Roger Carlson's review are caricatures of what is actually said; for this the only remedy is to read the book and draw your own conclusions. Like Carlson, I am a clinical psychologist (and yellow-dog Democrat), yet he strikes me as the sort of doctrinaire zealot who could easily end up in Hell sharing a room with Karl Rove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but...","review":"Let's not forget that there are actually mental health diagnoses that could possibly be non-diagnosed with the attitude that mental health is a conspiracy!

He started out as a therapist, turned into a businessman, and sold his business for mega millions of dollars. Like most capitalists, his only interest is money. Some people just never have enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Miracle Here!","review":"I purchased a gallon of this stuff upon a recommendation from a pet store employee. Sure enough when my puppy had his first accident I ran for the Nature's Miracle.It helped but it didn't solve the problem. In fact, it made the stain yellow and it smelled like a bottle of rubbing alcohol. This happened time and again with future stains.Out of frustration I went back to the pet store and purchaed their second best seller, Simple Solution. That actually worked and it even removed the yellowing that Nature's Miracle caused.The Simple Solution was less expensive, smelled better and most importantly it worked! Nature's Miracle doesn't live up to its name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do a thing","review":"This product did not work as advertised. The urine smell remains in my carpet.

I treated the spots as recommended but the smell did not go away, and was only diminished for a short time. I treated the areas multiple times.I ended up buying a special pet detergent for my steam vac and the problem was gone after one use, so I really wish I would not have purchased this product, as I used the entire bottle with no results."},{"rating":"2","title":"money saving buying this size","review":"This stuff works great to remove fresh urine and really old urine stains, without removing the color in the item being cleaned. If done properly this removes all odor and residue so the dog doesn't return to urinate on the same spot. It also works great at getting out ground in grass, blood, and other stains in clothes during laundry. Awesome product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leading brand","review":"I didnt think this was a major brand product from the uninteresting labeling, but this is the brand you'll find at major pet supply stores. It works just like it promises, eliminating the urine enzymes that pets leave behind and carpet soaps can't remove.If we thouroughly clean our carpet where an accident occurred, our dog still goes to smell the area (and will almost always have another accident in the same spot). But if we spray this on the spot after cleaning (and it's had time to dry, because they will go to smell it immediately after application), they wont go smell the same spot and there is no repeat accident!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This stuff sux","review":"It worked for 1 day and then the odor returned. I ended up using a home remedy that was not only effective but much, much cheaper. I found a site that offered to rememdies to remove cat urine odor in my rug. The first was to mix white vinegar and water, 50-50. The second was to mix peroxide, baking soda, and a few drips of dish washing detergant. I did both remedies, one after the other, and although to smell was a bit poignant and my son had to sleep with me for a night becuase of the smell and the chill in the room, it worked and the smell hasn't returned. This neutralizes the amonia in the urine crystals permanently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like water :(","review":"I've been using Nature's Miracle for a long time and had been very happy with the results until I purchased the 24oz Trigger Spray.

I am not a very talented cook, but I find these recipes easy to follow and virtually fail proof. My husband, a fabulous cook, also loves cooking with recipes from Cooking Texas Style. The book is filled with great unheard of recipes as well as Texas and Tex-Mex classics. In addition to the recipes, the personal notes that Ms. Marquez and Ms. Wagner have included are a thrill to read.

Well, then they emailed me that the rest of them they had in stock were also broken so I had the choice of waiting for new stock or they would send me a similar one. I requested a similar one (The Pineapple looking version). In a about a week I recieved the same kind I requested originally, and it was also broken. Hello, Im going to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they are not stupid enough to send me another broken one, they just dont know how to package this item properly to keep it from breaking on the way to me.

As one of the other reviewers stated the tails on the ends of the letters are much too long and there is no way to join them unless you have a Gypsy or specific design software. Kind of seems like a rip off to me. I wish Provo Craft would state that on it's packaging so that anyone just starting out with the Cricut would know.

Great Price!","review":"I was searching for a good font cartridge to make words and letters for projects. This is one of them! It has a lot of great options that fit the bill for what I needed. However, it doesn't have as many fonts as I would have wished so that I could use it for other projects, and the end curves of the cursive are way to long. For a few of my projects using that font, I had to cut the ends. I still say it's a great buy and I use it all the time.

After 2 Grand theft auto's and getting off lucky, you would think he would stop his life of crime. He continues to be a delinquint until an unfortunate event happens.

It focuses more on seeking the cause behind the haunting. I really liked the family in the book as well, you did not get the impression that they were dysfunctional and seeking attention. I would recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to its ratings.","review":"I had high hopes for this book after reading the reviews. I kept waiting for the exciting ghost story to emerge but it never did. It was an easy read but just kept dragging on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Convincing Read","review":"I grew up in this town and passed this house every day on my way to school, so I was compelled to read this book. It's well written for a book of its type, and its convincing without being sensational. A good true ghost story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Night Stalks the Mansion","review":"I did not read this book because it did not download completely. I couldn't figure how to re-download without paying for the book a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAME OLD SAME OLD","review":"This story has been told countless times.It has the same outcome as \\"The Bell Witch\\"The rape and murder scenerio is a very convienient way to explain away a haunting. The book was a good read. I wasn't creeped out whatsoever. That was the biggest dissapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!!","review":"This book is fascinating. Couldn't put it down until I was done and then I wanted more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooky adventure to read","review":"I loved this book - I received it as a gift and couldn't put it down as soon as I started reading it. It was a fun (and spooky) book to read and all of the \\"paranormal\\" happenings described were very realistic and believable if you have an open mind. Makes you wonder..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic. A 'must read'","review":"This is one of my all time favourite books. It's one of those books that you can't put down until the end. I find most 'true' ghost stories seem to be almost over written, to the point that they become cheesey and unbelievable. This one is done matter of factly and is about day to day life in a historic and very haunted old house. I am looking forward to the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this house.","review":"I used to love this house. I went to DCCC, so this was a gathering place for our little parties. I never went into the house (too scared!) and never heard the undead in the driveway (hard to do with the guys trying to scare us); but that house had a vibe to it. Even just driving by it, the house was creepy. I have wanted to read this book forever and was so thrilled when the Kindle edition became available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But...","review":"The reason I couldn't give this book all 5 stars is the fact the family never did any research on the house. Sure they asked their servant, but no one did any offical research into who owned house etc. of the past. This bothered me greatly because some history would have added to story. Was a believable story however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Ghost story","review":"This book was well written, I would not say it was so scary, but the plight of this family really touched me.The Author's pace of writing and the way the book was written made it easy to comprehend the story, and even the story of the previous owners, was heart wrenching, so for all those romantic horror fans, this is the book to read.You will never find a read as such, and it is so bad that ghost stories are not written so well anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly... nothing happens!","review":"A very-low key relating of a \\"true\\" haunting in PA shortly after WWII. Not much beyond some footsteps, doors opening and closing and a few items being transported, but at least it doesn't feel as if the writer is trying to sensationalize the family's experiences. Having done a little research after reading, sounds as if their conclusions, and at least some of their experiences, have no basis in fact -- SHOCK! That all being said, it's an okay read if you're looking for a low-key and not very scary book about a haunting."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I have read this book many times, and it gets better every time. If you want to read a book that will keep you up to the wee hours, hearing every night noise in a new way, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"In a word entertaining. Adopting an orphan to win back the Queen's favor sounds a little far fetched as a story line, but Ms Dodd actually makes it believable. Not her best work, but very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I bought this book based on the high recommendations that I read here. I must admit, I was very disappointed!! The relationship between Pamela and Kerrich was not believable in a romantic way. It seemed like he went from being a big jerk to a sweet loving person. It just didn't seem right. Plus, I didn't even like Kerrich--he was rude, mean and not very noble. I realize that rakes are supposed to be a little bad but he was too much. He didn't have any respect for Pamela and she was just a little too rigid. I didn't enjoy the book. It had great potential but it wasn't what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillarious and fun!","review":"I knew from the excerpt on Christina Dodd's website that I would love this book and I did. Pamela loves nothing more than she loves money and when she meets the arrogant Devon sparks fly. Words fail me on just how wonderful the interaction is between all of the characters. Even the secondary ones will live on in your heart long after you finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christina Dodd doesn't just write - She shines","review":"I cannot start with how great the story was and how the hero made me feel etc etc. Just know that her wit with dialogue is unmatched, her love scenes scream passion and you cannot put down this book to go do anything else until you are done. Or she's finished with you. Lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment!","review":"I'm a fan of several Christina Dodd's books but the Governess Series is just plain awful. The characters are so weak she doesn't even try to bring more of a challenge into these books. It definitely isn't funny whatsoever. All of the characters are annoying, especially the \\"Matchmakers\\" types. Just a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Jane Eyre&#65533;on crack","review":"It starts out okay. Pamela, an ambitious governess dresses as an older, uglier woman because the guy Devon doesn't want some the governess to lust after him. She's a funny creature, admonishing him as \\"Young man\\" and criticizing his \\"animal tendencies\\".The plot is a bit of a stretch. Why the hell did Devon get the idea that he would need to adopt an orphan to become respectable? I don't know. Devon's character includes affinity to children (did you expect anything less). Seems coincidental that all the leading men in romance books like children, eh?The real weakness is the orphan itself. Gosh, that annoying brat killed the heat, damnit! Of course that kiddo Elizabeth was liked by Devon.If you prefer the usage of office equipment for matter of consummation, well, here's a treat for you. But how they do it.. well, it made me skim and wish it was done quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drinking for little kids","review":"This book is full of stupid childish games. No one over the age of ten would ever play these games. You would get your ass kicked if you tried to play any of these games with your friends. I can't stress how stupid they are. Anyone who says this is a good book must not have ever drank a beer in their life or partied with anyone ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demanifest Manifests A New Vision","review":"Demanifest takes you to higher levels of imagination and creativity that surprise and delight. Michael Spoljaric and Stephen Johnston have created a universe for the eye and heart that welcomes both the unexpected and stunning with stark sensibility and lush exploration. There is so much to see and discover that the content accomodates most viewers quite happily. Be prepared for an expansive, new vision that will leave you inspired and wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deconstructive art with a touch of design","review":"A great gather of experimental art. Many explorations with paper, photos, collage, drawings, and digital work. A great example of the thin border between art & computers.Very well designed book too. Minimal and concise.I do not regret a penny spent on this and I love the smell of it, truly. Does anyone knows which paper it is printed?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad Book!!!!!","review":"This book is a pice of crap. Is a construction paper catalog with a few words!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book improperly packaged","review":"What started out as a 'good' condition book was turned into a 'below average' one, by being packaged poorly by the seller. The problem is this, a thin plastic envelope twice as big as the book without padding was used.This had the effect on the book as if it was tumbled in a dryer in transit or another analogy of a hamster in a hamster ball rolling down stairs. The cover on the book was badly creased in three places,the spine of the book was cracked horizontally in the middle. The top corner was banged up.Finally 3/4 of the pages and the cover were so curled upon the lower right hand corner that when you set the book down on the table there is a 1\\" gap between the book pages and the cover which would not close.I've received many books in the mail through Amazon. This was by far the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Health Food Fraud","review":"For search criteria I looked for a non-fat organic snack product and this product was one of the few that popped up. First of all, it is NOT organic. A single serving gives 5% of my daily fat, 15% of daily sodium and 5% of daily carbohydrates. The ingredients list shows evaporated cane juice (which means sugar). But its worse than that because the individual serving bags in the box each are supposed to be 1.3 servings, which means that the numbers disclosed are nearly a third too low for anyone who eats the contents of what appears to be a single-serving bag. So far as I am concerned this product is too salty and tastes more like junk food than health food. Unfortunately, I now have 23 bags of these awful things to get rid of. BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"need to get a shipper who actually gets the product delivered","review":"once again the shipping stunk. ordered the barbeque flavor and got it. then got notified that this flavor was returned. no attempt to contact us other that to say our money would be refunded.

The track titles are all mixed up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real deal....","review":"The Soledad Brothers have been around for ten years, and they may one of the last Detroit bands from the scene that spawn The White Stripes and The Von Bondies. They have released many albums but nothing that expresses their rage and glory. Voice of treason may that record that catapults them into the forebrain of the collective imagination. They are dedicated to the blues. \\"Cage That Tiger\\" is a sign of good things to come. Some bands think that they are playing the blues, but listen to things like \\"Son of Dogs\\" and you know that this band is the rightful heir to John Lee Hooker and Canned Heat. I look forward to checking these guys out live for real. They seem like a band that should break out. The blues live on in this music."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Banks? Santo? Williams? Jenkins? How about Hartnett?","review":"I was very interested in this DVD until I discovered, much to my dismay, that there were no games from the '69 team - nor '45! No wonder the GREAT Ron Santo has been kept out of the HOF! These young pup sportswriters never SAW him play! We need a decent DVD with the earlier years... with Billy Williams, Ron Santo and Randy Hundley, Fergie Jenkins and Jim Hickman, Gabby Hartnett's \\"Homer in the Gloamin'\\" and Grover Alexander, Jimmy Foxx and Rogers Hornsby, and never, never forget \\"Kessinger to Beckert to Banks!!!

We have enjoyed watching this and will continue to enjoy it from time to time. Great to add to a collection of baseball."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cubs fans, rejoice","review":"If you're a die-hard Chicago Cubs fan, you are required to own this DVD set. Sadly, it's sorely lacking on game footage of legends like Ernie Banks, Ron Santo and Billy Williams, and the bonus features come up a little short, but the complete broadcast games featuring the 1989 and '84 playoffs (the good games -- the wins) is great stuff. Plus, Steve Bartman is nowhere to be found in the entire set, although the 1998 one-game playoff win over the Giants would have been a nice addition."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sandberg Game! & more","review":"The Sandberg game was the best baseball game I ever saw. Tonight I saw it again for the first time in almost 23 years. I cannot think of a better sports DVD to buy, rent, or watch.

Yes they are sold out at the moment. However this is just like the monster high craze. Pricing like this is the same as when people were gas gauging. You should be ashamed at yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intimate look at Fromm","review":"I have loved the works of Erich Fromm since I was a sophomore in high school. His impact is immense, though his relevancy has been belittled by the Frankfurt School (omitting his contributions - and his development of the basics - of their major theories).When I heard of an Erich Fromm biography written by his long - time companion, Rainer Funk, I was excited. I bought the book as soon as I could, and I was very pleased with it.It has a lot of photos of and relating to Fromm that are hard to find, and give an intimate look into his life and ideas - not just what his ideas were, but why he thought them. Fromm's semi-autobiographical work, \\"Beyond the Chains of Illusion\\" offer a bit of insight into his life, but it is interesting to see the characters actually given faces.This book is great for anyone interested in Fromm, whose humanism is hard to surpass. It explains in the way only Funk could what Fromm's life was like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"This book is an illustrated biography of one of the most well known psychologists of the 20th century. Fromm had a varied career and his fame spread far beyond the confines of traditional psychoanalysis and sociology. This biography, written by his literary executor, Dr. Rainer Funk, outlines the life and work of Erich Fromm in a good way."},{"rating":"1","title":"No bang for the buck... look elsewhere!","review":"I'm disappointed again! Maxtor sells this product for 229.00 at Costco and one month after I bought it... (discounting madness strikes), and voila, 151.00!. The software that comes with this monster is worse than a dos batch program on a 286. Backup is not possible with this antiquated, barely functional excuse called ver 1.something or other. And this beauty REPLACES my cold, dead, frozen Maxtor external, 200gig... that one day after a year or so, (warantee over) decided to just roll over like my cat and never speak to me again.

After about 15 months or 3 months after the warranty expired, I was unable to write the to the drive and I started hearing that clicking sound you usually hear when a hard drive dies. Considering the poor reliability of this drive and the fact that other manufacturers like Seagate have warranties going up to five years I kinda feel like an idiot for buying this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure to operate","review":"The Maxtor came recommended, but the software on mine seemed to be corrupted, and it was returned. It was replaced with a different model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maxtor drives are terrible, buyer BEWARE","review":"I bought two of these drives, and they both broke and lost all my data in the 11th month of my owning them. Maxtor will not stand behind their drives for longer than a year beyond their manufacture. Pretty low confidence in their products, don't you think? When you buy a hard drive, you expect your data to be there for at least a year. Not these. I strongly reccommend that you do not buy these drives. They are awful products, and Maxtor as a company is extremely poor. You will be sorry if you buy them, I can guarantee it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid Maxtor","review":"Hard drive died after 3 weeks. This is garbage. I lost 40 - 60 hours of work. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a few notes . . . UPDATE","review":"I do a lot of archiving onto both external hard drives and optical disks in my photography business. I own three Maxtors: 150, 250 and 300. I found the software to be worse than worthless, but the drives work just fine.I drag and drop files onto the current drive when I need it. Afterwards I turn the drive off to avoid wear and tear.I had trouble with my old 150 GB drive once because I had it formatted at FAT32 instead of NTFS, but now it's fine. I still back up onto optical disks as well, although they aren't safe either. Nobody seems to have a bulletproof archival system, so play it safe.UPDATE: I still pull data off this hard drive years later. It still works fine on my new Win 7 64 bit machine. To repeat: I do not use Maxtor's lame software, just the hard drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good backup solution","review":"I have three major gripes.1-It is sloooow. Even though it has Fire wire/Usb2.0 (bursts) it takes forever for the backup interface to open.2- As mentioned already in previous reviews it does not back-up system files nor will it back up all my folders in My documents. Not sure why. The back-up interface is too simplistic and doesn't have many options.3-It's noisy. Grinds and sounds like my old SCSI HDD.I wished I had read more reviews before I purchased this drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning for Mac OSX users","review":"The software on this drive doesn't work. I spent an hour on the phone with Maxtor customer service and they couldn't solve it. The drive works as a simple backup for important data but their Retrospect Express, the software which performs the automated backups, synchronization, etc.) doesn't work. If you want a simple drive with extra space where you drag and drop data to be saved, this is a nice drive to have but forget the automating features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maxtor+Seagate = Data Disaster Waiting to Happen","review":"I owned two of these drives, and both failed within a year of purchase. Both times I had valuable photographs and videos of my baby on the drives.Maxtor (who has since been aquired and gutted by Seagate) offered to recover the data... for only $1000.00 dollars! But they'd give me a new OneTouch.There are many other drives available, take my word for it... AVOID SEAGATE AND MAXTOR. Your business / entertainment and memories are too valuable to be left to a shell of a company that's coasting along on an old reputation, that today is only looking to make money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke down within couple of weeks","review":"Got it a couple of weeks ago, after seeing its good reviews.Worked great for a couple of weeks..I filled it with 200GB of backups and music. Yesterday it broke down, despite having a power surge protector. It looked like power issue, as I heard a sound...while running and my OS no longer could see the USB drive.The most unfortunate thing is that Seagate provides no free data recovery services, even under warranty...they can only replace...which is really bad...their data recovery services are priced/charged based on data size recovered...i think.Luckily, I did not erase all the source data...just lost about 1GB in all...trying to recover it through data recovery services...but this really is bad. Looks like seagate does not care about maxtor products...as they offer exchanges for defective maxtor products under warranty by new maxtor drives or OLD refurbished seagate drives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great... Until it doesn't.","review":"So I've had mine for about six or seven months, and was completely happy until it died! It seems like that's the consensus of these reviews, people are satisfied with the Maxtor until it suddenly stops working, and then they're very unhappy, as I am. I plan on contacting the new owners of Maxtor and trying to get it replaced, but from reading other people's reviews I probably won't get any of that data back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable Book","review":"The claim on the cover of this book \\"Everyone who reads The Incredible Catholic Mass will think of his Mass attendance in terms of before and after this book.\\" rang true for me. I feel much closer to Jesus during the Mass now that I understand exactly what it's for and why Christ instituted it. I knew the Mass was an important means of worshiping God, but I had no idea how much we personally gain by devout attendance. I wish I could go every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book about Mass","review":"This book explains the nature and essence of the Holy Sacrifice of Mass, its real meaning and significance. After its reading, nobody will ever face the Holy Mass the same way again, having understood what truly happens there: the bloodless renovation of Christ's sacrifice in favour of a sinful mankind. The reader will increase in a great scale his devotion towards Mass and will assist its celebration much more frequently with major profitableness. Highly recommend for real catholics!A final note: the author, Father Martin von Cochem, lived during the second half of the 17th century and the first quarter of the 18th century, much before the disastrous Second Vatican Council; the Mass analysed in his work is obviously the eternal Roman Rite Mass - the Tridentine Mass -, not the extravagant New Order Mass of Paul VI; the book can only be fully perceived having that factor in consideration."},{"rating":"1","title":"GAS & GAFFS","review":"It's a GAS fireplace...need I say more?Actually, yes, someone in the background dropped something, the microphone probably.

Overall, this is the best Green Day single you'll find probably."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a Month","review":"That's about how long it took me to read this book. Not because I'm slow, just because I did not enjoy it. If I didn't know any better I would have assumed this book was Adler's first attempt at a novel. But it isn't. Well, the main characters are likeable enough. I'll give her that. Except for the alcoholic old woman. She added nothing to the book. The plot is weak, there is too much dialouge, and too little effort put in. By the end of Ed's killer is revealed. I couldn't really recall why he wanted Ed dead. But I didn't care.

I'm very happy to have it and am going to buy some of the others in the series... Beethoven, Bach, Chopin...The orchestras playing here are world-class in every way, and the clarity and richness of the sound is great, unlike some classical albums you buy where the sound sounds like it was recorded from a transistor radio.my only gripe with this CD is that, while the song titles listed include \\"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik\\", one of Mozart's most famous pieces, this CD includes only 3 movements of this piece, none of which are the MAIN theme...and that is a big disappointment. This is why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. For someone like me who is not a hard-core classical listener, this is (almost) perfect.... a handful of his greatest pieces, rendered beautifully and for a price that's more than fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"G-CODE?!!

I ordered the book. I returned the book. I am not taking the course.The authors may be excellent organizers. The book has plenty of structure with this indentation of one type related to that indentation of another type. The problem is the prose. Like Chinese food served in Montana, the prose lack zest. Classical mythology, my main interest, is full of passion; the authors have sucked the passion out of the stories.And one other thing, Star Wars is not myth in any sense that makes myth interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best, not for serious scholars","review":"I am a literature major and had high expectations for this mythology class and textbook. I was, needless to say, terribly disappointed. There are historical inaccuracies, outrageous assumptions, unsupported claims, and MANY technical writing errors such as making no effort to qualify their statements. This is a sloppily written, skim-the-surface text composed for those who don't know any better or who just don't care.

Thank heavens for the interesting middle -- otherwise, this is not worth the price of the hardback nor my precious reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to be stubborn to finish this book","review":"In Maine, as I write this, it is \\"Mud Season\\", which was an appropriate time, as it turned out, for me to read Dark Lady. It appears that Richard North Patterson is going through his Mud Season period with this effort. I agree with those that point out that he is unable to write convincingly in the mind of a woman. I agree with those who have said that the plot of this book is confusing at times; that the characters are not fleshed out and in the end you really don't give a damn about Stella or the problems and issues she is dealing with. In a word, it is a tedious read. I have usually enjoyed this writer. Many of his earlier novels were first rate, but this is not one of them. I hope that the next effort will be more succesful and that he gets back to the type of writing he is clearly capable of."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lot of Navel Gazing Before We get To The Real Story","review":"The protagonist spends a long time reliving her past in the Polish section of Somerset (Cleveland) before we get to really solving the central crimes. She is a senior assistant DA with political amibitions and I was beginning to think I was reading an Advise and Consent scaled down for Northest Ohio before we got down to actual crime solving. Once the author did it was a pretty good story. It just took way too long to get started. The author is well know and most of his works are best sellers so this can't be typical of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not Great","review":"This book was enjoyable reading even though some parts dragged out more than necessary. The cast of characters were somewhat confusing but it was all brought together nicely in the end. There were some interesting twists and story lines within the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Slow Moving Novel!","review":"Having just finished reading all of the fascinating and unbelievably good Phillip Margolin novels, I decided to try another author in that same genre. Well, Richard N. Patterson doesn't even come close to the quality of Margolin. I picked up Dark Lady because I saw it in soooo many stores that it drove me crazy, so I decided to read it. Good thing that I got it for half price because it is so boring. Too much of a history lesson thoroughout the first 30 pages. It is a typical drug/ murder novel with nothing that is very exciting. I don't care for the main character, Stella Marz, at all. This book is mainly a time-filler novel. Try the other Patterson, JAMES PATTERSON, that's a good novelist."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wrongful Dedication","review":"With mediocre editorial and customer reviews, I bought this book with hopes of being surprised. I did not get past the dedication page. George Bush...please! Anyone want a brand new copy? It is so near the trash; however, I have never thrown away any book, regardless of how bad it was. This one breaks the streak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patterson has done it again","review":"Dark Lady starts with a bang and never lets up. The crime is startling and complex,the legal atmosphere authentic. Patterson uses his trial lawyer's gifts to create a character in Stella Marz who seems to turn the pages by herself. Patterson again deals with real issues most writers shy away from. He never pulls his punches and Dark Lady is a knockout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murder and Corruption in a Tired Town","review":"Like other reviewers, I was also disappointed with Richard North Patterson's \\"Dark Lady.\\" When you can't be truly interested in the characters it is difficult to become involved in their lives. It took about half of the book for it to really get moving and even then it was too late, because we already knew what was going to happen. I personally am getting very tired of authors deciding to 'kill the cat' or the dog for that matter. I don't enjoy predictable books and this one didn't even begin to stretch my mind. I surely hope RNP will take some more time, if that's what it takes, to get back to his former stature. I did enjoy \\"No Safe Place\\" unlike the critics, but this one should not have been published, at least under his real name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downhill story","review":"I love the other Patterson books I've read so was very surprised with this one. Very slow start and then I kept finding myself having to go backwards to check if I'd missed something. I hate books that do this to me. Not sure what happened but this book definitely gets a thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"Glad I got this one from the rental rack at the library! No courtroom drama, characters you don't care much about, and predictable local \\"intrigue\\" all make for a disappointing read. Hardly what I expected from the author of Degree of Guilt and Silent Witness. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"The book has all the variables of a Patterson book, but it doesn't jell. It does not have any of the i-have-to-keep-reading stuff of his past books. I wish it had started 2/3 through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Better","review":"This book started out slow -- petty politics and not really understanding who the players are and how they are related. Story pick's up about half-way through for about 70 pages or so, and then down hill again. You are left with the feeling, who cares and what did all this mean? Why was this story interesting to us? Die hard fans will probably still enjoy this book, but after No Safe Place and this one, I don't plan on picking up another hard back of his soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so","review":"I've read a couple of Richard North Patterson novels and have enjoyed them. I'm on page 213 right now and I'm having trouble getting through it. I really enjoy the scenes where you can gain insight into the characters (like Stella's past,etc.). Patterson is excellent when it comes to getting inside of the characters. But, the political and legal babble is BORING, BORING, BORING. This book would be great if they weren't building a baseball stadium:-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"Again, I was greatly disappointed with this book as I was with Patterson's A Safe Place. I used to love his books, but I am bored beyond belief now. Am I the only one who has seen the change in his writing! I long for another Silent Witness. I doubt if I will buy another of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"As entertaining as watching paint dry.","review":"I can't wrap my brain around that RNP actually wrote this book. It's slow, boring, and hard to follow. I bought this book because I really liked Stella marz from Silent Witness, but to be honest, she doesn't seem anything like the character RNP created in Silent Witness. Overall, take a pass on this snoozer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard for me to follow","review":"I did manage to read the entire book but had difficulty making all the connections between different characters. Maybe it was just me but there is a possibility it was also the plot.....In case you find yourself not understanding what is going on, just keep plugging along as it all does come together eventually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold together, far from Patterson's best","review":"Hey I love Cleveland and wanted to love this book. But the mob/big money/politics connection is about as obvious and hackneyed as plot devices come. Also the key clue that finally pulls everything together is laughably convenient and unbelievable. And why is Marz the one who finds this all important clue? No cop or homicide detective would have found it before her. Come on... The surprising best part here is the love story betwen Marz and her little helper. If it weren't for that, the book would fall completely flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dark Lady was a wretched read","review":"What an absolutely horrid novel. I have read and enjoyed Mr. Patterson's other books, but definitely not this one. The plot was boring, the characters ill developed, and the storyline uneventful. Advise: avoid this book like it was the black plague!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Suspense?","review":"I found the book to be slow, the characters to be uninteresting. The book seems to be more of a character book, with characters that one does not care about, than a mystery. It totally lacks suspense! The only reason I was determined to finish is that I paid for it. If I had checked it out of the library, it would have been returned months ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed But Still A Patterson Fan","review":"I have enjoyed everything that I have read by Patterson. When I bought Dark Lady, I also bought Patterson's latest novel, Protect and Defend. I couldn't put Protect and Defend down until I finished it. I have struggled for almost a month to finish Dark Lady. Dark Lady is suspiciously like a John Grisham novel instead of a Robert North Patterson novel. If I had wanted Turow or Grisham, I would have bought Turow or Grisham. If I want Patterson, I want to see the sophistication that I saw in No Safe Place, Protect and Defend and Final Judgment. I haven't found that high quality in Dark Lady. I am a little embarrassed to be writing about a novel I couldn't finish. But what is it they say about a new pair of shoes? If the shoes don't fit well when you buy them they probably never will. Alas, I fear this book won't get any better. I regret having to say that since I enjoy Patterson so much. Dark Lady is not a keeper in that fine Patterson tradition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just promotes seterotypes !","review":"I read Silent Witness by JNP and loved it so I moved on to this one. Boy what a waste of my time. The story moved S L O W. First of all it gives the impression that the construction industry is just ripe with scandels and corruption. I work for one of the oldest land developers in the nation and am here to tell you that is just not true. It seems to be the reputation that the industy has gotten over time but it is not the norm. Another thing I was offened by was that MBEs just show up to collect a paycheck and not to work - once again FALSE.I think the book does more to promote sterotypes than to entertain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I really like this author, and that's why I was very disappointed in this book. It took me way too long to finish it because it takes over 200 pages to even begin to grab you. And even then it's a flaccid grab. The story-building goes on forever, and I kept wondering when this was going to kick into a higher gear. Definitely not a keeper, and extremely forgetable."},{"rating":"1","title":"After all of his other great reads, a major letdown.","review":"If you are a fan or Richard North Patterson, as am I, save yourself the money and more importantly the time. He attempts, and fails, at writing a darker tail of deceipt. His fictional town of Steeltown is contrived and not at all believable. His plot is disjointed and his characters belong in Greek tragety. Go back to San Francisco Mr. Patterson and leave the dark Rust Belt for more accomplished writers like John Updike. Stick to your knitting. We would all be much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating Disappointment","review":"I have read and enjoyed all of RNP's books, and was thrilled to trip over this one, which I had not read. What a letdown. I am on page 90, and have decided to give up on it. It has been a real chore to get this far, and I feel that if I dread picking up a book and read it out of some sort of misplaced duty, it's time to give up on it. (I've only given up on two books before--Hunt for Red October, because there was too much technical stuff and I ended up tossing it across the room, and Turow's Pleading Guilty for much the same reason I don't like this one.) The character development just doesn't happen. I don't care what happens to any of them, another good reason not to finish a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"For me, this was definitely a book I could put down and I did - often. Although well written, I would never recommend this book as a 'good read'. I had no empathy with the main character and the book was slow moving and unexciting. I give it two stars as at least I managed to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Lady","review":"I am always anxiously awaiting Richard North Pattersons new books and courtroom drama. This one was difficult to finish. Uninteresting and uneventful. I'll look forward to the next one but I hope he returns to his satisfying and suspenseful style of old."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is very lightweight compared to his others.","review":"After reading DARK LADY I felt very relieved that it had finally come to an end. I have read many of Mr. Patterson's books and hated to get to the last page (The biggest compliment one can give a good mystery.) This was just a chore. Sorry Mr. P!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely weak","review":"Having read all of RNP's books, I was expecting a lot more. I even \\"saved\\" the book to savor on a long flight to Bangkok, thinking that it would provide ample divertissement. Wrong. The first two thirds just dragged and dragged. (Hey, the idea was to keep me *awake* and reset my internal time clock, not bore me into somnolence!). The denouement is tricky and brings together all the disparate plot elements, but by then I coulda cared less."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"This book was very difficult to get through. It didn't have any of the suspenseful pacing of his other terrific novels. The murders are unnecessarily grotesque and the characters are almost caricatures. Although the story line is admirably complex, that's not enough to save this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"no title","review":"This was one of the best books I have read in a while. Wonderful feminist story. Make a marvelous movie for someone like a young Kathleen Turner. Spans a woman's life from the time she is twelve til she is 42; ends in about 1922. Starts with a harrowing scene of the death of her father from a sawblade. If written a little heavy-handed, still manages a very good story, even illicit sex and adultery. Lots of good scenes for film script. Lilla manages to overcome the stilted mores of her mother and the times. Takes place in Chicago and Wilmette. Herrick obviously a local boy. Much comparison could be made here between Lilla and her mother and many mothers and daughters of today. In the book, the two can never come to a meeting of the minds . They have totally different mind-sets, morals, values, etc. They just do not speak the same language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Use and Tailor for Your Students","review":"Midway through the school year, I picked this book up on a whim. Fountas and Pinnell have always been tremendous resources and this book is no exception. I used it primarily as a tool to fill in the gaps I was seeing in my students' knowledge. For example, they struggled with -ed endings and I used the corresponding chapter to teach on -ed endings for a week. Each lesson has an explicit objective (which is helpful when you're struggling to explain the rules of phonics!). It then lists a lesson and individual work for the students to do (e.g. word sorts). At the end of the lesson, follow-ups are suggested such as assessments, written assignments, and related read alouds.Overall, this book is a tremendous resource that makes skills and word work easy to teach. My students were engaged with the lessons and work. I look forward to using it for an entire school year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!!!","review":"This book has great ideas for teaching phonic skills. Wanted to expand my background knowledge for the common core standards and find some activities that would be fun and increase knowledge for my struggling kindergartners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design flaw...","review":"This product has a fatal design flaw. The two eye pieces are a fixed distance apart. If the width of your eyes are not the same as the binoculars, then you can only see properly through either the left or right lense, but not both. If you try to view using both, and your eyes are not wide enough, the center of your view has a blocked-out portion which is annoying. My eyes are not wide enough apart, so I can't use both lenses. The magnification is not as impressive as the other views state. However, the stabilization feature does work well, although I don't see it as such a needed feature really. I'd much rather be able to see through both lenses clearly. I plan to return them, and purchase a pair that has adjustable lense width."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful journey","review":"This is a very well done book and audio.

Unfortunately when I got it, I couldn't get it to run on my Vista Laptop or Apple. That's the problem with Vista, it makes everything obsolete.I'm sure if you have an older Windows operating system, it works excellent; but if it won't work on Vista, what good will it be in a few years, when everything is Vista. If they upgrade it to operate on Vista and future Window systems that would be great. While they're at it, maybe they can make it run on Apple also.I have Stephen Recker's \\"Virtual Gettysburg\\" and that works on my Vista system. It is also an excellent Gettysburg guide and you can get it at Amazon. I would also like to say, Amazon was excellent when it came to retuning the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Mac Users","review":"I was very interested in this product as it seems to have everything for someone unacquainted with Gettysburg.

I bought this book because I thought it may be useful to recommend to couples planning to marry. It's not useful, at least not for Australians. The reason is that the ceremonies are excessively religious and therefore only suitable for use in a religious enviroment. Australia is a secular country, by and large, with Sundays and religious holidays devoted to sport and good times, with most church congregations elderly and few in number. Fewer than half the weddings performed in Australia are religious and for those the couple doesn't get much choice - it's the published liturgy of the religion concerned, take it or leave it. For Australian civil ceremonies the book is little help. Apart from the religious-ness the ceremonies are too short and too mushy for Australian tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really very good.","review":"The best thing that I can say about this book is that, unlike many mass-market genre paperbacks, there aren't a whole lot of typos and other sloppy editing mistakes in it. There are a couple, but not enough to complain about. And the characters are resonably, if not exceptionally, well-handled.Unfortunately, the basic plot is silly, it is handled poorly, and resolved in a very unsatisfactory way. Granted, it isn't the worst Star Trek novel I've read -- not by a long shot -- but it's definitely in the bottom third. I wouldn't bother with it unless you're just desperate for a Star Trek novel and the only other ones handy that you haven't read are ones that I've given one-star reviews to; there are a few of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"a yawner.........","review":"Had hoped for much more... it's the type of book that sets up the conflict for 200 pages, massages it for 60 more, and then resolves it in only 10!!

Played it myself I did in public a few times. Over the years, many of these songs have sunk in--age has a way of humbling you into understanding.

And that, after all, is the most important thing. I've been drawing for nearly half a century, but these keys have pushed my drawing to an entirely new level.

Now it's my turn to praise the book and its content. My son (13) has been reading and working through the projects for the past few days, and I can't believe the work that he has turned out. The explanations are clear, and the projects help you work on particular drawing techniques.

It teaches you how to draw what you actually see, instead of what you think you should be seeing. I had never taken a drawing class before but now I can draw anything that I have enough patience to sit in front of for a few hours. If you are a beginner, get this one. It's the best. (I still can't get through the first chapter of the left brain/right brain book. Boring.)

However, I cannot even give it three stars and say anything else good about it. Picture entering a bar with heavy smoke and just hearing fast techno. With hearing this, it is not quite what I would call compiled right. I'll hear 4 or 5 good songs on hear, but it does not have a consistant beat with songs that make nearly half this fabric boring. This is boring where I would be more amuzed watching grass grow.I am not a Luke Slater fan.

Fabric 32 by Luke Slater is one of those albums for me. Classified as \\"techno\\" this album has Slater attempting to hybridized multiple genres of electronica. Perhaps to complicate the classification scheme even more? Like a failed chemistry experiment, Fabric 32 does end up with a final product, but it is far from pleasant.To make it even more painful, you can hear some great rifts of music and groovey beats in the distant background on multiple tracks, but they are quickly swallowed up by noise and garbage each and ever time. Horrible track selection and horrible mixing. Sorry Slater, try again.1.5/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"IS makes a world of difference!","review":"Without the IS system, I can only look through these things for a few minutes before my trembling hands have me nauseous. But the IS allows me to look through these as long as I can support them. Like another reviewer, I find I have to fold down the eye cups for a better view.I fail to understand why Canon can't include a cover for the objective lenses, particularly at this price tag. Aside from that, the only complaint worth mentioning is that they are rather heavy, and you won't be pointing these at the sky for too long without a tripod or something supporting your elbows.If you can afford them and don't mind a little weight, you will be pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Binoculars","review":"I have earlier bought Swarovski 10x42W and Leica Ultravid 12x50HD binoculars and they are great but very expensive... and there is no image stabilizer.This time I wanted better magnification and this requires image stabilizer. Canon 18x50 IS exceeded my expectations - the stabilizer really does what it should. I first planned to buy 15x but it is good that I finally ordered 18x. The binoculars are a little heavy for women but in my hands they are ok.When you add UV filter or some other filter, they protect the lenses from scratches and naturally help on their own way, too.Why would anybody buy anymore traditional binoculars without image stabilizer and pay even much more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but could use a little upgrade","review":"As mentioned in other reviews the eyepiece rubber needs to be rolled back or trimmed to get a good view through them. I will most likely end up trimming mine as the rubber is thick when you roll it back and does not leave much room for your nose and comfort.Other than that the view is superb, not quite as good as Zeiss but close enough when you factor in the stabilizer. Very noticeable difference between using them with the system on vs off...."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will float your boat.","review":"My ten years with a $1,000 pair of Steiners was a long and happy relationship. Few things on a boat last that long or work so well. However......in pitching seas I never really mastered their use and when I needed them most, they served me the least. Along comes a nifty boat show demonstration of the new Canon Image Stabilizers (in an 18x50 setup....excellent for open water) and voila, the Steiners become below-decks backups and the Canons rise to the bridge. They are magnificent, with great optics, very good balance and of course the incredible advantage of image stabilization that actually works in 6 foot seas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"I needed a good set of binoculars for my wife & me. We are in excellent bear & deer country in Wisconsin and like to ride around watching the wildlife. I am a disabled Vietnam Vet and my hands shake a lot. Spotting scopes and high powered binoculars never worked well for me in the past. You touch them and everything goes out of focus. These image stabilizers work great! For the first time I can really zoom in and see clearly. They are a little heavy and you wouldn't want to carry them around your neck long. But overall I love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Heavy for Everyday Birdwatching Without a Pod","review":"This birder, who has a Zeiss, two Nikons, a Leica, a Swarovski, a Bushnell and two other Canons, should have known better, but didn't adequately consider this unit's 43.2-ounces, almost three pounds. The verdict after a first outing in Fairfield County, CT: Very heavy in the field in a standing position despite good not great IS. 15-power magnification is obviously a lot, one trade-off being six meters, about 20 feet, the nearest focus. The focus knob is fast and smooth, the image is bright, & the ergonomics are reasonable. For a specific assessment of the optics this reviewer will defer to the pros."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly recommended","review":"this is a very nice product. better than expected. clear and stable views.

We took them to the Galapagos Islands and they performed well. Teh IS really assists with ship rocking and minor shakes. I have a few thoughts that would make these binoculars more user friendly.1. Try to make them lighter. My wife found it difficult to carry them for extended periods of time.2. Please add fip open ocular and objective lens caps rather than the loose caps. These get lost and the ones tied to the binocular body make it easier to cover the lneses in inclement weather.3. Making the units water proof and not just resistent would be a big factor for those of us who use the binoculars in nature photography especiall in a canoe or kayak.4. Having an optional camera adaptor would be great for photography buffs.Overall this binocular is a great addition to the human eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Stable product","review":"Buy these if you are into bird watching (any type) live sports, or just want to hear you friends say \\"WOW!\\" when you turn the image stabilizer on when they are looking through these binoculars.Worth every penny!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best binocular I have ever owned","review":"The Canon 18 X 50 image stabilizer binocular is the eassiest binocular I have ever used, The stabilizer is also the industry best and gives the user a clear view of whatever is be locked at with out wory over shakes at the eye level"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eyecups too stiff","review":"Great in every way except the eyecups are waaaay too stiff for me. Using them for birding and long periods of trying to figure out what you're looking at, you have to pull them hard into your eye sockets to exclude the side-light. Over time, this is painful. I compared them with my old 15x45 Canon IS which were comfortable and could almost gather as much detail. By comparison, the 18x50's seem to have better contrast and maybe a better stabilization.... but not as user friendly so - I sent them back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"The reviews must have been written by Cannon representatives.

Not only is it beautifully designed, but the plot is equally well-constructed. It captured my attention from the sexy prologue (check out the \\"tight buns\\" description, ladies) but the suspenseful plot should also appeal to guys.The author has all the details right, along with providing a strong, believable and ironic love story.

The big disappointment was the noise generated by the movement of the disc player--in many cases, the whirring noises were louder than the music I wanted to listen to. Unless you plan on cranking the volume consistently, or all your music has a loud enough bass note to overpower the constant \\"whrrr\\" sound, you'll probably be happier with a less funky design that offers a little more insulation. A couple of additional notes--the pictures shown of the stereo have brightly colored circles on each of the three discs. These are cardboard shipping materials that pop out. Also, each disc area has a big red light under it, and a round green light in the middle. Kind of cool, but brighter than you might expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great design!","review":"This unit has a long list of features that are very useful and the fact that it can be wall mountable fit the bill perfect for me. The SMV 100 has great sound for the money. I love to watch the front panel open and close with a push of a button on the remote. Features I like the most: Digital tuning(40 preset), Random play on any of the 3 CD's, Clock and music sleep timer plus a ton of remote functions.

Although it is a long book, it does not have to be read all at once, for one chapter or topic does not depend upon another, and, indeed, it is good to read over a period of time, in order to be able to reflect upon each topic and how the Western World may -- or may not--regard it differently.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Pay Extra For A Sony","review":"I paid extra to buy a Sony with the expectation that it would be a more reliable product and with the further expectation that if I were to have problem with the monitor that Sony would stand behind its product.

Maybe this is something that would get better with time as the leather stretches with wear, but I couldn't help but think that it was so tight on my Color Sidekick that it might damage the screen or wear off the paint prematurely had I continued using this case.I have gone with the cheaper Neoprene case and like that one much better.

The language and grammar of the book might have you confused for a moment, at least it did for me, but if you re-read the first chapter or so you'll understand how the author writes. The characters are brilliant but, even though it has a some-what lack of description to them, you can feel a lot of what their life and personality is like. Then again you can picture what they look like and let your imagination mold together the more fine details of the characters.

It's a fiction book and the main character is about a teenage boy, named John. He goes to middle school and he deals with problems. He lives in his house with his mother and his mother's boyfriend. He doesn't talk to anyone. He chooses to talk in his mind all the time than rather tell people whats going on in his life. John is abused by his mother's boyfriend. His mother of course doesn't have a clue about it. No one does. His music teacher gets suspicious that something's going on that he won't tell him. It seems like he's not too happy. His mother's boyfriend always blames him for everything and even abuses John's dog.I recommend this book to anyone. I loved this book. I enjoyed it very much.

Being a 13 year old boy, it's very hard to find a book to read an actually enjoy it. I can't say I've ever really enjoyed a book that I read. I picked this book up at the book fair, the first pages had my doubts because of its freakish begininning. I really got into the book as I encountered realistic situations that would occur through the eyes of a teenage boy. I almost felt as if I was in a virtual reality game while someone else was controlling me. I often found myself staying up late night to read the book, and even found myself reading it in school. In school many people starred me down because I was laughing so hard. This book is truely well written and will make anyone entertained within seconds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting","review":"This book was an exciting story. It is about a young boy whom's father ran off when he was younger. His mother however, is dating and shacking up with another man who abuses John. John hates him but knows that his mother likes him.

Reccommended for teens at least 12 yrs. old."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review that's not a review","review":"Because if it was, you'd actually get a solid opinion about this book. It's the same size and shape of many books before it, but it's not. It's about a detached boy's confused take on his life dealing with home, girls, school, and violence. He's Holden at 12 years old with continually building suspense leading to a drop off and a free fall.The fall is glorious. The journey is bittersweet.

I think the basic story was good, but the author's technique of describing action over the course of several pages and then telling you none of it actually happened grew extremely tedious. Once or twice within the novel would be fine, but it was used over and over. Also, after the twentieth time I read about \\"the man who isn't my father\\" and the \\"house that isn't a house\\" with the \\"room that isn't a room\\" I wanted to throw the book at the wall and shout, \\"We get it already!\\" I was forced to skip through paragraphs and I hate to do that.

I would not recommend this particular novel written by Mr. Klass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I enjoyed this book! I chose to read it mainly because of the great reviews here on Amazon. I wasn't disappointed.

From the first page you are transported to a world where John, our protagonist, has be place into a situation which he has no control. The words of Mother Teresa who once said that \\"loneliness and the feeling of being unwanted is the most terrible poverty\\" prove all to true in this tale of a forgotten soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need to know him.","review":"this is one of the most compelling abuse stories i have ever read.

It was slow in some parts but you just had to bite down and hold on for the remainder of the ride.When you did that, you were greatly rewarded with exciting suspense and drama. In the end..you'd be glad that you read \\"You don't know me\\" and you might come to realize that when you get to the last word, on the last page, on the final chapter you might have actually read a GREAT book that you will never forget.

I'm sorry that Paul Gross having co-written the story did not put more feeling into his acting in the movie. He was very wooden and the language was so contemporary that it lost it's historical footing as a period piece. I watched my copy I bought on Amazon and will be selling it right back ASAP.

Characters are two dimensional, and you have seen them all before: the brave soldier with a problem with authority, the Colonel Blimp commanding officer, etc, etc. The imagery and metaphors are all cliché and have the subtlety of a brick.

A good idea but so badly executed its not funny, the rip offs from private ryan are so obvious in the combat scenes its just not funny, the acting of private mann is terrible, the whole morphine addiction side track story line is what? Huh? Exactly. The love story is crap, the whole love making between the main character and his nurse sweety on pretty much the frontline of the western front? COME ON!

Overly sweet without any substance or satisfaction. The guy just cannot write. I expect the reason it got popular at all is because it is about Santa. The historical figure stuff is just dumb. And really the wife named Layla thing just bothered me. The pictures throughout are a bit creepy.Was hoping for something a bit more magical instead of it just telling me things happened \\"because they are magic\\".

There were far too many unnecessary details that drew attention away from the story.Something else that constantly pulled me out were the questions posed by Santa to the reader, it was as if the author wanted me to stop thinking about the story and instead realize how improbable it was that it was actually by Santa. I think with the direct questions, \\"That last chapter was rather sad, wasn't it?\\", he was attempting to remember a quainter time...it does not work for him.If you want an innovative and beautiful Christmas read, try The Legend of Holly Claus by Brittney Ryan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Show how commercialism married Christianity and Superstition","review":"Guinn's book, read properly, demonstrates historical attempts to pervert the reality of Christianity by tainting the Nativity of our Lord with legends, myths, magic, and commercialism.

Little did I know, at the time, was that I stumbled across a true Christmas treasure.THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF SANTA CLAUS tells the complete story of Saint Nicholas, from the day that he was born, up until present day. The story is not only a fantastical tale, but features many facts from history, and many Christian undertones.As we are taken on this incredible journey with Santa Claus, we also meet up with many of Santa Claus' good friends, including Mrs. Claus, who also posess the gift of magic.This is a must-read this holiday season for everyone the world over.

I thought I was getting the Nyko brand charging station, but instead I got this. This first thing I don't like about this is that you can't charge the batteries while they are in the remote. Secondly, you can only charge one battery pack at a time. So, if you have two remotes you essentially will still need additional batteries on hand to make sure your remotes don't die on you.This is bad enough, but to make matters worse the battery life is HORRIBLE. I had a battery that had been charging for 6 hours and the station indicated it was fully charged, but when I went to play in lasted LESS THAN 2 HOURS OF PLAY TIME! This is unacceptable. Unfortunately, my regular pair of alkaline batteries lasted me for more than 30 days, so I'm past the return date to take this back. Now you have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend","review":"You can only re-charge one battery at a time and you need to take the battery off the controller.

What I realized is that it has to have something pleasant to focus on, since the scripts are all predictable. I've sat through many with Meg Ryan because she is adorable. Mary Stuart Masterson is not, even though she shuffles, flatfooted in baggy pants the way that Ryan does. With Ryan the shtick is very cute because she is basically charming and beautiful...even if it does seem like it was stolen from Diane Keaton.The most interesting thing about Mary Stuart Masterson is her name. Perhaps she's a fine actress and does well in more serious roles. But in this,a love story, she fails. Christian Slater is better but even his down-and-out personal seems awfully fake.I watched it for about 40 minutes and turned it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful!

I have always searched for the warm, relaxing, romantic melodies that are light, graceful, and musically beautiful. Silvestri, Shore, The Newmans, Kamen, Newton-Howard, Portman....people who's work really climbs into your heart. This disc is a terrific example of this type.Even the few vocal tunes at the begginning are enjoyable.You will be glad you made the purchase.

Anyone in their right mind knows that a guy that met you in this way would not be normal and you wouldn't be all thrilled to meet him. My advice, if you need to throw up something that possibly made you sick, rent this movie and watch it. It shouldn't take long. You may wonder, why did I give it 2 stars.

Christian Slater \\"is almost terminallynice,\\" as the \\"Time Out\\" film guide says. He's a good actor, but the character he plays is too nice and bland to bebelieved. Because of the script, the characters, and the directing, it all adds up to a weak, tiresome film. I'm glad I saw it on TV, so that I could then erase it.

After doing a lot of research I decided to buy a Chamberlain Whisper Drive Opener. After the purchase, i found it very easy to install which took me approximately one hour. The belt movement is very quiet; however, it is not silent. We have now been using this garade door opener for about three years and it has performed flawlessly with the exception of a drive mechanism recently problem. This problem is the result on he door opening a little too much which causes the emergency release lever on the track to hit the stop-pin. Other than this one issue, the opener has performed well. I would recommend this opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent. Get this to upgrade your old chain drive dinosaur before it's too late","review":"I have a two car garage under my house that had 18 year old chain drive openers. Greasy, loud, but reliable. I looked into a keypad accessory, but no accessories are available for such an old model. As a result, I decided to upgrade and pulled the trigger on two of these openers. This product is five star fantastic. Quality product that is smoother, quieter, brighter (two 100W bulbs), and just a giant leap forward for everyone in our household to use. I researched and shopped around and no one beats Amazon on this. It's laughable to see people paying $20 - $50 more (higher price, sales taxes, shipping, etc.) from other online retailers or brick and mortar big box home improvement stores like it's still 1993. I installed both myself. Very easy and straightforward DIY task. Great instructions walk you right thru it. Practically took me longer to take down, dismantle, and stuff the old ones in my trash barrels..."},{"rating":"2","title":"inconsistant quality","review":"I bought two of these and one of them is indeed whisper quiet but the other one is much louder. It is nearly as loud as my old chain drive. It functions however so I'm not sure if I could return it, and I had it all put together and hung from the ceiling by the time I first heard it working. That unit also over-heated while tweaking the safety adjustments, the manual says to run it through a full cycle after each adjustment. It shut down with an overheated diagnostic LED warning after 6 or 7 concurrent up or downs. The door is correctly balanced with brand new extension springs, and I ran both units with the doors released to hear just the motors. One is definitely 3 or 4 times louder. Also one of the clickers didn't work, but it's not a big deal because each unit came with 2 so I still have 1 extra (two single doors on garage)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hidden costs abound","review":"Great door opener--quiet and easy to install--but Sears apparently feels compelled to stick it to the consumer at every turn. It was only after opening the box and taking inventory of the contents that the instructions mentioned that the opener in the box was only good for a 7 foot door. 8 and 10 foot doors require an extension kit--a $75+ (including shipping) box that contains a metal rail and a longer belt. That kit is a rip-off, considering it adds 45% to the original $180 cost of the basic opener. The basic opener also did not include brackets required to mount the system to a finished ceiling nor did it come with extenders required to mount the safety reversing electric eyes in most garages...another \\"accessory\\" you can order from Sears--for an additional charge, of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"remotes are crap!!","review":"Even after changing to a fresh lithium battery my remote only works while directly in front of the garage.

I installed it (with help from a friend) on a 7 foot x 16 foot solid door. The directions were clear and all the parts were in the packaging (no missing parts). The sensors worked without a lot of adjusting. This opener is super quiet, they were not kidding when they said whisper. If you're a novice at doing handyman stuff, ask a friend to help with the install and make sure you have the tools required. Also verify your door size does not exceed the specs for this model. I couldn't be happier with my purchase decision. Great price and no problems at all. I did initially have concerns about purchasing a belt drive vs. screw driven, but it has a 10 year warranty on the belt... the motor is lifetime. For under $200, you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy install for a complicated task","review":"easy install for a complicated taskI order this unit from the lighting deal with Amazon to replace my broken Garage door opener.

It is on my main door that gets used at least 6 times a day. That's conservatively almost 22,000 cycles carrying my 18x9 foot insulated door! My other smaller door (9x9 foot insulated) that gets used maybe 1x per week has had 2 other brand openers in this same time span that were comparatively priced that failed. The last opener on the smaller door went out due to a power surge along with other appliances in my home but this Chamberlain opener still works! We have lost transmitters and this unit is a breeze to reprogram with new ones as well. If it died tomorrow, I would still give it 5 stars for it's years of trouble free service to date. I would definitely buy another when and if this one ever fails."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Garage Opener","review":"I just completed the installation of Chamberlain Whisperdrive. The instructions were very detailed and well explained. The parts were all included and extremely well made. Every component fit together perfectly. This is a rather lengthy project so don't rush the assembly and allow several hours for the install. I was replacing a 28 year old unit so it was somewhat easier since some of the required structural supports were already in place. Once installed, this opener is very quiet. It is really well designed and the keyless entry pad is a bonus. I cannot imagine why any homeowner would not be totally satisfied with this automatic garage door opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Quiet","review":"The opener is very quiet.

No more getting out to open/close the door on those cold or wet days or just getting out of the car period. Although I am in maintenanace, I found this to be fairly easy to install. Someone with the suggested tools and half smart should be able to put it together. It might take them longer than it did me, but I definitely don't think a professional is required unless you just don't want to or physically unable. It is extremely quiet.

Now just got around to put it up and Wow, the rail is only good for 7' doors. I had to shell out another $63 (part, tax, shipping) to Chamberlain to get the 8' accessory kit. That's an additional 32% over the original price! And, the additional part is only an extra 1' piece of metal (rail) and a longer belt. The price for the add on is outrageous! I cannot attest to how this opener works, as I am awaiting the part so I can install it. However, the experience of having to spend 32% more for this is a poor one and this was not a good buy in the end due to the added hidden cost! I searched the Amazon description and nowhere was the 7' limitation mentioned! Shame on Amazon for this! FYI, Chamberlain sells 8' and 10' extension kits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed","review":"Given the number of positive reviews here, i was very disappointed with this unit. The first unit I bought just flat out did not work. Chamberlain customer service sent me a new circuit board to replace the original and still no luck (2 weeks now without a garage door opener). They finally shipped me a whole new unit which did work so 4 weeks after installing the darn thing I finally had a door opener. However, since then I have had nothing but problems: the door sometimes opens or closes all by itself (which Chamberlain customer service says is not possible - I wish they would come out and see it for themselves!). Coming home to an open garage door is not cool.Also, the main open/close button on the wall mounted controller works about 50% of the time, and I have to punch in the numbers on the external keypad 3 or 4 times before I can get the door to respond. I hate this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I owned this for about four years. The battery back-up lasted about a year until the battery went out and the unit beeped incessantly, which you could hear clearly inside the house. Replaced the battery, but the beeping didn't stop. Finally, we just removed the battery. Our last year with it was full of malfunctions also. First the lights went out, which is terribly inconvenient when coming home in the evening. You could hear the small tick noise we'd normally hear, but the lights wouldn't come on (and yes we replaced the bulbs). The last straw was a malfunction with the sensors...it just wouldn't close anymore and indicated there was a wiring issue. We replaced all the wires and the sensors (which were in-stock and available at the local Lowes...hmmmmm), but we continued to get the same problem and same error. This was a horrible product that seems to have been built to break. Go with Genie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to install, works well, not quiet at all","review":"I purchased this opener for use on a double door. The unit was easy to install, easy to align, and the remotes and keyless entry are nice features. However, I am quite disappointed that the unit is extremely noisy. This replaced a chain drive unit that was noticeably quieter than the \\"whisperdrive\\" unit. The noise level of the door itself is not the issue, the noise that is infuriating is coming from the drive unit itself. Based on my experience I wouldn't pay the premium price for a Chamberlain unit in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not what I expected","review":"The opener installed reasonably well. The price is reasonable, if I had not had problems (excessive noise and failure). I had the opener for just over 6 months when it failed. I used the owner's manual to isolate the failure to two possible options. I checked the warranty and it was only validate if you shipped the opener to the company without opening the cover. Not knowing how long this would take, I opened the cover and inspected the parts. I purchased ($30) and installed the first possible repair option from the owner's manual; it did not repair the problem. The second option was going to be of a new opener, so I went and purchased another opener. Disappointed in it only lasting just over 6 months, and the noise is/was more than the new screw-drive opener that I purchased as a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY quiet","review":"I replaced two very old openers.My installation was complicated because my garage has a beam across both bays.The openers I replaced were several inchs shorter than the Chamberlains.The Chamberlains were too long to fit between the front wall and the beam.I ended up opening the ceiling and extending the header beam (above the door) to give more room.Once I figured that out the rest of the installation was easy.They are so quiet i realized how much noise the doors themselves were making.I had those professionally serviced and now you can't hear either door opening, even in the room above the garage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good; could be better.","review":"I have two of the whisper drive openers...my only complaint is the quality of the spring clips used to secure the reverse sensor wires. You have to insert two wires into each spring clip and while the first works well, the second wire can be a challenge as the clip doesn't always secure the second wire. A beefier spring clip, or a clip for each wire would be nice...wasted a lot of time with a mini screwdriver trying to get the second wires to hold...have also had the wires come loose over time due to unit vibration and when that happens, you can't close the door until you fix the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet, Smooth, Easy to Install","review":"Received on time, as promised. Came packaged well, no damage. Well layed out instruction manual. Count your parts, step 1, step 2, etc. The manual suggests to install within 2\\" from top height of opened door. My spring was in the way so I had to go higher. Everything went together well, everything worked 1st time. Still haven't got Homelink from the car set up, but that is more due to the auto instruction manual. Very please with noise level as I went from gear driven to belt driven. This item was installed on a well balanced, medium weight 18' door. If you don't skim the manual you won't miss anything and you should be good to go. P.S.

I completely removed all parts involved with the old unit and installed new one from scratch. Besides having to adjust the down travel due to initially failing the \\"2x4 reverse test\\", it worked right out of the box. Unit makes a slight hum while operating but the sound of the door itself is louder and is all I hear. Came with two remotes, was able to use HomeLink button in my newest vehicle so all three of my cars can operate the opener as well as my home security system's remote keyfobs. Slight handyman skill required, but wasn't anywhere near as hard of a install as I thought it would be-it took me about four hours to complete. I would recommend this unit to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than expected","review":"I was pleasantly surprised at how easy the instructions were to follow.

We are very, very happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chamberlain Garage Door Opener","review":"Purchased two of these openers to replace 20 year old units. They work well and are quiet. The instructions are good and assembly easy. Since I had old hardware to steal from, I am not sure if all bolts are supplied for mounting. The angle metal that is supplied to mount the drive end to the ceiling is flimsy(that they supplied anything is surprising to me) Most hardware stores and lumber yards have heavier material. As always mounting the unit to the ceiling is the tricky part. Since each installation will be different, it is up to the installer to figure out how to secure the unit.I like the extra features this unit offers. An outside keypad, and an extra button on the inside control to just turn on the light. They offer some other features you can add the the unit but I don't remember what they are (they may have more information in the description of the unit).I would recommend this garage door opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chamberlain Whisper Drive Garage Door Opener","review":"Execellent product.

Much better than the 20 year old chain drive units I was using. Not all that satisfied with the wall units being lit up as bright as they are. Also the pull cord does not retract when activated so the door does not re-engage with the drive when the release cord has been pulled. It's simple to reset it, but it's a pain if one forgets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for good price!","review":"Bought this to replace an older open. Very quite, great light from the two 100 watt bulbs (you can use the effecient swirly ones with no problems) and the extra buttons on the remotes for lights, etc are great. You can also program your car opener buttons to work with this one. The touch pad is a good size and has a glow light that stays on, I am not sure if there is a setting for that, but it is like having a very mild nightlight which I find useful. Remotes are easy to reprogram if you accidently mess them up like I did - a cinch. We did not install the coded keypad outside so can't say anything about it. The delivery through Amazon was awesome. We ordered it at night and it was delivered FedEx in one business day and that was with the free Super Saver Shipping.

Still the Sears unit(made by Chamberlain) lasted 12 years. I could have fixed it for 30-40 bucks but I figured 12 years is enough. This belt drive was easy to assemble. I took the old one down leaving what I thought I could reuse in place. Anything that showed any sign of wear, I was going to replace but found nothing amiss except the bearing under the sprocket that failed originally. The new one bolted right in place. I replaced the sensors just because. Same with the wall button and push button entry.I can't believe how quiet this garage door opener is. With the passage door into the house closed, we cannot hear it. Standing out in the garage what you hear the most are the wheels on the door. So much so that I ordered nylon wheels with 13 ball bearing to see how quiet I can get it.

Most of the reviewers here have been women and they have elevated Ms. Shinn to the ranks of bestsellerdom because of her leanings toward Romance. To her credit Shinn's protagonist has a bit more assertiveness that the usual female lead in sf novels, but that is all given up when she achieves what she's after in the end.

The two main characters were supposedly \\"in love\\" but bickered and were at odds almost constantly. That was the most annoying part of the book and distracted me from the interesting concepts.

The characterizations are beautifully done, and the world of Samaria is wonderfully rendered. It's complex and yet elegantly simple at the same time.

Each character is so deeply thought and developed, that it almost makes it seem that they ARE going to be real people in the future. I thought it was interesting that there was a good looking villain, because usually a villain in a story like this would be some kind of wart fulled alien or a cranky old warlock. I also love her choice of words that makes even the complicated plot easier to read. I really don't think there is anything like the \\"Archangel\\" that I've ever read before. This is indeed an original piece, and this has become my most favorite book of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Out of the Ordinary","review":"I'm die-hard fan of fantasy novels, so I must've read hundreds of such books, but \\"Archangel\\" definitely stands out for its uniquely imaginative environment, symbolism, characters, and plot.Shinn's work is a proof of my thesis that female authors indeed are usually better than their male colleagues at portrayals of memorable heroines. Compare Shinn's portrayal of the herione against that of Donaldson's \\"Mirror\\" books and Barker's \\"Imajica\\", and you will clearly recognize Shinn's superior skills in characterization. (Well, relatively speaking - \\"Gone with the Wind\\" and \\"Jane Eyre\\" are in different universe altogether...)My only complaint was the repeated descriptive reminders that the angels look like... a cross between Chippendale and Calvin Klein models. Overall, however, a must-read for fantasy fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish writers wouldn't mix sf and romance","review":"Shinn is a good writer, but I am really appalled at this trend of mixing sf and romance.This is a formula romance page turner, well done if you like that sort of thing, but it could have been so much better if she'd paid more attention to the sf aspect of this novel (a la Jaran and Mistwalker). The premise is waaay too cute for me also (what with the gene-engineered angels) and there's no intrigue in finding out exactly what lies behind the fluffy front. In fact, she doesn't even drop any hints. It just is what it is. As an sf fan, I always feel a bit silly complaining about far-fetched plot premises, but even I gagged on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"Gabriel, a future Archangel, has been told the name of his bride. He is to go to where she is enslaved, bring her home, and marry. Rachel, his intended, is not crazy about the idea but concedes. This is the basic plot in ARCHANGEL.Miss Shinn does a great job building her world in which the book is set, but I found myself offended with some of her liberties. Setting that aside, I focused on the characters. Rachel and Gabriel were annoying and as easy to embrace as a cactus. They fought throughout the entire book and were constantly finding reasons to be apart from each other. As much as I tried, I never reached a point where anything about them endeared them to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, Jovah, this was so beautiful!!!","review":"This novel is right up there with the best - it's going up on the shelf with all my classic favorites - Tolkein, Adams, Brin... Shinn has not only produced a wonderful futuristic world, she has peopled it with captivating characters and a writing style that never loses one's interest. And although neither \\"Jovah's Angel\\" nor the \\"Alleluia Files\\" are on the same standard as \\"Archangel,\\" they are also quite good.Sharon, if you read these reviews, I would like to thank you for sharing your talents and providing the public with such an enjoyable book. I took great pleasure in reading your beautiful story hope that your future works are just as wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best fantasy novels I have ever read","review":"\\"Archangel\\" is indeed one of the best fantasy novels I have ever read. It has everything a good book should have: believable characters, a suspenseful plot, and an interesting society in which the plot is based. My only complaint is that it ends far too quickly - as some other readers have commented, I would really like to know what happened to Gabriel and Rachel and Nathan and Maga. Unfortunately, we only get a few tantalizing hints in the sequel \\"Jovah's Angel.\\" So, Ms. Shinn, if you are reading this - I think I am not the only one who is eagerly waiting for a \\"real\\" sequel to \\"Archangel.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Archangle","review":"This book keeps getting better and better every time I read it.

This book got me back into reading and i havent stopped."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Sci-Fi to Fantasy in a single leap!","review":"I am struck by the author's use of contemporary religious symbolism used to weave a story that is rooted in science fiction, reads like a fantasy thriller, and paints a picture of human social struggles and love inside the neatly organized package. This book is to World Economics what Planet of the Apes was to Racism -- a wonderfully cloaked parody of the current social, religious, and economic evils in our daily life from which we can safely step back and judge with a clearer perspective. And all this with a positive conclusion! A gem of a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my favorite of Ms. Shinn's","review":"I am new to Sharon Shinn's writing and loved the four books of the Twelve HOuses. This is the first of the angel books I\\"ve read, and while the concept is interesting, i found the heroine to be so irritating it was hard for me to wish her well. Which is why i rated the book so low. Still better than many fantasy books but I like her others so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have read several of Sharon Shinn's books and found them entertaining. This one was not. I read all the reviews about the great love story the book was; I never found that to be true. The story skated around Gabriel and Rachel constantly with little if any interaction between the two for most of the book. When were together, they fought. I realize there's the popular antagonist views many writers use in romantic novels, yet this was so overused that I liked neither of the characters and could see how they didn't like each other. I particularly did not like Rachel, the main female character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Fantasy World, But","review":"I read a lot of Sci Fi and Fantasy. I read one of Sharon Shinn's more recent works and liked it a lot. This book started out interesting. As it progressed the number of missed oppotunities began to get anoying. It was kind of like watching \\"Three's Company\\", everybody on a different track. A third of the way in I started speed reading thinking it would get better. Wrong! The lead character Rachel never matured and stayed as obnoxious as ever. When she walked away AGAIN near the end, I did a rare thing and put the book down in frustration with 40 pages to go. How it ends I don't care. It was a long path to nowhere. A waste of a good imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magnificent book and world","review":"Sharon Shinn creates a world and a theology in the introduction; the reader has a God's-eye view of the lovers Gabriel and Rachel. There are so many good things about this book I hardly know which virtue to start with: a totally believable, no-holes precept; feisty lovers; world salvation or destruction; multitudinous themes and discussions on the true nature of freedom, slavery, duty, peacefulness. Mostly, though, I thought all of the setting and the issues besetting Samaria were secondary to the friction/fire between the two star-crossed lovers. 'Archangel' is a love story first and a fantasy/science fiction novel second. Mesmerizing, subtle in its observations about human psychology and motivations, written by an author in full command of her considerable powers."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unusual and stunningly beautiful love story.","review":"After reading Sharon Shinn's novel, Archangel, I was amazed at her skillful weaving of biblical myth and a quickly progressing world. Her rather subtle opinions on faith, progress, technology, and people were very interesting to interpret. I found her characters, especially the all-too-human angels deep and memorable. This is a book I will read again and again, and enjoy more every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Great book. Great series. Factual fiction. Awesome authors.

The label has an excellent roster. If they wanted to publicise their archives, they could have been a great deal more generous at this price - or else offered it for $6 or so. It's also disappointing that Vanguard is ignoring some of the wonderful stuff in its archives and focusing instead on meaningless releases of this variety - the \\"greatest hits\\" by the same artists, on the same label, are a much better deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gives Cryptozoology a Bad Name!","review":"Type in \\"cryptozoology\\" at Amazon.com.

Heaven help us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to know about cryptozoology, don't read this.","review":"This book passes itself off as a large overview of fascinating creatures which are rumoured to exist, yet winds up trudging into the rediculous and silly. While the book does contain some nice references in the form of photos and drawings from actual paranormal cases, it also delves into childishness like boogeymen and jackalopes.Another problem with this book is the lack of good organization. It skips around a good bit and seperates things like Sasquatch and Skunk-apes, which are obviously similar, if not the same thing.In short, I believe this would be a good book for a third grader interested in the unknown, but anyone looking for facts should look elsewhere. Read Grover Krantz's \\"Big Footprints\\" or John Green's \\"Year of the Bigfoot\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining","review":"This book is entertaining in that it's humoristic but it also provides some nice insights into Native American as well as local folklore and decent cryptozoology/paranormal info.No it's not Keel,Coleman,or Sanderson,but it's worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"inept, silly retread","review":"This takes much of the same information from other books on cryptozoology and deals with it in a pop manner, with silliness and large discussions of movies, again from a popular, capsule review sort of way. That is to say it falls somewhere between _Entertainment Weekly_ and _Weekly World News_, which is not a pleasant combination. There is little in this book that cannot be gleaned from other, better written and less condescending sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather read junk mail","review":"Not only is this book a piece of trash it's also inaccurate.I believe he made most of it up and I think he writes all of his reviews.This book is inappropriate for everyone walking god's green earth.

I was extremely disappointed by the superficial treatment of the text. I found myself using the Biblical text and other sources. For the most part Dr. Swindoll's book was a distraction rather than a help. For example, 2 Samuel 7 descibesGod's covenant with David that Christ, the True King, would be David's descendant. Swindoll uses this text as to how to react when God says no to our plans. (In this case, it is God's rejection of David as the builder the temple that Solomon eventually built) The covenant IS the point and Dr. Swindoll completely misses it.If your looking for moralisms that you really already knew this is your book. If you want a serious study of the life of Davidyou would do well to look elsewhere or try something bold-- a careful reading of the Biblical text."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I ever read.","review":"Chuck Swindoll really challenged me with this book. I learned a lot about my life by learning about the life of David. I face many of the same struggles he did. Swindoll wrote this book as if he were talking to you instead of writing a book. The personal touch helped in gaining a greater understanding of King David."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book from The Good Book","review":"Charles Swindoll does an excellent, if not remarkable, job of not only presenting the trials of David in modern day life, but he also vividly illustrates the psalmist's shortcomeings into lessons for today. Without a doubt, this book was written with God's guidance (no slight intended towards Mr. Swindoll), and I recommend this book to be used as a tool for the Christian of today in his/her walk with God. Upon finishing, I not only had renewed insight upon David, but also within myself, and found newborn strength to conquer my own daily struggles. God has annoited this book, of that there is no doubt, and I strongly urge Christians to delve into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great As A Teaching Manual!","review":"This is a well written, thought provoking book.

The lyrics bordered on trite (Women love me 'cause I take my time. Gimme a break!)and the band was nothing special. His harp playing was outstanding as always but produced so it pretty much overwhelmed the other musicians. For me this was a waste of money and I don't say that about much music I buy.

Perhaps that was what she intended, but I don't feel enlightened as a result. I also felt the portrayal of farm life over romanticized.

Even she hated it - she left it in an airport half finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing AND Boring - a losing combination","review":"This is the first book I have ever read where I could not identify with a single character. The protagonist, Alice, is so prickly, self-pitying and unlikable that you find yourself hoping she WILL be convicted. Don't waste your time with this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I had to force myself to finish reading this book. I actually skipped to the end to see if the main character was indited or not. I would rather pluck out all the hair on my body with a tweezer than to read this book again. I dont know what Oprah was thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did I just read?","review":"I thought this was a map. I opened it to find just a bunch of words.

If you want a map, do not buy this strange book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through the constant misery...","review":"Maybe I shouldn't even write a review on this book since I couldn't finish it. But I suppose that in itself says something. While many people have loved this book, I could not bring myself, night after night, to read what seemed to be the same depressing, mundane, dwelling of the main characters issues over and over and over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING, SAD, DEPRESSING, Blah blah blah blah blah","review":"I wouldn't give this even one star but one is the lowest you can go. This is my current book that was picked for the book club. I have bad luck reading any oprah books. This read faster than most of the others I have read, but the ones I have read from Oprah picks have this same depressing nothing really happens kind of theme. Our first book read for my book club was \\"The Red TEnt\\" and that is the best book I have read in a REALLY long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I bought \\"Map of the World\\" in an airport thinking it would keep me busy on my recent trip to Paris, how wrong I was. Maybe it's because I'm young but I don't get it. Nor do I care to, I have never read a book that made me dislike the characters as much as this one has. Maybe I'm just missing the point... Could someone please tell me why this long, boring book is suppose to be good?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A revolting concoction.","review":"This book was terrible. It's horribly constructed, and Hamilton's attempt at 'graceful language' falls flat when wasted on such shallow characters.I have an exam coming up in less than 3 hours, and a good chunk of this exam rests of my ability to successfully write about 'mimetic desire' in relationship to Hamilton's travesty of a novel. How on earth I'm expected to come up with this sort of material, especially with such an intolerable work, is beyond me.Other problems include the storyline 'gracefully' grinding to a complete halt. Following the plot is like watching an old person slip into a coma. As well, I strongly suspect that very few readers have the patience to deal with Hamilton's abominable elements of self-pity and unrelenting stubborness.Oh, god, I could go on forever, but I need to start studying."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely put-downable","review":"i rarely leave a book unfinished, and this is definitely one of those rare times. i am glad i got the book for only a quarter at a library book sale. i am ready to take it out and put it anywhere, probably on a park bench when it stops snowing so maybe someone can benefit from it, someone who will sympathize with the book's self-centered and extremely boring characters. i went past page 50, hoping the book would kick in, but it didn't. i should have learned from my first experience with jane hamilton's The Book of Ruth, but i thought i would give this author a second chance. well, this is her last, as far as i am concerned. it is a waste of time for serious readers. use your time, money and effort on the classics. this one is not even worth summarizing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated!!","review":"I was very excited to read this book because I had heard so much about it. I'm starting to think that I did not read the same book as most reviewers. I found the descriptions drawn out so much that they were boring and I felt absolutely no sympathy for the main character at all. Howard was her God sent, but she treated him terrible. I actually got to the point that I wished he would just leave her in jail and be done with her. I would only recommend this book if it was the absolute only thing to read. Don't waste your time or money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Map of the World","review":"Next time, I'll be more careful. The author missed the mark when writer's protagonist claims to be a \\"licenced practitioner nurse\\". There is no such credential. \\"Practical\\", \\"vocational\\", maybe but not \\"practitioner\\" as a credential. Alice's most acute problem: no judgment. Bad read. Bad, bad, bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifetime!!","review":"This book was okay. That is all there really is to say. I suspect that this book will eventually turn into a movie and I will catch it on Lifetime. I think this story will be more intriuging as a movie on the Lifetime Network than a as a novel, what with all of those commercial breaks building the suspense!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a deep work; only popular due to \\"star power.\\"","review":"Though usually hesitant to read books on Oprah's list (I believe in my own ability to find a good book, though I admit she has picked some winners), I read a bit of this one at the store and felt I would enjoy it. WRONG. The only character in the book I actually liked and cared about was Theresa, and it was not her story. Though a lot takes place in this novel (death, prison, false accusations) and it reveals life truths (such as the fact that many spouses don't know each other and one's seemingly safe life can snap in one minute, without the slightest hint of forewarning), it left me saying - \\"Oh, deal with it.\\" The novel held no great revelations for me, nor did I find the central characters compelling in any way. Far worse things have ocurred to others not as well situated, and they have conquered their demons with more grace, common sense, and ability. Better novels have told similar tales in more compelling fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow go.","review":"While parts of this book kept me turning the pages, on the whole, I was bored to tears. I found Alice to be a pitiful soul, and her husband, Howard, to be a pathetic man. His perspective was the most frustrating. I have found Oprah's picks to be pretty awful so far - Snow Falling on Cedars, is another one that dragged on for what seemed to be an eternity. I honestly am recommending people to avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst i've read in a long time...........","review":"Anyone who can sit and read almost 400 pages and say that this book was worth reading will not get my vote......... Alice is a horrible character that makes you hate her and feel sorry for her family because they have to deal with her. she only cares about herself and someone who can actually dislike their child needs therapy.....oprah should offer refunds for the people who have believed in her and have actually had to be tortured by this poor excuse for writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikable Characters","review":"I just don't understand how so many people can love this book so. I felt none of the characters were likable especially Alice. Howard would have been better off without her--I would have been just as happy if she had had to stay in jail. Way too wordy and depressing. As a mother of young children, it didn't bother me at all to read this. It was too lousy even to care about. As for Oprah's picks, I am surprised. Midwives is the only other one of her suggestions I have read, which also left me annoyed with the main character and the story as well. I'll give Oprah one more chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Couldn't hardly put this one down. It isn't a happy story, but the writing was fantastic and the story really makes you think how quickly your life can change and how hard it is to recover when bad things happen to good people."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Map of Two Hearts","review":"This was a beautifully written novel about how our minds can often trip us up. A tragic accident has caused a young woman to blame herself for the death of a little girl; and a domino effect is triggered. Shortly, the entire community is blaming her not only for the child's death but for atrocities far worse than her supposed negligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for summer reading..","review":"I read this book for summer reading and I must say it was the longest and most drawn out thing ever. I really did have a hard time actually sitting down and reading it. I even stopped reading in in July, read everything else I had to read, and decided I had to finnish it by today, for school tomorrow. The ending was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refuse to finish","review":"I started this book about a week ago. Usually, I can read a book this length in a day or two if it's interesting, and I find most books interesting. My daughter recommended this one. She loved it. Before finishing the book, I decided to check Amazon's reviews to see if it was just me or if other people hated the book. It seems to be one of those that you either love or hate. I'm finding it terribly depressing and boring. I don't care a whit for Alice or Howard or any of the characters. After reading the review by the person who slogged through to the end and was still disappointed, I'm not going to hang around for the jail time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it better than The Book of Ruth","review":"I found it interesting that the author started with a climax in the first chapter. There was so much emotion there, I did not know how the author could top that. At times, I was frustrated with Alice and Howard. I felt that they were not trying to be in charge of their own destiny but were shifting with the wind. I understand that they had a lot of traumatic events, and they were mired down. However, the rest of their life was at stake. I enjoyed Alice's memories of the prison the most. Those antidotes were raw, enlightening, and penetrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A verbal exposure of the rawest human emotion","review":"I loved this book. It gripped me in a very differ-ent than the way in which most \\"page-turners\\" do.Jane Hamilton explores the most basic of humanemotions in a way I've never experienced in a book.I'm also originally from an area of Wisconsin veryclose in character, name and locale to Prarie Cen-ter, which made the book hit even closer tohome for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bummer!","review":"What is with Oprah? I have read five of her books now, each one more depressing than the previous. This book was boring and had too many words. I felt like the elementary school situation was unrealistic (I am a teacher) and the behavior of the children would never have happened as written. I did not like Alice and wished Howard and Theresa would ride off into the sunset and leave her with her rambling thoughts. I ended up skipping entire pages of descriptions and thoughts just to get to the storyline so I could finish. It's back to Harry Potter for me. Now that's real action!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely slow","review":"It took me longer than usual to read this book. I felt the writer had some mixed thoughts and put them down on paper. I was always looking for something good to happen and it wasn't til the end that I realized I just read a bomb. try the Pilots Wife, or river, Cross My Heart or even Vinegar Hill was better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable","review":"Jane Hamilton's use of correlative prose and richly detailed characters drives this magnificent book through a tale that intrigues and makes one look at the self in a way that's spellbinding. It is a story that proves just how fragile life is and how special those close to us really are. If you want to read a book of the heart and soul, read this one! If you enjoy books from Oprah's book club, I also reccommend \\"White Oleander\\" by Janet Fitch...It's just as good, if not better."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one story I will reread","review":"If you have ever lost love - you must read this. I read this book on a 7 hour plane flight to see my daughter, I cried not at the end - but as the story unfolds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought it would be","review":"I bought this book because it was listed as an Oprah book club selection. I usually am very pleased with Oprahs selections but this book left me asking why it was picked. It was terrible. I had to stuggle to get through it. I hated Alice from the beginning. She can't cope with her children, and instead of disiplining them she trys to stangle a kitten. Howard her husband is afraid to live his own life, and instead does what he thinks is best for ALice. All through the book, I was hoping that he would get a backbone and join the real world. As I read this book all I could think about was what I was going to read next. It was almost painful to finish, and I was relived to turn the last page. The ending held no surprise for me, and I still can't understand why this book was choosen for the book club. Save yourself the hours and rent the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"a great book","review":"I thought this was a great book and couldn't put it down! If I just looked at the title or cover, I wouldn't have read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written but ultimately too sad","review":"I read this book a few years ago shortly after it was released in paperback. Jane Hamilton is a beautiful, insightful writer with a keen ability to paint realistic characters experiencing very believable emotions. Although I appreciate her immense talent, this book left me feeling empty and sad, rather than enraged, embolded or inspired, as she may have intended. This is a well-written book that deserves all its praise, but reading an emotionally draining book, with little levity to break up the mood, is simply not how I like to spend a rainy afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, put the dysfunctional family to rest","review":"Having to reread MAP OF THE WORLD a second time in 3 years for my book discussion group (I am a librarian and discussion leader) gave me an opportunity to get really annoyed all over again. Why would anyone care about this two self-absorbed , sullen characters that can't communicate with each other let alone the reader. Alice likes to tromp around doing Hungarian dances while Howard milks the cows? Give me a break! When will contemporary authors quit beating the dead and boring horse of dysfunctional families and write something beyond their own personal experience. Write about something you don't know - do some research!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither inspiring nor interesting","review":"Alice lives a relatively mundane life. Her husband works their small dairy farm, and she works as a nurse in a rural school. In the way things sometimes do, tragedy strikes when the youngest daughter of her neighbor drowns in Alice's pond while under her care. After a time, she comes to terms with this and moves on. Then, she is accused by a local troublemaker of sexually abusing her equally troublesome son. More tragedy ensues.The writing is of good-enough quality, but long-winded and indulgently self-reflective. The characters are solid, but seem like passing strangers to whom one has no connection. The situation is very sad, but Alice's paralysis by her own self-pity grates on your nerves. I found myself angry that I had to read to the end just to find out what happens. Finally, the epilogue seems tacked on, as though the author felt it unnecessary to discuss the most important part of Alice's emotional journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an Oprah choice?","review":"This was one of the worst books that I have ever read. How did it come to be on Oprah's list. Does she actually read any of the books on her list? If I could have selected less than 1 star I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one!","review":"My daughter read this book and sent her copy to me stating that she wasn't sure I'd like it much but it passed the time for her while she rode the subway to work. Wow, what a chore it was to get through it! The characters were not well developed, the plot ordinary, and the story slow and boring. I was not surprised that it did not hold my interest as it is one of Oprah's and I have been very disappointed in the other two I've read, Stone's From the River and Songs in Ordinary Time. Skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"The only reason I gave this book two stars instead of one was due to the courtroom scenes. They were the only interesting part of the book. I found this novel depressing and had no sympathy whatsoever for the main character. She was a caustic, careless individual who had an attitude. I also found the character Theresa to be very unrealistic. I suppose there are genuine saintly people out there who could forgive what the main character did to her child, but her \\"goodness\\" was nauseating. Don't waste your time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't seem to get interested...","review":"I'm not actually done reading the book, & it upsets me. I find myself struggling to read a single page! After coercing myself to read 5 pages, I'd have to put the book down...then force myself to pick it up again maybe 2 days later & do the same thing all over again. I\\"ve never had this problem before!I do believe that once I get done reading the book, the story will be a good one---that's why I\\"m so upset that I can't get myself to be interested in it by now! Then again, I also fear that maybe everybody is giving this book so much praise merely because the \\"overall story\\" is a good one, while at the same time, it's a bad read. Seems to me, & this is the first time I've ever said this, that this story is probably more enjoyable as a movie then as a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This beautifully written book allows the reader to know these characters from the inside. Their thoughts, emotions, and inner dialog are explored in an unsentimental and clear way. You can't read this book without facing a few dark corners in your own psyche, which is probably a big reason for the wildly varying reviews contained in this website. It's an intimate journey, one which I found well worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"STIFFLING, SUFFOCATING, GIMME AIR, QUICK!","review":"If you liked Smiley's 1000 Acres, you'll like this book. I liked neither. I felt in both books like I was going through someone's dirty laundry basket ... there was nothing uplifting...nothing to capture the imagination. The \\"heroine\\" of A Map of the World was truly unlikable to me. She was self-absorbed and not anyone I could care about. Her children were despicable, and her husband a tight-lipped drone. The only reason I give the book even 3 points is that it opens with a bang. The action that gets the whole story in motion happens more quickly than in any other novel I have read. Perhaps that's why the rest of the book seems so slow and tedious. I might add, If you like books with a little \\"poetry\\" in them, or books that leave something to the imagination (such as The God of Small Things), skip this one. Everything's laid out in tedious and unending detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sinclair Lewis meets Oprah","review":"This novel is really just an 'Oprahization' of the tradition of Babbitt, Main Street and Elmer Gantry--it's fundamentally a screed against the smothering hypocrisy of a midwestern town that fails to understand its most hip, sensitive residents. Frankly, Jane, it's been done, and without resorting to the emotionally manipulative story and characters you've concocted here.As several reviewers have mentioned, Hamilton is capable self-absorbed characters bring this book down, especially Alice's tedious expositions of just how *remarkably* sorry she is for herself.Also, the devices Hamilton uses to prove how her bohemian family stands out from the hoi polloi in that heartless (and obviously soul-less) Wisconsin backwater are both tiresome and ridiculous. The farm as an island of Eden in the subdivisions? Mommy's folk dances in the attic? Daddy's clarinet serenades to grieving, confused daughters? This stuff is fodder for the Simpsons!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressingly Well-Written","review":"We read this book for our club. Feelings were mixed. The single star indicates my overall opinion of the book. It was well-written and as other reviewers have said, almost too much so. Hamilton writes so convincingly of Alice's thoughts and feelings that I felt immersed in her. But I didn't want to be! Alice is a depressing and annoying character who I wanted to shake some sense into! Hamilton's purpose must have been to unbearably depress her readers. I have no desire to ever read anything else written by her."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTALLY HATED IT!","review":"This book was ridiculous. I hated the young mother and couldn't believe she was so neglectful of the children. And her husband - hello? - welcome to the modern era - you have to take care of the kids too! I read the book to finish it, but could barely stay interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but slow","review":"This is a book about the severe hardships a woman, and consequently her family, endures during a particularly turbulent time of their life. the book well written and semi-interesting, but it is slow...the plot inches at a snail's pace, and is often distracted by the author's flashbacks, tangents, descriptions, etc...Particularly mind-numbing were the chapters relating to Alice's flashbacks of her prison experience...Maybe I didnt like Alice too much, but at that point in the book, I could honestly care less what happened to her.the only excitement the plot offered were the courtroom scenes towards the very end.Finally, I would not highly reccommend this book, it's just too boring..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are these depressing people!","review":"I could only manage to read about 1/3 of this thoroughly depressing novel before I gave myself the permission to put it down and stop torturing myself. I felt no compassion for any of the characters except Theresa. The plot is rather contrived (accidental drowning, charges of sexual abuse, arrest - talk about bad karma!) and I felt that I really didn't care what Alice had to say or what happened to her. Some of the other reader reviews were glowing; guess it goes to show you that people do have wildly different tastes when it comes to literature. I will not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooring! Don't waste your money with this book.","review":"I found this book to be very dull. There was no flow to it and there wasn't enough emotion in the writing. I felt that there could have been a little more pizazz to it. The two different viewpoints was a cool idea but the overall story and the outcome at the end was just too BOOORING! I felt like I wasted my time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Downer","review":"If you're feeling especially happy and upbeat this is just the book to read to bring you back down"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just read the first paragraph over and over again........","review":"I guess that one should never assume that since an author excels with their freshman work, that they will equally achieve the same thing the second time around. The Book of Ruth was a smooth and enticing read that grasped you at page one and did not let go until the turn of the last page. Unfortunately, the first page of this book only sets you up for failure. Stop at the turn of the wonderfully crafted first page. The book gets progressively worse; and just when you think that you MUST continue with this read to find some sense of redemption, you realize that you have wasted an afternoon and evening, just to wake up tired and unfulfilled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't finish","review":"I can't finish the book. There are parts of good writing by the author but the story is unnecessarily draggy and depressing. Alice always just look at the negative side of things, bemoaning her life and that people around her has robbed her of something. For example, she would notice how ugly a person is than anything else. I find her attitude to Nellie particularly selfish and rude. Her daughters are supposed to be difficult to handle, yet Nellie has helped her while she drowns herself in self-pity. I just feel that I have better way to spend my time than to read and feel annoyed and depressed about Alice's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I read this book while captive on a transatlantic flight. It did hold my interest, but I got impatient at times with the whiney characters and the oh-so-excessive wordiness of the writing. The book was in desperate need of a good editing to eliminate the belaboring of just about everything. I do identify with the anguish of Alice over the death of Lizzy. Isn't it every mother's nightmare to have a moment of inattention result in tragedy? That situation is what drew me in and lead me to finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book I'm Glad I Finished","review":"This book moves languidly until the end and I admit I read it in spurts. At times it was too depressing while I was in a depressed mood but when my mood lifted I was better able to be objective. Hamilton's prose is beautiful and the way she gets into the characters' interiors is poignant enough, though I doubt many people have the profound kind of conversations these characters display here (though I wish it was the case). If you look at the story as how a person can be ostracized from their community based on false accusations, the inner strength it takes to forgive your friends and loved ones when it's so much easier to be bitter and blame and how we have to persevere in the face of losing our dreams, you can see how this book can be analogous to our own lives. And the characters do successfully move on and their story becomes just a sad episode in their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"How sad and depressing","review":"I couldn't finish this book. I couldn't get past the first 75 pages if that. I found this horribly depressing. Not necessarily a badly written novel, but it is so saddening tha I just could pull myself through this book. The main character is obviously from page one depressed and hugely disapointed with her life. And it just gets worse from there. I still have this book (book mark and all!) on the shelf in hopes that maybe I will feel up to this book. The premise of the book seems good and this is why I am holding on to it. I supoose if I run out of other books to read, this will makes its way off the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit wobbly","review":"I found the main characters Alice and Howard a bit wobbly. I didn't end up feeling like I knew them at all. I felt like they were sleepwalking through their whole lives. I don't hold out much hope for them. In short, the tale was not very interesting or believable. I didn't relate to it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tear jerker","review":"If you have kids, watch out! This one will hit home.

I couldn't get into it at all--I didn't care for switching viewpoints a hundred and fifty pages into things, and then switching back again a hundred pages after that. The endless descriptions were tedious, and I ended up skipping over most of them just to get to the action. Truth be told, I still haven't finished this book yet and don't plan on it. It's sitting on my coffee table gathering dust, because frankly I have no interest in finding out what happens to these characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawner","review":"BORING!

As a college student I have had to read some of the most boring text books ever written.....and I would give them a higher rating than I would this book. Never before have I truly trudged through a book. The reading experience was painful. And (for the first time ever...) I put down a book with no desire ever to pick it back up again. The characters (and setting for that matter) were dry, unsympathetic, and shallow.And six of my friends have also read it and felt the same way.

There is this great potential for a wonderful story, but it just never quite gets there; it's as if emotion is missing from it. It's complicated because I found the book interesting, but it was just boring. The story is there, it is well written, but something is missing.It's too bad whomever wrote the intro on the dust jacket didn't write the book, they had me sold on an interesting tale. I can usually plow through a book, even a slow book, at a good clip but I stopped reading this one about 6ish chapters from the end. I couldn't even bring myself to find out what happens in the end...I really couldn't care less.

I expected it to be a drama, but I didn't think that the end would be so negative or that after reading it I would be left with such a jilted feeling about the book. I just didn't find the quality epic I wanted to find through the main characters, and the neighbor and husband never redeemed themselves in my opinion.

I've picked it up serveral times only to feel very disconnected with the story and I lay it back down. I've caught myself actually day dreaming while reading, unsure of what I read.

The initial event bears little relevance to the plot, which is a very dull trial. I got bored with the writing style, the lack of action, and the lack of verbal dialog. I am losing faith in Oprah's selections. I also cannot imagine how they are drawing people to the theater to see a 2 hour movie of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very depressing","review":"I attempted to read this book-Jane Hamilton is an excellent writer but this is a profoundly depressing book and I caution readers to avoid it unless they really want to give it a shot.(Don't let Oprah's recommendation sway you-(See Bridges of Madison County- an apalling book- read the reviews for a laugh- her choices are generally very weak) Jane Hamilton is a better author than most on Oprah's list. I was unable to finish this and felt drained & depressed which is unusual with me because I am really a happy person. Actually, my husband asked me to stop reading it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotone at best","review":"This book is painful slow, depressing. Im not sure how it made the list. Its just painfullyslow every chapter is about her pain.

I read it about 5 years ago, and I still remember it. It's about a mother's coming-to-terms with the death of a neighbor's young child. There are three points of view, and the book is well-developed. The first is the mother's decline, the second is her husband's perspective, and the last is the mother's coming to terms with her life. It's a MUST READ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Jane Hamilton's books are certainly memorable. \\"Book of Ruth\\" contained one of those scenes which will remain burned into my brain cells. However, \\"Map of the World\\" seems to have all the cynicism and darkness, with none of the intensity or sense of redemption. Characterization seemed weak - I couldn't muster enough interest about the characters to really care what happened to them. I'm surprised this is an Oprah pick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't meet my expectations","review":"I fell in love with The Book of Ruth and expected this book by Hamilton to reinforce my love of this writer. However, it took me two months to get through a book that it should have only taken me a week to read. I found it boring, with no direction. The best part of the book, I feel, was the section from Howard's point of view. The rest left much to be desired. I was disappointed today when I saw that Oprah had chosen this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A VERY SLOW READ","review":"I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED IN IT...I DONT THINK THE TITLE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY LINE? BASICALLY IT WAS BORING, TO ME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too wordy, and difficult to get absorbed...","review":"I put this book down after reading almost 100 pages of it. It takes a lot for me to put a book down! The descriptions were WAY TOO WORDY - the author often uses almost an entire page to describe a simple emotion. While I found the plot an interesting one (from previous reviews), I think the book could have been written in quite a few less pages. After 100 pages, I was not absorbed into the book, and was still struggling to continue reading. That's when it wasn't worth my time anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skillfully written - but is that enough?","review":"There is no doubt that Jane Hamilton can write but that does not necessarily mean she can craft a good novel. We get a brief glimpse of the Goodheart family before disaster strikes - too brief, for me, to sympathise with the characters or realise what makes them as they are. Ther follows a porridge of flashbacks and a colourful bouquet of characters, most of them somewhat hysterical in their behaviour. And a view of a very narrow world, frankly a rather uninteresting world. In fact I had a rather odd feeling while reading this book: that the authoress had a specific reading public and a concrete commercial goal in mind. Which makes it a book for a very limited public indeed. Rather disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost grip","review":"Great premise for a gripping story, but I couldn't suspendmydisbelief of the events that followed the initial tragidy. One's sense of depression would be fathomable after such an event, but I thought a mother's bond to her own children would override any guilt ridding penance in prison ... The court scene near the end was unsatisfying in that the witnesses seemed tailormade for the result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, slow, slow","review":"I was anxiouse to start this book because of the great review. I struggled to stay with it, not really caring one way or the other what happened to the characters. If it wasn't the only book I brought with me on vacation, I may never have finished it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I slogged through this book only because it is my principle that I finish any book that I start. I did not find any of the characters interesting or compelling. I was actually hoping that Alice was found guilty so everyone could get on with their lives, such as they were. I believe that I will give up on Oprah's picks because they are all about such boring people (This Much I Know is True; Stella)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Of Love and Other Demons","review":"Set in the tropical South America during the 1700s, Marquez writes of the fateful love affair between a young girl and a priest. Sierva Maria, who was made to live in the slave quarters until the age of twelve, is bitten by a rabid dog one day, and is consequently forced to undergo uncivil, tormenting therapy. Maria is soon sent to a convent when the local Bishop states his belief that Maria is possessed. It is at this convent where she encounters Father Cayetano Delaura, who wil be deciding on whether or not Maria needs to be exorcised. From this point on, Delaura begins to realize the strong feelings that he feels for Sierva Maria. Marquez powerfully demonstrates the unfortunate sequence of events that can come from one incident, and from one ill-fated love affair. I stronly reccomend this book. Enjoy! :-D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I find it very difficult to get through half of this book. I have put it down and picked it up more times than I care to mention. It is a waste of time. Awful book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing!","review":"God knows how or why I ever finished this book. It must have been a bad week for finding good books.The subject matter was depressing, and throughout the entire book the story just seemed too fantastical and didn't ring true.Frankly, since this book made Oprah's book club, I have refused to read anything else that did. It just left a bad taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hapless people make for fruitless reading","review":"I looked forward to reading this book, having heard so many good things about it. However, I found the characters disturbingly self-involved and even rather stupid about the way life works. Alice doesn't lift a finger to help herself, before or after her tragedies; she is a drifter. She \\"forgives\\" her husband -- but I don't know for what. The jail scenes were very false, and the black dialect was off-key (i.e., \\"I be listening\\" means I'm listening all the time. \\"I listening\\" would mean I'm listening right now.) Hamilton says her point is all about forgiveness -- but it is Theresa who has something to forgive. Alice brought her troubles on herself. I am a teacher and there ARE annoying children, and you can lose your temper. But you make it up to the child later, even apologize! You don't go on resenting the kid. He's a KID! A very odd book, and very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing book","review":"I wanted to read the book, even purchased it after it became an \\"Oprah\\" pick. I was very disappointed in it. I did read it all, kept hoping it would get better! I didn't like the characters. Actually I thought the book just drug along. I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shared feelings","review":"After trying to read this book, I thought the plot and characters were improbable and boring. I've only read about one-third of it and will probably not read the rest. I'm happy that other reviewers found it the same. I thought, perhaps, I was the only one who felt this way, and that something, anything might make it more readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am pretty confident the only reason this one made Oprah's picks is because she is mentioned in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tiring read..","review":"This is extremely difficult reading. I found myself skimmingover many paragraphs and pages, just looking for some dialogue. Tomake it worse, the print in this edition is so small that one can only read for a chapter or so before becoming fatigued. I found it annoying, and way too wordy and explanatory. I think if they got to the point more quickly, and didn't labor so MUCH over descriptions etc. it would have been more enjoyable. It's become a drudgery to read, rather than a passtime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"This book quite different in plot from \\"The Short History of a Prince\\" which I've just read. But sad, so very sad. In fact, I haven't been quite so moved from a book in a while. Liked the way that Alice's time in jail portrayed as haunting, yet not so terrible that the human spirit can be broken. Seemed the ending was uneasy - after the suspense of the trial, the verdict was taken as assumed, nothing seemed to be resolve etc. etc...but perhaps this just goes to show the great amount of realism in the book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Map Of The World","review":"While the author is a wonderful writer, I had a real hard time getting through this book. I absolutly had no pity for the main character, in fact her self-absorbtion in herself was sickning. I don't have to identify with characters in order to love a book, however I felt so far removed from this woman that I could hardly finish. Definetly not a page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech!","review":"What a mess! This is one of the worst books I've read in a while. I was irritated by almost all the characters - the wife who couldn't tell her husband she was having a crisis, the husband who was too obtuse to determine his wife was breaking down, the friend who came thisclose to betrayal with the husband - I could go on and on. This is one time when I'll bet the movie will be better than the book. This book was a boring, meandering mess. I wouldn't even suggest borrowing it from the library, let alone buying it, as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant writing style, but dry predictable plot","review":"Ms. Hamilton's amazing ability to turn a phrase and weave eloquent prose is the only thing that saved this novel. The plot is highly predictable and I never developed any real affinity for either of the narrating characters. The Alice character is quite possibly psychotic and I did not feel the sympathy for her that I believe was intented. I was never entirely convinced that she was not guilty of the crime of which she was accused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Choice - Oprah","review":"I tried to read this book about a month ago and couldn't get past the first 4 chapters. I am surprised that this made Oprah's list. Kinda makes me want to finish it but I'd really hate to invest the time and the book turns out to be a dud. Although Hamilton is one of my favorite writers this novel just didn't work for me. For a better view of Hamilton's talents check out The Book of Ruth or The Short History of a Prince. Both excellent reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Hamilton's prose, her phrases and turns, will stay with the reader long after she is finished with this book. I found myself re-reading lines, sharing them with others, thinking about them long after I put this book down. The heart of the story is simple -- it is about friendship, love, forgiveness, and how fragile our existence truly is. The relationships between Alice and Howard, Alice and Theresa, Alice and her cellmates all work toward helping the reader understand the complexities of life, where even a seemingly simple life on a farm is wrought with myriad possibilties, both good and bad. Howard's and Alice's love is painful to witness; it is filled with betrayals and disappointments, but love nonetheless, and beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"\\"The trout that Howard had stocked in the pond swam along through the dark water. They noticed Lizzy out of the corner of their eyes. They had inherited the knowledge of that look, and they knew it by heart.\\"They inherited the knowledge of that look? What look?

I, at least, have enough sense not to take the bait from this book.Swimming onward..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"After Book of Ruth, I was expecting something big from Jane Hamilton. Maybe I was expecting too much. However, I was very disappointed in Map of the World. I couldn't get interested in the characters or their lives, even when things went so bad for them. Also, there was no redemption arising from tragedy, so the whole thing is just depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very descriptive and heart-wrenching book.","review":"\\"A Map of the World\\" by Jane Hamilton is a very heartwrenching book that let's the reader step into a world of drama and ever-changing life-altering turns. The one place that the story does appear to falter is that the author brings in too many different plot lines and tragedy, never developing any of them to their ultimate extent. She touches on the subject of mental illness, but appears to be drowning in an area she is unsure of, so dismisses the idea without any explanation. The characters are well-written, all of their neurotic behaviours not quite accounted for, yet somehow believable. In them the reader can envision those parts of human nature most people never verbalize.All in all, quite a good book, with an interesting array of characters, and an ability to keep the reader in suspense and reading further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Map of the World","review":"This has to be one of the worst novels I have ever read, and I am sincerely disappointed that I purchased it. I have finally resigned myself to the fact that it was a waste of time and money. Like many of the other customers who found themselves trying to plug away at this book, I must have given it about five or six tries, and it was more and more awful each time. I can't believe this book is so highly regarded, on the best seller's lists, etc. I think someone on Oprah's staff will have to be fired for choosing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN","review":"This book was both depressing and boring. Why people enjoy reading about dying children baffles me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm waiting ...","review":"I love to read, fiction especially. I just don't understand what anyone finds so compelling about this book. Yes the premise is tragic, but I never cared about the main character. I found her selfish and immature and I liked her husband far more than I liked her. At the end I felt she owed him a big apology - after all, his dreams died too and she never seems to consider that."},{"rating":"1","title":"God, I hated this book","review":"It's rare that I come across a story where I could care less about any of the characters but Jane Hamilton's rambling, aimless prose actually managed to do just that. To sum up: I hated this book. I just couldn't get into it; could not relate to or identify with any of the self-absorbed, passive, boring, unsympathetic characters. But I continued to trudge on---hoping that it'll 'kick in' eventually. But \\"A Map of the World\\" never took off. It took me over a month to finish reading it. And when I did finally finish, it was more of a relief to finally be done with it than of any literary satisfaction. This book was a huge waste of time. This will be my first and last experience reading Jane Hamilton. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUK! The worst book I ever read","review":"Map of the World is depressing. The characters have no depth, just sadness. They don't attempt to DO anything to relieve their sadness. One horrible event after another, and only one issue is ever resolved (the trial). Thumbs down! Rent the movie if you have to - it's better."},{"rating":"1","title":"An effective sleeping aid","review":"Every time I tried to read this book, I fell asleep. That's how compelling the plot is. The beginning was promising, but the storyline slid downhill from there. I was very disappointed and surprised that Oprah even recommended such a droll piece of verbiage."},{"rating":"1","title":"reader","review":"Well This book was very very hard to continue reading. The first 100 pages are so slow and you are just like why am I even trying to finish. but I must say that after the first 100 to 150 pages I actually began to get interested in the book. It took me a month to finish. Not one I would reccomend to anyone. I gave it two stars cause I did finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"What a bunch of words to say a bunch of nothing. I guess I'm missing something. I did read more than 50 pages and neither the characters nor the plot grabbed me. Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just couldn't sympathize....","review":"I rated this book with two stars because I really disliked the main character. Perhaps what I seek from reading is different from other readers, but the reasons I read are to be inspired, and to learn, and to laugh. Alice made me angry. She was short sighted, insensitive, weak and self-centered. The reason I didn't rate this book even lower is because, while I disliked it the whole time I was reading it, it certainly made an impression on me. I guess you could say I did learn something from it - how I never want to be. To me, there are too many depressing things that happen in everyday life; I don't want to be depressed in my reading-fantasy world as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"The name of the book and the contents of the book not consistent","review":"The name of the book and the contents of the book not consistent.It is a novel,I used to think that it is an atlas.It seems that my English is very bad!!My textbook and postage fees is wasted!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of only 2 books I actually couldn't get through....","review":"I found this book so slow, so dull and so shamelessly heart-wrenching that I never did finish it.

Uninspirational work by and for those who don't have enough misery in their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"MaryAnn","review":"I have been reading this book for a few weeks. The reason it is taking so long is that I read other books in between because I find this one SO BORING!

This is a case where the author \\"tries\\" to hard to WRITE! It is overdone with excessive meaningless detail that dragged the plotless story further! I did read \\"Book of Ruth\\" and enjoyed it, but this, Map of Nowhere was totally boring, nothing happening, nothing doing! Characters aren't profound or defined, and the book takes too long to get to one point! I could read pages and pages and still not have a good grasp of characters or story! Waste of my precious reading time, repeat, a TOTAL waste of my precious reading time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Have never so intensely disliked a book as I did this one!","review":"I really looked forward to reading this book. I read Book of Ruth and enjoyed it quite a bit. However, had I known what a disappointment I was in for, then I would have saved my money. I found the main characters unsympathetic (which I thought would be impossible given the subject matter of this book) and completely unbelievable. The only characters I liked was the spunky daughter and the husband. Plus, there was just way too much going on in this book - I won't go into details, in case you are determined to read it (don't be!), but suffice it to say, that Hamilton could have cut the issues in half and still had a \\"meaty\\" book. Then there was the ending - don't even get me started on the ending! If anyone needs forgiving, then it must be me - for letting myself even open this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gaseous!","review":"I recently read that a truly good book will entertain and bring about insight for the reader. This book is about as far away from being good by that definition as any book I have read. Languid storytelling, scrawny plot, underdeveloped characters,and an agonizingly slow pace just begins to sum up my response to this book. Hamilton's writing style failed to elicit from me a connection to any of the characters, and events seemed to happen exclusive of others. I hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book was mediocre at best! I read the whole book because I kept waiting for something to happen. The book was very flat.

After a while, all of the story lines got mixed up and I went cross-eyed. I finished it out of necessity, not desire."},{"rating":"1","title":"GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT","review":"The only successful thing about this book is that it proves thenew trend in America that you are \\"guilty until proveninnocent\\" as opposed to \\"innocent until proven guilty.\\" Other than that, I found it boring, boring, boring. Oprah must have a personal friendship with Hamilton since she's picked two of her books for her book of the month club. I didn't like the first pick, Book of Ruth either so I probably should have just let this one go. Instead I ploughed through 390 pages of characters who are all victims with the saddest victim being the husband Howard. I think I'll pass if Oprah picks another Hamilton book. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This was one of the worst books that I have read in a long time. I had to force myself to keep reading in order to finish.

The plot is sad and depressing and never gets better. The entire book carries an aura of \\"just can't win\\" and has no happy or redeeming moments. I had to make myself finish it and by the time I got to the end, I was sorry that I even bothered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed to do research","review":"I was bothered right away by the author's lack of reserach. When the main character is described as a \\"licensed practitioner nurse,\\" it was clear that Hamilton didn't even bother to do rudimentary research. There are licensed practical nurses and nurse practitioners, but Hamilton's jumble of the two was disappointing and confusing. Also, it was clear Hamilton relied on pure speculation to guide her writing about child abuse. Overall, a good enough story, marred by the author's failure to do her homework."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DIS-CONNECT: Just couldn't care about Alice!","review":"I wanted to get into this book, I really did. But I couldn't. I forced myself half-way through it, then couldn't go any further. Months later, I tried again with fresh eyes, picking up where I left off but making it only 50 or so more pages. I just didn't care enough about the character of Alice to go on. I never felt any real connection to her. I don't necessarily need to like a character -- and indeed I didn't like Alice, so mundane, unfocused, with such poor life/interpersonal skills -- but I need to at least FEEL something for a character to see a novel through to its end. I simply didn't care about Alice's predicament or its outcome. Moreover, I found the author's writing style often long-winded and detached. Sorry -- just don't know what all the fuss is about on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderfully written; abrasive and honest","review":"This book is absolutely incredible. Alice speaks with such candor, it actually seems the story comes to you straight from Alice's deepest thoughts, with absoutely no filter whatsoever. I really enjoyed that aspect. Ms. Hamilton is truly a gifted writer. If you can handle uncomfortable subject matter, this book is a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book in Search of the Right Reader","review":"I was very suprised to see all of the negative comments listed for this book; I was instantly hooked after reading the first sentence. I think A Map of the World might only appeal to people who enjoy Hamilton's writing style... so if you're considering getting it, be sure to read some of the sample pages that are available and see how you feel about her voice.Also, when I read a book, I care much less about the plot than I do the quality and care that is taken in writing the book. A Map of the World is written with great creativity and honesty. I feel the characters were very well developed, unlike some reviewers. Also, I found the plot to be interesting and stimulating.... but, like I said, A Map of the World's quality depends on the person reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing","review":"This is the slowest, most depressing book I've read in a long time. I kept waiting for it to get good and it never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Empathy","review":"This book left me cold. I had no empathy for the main character, who seemed to only want to feel sorry for herself. As the mother of a three year old, I wanted to feel...SOMETHING! But the characters did not warrant any feeling. They were stereotypical and sterile, and the situations seemed completely contrived. Not an enjoyable, or even thought-provoking, read."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just goes on and on and on....","review":"The first paragraph of the book was such a masterpiece, I thought I was in for a treat. It must've taken a year of rewrites just to get that one paragraph right. But it went downhill fast from there. The painfully endless dull descriptive paragraphs after that made me stop by page 90, but then I stubbornly resumed and plowed through to the end. I couldn't read fast enough to move onto another book. Too realistic (which I guess is complimentary), too painful, just plain too much. Sorry. I wanted to like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm also struggling to finish this book","review":"I agree with the reader from New Jersey. I'm still reading the book and I'm having a hard time getting interested also. I usually read a book within a couple of days and I'm struggling with this one. It's written in a very boring manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This book jumped right into action to catch your attention. The characters were portrayed in a very realistic manner so that you could identify with \\"their type\\". The author left no guessing as to how anything was to be visualized: this is good, but can become a little too much sometimes. It is a story of the family down the street that could be found in any of our communities. Coming from a small midwest town in Iowa, I can relate to the choices that ended up having to be made for this family. This book is not a super thriller - so don't expect it. However, it is a very mild truthful story that keeps your attention. It's like hearing a days worth of gossip at the coffee shop! I liked it very much. I hope the movie does the book justice. And for all of you big city people.....No! We are not all like this in the midwest! (smile)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Map of the World","review":"I felt there was too much. Just when there was a chance to see a situation in depth, more plot was added - always worse. After awhile the book began to feel like a bad ride in the house of horrors. Good writing. Basically, a good short story that did not need so many plot twists."},{"rating":"2","title":"See what Trust in God can do in just one life...","review":"If you want to see what radical love of God can do in a life - this is the book to read. It does not matter if you are Catholic, Orthodox, or of any Christian denomination - this book is a road map of how to \\"work for God.\\"The book is written by someone who not only loves her, but acknowledges her faults - and just like all of us, she has many. This is a REAL living breathing human being who encounters the same difficulties we all face. The same emotions, hurts, fears, ailments. And yet, maybe it is because of all this that she could talk to anyone (rich man, poor man, beggar, thief) and help them to see that life is never hopeless.You'll need to be careful though, one reading of this book will have you pondering a big question -- \\"Do I really trust God enough to find out his will, and do it?\\"I highly, highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing in Ways","review":"In many ways, the book is what Mother Angelica requested of Raymond Arroyo: tell it like it is. It is unvarnished, to a certain degree, but also quite biased. It is difficult to get behind Mother, despite her great accomplishments, when she was continually disobedient to Bishops. All of them were not perfect, that is true, but in general, she did what she wanted and quite often didn't feel called to obedience and that is a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS BOOK","review":"This is one of the most exciting, well written biographies to come out in a very long time. Its about an underprivileged woman who became a cloistered nun and changed the world. Mother Angelica is a woman who somehow balanced real orthodoxy with brilliant management vision and skill without what seems any worldly qualifications whatsoever. Moreover, here's is a story of overcoming great suffering -- both physical and emotional -- and allowing God to transform her life without ever looking back or counting the cost. (It's worth noting too this is no saccharine sweet nun's story, to be sure!) This wonderful biography really shows us she is \\"The Patron Saint of CEOs\\" -- and patron of anyone else who by God's grace, must overcome a legion of what seem like insurmountable problems. Mother Angelica's life turns our natural aversion to personal suffering on its head and makes clear that miracles really do happen. --Enjoy.M. HartVolant, PA"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading","review":"I am a Greek Orthodox Christian and have always supported EWTN. I knew a bit about her life, but this book does give more detail.I was a bit shocked at how much opposition she received from the Bishops in the US--you would think they would be grateful. Before EWTN, PTL and the 700 Club were the only fare for Catholics.EWTN has also introduced programming for Eastern Rite Catholics which is a huge step forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"I was at a very low ebb in my spiritual life when I picked up my brand new copy of Mr. Arroyo's book last week and started reading. Within minutes, my depression was totally lifted. The word \\"inspiring\\" seems feeble indeed to express the tremendous sense of awe one feels upon reading of the depthless devotion of Mother Angelica to her Spouse, Jesus, and her life's complete dedication to Him. I had no idea of the mountainous obstacles Mother has faced physically, nor her humble beginnings. This book is absolutely riveting from the first page, I will read it again and again. Never have I felt so blessed to be aCatholic, what a mighty God we serve!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I really learned how the last 50 years affected the average \\"Catholic in the pews\\" when I read this book. I saw how Mother was just as influenced by the \\"whims\\" of liturgical change as most U.S. Catholics were, but with caution, and finally understanding of what Vatican II was really about. She truly is a visionary in the sense of seeing what modernism will do to us if we let it take over in place of true teaching. My words cannot explain how much I could relate to her and her outrage and grace while dealing with her detractors...but Raymond Arroyo's CAN! READ THIS BOOK! Pass this book to your friends and family! I've read thousands of books in my lifetime and I can count maybe 10 that were so memorable that I would recommend them. This is one of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother Angelica","review":"This book is a great gift for a Catholic mum, especially if she watches EWTN.

It is a book full of Fun, Wisdom and Spiritual enlightenment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother Angelica book","review":"It was a wonderful book.

The author emphasizes so much on the problems inside the Catholic Church and misses to write about the beauty and unity of the Church. For all the non-Catholics who decide to read this book: Going through all that this Church has gone through, is another testimony that this is the Church Christ established and He is taking care of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mother: the arbiter of our faith?","review":"The book is very subjective. Arroyo is one of her admirers and could have been more objective. I think the bishops are vilified to a great extent by both Arroyo and Mother. She seemed to have her agenda come hell or high water, no matter what the bishops say. I think the book would lead one to think this is a Catholic network. I would say it is in the Catholic tradition but does not speak for universal Catholicism."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"mother angelica story is fantastic....i cant put this book down she is truely remarkable and if not for her backround maybe she would not have been the nun she is"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Biography","review":"This biography is a warts and all but compassionate view of Mother Angelica.

It is truly an inspirational book. I had forgotten what a fantastic sense of humor she has.Raymond Arroyo does a good job of writing her story. It is a testament to Mother Angelica's Faith in God, not matter what the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Singer!","review":"This CD is a wonderfully produced collection of very nice songs, but the real feature is Ilse's voice. She sounds tough and soft at the same time. In a time of slick and glammed up crossover artists, here's one who sings better, sounds better, and delivers with strength and emotion. There's just no comparison between Faith Hill's \\"Breathe\\" and Ilse's \\"Breathe In, Breathe Out\\".

The picture quality is great and hi def looks amazing, be sure to take advantage of the DVI connection and hook Hi Def up using this connection for maximum quality, it's a little pricey but worth it. The only real flaw is the self focus feature is useless to get the picture nice and sharp you must manually converge and there still will be slight over lapping that is almost totally unnoticable if even noticable at all. Movies look great hooking the DVD player up through the component connection and the same goes for video games that are capable of 480P or 1080i and 16x9 (X-Box) with a component connection of course. This TV is the one for you if you have the room and do not feel like spending over 2 grand for the same quality picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I Could Find For The Price","review":"I have no problems with this TV. Sure, the 4:3 standard cable channels suffer from \\"stretch\\" if viewed in anything other than the 4:3 screen mode, but I didn't buy the TV to watch standard cable - I bought it for DVDs and the Xbox 360. I hooked up my DVD Player to the TV with Component Video Cables and the picture is sweet.If you're getting this TV to watch standard 4:3 non-HD stuff, you might be disappointed.I'd buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK TV","review":"After getting this TV home and making all the tweaks possible to get the best performance possible from this TV, I was left very dissapointed. Picture is very grainy while viewing some HD broadcasts even with a maximum reception signal. Left speaker is rattling even with low volume. Auto-convergence and manual convergence have not been able to correct over-lapping blues during adjustments and during graphics while watching TV. I have been very detailed to manually correct this problem but have had no luck. I think that I might have purchased a faulty unit. Overall, I would not recommend this model because the quality of HD does not look any better than a standard analog TV.

So it can't be all bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More fun and educational games please!","review":"My daughter found this obscure game at our library. It is a series put out by the Canadian Forestry and Health Departments to assist children in learning about these important functions. They reminded us a great deal of the magic schoolbus, however the interactive aspect really helps those who are visual and hands on learners. Also the game includes many different language selections, so you can expose you children to different ways of saying the same things should that be important for you. We set ours between French, English, Japanese and Russian and Emm likes to change the settings to learn new words too! Our favourite apsect about the game though, is how it teaches Emm to respect trees as living things while also teaching her about all of the scientific information as well! Thanks to the CBC to put out such a fantastic game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reprint","review":"This is a reprint of the 1954 Dover edition, which is in turn a reprint of the 1885 edition.

I love the bright colors and it seems very well made and durable. My son is only 8 months old but he already loves swinging it around by the pull cord, chewing on the wheels and shaking the animals to make a rattle noise (The two bigger animals have rattles inside and the little mouse has a squeaker). I love that this toy will grow with him. When he is more mobile, I'm sure he will enjoy pulling it around. Later, he can create stories with the animals or pull the wheels off and put them back on or stack the wheels on end. A wonderfully versatile toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute 6+ mos toy","review":"This is a pretty cute toy. Haba sent this to us for free after buying the curioso sorter (there is a small design flaw) - by the way, great customer service! I had not even thought about buying this, it just doesn't look that great online but I'm glad we got it. It's really cute. One of the loops on one of our cars is a little too long & the cars do not stay connected (but a couple of stitches will fix that), the other one is just fine. The characters all make a noise when shaken or squeezed & the wheels axels all come off which will be good for learning how to build it later on, which I think will extend the life of this toy. The string is a little short but that is probably due to the choking hazard strings provide. Glad we got it, Thanks Haba!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight!","review":"This book really goes back to the beginnings of occultism.

It does not mean that the music is from the classical ERA of music. It is still beautiful music, but those of you who are trying to learn to distinguish the different time periods will be disappointed. The CD actually does claim to be from the classical ERA but actually has much baroque era and romantic era music on it (the romantic CD by the same publisher is also not era specific). In regard to some of the other reviews, while the classical era did have an emotionally detatched quality, not all of the music on here is classical!

The characters are likable and believable and the action flows at a breakneck pace like watching a good James Bond movie.

I saw this book on the bargain table, opened it and - I don't know if it was just sheer \\"luck\\", but the very first page I opened it to (and consequently the ONLY page) it just so happened to be the one in which I found a typo.

But as an analysis of specific Ford films as well as the themes he used throughout his career, this book is invaluable.

The title says \\"The man and his films\\", but this book is mainly about the films. That means, if you are looking for the definitive Ford bio, this book isn't it.That said, this book does has its advantages. It explores Ford's movies in depth, revealing new facts and a lot of insight. It also has a lot o photos.If you want research on his movies, this is the book for you.

I replaced the metal band with a 20mm \\"lizzard grain\\" leather strap. A very simple process that I highly recomend anyone try with this timepiece. Overall, the face is simple but very flattering.

Too pricey for a product that doesn't deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"BASIC AND BORING","review":"After watching this ( as much as i could stand to) I realized why I never liked the Merv Griffin Show. He does not ask the questions that you wish he would. He treats the guests as though he were at a dinner party with them at his house and doesn't want to offend. So many interesting people and not a question thats eye opening in the bunch..What a waste !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I was so looking forward to this DVD boxed set and now I am just so disappointed. What were they thinking? Right off the bat I looked for Truman Capote but he is not in it. I looked for Lucille Ball, nope. There is no Bette Davis, no Joan Crawford etc. Merv was his best with the larger than life ladies and his interviews with Truman Capote were fascinating. They really screwed this up.

The production is poor and we thought the selection of clips was done to make us want the good ones. It is like a tease. I say don't buy it, wait for the next series which I bet will have a better selection with better packaging inserts. Don't stiff us next time Merv!!! You need to think of us and not the money! Please upgrade the quality and give us the better clips! Thanks. We are such fans of yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone But Not Forgotten.......","review":"Where in the world are the clips of Sylvester (James) the disco queen's appearances? He was enthralling and captivating and shocked Merv by appearing in a dress on the show. For that time it was unheard of... unless it was Milton Bearle of course. But the clips of Sylvester should have been included, as he was one unforgettable character. So this gets 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much footage, not enough discs","review":"Overall, it was great to see some of the classic interviews from the show, but they are really edited. Just when you get into the clip, it's over. For example, Orson Wells' last interview, conducted 2 hours before he passed away, was just getting interesting when it just fades into the next guest. Also, there is no way of telling how equal the editing of the interviews are - the Jack Benny interview is nearly 30 minutes while the George Burns interview is over in about 3 minutes.Instead of this set including 3 discs with 3 different themes, there should have been 3 dvd sets each devoted to a particular theme. Check out the Dick Cavett dvd sets and you'll see what I mean - complete shows, complete intervies and great bonus features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"Sat down and watched it non-stop, from start to finish.

I have normal size ears, and they are SOOOOOOO uncomfortable, too big. They don't sit comfortably behind my ear,and the speaker doesn't fit in my ear. It looks like they put the speaker on the wrong side; the speaker faces outward, so the people standing next to me can hear my music so I can't put the volume up too high. The sound quality is terrible so in order to hear my music while I'm on the bus I HAVE to put the volume all the way up, but then the person next me can hear it also because of the stupid design.I bought these because they looked sturdy, and they probably are, but they just suck.

I really do. Except for the fact that they don't even REMOTELY come close to fitting within my ears. I have them on right now. They dangle sadly just outside of the shell of my ear. These headphones are leaving me hanging, like an inconsiderate lover.I can ALMOST hear my music. Faintly. As if it's being played on the other side of the house. And no amount of smooshing can make them fit.If I press them roughly into my ear canal, the sound quality is as can be expected for a pair of ear buds. But seeing as the second I let them go, they come flying out, they are pretty much useless.If you have freakishly large ear canals and normal ear-buds continue to disengage like a hotdog in a hallway then I sincerely recommend these for you.

They were a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"Ear piece is a little bulky and the part that wraps around ear is VERY flimsy. As a result the headphones do not stay in place while out jogging. Constantly having to hold them in place to prevent them from falling out, which they did several times. Never had this problem before. Overall audio quality was ok, not great but not terrible. I suppose if you were sitting in one place and not moving around much these would be acceptable, but there are many better options for similar price. Not worth returning, I threw them out after using once.

There's some real art going on here.Listen to it.

Days of the New has lost a few members, and taken on a few new members since thier last album. Their sound has changed, but certainly not for the worse! Travis and the band are backed up by a choir and an full orchestra which gives them a rich and dynamic sound. Both the instruments and the voices blend perfectly, and if the lyrics get a little too deep for you, just listen to the music, that alone is a treat! They haven't lost the power in thier music, they've just refined it a whole lot, and this is an excellent album! I haven't been this excited about a new C.D. in a looong time! If you are even a little curious about it-- buy it! You won't be sorry! There isn't a bad track anywhere on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"And i thougth they couldn't do any better...","review":"What is there to say, but to: listen to the CD!!

I liked this one also...not having a name I have named it the Days of the New \\"green albumn\\".On this cd there were some changes to the band members specifically they added a female backup vocal. She fits in most songs, such as Flight response and The real. But in others like Take me back then and Phobics of tragedy something does not jive.In general there are plenty of good songs on this 14 track cd to please you. Of course there is the brilliant sound of acoustical guitar throughout. It is trully a pleasure to enjoy this band on a fine pair of speakers that can trully bring out the strings plucking and sliding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD, but very different from 1st cd.","review":"I really liked the first album.

Ok, but not really something that had a lot of longevity. That idea was erased when I heard \\"Enemy\\" on the radio a few months back. That & the advice of a friend made me decide to get 2. As soon as I heard the banging of horse hoves on \\"Flight Response\\", I knew DOTN had made an immortal record. Celtic guitars, VAST-like chants, an 18-piece orchestra and techno rythems/loops followed. I was blown away. The new DOTN was better than the first version of the band, all the ways around. Buy This Album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S GOOD","review":"It's a lot better than I thought it would be, Travis Meeks still makes acoustic rock sound awesome, keep up the good work Trav!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 For Who?","review":"The much anticipated follow up to their self-titled debut is a waste of time. I was highly dissapointed. I was expecting a slight advancement on their previous work, yet keeping with their style. The first single alone turned me off. Who's heard of Techno-Acoustic? The mix just doesn't work. If you like techno, buy Moby. If you like rock, buy Alice In Chains. If you like Days Of The New, buy their first album. By all means, don't buy 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-indulgent !","review":"One of the key highlights about the first album (and there were many) was that Travis and Co. allowed the songs to 'breathe'. The acoustic guitars and their arrangements really came out in full flight, with production to match, which together really allowed the songs to shine. The disappointing thing about the second album is that while the songwriting is fine, it is burried behind a wall of instruments and poor production. Those wonderful acoustic tones of the first album suddenly find themselves fighting for a piece of space in the background which in the end losses the 'essence' of what made the first album so unique and different. The bottom line is that now DOTN sound just like another band, will little, real differeniation. - Get back to the basics Travis."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even close to as good as it could've been","review":"I was blown away by the Days of the New's first album. It will forever be in atleast my top five. I waited a long time to hear their new stuff and I was very very let down. This album is terrible. I listened all the way through the first night I bought it, and the next day I sold it back to the store. They have drifted from genious guitar and drums to stupid, unmelodic drum machines and synthesizers...terrible terrible music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll Wait for the Days of the OLD","review":"Uh, what happened to Days of the New? This new album should be called Travis (it's all about ME) Meeks sings the blues. The new techno-beat and poorly structured songs can not even be compared to the first album. The vocals are fine, but the sound just lost the heart. I hope the Former DOTN band puts out an album minus MEEKS and prove they also have talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word...","review":"TERRIBLE. The new cd is simply terrible. All but destroying the band i loved. Meeks has added too much to such a rich simple sound. The original album called \\"one dimensional\\" by some was simply amazing. In an effort to try to create an album as good as the first Meeks has failed miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely Disappointed","review":"Maybe my expectations were too high after totally loving DOTN's first release. Travis seems lost without his former bandmates. Classical, indegenous, techno, and nu-metal, with hints of the origional DOTN sound, smashed into a crap sandwich that fits your cd player, did not turn out very appealing to me. I only find 2 tolerable songs, one of which is \\"Enemy\\", and that became old very quickly. I can't remember the name of the other song and I don't care to shake the pounds of dust built up on it to look.I didn't like it, but maybe you will.

The songs are haunting and uplifting in turns, brilliantly orchestrated and superbly performed.The album flows from start to finish and is full of great surprises along the way.For instance, 'Flight Response' from it's rather inauspicious beginning gradually builds into something very powerful: and that's only the first song!!There are no weaknesses here, truly a very special collection.You really need some time with this and once you're 'in' to it, take some more time to listen from start to finish.Highly recommended to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ideas, lovely quilts, small projects are not applique.","review":"Ms Severson has a wonderful sense of color and design.

I can barely remember each chapter by the end of it.Several pages, I've simply skimmed, looking for something worth reading and coming up empty. I expect I'll \\"finish\\" it that way, if at all.By contrast, I found King's \\"On Writing\\" to be inspirational, instructive, informative, and engaging. I sincerely wish I could say the same for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read, insightful","review":"I find most of Terry Brooks's work to be hit-and-miss, but this one was a definite hit. He lets us in to his head during the creating process. While there is nothing particularly ground-breaking here, his style is very conversational and easy to read. He doesn't get bogged down in mechanics but tries to convey that writing is a process and a craft, not just a hobby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry Brooks is a wonderful author","review":"I have been a fan of Terry Brooks since I was about 12 years old. This book is a great read even for those who don't want to become professional writers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book!","review":"\\"Sometimes the Magic Works\\" is a wonderful book for aspiring authors and fans of best-selling fantasy author Terry Brooks alike. Mr. Brooks has created a truly delightful blend of personal memoir and writing guide that offers a rare peek behind the curtain at the life of a successful writer. In revealing what it takes to \\"make it\\" in this incredibly competitive field (discipline, perseverance, creativity, and LOTS of luck, among other things), Mr. Brooks provides the kind of invaluable advice and insight that any young writer would consider themselves lucky to happen upon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book and super insights","review":"If you want to get a bit more of a glimpse into how Terry Brooks thinks and crafts his stories read this book. It's full of insights into what he thinks about the movie Hook, george Lucas, which of his books are his favorites and what he thinks of his work in general. I've gone back and reread parts of this just for a reminder and a bit of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writers Take Hope!","review":"As an aspiring writer, I nearly despaired about my prospects of becoming an author after reading Stephen King's book on writing, which struck me as demeaning, but this book not only offered me great technical and artistic ideas, it gave me back my hope. Brooks makes a cohesive argument for doing the tough pre-work of writing up front, which many would say takes away from a story's creativity and spontaneity. Given his excellent body of work, though, his methods were nothing less than compelling for me. I was no more successful in putting this book down than I have been with any of his novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a complete dissapointment.","review":"Consider other books if you want to seriously learn UML or OO Analysis/design.

Ms. Kingston's book was very rigid and authoritative. Although Ms. Kingston's techniqes may work for some, her book made me feel anxious and \\"wrong\\". Ms. Linn's book encourages people to rely on their own intution and trust their own feelings rather than following traditonal \\"rules\\". She gives examples of space clearing techniques from many cultures and encourages you to make your own rituals rather than following some set technique.You may not agree with all Ms. Linn's ideas, but she presents them in a way that allows you to consider them and then make your own decisions, rather than telling you that you have to believe what she believes.

The wood grain and finish are nice and are a lovely addition to our table. The pepper grinder works well, though I should point out that you don't have to turn it very much to get a good amount of pepper. Definitely don't go at it too vigorously unless you like a lot of pepper!Overall, the quality seems excellent, and it's an attractive set. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's a little more expensive than I would have expected, but as far as the product itself is concerned, I have no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good shakers","review":"The S&P shakers are a bit on the short side, but look absolutely great and function well.

Krusell has made another excellent slip for those with slim waists; unfortunately for those of us with middle age spread, it doesn't prevent the occasional slipping from the belt. I AM very impressed with the multidapt concept, so I'm trying other products of Krusell's. Highly recommend the concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: Please Read","review":"I really liked the concept of this product, but please be warned of the following: The product has a single holder for the wii remote, which then attaches to either the bat, golf club or tennis racket. The problem with this is that the holder connector to the sports equipment is very weak. The first time I used this product, I used the bat in the wii Sports baseball game. The bat has enough weight to it that it creates a breaking point at the remote holder's connection to the bat. Swinging the bat in the air, for one inning, caused the bat to break off the remote holder and fly into a wall, literally putting a hole in the wall. I am just glad it didn't fly into one of my children.This is a great product concept, but not tested thoroughly in terms of the stresses that would be put on the plastic components with normal use. Would love to see an improved version, and hope to get a refund on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to make te grade.","review":"A waste. Limits the use of the Wii controller.

An adult was playing the game, the baseball attachment was not struck-just the swing of the bat broke the attachment. Now the golf club and tennis racket are useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but not necessary","review":"My husband purchased these accessories to go with Wii Sports. They should have been made much larger. Especially the golf club! You get a child size version of a tennis racket, golf club and a baseball bat. The tennis racket helps you visualize what you need to do slightly better, but the baseball bat and golf club are just silly.

It has the same producer, loads of great sessionmen including Michael McDonald, Nicolette Larson, Bill Payne (Little Feat) Jim Keltner, the Tower of Power Horns and the Memphis Horns. There was one MAJOR problem with this album. The SONGS ARE NOT THERE. Plain and simple, you can add lush production and good musicianship, but if the songs aren't there, the songs aren't there. Johnston was trying for a more \\"current\\" sound. It failed. It was more like bad disco. For a better Johnston solo effort go to his next album Still Feels Good. Better songs, more \\"doobie-ish\\" material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doobies Out-takes","review":"This is a nice little album from Tom Johnston; it sounds very much like a Doobies album but without I'm sorry to say very good songs. It is even produced by Ted Templeman!! Standout track for me is 'Savannah Nights'. The rest of the very short album (29 minutes) just flows away.Why did Wounded Bird not release this album together with \\"Still Feels Good\\" (33 minutes) on 1 CD ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album Sucks!","review":"If you like the more rootsy sound of Johnston era Doobies,I doubt you would like this. Sounds very dated and nods to thedisco sound of the time it was recorded. The only reason it gets2 stars is that the musicians play this crap about as well as they can. I normally don't completely pan albums, but this just reminds me of how bad the state of rock was in the late seventies.

Then I recommended it to my best friend, and she couldn't put it down! Some people hate fantasy novels, but this novel is definitely above the other fantasy novels that people hate. The plot was engaging, and the characters were interesting. In fact, I was so mad when I finished the novel because I would no longer have this wonderful book to finish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An average fantasy-type novel with few interesting moments","review":"Overall I was disappointed with this book, not because it was really bad (it's not), but rather because it wasn't nearly the great novel reviews here indicated. Most of the characters were somewhat trite and not especially interesting (and about as alien as left handed humans). The plot was linear, predictable, and slow moving. At times, the book read like a almanac (e.g., there was a population number given for virutally every city Valentine and his group passed through or near). This doesn't make for particularly exciting reading. Bottom line, it's the last Marjipoor story I'll read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving fantasy/sf \\"epic\\"","review":"This wasn't a really bad book, but it was disappointing because it didn't live up to some of the reviews I'd read. The characters were trite and frankly uninteresting (most of the non-human characters were about as \\"alien\\" as left handed humans). The plot was linear, predictable, and plodding. It might have been a page turner for me if I were a juggling buff or a psychologist specializing in dream analysis, but I'm neither so it was a chore to get through. The last Marjipoor book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"a struggle","review":"I picked up this book with high hopes based on the reviews but was uninspired by its text. Although the first 50 pages were interesting, the next 450 were a struggle to finish as the novelty of juggling (I'm a juggler) wore off and the plot became predictable. I would not recommend to those over fifteen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic","review":"After reading the other reviews i was stunned. I read this book years ago and although i am not avid SF reader found the book simplistic, unimaginative and predictable. Just my 2 cents.

B"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Gawd what a boring book!!!","review":"One thing I will say about this book is the author has some great imagination and this book seemed to be an excuse for him to get the fantastical creatures out of his system and onto paper. The \\"hero\\" is boring, passive, and only gets semi interesting when he is trying to reach his mother. The shapeshifters are creepy and virtually the only highlight in this dull dull book. There is a seamless blend of magic, medeval lifestyle, and advance technology, I just wish the author convince me to acutally care about the characters. If my brothers kept getting killed I would have ditched Valentine after couple chapters, I mean, what does it take for these people to get a freaking clue!?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Colored Pencil Solution Book","review":"What an incredible book!

The information is very light. Compared with some of the other options available such as Amit Kalani's MCAD/MCSD books there is only a grain on information. If you take the test soley on Microsoft's book I think you will find yourself woefully under prepared. Last, there are precious few questions, no tips, and little in the way of examples to work through. The book is a brief skim of topics that are covered in much better detail elsewhere.

He laughs when he finds the poop and thinks it's really funny that the penguin poop is pink.

So few books emphasize using a toilet."},{"rating":"2","title":"really fun read","review":"This book has been so entertaining for my newly potty trained daughter and her older sister who loves reading it with her.

When I ask him to chose a book to read, this one is always in the running. The title of the book \\"Where's the Poop\\" is not a phrase that is used throughout the book (as it would seem) But it is implied that parents can/should use the phrase when reading with their child. This book is definitely useful for potty training. In fact, so helpful that now my child is extremely curious when our cat goes to the bathroom in the liter box, or the dog going to the bathroom in the yard. It was almost like a light bulb went off, and my son realized that every living thing has a proper place for poop. Potty training is going very well, by the way.

It was met with \\"I don't want to.\\" He even goes to a fantastic early education school that is great with potty training. As a therapist I was aware of many potty training books but not this one. However I read all the reviews on-line. My little one loves lift-the-flaps books and I knew that children learn better with hands on material. I decided to give it a try. The book arrived three weeks ago and we read it. He immediately wanted to go set on the potty and read the \\"poop book.\\" INSTANT SUCCESS!!! For the first two weeks we had to read it each time he went to poop or he read it himself. (He memorized it the first day).

First of all, it is a great picture book of many animals. It is a great lift-the-flap book, with many flaps to lift. And it is an brief introduction to potty training. The text has the mommy or daddy elephant, penguin, kangaroo, etc. asking the baby whether it needs to go poop yet. The baby answers no, it has already gone. Each page has lots of flaps -- you find all sorts of things and, under the final flap, the poop! The image of the poop is different for different animals which I thought was good. The last page is a picture of a bathroom. This book does not go into using the potty and is not about potty training, but it is good for kids who have not started PT to get them thinking about poop."},{"rating":"2","title":"People poop goes in the toilet.","review":"This book is good for reminding my two-year-old that poop goes in the toilet.

He had no interest in finding the animals poop whatsoever and I wouldn't consider this a potty training book at all. Basically just a flap book looking for poop all over the place.

You have to make up your own story to go along with the text though, because the text provided is just so dumb. I'd be embarrassed to read it as printed to my 1 year old, and this is coming from someone who regularly makes up silly songs on silly topics to sing to the same 1 year old.The description suggested that the book shows how every little animal has a place to make their poop, but I struggle to find that message in the book.

The idea of this book -- to show that all animals make poop - is a good one; however the delivery lacks creativity. With each animal there is an opportunity to search for the poop -- hence the book's title. There are lift-up flaps hiding various items on each two-page \\"story\\". Alas, the flaps are easily torn and -- the worst failure in my teacher's mind -- the poop is ALWAYS in the lower right corner of the spread.

Herge only gave one interview in his lifetime, to Numa Sadoul. The only other work on herge was Harry Thompson's excellent 1991 biography on Herge and Tintin. Thompson's (apt name for a biographer!! Which twin is he?!) book is full of detail, and for that, is probably more valuable than Peeter's work. However, Peeter's book is chock full of original illustrations, shows the evolution in Herge's work, and has a great deal of Herge's private Tintin memorabilia. well worth a critical look."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, coffee-table book... not in-depth","review":"This is a good book for tintin lovers, but mainly in the colorful photos and illustrations, fill-out-your-knowledge kind of way. -- If you're looking for good, well-researched, solid history of herge, then this book is somewhat lacking. has one or two chapters of herge's life, but with large gaps and not always excellently written (or translated perhaps.) -- frustrating at times when there is an amazing illustration of some notebook page that herge drew showing early tintin characters, but with no caption describing (most of the admittedly excellent illustrations have captions, but some are missing.) -- if you want a beautiful, full-color book to give you more (but not exhaustive) info about herge and tintin, this is an excellent book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agree","review":"with most of the reviewers that the book is not detailed enough. The author only dedicated a few pages to each Tintin book and I found myself turning the page to find that was all there was!However,1) Has a nice biography on Herge and doesn't spare the hard stuff - bon.2) Shows Herge's other work, which the other companion doesn't do (if it does I don't remember it.)3) Discusses the changes and updates the Tintins went though, the colorizations, etc.4) Very nice pictures, pictorials, etc.Summary: If you are a Tintin fan, you must get this, but it leaves you wanting more. It's very easy reading, I picked it up for some post prandial reading but found I couldn't stop(!) and read til the end. I also have Michael Farr's companion, but found that very hard reading and never finished it. I'm now going back to Michael Farr after reading this one. But this one is definitely a very nice read. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first hand stories even for residents of other states.","review":"In Pennsylvania we have a cable TV channel called PCN TV; Pennsylvania Cable Network. This book is based on video interviews with WWII veterans living in Pennsylvania before the war, and came back to their home state after completing their service. The book contains about 30 personal stories of veterans who served in different branches, in different theaters of battle, and are written in first-person.In my opinion, this is the best book for getting to know what these men went through. Some tales are harrowing, some sad, and one or two are even funny. I found the book more interesting than even \\"Band of Brothers.\\" If you're a serious WWII era history buff, or a casual reader about military stories, this is an excellent book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hat!","review":"I received this hat on time and in good condition !! The only bad thing is is that my boyfriend usually wears a Medium in all other fitted hats so I ordered him a M in this hat. Its a little big though and I am afraid to wash it and shrink it because of the maroon coloring running onto the white. I think a SMALL would be too small.Its a very nice hat. The only one I could find like it was on this site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love all the second-tier acts of 1995?","review":"This CD is so bad, I was personally insulted upon listening to it - it only gets one star because zero is not an option. Nominated for a Juno? What a joke! (This is, of course, the same organization that gives prizes to Celine Dion and Nickelback.) If you really, really, want to be transported back to the days when yawn-inducing third-wave grunge imitators ruled the earth, if you think that the disappearance of Stone Temple Pilots is a catastrophe rather than an act of mercy, this is the CD for you. If, however, you're actually interested in the many directions that music has moved in the last fifteen years, and you don't want to hear more of a style that was exhausted around the time Friends debuted on NBC, then look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful item","review":"I'd say, all in all, it's a useful item and almost up to handling a small SLR and certainly a 4/3 camera, which is what I'm using it with. The detachable feature is great! The adjustable length is a little strange but serves it's purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best strap available","review":"My family owns 3 of these now. Feels like you don't even have your camera around your neck. It makes the camera so light and comfortable. Best strap that you could purchase and it lasts for years. My strap went from one camera to another. Never need another strap again and the easy clip keeps the strap on the neck and then quickly in your hand for close shots and back on the strap again. I would encourage anyone to make this one purchase and be set for the life of several digital cameras. It's also the only strap that will only fit through the very small hole on the side of the digital camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"It actually depressed me.","review":"Not what I normally look for from a romance novel, obviously.Having known women that really believe their men (fathers, boyfriends, husbands) treat them like crap 'to protect them' or 'for their own good' this book was like an insight into their lives.A woman who blames herself or makes excuses for the emotional abuse that is heaped on her is just sad... sad, sad, sad. Don't we see enough of this in the real world?And can I just say that the very idea that women hold their power on their knees (as Hannah does midway through the book) is BEYOND INSULTING! A womans' power comes from her intellect and strength not her suction level.If you want something that doesn't subjugate and marginalize a woman, Hustler magazine is a better bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make time to enjoy this novel","review":"witty, charming, sexy and I agree with others, one of the best ofDodd's historical romance novels.Also recommend: \\"A Secret Love\\" by Stephanie Laurens and \\"Damselin the Rough\\" by Ann Mary Tempesta"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!","review":"I have read other books by Christina Dodd & liked them. Which is why I read this one. What a disappointment! Story plot was o.k. But character development was poor. I like reading stories where I like the characters, at least like them at some point in the story & wish they'll be happy in the end. But this story was so boring, dragging on that I couldn't care less what happened in the end. Only because of my silly compulsion to finish every book I start, I ended up wasting a few hours of my time on this book. BTW, I did like the \\"Rules of engagement\\" in the same series very much! I liked Hannah Settrington in that story, which is why I got this book. My humble opinion is that Avoid reading this book unless you've nothing better to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"gothic grabber!","review":"Okay, Dougald isn't a \\"pretty\\" hero. He's wicked, bad and dangerous. That's JUST the fantasy type of hero I like, one who has a lot of torture stored up, one who is obsessed with the heroine, one who makes my spine tingle with maybe fear and maybe something else. If you like wicked bad-boys, heroines who are drawn against their will to their men, and a moody broody castle ... this one is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"I usually love Christina Dodd novels......but not this one. Dougald was absolutely one of the WORST \\"heroes\\" I've ever read about. He has a mean streak a mile wide - there is no redemption for him. I had a really hard time finishing this novel.
