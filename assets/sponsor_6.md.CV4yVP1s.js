They used to put out quality music and this is definitely nothing new to the world of music. He could have done a much better job singing too.. but even the quality of the recording is terrible. His voice sounds scratchy and believe me that is not from his off key style. It comes from not caring about the music--period. Give it 5 stars-- it's exactly what MTV would love to rave about.

But after about 5,000 listens, I made myself like it. I don't think I'll be able to do that with this album. I am so disappointed. U2 fans will know what I mean when I say this: the boys have finally \\"gotten over it.\\" Gone are the days of angst, intimacy and heartbreak in U2 songs; here are the days of sappiness, shallow lyrics and complete normalcy. Normalcy. Blah. When did I ever ask for normalcy from U2? What happened to the textures and open-ended lyrics of Achtung Baby? What happened to the abstract poetics of the Joshua Tree?

GIVE ANOTHER ONE, PLEASE..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzz...nothing noteworthy about this album,","review":"Perhaps the truest test of any good band is their ability to acknowledge that the well has run dry. U2 is apparently either straining water from mud, or aimlessly wandering the field with a divining rod, because their well has definitely dried up. After successfully demonstrating that they had the ability to push their music in any direction they wished, they release this latest \\"effort\\", a collection of uninteresting drivel. The songs are shapeless, and not in a good way. It's like eating an entire box of wet saltines at one sitting...it's mushy, bland, and it makes you yearn for just about anything else.Their passion is obviously dead, possibly because they are too wealthy to care anymore. It's sad that it has happened, but the the unforgettable fire that used to be a part of every U2 song, is now completely extinguished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome entry into the 21st Century","review":"I must say that this is there most brilliant work since Achtung Baby. Every decade at least one album stands out like Joshua Tree of the '80's and Achtung Baby in the 90's. I am an avid, fanatical fan of theres and I find myself once again emerged into this album. There music has a way of piercing one's soul. Track's 1,3,4,5,8,and 9 are incredibly awesome. I can't wait for the tour!! If you are a true U2 fan and not stuck in the early 80's still (expand your horizon's old schoolers) you'll really enjoy this album. Bar none they are the greatest group in the world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"errr what?","review":"'This is only their 9th album of original material in 20 years creating a relatively small \\"body of work\\" for a band that recieves unwarranted historical mention.'Say what?

So I missed out. Then two days later I got it and got home to listin to it and man was I wishing I hadn't spent all my money that first day. For About 4 months it was in my cd changer and playing half (or more)of the day. Drove my family nuts..but, for good music.All that you can't leave behind is a mix of all of there other albums. Its got a Serious side to it, Original, and some pretty smooth pop type riffs. If you like any other U2 album, you will definatly love this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gray Album","review":"Bono or one of the guys in U2 said this was their \\"White album\\"--I think it's more like they gray album. Gray as in ho-hum. I've suffered through this album a half dozen times and I must say that this one will go down as my least listened to U2. This album is mediocre, dull, and uninspired. The Edge is wasted, Bono's weak voice isn't hidden behind the depth of music and/or passionate lyrics as in past albums, so it's just a bunch of screeches and groans. If the lyrics are classic, so is my used Bic razor. I was hungry for more U2, but now I feel like a ate at a bad Denny's knock off restaraunt. It's not Muzak, but it's not rock and roll either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely underwhelming","review":"Love the band. Have all their records. Love the single \\"Beautiful Day\\". The rest...boring. I am shocked by the knee-jerk praise for this album, as if the critics and mass populace are determined to make sure U2 never takes a risk again. Clearly there is some sort of POP backlash going on here, because this album is so unnecessary to you record collection. Save your hard-earned dough and buy TRAVIS, \\"The Man Who\\", which is what the new U2 album could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't believe the hype","review":"Listening to Beautiful Day makes you think All That You Can't Leave Behind is gonna be a great old-time U2 album. The fact is, there is almost no drum and bass section in this album. Stripped down is an understatement. U2 have never made an album like this, where there's only Bono to carry them. Normally, this would still be good, but Bono now thinks he is an R&B singer. His voice has been destroyed by cigarettes, age, and too much falsetto singing in the past. A once soaring set of pipes now sounds considerably limited to moaning. He sounds a bit better in concert, so let's hope he was just suffering from a bad couple of months when this album was recorded. Contrary to other reviews by people who either loyally refuse to see the truth or have just jumped on the band wagon, this album is not better than or as good as Joshua Tree or any other U2 album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettagble Fire","review":"I was surprised to see so many rave reviews of this album. While \\"Beautiful Day\\" is an incredible single, it's not enough to hold this album together. The remaining songs are too lyrically boring, sonically toned-down and musically bland to be memorable. Only the song \\"New York\\" near the end re-kindles the U2 fire they are known for. The contrast between this album and their last three is so great that it leaves me wondering about the future of this band...is this the beginning of the end? If you are a fan of the early REM albums (Murmer,Reckoning, Lifes Rich etc) as I am, this album is analagous to \\"New Adventures in Hi-Fi\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"All That You Can't Stop Loving","review":"I'm a little confused at how some people are saying this is not as good as Zooropa and Pop, those were not U2's best albums. Although they were interesting , I think the band had lost some of their identity with those efforts. And to say this is going backwards towards the Joshua Tree would be a compliment, not a put down. I just don't get it?? Anyway, this album is great. It showcases U2, both old and new. I would HIGHLY recommend this album to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another victim of the Loudness wars.","review":"When I first heard this album on my car's MP3 player, I immediately fell in love with the album. However after listening to the entire CD on my high-end sound system, I feel much like Alex from \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" - revolted and nauseated with the music I love.This seems to be the first U2 album to be subject to the destroyer of sound fidelity: The loudness filter. Forget about appreciating the guitar work, drums and bass. All those sounds have been mushed together into a giant wall of static. This album is impossible to listen to from beginning to end without getting motion sickness.And record labels keep wondering why CD sales are plummeting. I would love to send this CD back asking for a refund due to lack-of-fidelity. Save your money and just download the MP3s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Solid Album From The Boys of U2","review":"Excellent Album, certainly the best album to come out since...well...since Pop of course!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very solid album","review":"I am not a big U2 fan, though I definitely like them. I don't have many of their earlier albums, but I have Joshua Tree, Pop and a couple others. I can say without hesitation that this is the best of the three. Songs 3, 4-8 and 11 are simply unforgettable. I think \\"In A Little While\\" is my favorite but it's hard to say. For anyone who is not sure they want the album because they don't really like U2, I say buy it anyway. At times Bono's voice reminds me of Jeff Buckley's and the influence of the Beatles is a strong presence here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired retro flash from U2","review":"Gone is the experimentation of the past three albums, which went a bit over the top, but at least this band never sounded like retreads of its old self on Zooropa, ...Baby or Pop. Here, the once socially relevant and powerful US bring back their old sound without the old feelings, and to me it sounds less than inspired. Clearly this is a monority opinion, judging from the other publised comments here, but this music sounds more like \\"product\\" than anything ever produced by this once revolutionary band. Lyrics as trite as those of \\"New York\\" would not have found their way onto a U2 album a decade ago, but now we hear Bono making tepid rhymes in a rock star pose that no longer looks unstudied. Bring back some of the heart to your music, boys, and all will be forgiven."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Opens Big, Then Fades a Bit...Still, it's U2\\"","review":"\\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" opens big, with \\"Beautiful Day\\", \\"Stuck in a Moment,\\" \\"Elevation\\" and the title track as its first four cuts. All are outstanding -- some of U2's best stuff ever. From there, the album is a bit mixed. About half of the remaining tracks are strong, the other half are pretty weak. It's definitely worth the purchase and adds another strong notch to U2's stellar reputation. Many are calling it the band's best album ever, but in my opinion \\"Achtung Baby\\" and \\"Joshua Tree\\" outshined it. Still, it's U2...you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 At Their Best","review":"In my opinion, this is U2's best CD. This cd beats out the depressing sound of Joshua Tree, and the dance music of Pop. All That You Can't Leave Behind (ATYCLB) is a great collection of upbeat songs. Perhaps this CD should have been called Pop? You can't really go wrong with this cd. The only reason it did not get 5 stars is because i would not classify it as a classic, or in the same category as Highway 61 (Bob Dylan), or Led Zeppelin 4. But, this is a great CD to have whether it is a classic or not. Perhaps this CD should have been called Pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"The old U2 is back","review":"U2 has definitly grown up and passed their mid-life crisis. For those who loved the electro-pop of Zooropa or Pop, this might not be your thing, but for those who remember the golden days, this is a return. After a slight departure from the Daniel Lanois influenced albums for the late 80's/early 90's, U2 has gone back to their roots by reuniting with the Joshua Tree producers and it can clearly be heard. This much more relaxed album is a joy to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing music","review":"I got this album and I have to say, when you don't feal like having your ears bashed in it's the best to listen to. Sometimes you just need some good ol' lyrics and smoothe tunes.This deserves 5+."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ALBUM","review":"I'll make this short and sweet. This is one of the best cd's I've bought in a LONG time. All of the songs are good, but my favorites are \\"Beautiful Day\\" and \\"Walk On\\".

This is the only time I have been disappointed with a U2 release. The songs seem to focus on Bono's vocals as opposed to the music which is not what made U2 who they are. Bono is not a great vocalist, I would say borderline good, but he is a great singer if you can follow. He puts his heart and soul into every word which is usually felt in the emotion of the songs; not on this album. The rock of U2 has always been the music, Edge's unequaled rifs,larrys unique timing and Bonos emtion are what make the band great; it is not on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY?","review":"What possibly could a bunch of drunken Irish louts have to say that would be remotely relevant to anything? \\"Bono\\" makes a lot of noise about \\"how good a Christian he is,\\" and while it's not for me to judge, I'll venture a bet that neither \\"U2\\" or (this one's even WORSE, if such a thing is possible!), \\"Stairway to (sic) Heaven\\" by that VILE Miss Plant and her sweet boys WON'T be on the jukebox in Heaven. Still: if this foolishness appeals to you, live and be well. I guess.

So it was a shock when I got this album and found middle age has caught up with them.It's like U2 without a spine. Weak songs. Their first single \\"Beautiful Day\\" was unremarkable both in theme and guitar hook. Bono's voice hasn't always been in the best shape, but it sounds dreadful now. I think he's permanently damaged his vocal chords. Compare his singing here to his beautiful chrystaline performance on BOY and you'll see a big difference.Only \\"Elevation\\" rocks out a bit, but then again, hardly. None of these songs inspired me.

I wouldn't say the horrible \\"s\\" word, but most of this is painfully generic....and what happened to the once brilliant lyrics? That is the biggest crime here. Only a couple of these songs are respectable lyrically...the rest of the band carries what little material works on this set.\\"Kite\\", \\"Peace On Earth\\", \\"Walk On\\" and \\"Beautiful Day\\" are the strongest because Bono actually made an effort on those....Imagine programming a cd to play only 4 songs on a U2 disc?!?!?Wild Honey is so bad, it actually makes me angry....Overall, a HUGE disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first U2 album I've rejected","review":"Let me qualify myself briefly be saying I am a huge fan who at one point owned everything they recorded in the studio (save a few B-sides) on vinyl beginning with their Irish only debut EP U2-3.

Certainly more mature sounding than the current stuff they've done. \\"All that you . . .\\" is stripped down, but to the point of wimpiness.

A must for any U2 fan out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"I actually liked \\"Beautiful Day.\\"","review":"I got word just now that U2 won Grammys for this album, I saw them last night on the show, along with Christina Aguilera and Shakira, whose \\"MTV Unplugged\\" won Best Latin Pop Album of the Year. I don't have this CD, but I downloaded \\"Beautiful Day\\" just now, heard it again, and actually had more appreciation for it than I had before. Forget what I said in my \\"going commercial\\" review; these Irish lads most justly deserved the victory they achieved last night. Sorry, 'N Sync. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Smashing Year For U2!","review":"These guys can still Rock This Town & simply turn around & sing such unforgettable medley's. (It's Just another genuinely designed Album by U2, nothing less/nothing more)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD rules!! rock on (or walk on, haha) U2!!!","review":"i love this cd so much. my parents bought it when i was in 5th grade (i'm in 7th now) and before that i couldn't really distinguish U2 from anyone else. but after my parents played it so much i began to love it, and one reason it's so great is that i can relate so many of the songs to my life, \\"stuck in a moment\\" and \\"walk on\\" being the main ones. but \\"beautiful day\\" always gets me in a good mood, and \\"walk on\\" helps me solve almost any problem i am having and makes it seem insignificant. i would really recommend buying this CD, because if you're anything like me, you won't be sorry!! walk on!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What this cd has taught me","review":"What can I say? It's one of their best. ( I have this Cd in addition 2 War The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby) Beautiful Day is about seeing beauty in everything around u. The lyrics and tune r great! Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of is a good one. It tells u not to let small disappointments get in ur way. Walk On I absolutely love!! The lyrics r beautiful and it's about staying strong and not looking back. Kite and In A Little While r a little slower but good. New York is cool! It does NY justice by showing how diverse it is. Peace On Earth is Bono's pleading 4 peace. I hate any kind of war and hope that there will be world peace. The vocals and rhythms r great and every true U2 fan should own this Cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ego is what you can't leave behind, Bono","review":"Although I think the singles are very good, I had to give this album 1 star on principles alone. For that I apologise.In the early nineties, Bono accepted an MTV award for best alternative band with a speech ending \\"...an we will continue to f...-up the mainstream\\". Well, it seems that quite the opposite has occurred. The band is getting critical praise for retreading old areas and avenues!!! The album is safe and commercial and will no doubt serve Bono's ego fix after the unpopular PopMart tour. Shame for giving in to market forces.It would be nice of them to retire now, at their peak, but I know this won't happen. We'll just have to watch a slow and painful death of a band over the next 5 to 10 years.Boo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"That's enough","review":"That's enough now. Despite the fact that U2 fans keep convincing themselves that their favourite band is still the best in the world no matter what, it should be pretty clear to everybody that U2 have reached their peak (and what a peak, I used to love them too) a long time ago, but now, rather than having the dignity of ending their career at their best like every great band should do and usually does, they sadly keep releasing cds after cds, from Best ofs and Lives to new albums where the attempt to adapt their sound to a new era and different tastes, with unconvincing electronic sounds and dull songs is, yes, to be appreciated, but simply not enough. They are simply not as good as they used to be, and the longer they wait to call it quits the worse it's gonna get. Isn't it better to disappear from the scene leaving beautiful songs and unforgettable memories in our minds, rather than descending the mountain of glory they conquered long ago..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Songs I *Can* Leave Behind","review":"I had great hopes for this album. I really did. On a recent visit to London, I caught U2's performance of \\"Elevation\\" on \\"Top of the Pops.\\" I remember thinking, \\"Good! They're getting back to making strong, interesting music. It's about time.\\" Following the insipid sorts of things that U2 has put out since the early '90's, I was ready for a real change of pace. Imagine my disappointment upon discovering that \\"Elevation\\" was the only departure from that sadly-established pattern. I am unable to explain why \\"Beautiful Day\\" is so popular ... repetitious, dull lyrics and a not-too-interesting rhythm. The rest of the cuts are so forgettable that they are not even worth mentioning. For the most die-hard U2 fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2: Can't Leave This Album Behind","review":"What can I say? U2 has done it again. All That You Can't Leave Behind continues to remind us why U2 is one of the greatest bands around. With this album you will hear many different influences but the sound is still completely U2. IMHO, it's not their best, but it's ranks up there. It's a bit mellower than recent albums but older U2 fans will certainly fall in love with it. Definite thumbs up! Can't wait for the US tour next spring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this album!","review":"U2 is back! Listen to this album on a sunny day and it will bring tears to your eyes! The lyrics are sublime. The beats are fresh - the Edge found his guitar again. Just something you have to experience for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"yeah right!","review":"I allready knew some songs of U2 on the radio and I liked them. I allready had buyed a greatest hits cd of U2 which was nice(4 stars). But this cd is nothing. I am sorry for myself because I spend money on this. The songs that I heard on the radio were good, I allready knew them so that was not a surprise, but the rest just sucks. Below you can see how I rate the songs:Beautiful Day: 9/10Stuck In A Moment: 8/10Elevation: 8/10Walk On: 9/10Kite: 7/10In A Little While: 7/10The first 6 songs are very good, but the rest just sucks!Wild Honey: 1/10Peace On Earth: 4/10When I Look At The World: 2/10New York: 2/10Grace: 1/10The 2 stars I give to this cd are the stars for the first 6 songs, if the rest of the album was as good as the first 6, then I might have given this album 4 or 5 stars, but no. So only buy this if you are a real U2 fan, if you are new with U2 then you should buy a greatest hits album."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but...","review":"I just don't get it. Yes, they are interesting and Bono has a soaring voice but other than a couple of catchy tunes, the rest is nondescript and bland. While they are apparently trying to diversify their sound, the limitations in their song writing ability is becoming ever more evident. I guess to many this band is the second coming, however there is so much more interesting, challenging and dynamic music out there. Try the new Porcupine Tree album,\\"In Abstenia\\" if you want music that drives you. It's time to move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at best...","review":"This album disappoints. It's clear that opinions on this album are widespread, so you should make your own assessment (buy the disc - it's U2, after all) but my take is that it:1) lacks passion 2) lacks originality and artistic appeal 3) seriously lacks Edge's guitar 4) lacks a \\"theme\\" - which is what makes listening to other U2 albums such a joyU2 newcomers may like this album - it's pretty easy to swallow - but a true fan may have a tougher time having revelled in Achtung Baby, The Joshua Tree, The Unforgettable Fire and others all these years.U2 set their own bar really high - they're having a tough time clearing it now because of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake Up Dead Band","review":"What has happened here? It's not a pretty sight folks. Here is U2 wallowing in, oh god no, adult contemporary music land. Worst of all, Bono and the boys are strutting around declaring that they're here to save rock and roll. Since when does this kind of pablum pass as rock and roll? I really wanted to like this record, but there's really not much here to grab on to. Boring boring boring. Truly some of the worst lyrics I've heard in a long time, and the music isn't much better. Let's hope it's just another phase they're going through."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best...","review":"This is one of the best CDs ever. In addition to the radio favorites such as \\"Beautiful Day\\" \\"Stuck in the Moment\\" and a movie soundtrack \\"Elevation\\", all other songs are just great and you never get bored listening to this CD. It is a great buy and there is no doubt that songs from this CD were nominated for the Grammy awards last year AND this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booorring!","review":"I bought this as a gift for my favorite U2 fan. Every song sounds the same as the one before. People told me it sounds more like \\"old U2\\". Yeah. It sounds suspiciously like a band trying to sound like U2 yet still be palatable to the radio audience. It's by far their least innovative and most sappy... but I know what the problem is. Radiohead made a Faustian deal and stole all of U2's future albums. They sound more like U2 than U2 does now. I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Over Yourself Already !!","review":"I have tried to like U2 but after repeated listens and taking the time to digest this left over 80's band filled up with its own significance , I can no longer stand it . I lump them in with the Beatles, Stones and Springsteen as the most overrated artist of all time . It would take their whole catalog for me to fill 1 cd ...sorry folks but they are just a mass commercial outfit with one of most repetitive guitar sounds ever ."},{"rating":"1","title":"U2 cd inferior to the new cd by their peers","review":"The new U2 cd is inferior to the new cd by Echo and the Bunnymen. Both bands started at the same time, worked for a time with a similar sound-- Only thing, Echo was the cooler band back then, and that hasn't changed any.Where the Bunnymen are still alternative, and still question \\"answers in the sky\\", U2 jump at the chance to push a feel-good, friendly-god view of the universe. If you like Hallmark card lyrics mixed with rock and roll sensibilities, then U2 is the band for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank Goodness","review":"Following what I considered their most dreadful period (Zooropa and Pop-Mart) the band are back with a good listenable album. Granted, it loses steam after track 5, but the first five tracks are really solid. The CD is a good listen, though nothing even close to being on par with some of their greatest tunes (like With or without You, In the Name, Sunday Bloody Sunday, etc)."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2, tours, with new album Atomic Bomb","review":"For those heavy u2 fans who can't get enoughof their work, u gotta also own the rarecollectors edition:\\"1990-2000 + B-sides\\" and \\"Elevation\\" (limited edition)Both cds contain rare tracks never releasedbut offer rare treats for die-hard fansAll That You Can't Leave Behind offersa much more subdued U2"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to \\"in a little while\\" for a long while","review":"This CD has two sweet songs on it: \\"In a little while\\" and \\"Elevation\\". In a little while is the kind of slow groove song that really grows on you and, personally, I think it's great. It's simple, open, and airy, and Bono's voice is amazing on it. It flat out grooves. On the other hand, Elevation flat out rocks. This song will get your blood flowing and your head banging.Of course, you've all heard Beautiful Day which is a really good song but, I believe, a tier below the aforementioned two.Third tier songs include Stuck in a moment... and Walk On.The rest of the songs didn't catch my ear so they didn't get many listens.Overall, a very respectable album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Rock Band in the World Saving us from Junk","review":"Once again, the best band in the world is back on top. They are saving music from the miserable drek it has become with Rap, Boy Bands and badly dressed divas with one range. Go see them in concert if you haven't. They will be back stateside in the Fall. ATYCLB is brilliant...Kite and Walk On, Beautiful Day, Elevation, all of the tunes are great..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's get it together, guys","review":"This album sure is a dud. Save for the dark \\"New York\\" tune, ATYCLB just doesn't cut the grade - it's pretty [bad]. U2 are known for their cutting edge style and their ability to always push musical boundaries, but this record doesn't push much of anything - except U2's unit shifting status in the biz.Sure it's a big seller, but that doesn't make it a unique or enjoyable album! I just hope we're not in for a decade of grandfather rock by one of the best bands ever.Let's get it together, guys....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed fan","review":"It's not just this cd that lets me down, but everything U2 are doing at the moment. Rather than leaving us their great albums and quitting as legends, they produce insignificant music that will slowly (but painfully) make them die. What a let down...."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW CAN YOU LEAVE THIS BEHIND???????","review":"WOW, how can one really leave...U2s',ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND without thinking that it is a great album and that it won 4 Grammys and that Bono is the best!!!Easy, listen to the album and you'll realize that U2 has nothing else to say with songs like \\"stuck in a moment you can't get out of or \\"Elevation.\\"The production is fine but the energy isn't and Bonos' voice is gone...compared to the Banshee sounds of Achtung Baby. Then there is \\"Beutiful Day,\\" which sounds like a B-side effort. This album is trully over-rated and althought it tries...it lacks in consistency."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best effort since Actung Baby","review":"I'll be brief here. For those who have fallen off the U2 bandwagon(like myself)due to less than stellar releases like Pop and Zooropa, this CD should be a pleasant surprise for you. This effort belongs right up there with some of their best stuff like Joshua Tree(ok, ok, maybe I'm stretching here since very few rock albums ever released can rival JT), Achtung Baby or Unforgettable Fire. As for another reviewer saying \\"nothing made my feet tap\\", huh!!? If one wants to tap their feet, stick to the endless vacuous material one finds on the FM dial these days. Admittedly, this disc does not put one in an awestruck state with one or two listens. My initial reaction was, \\"Pretty good stuff, it's nice to see the boys have left, if only temporarily, their Zooropa/Pop mindset behind.\\" Yet after repeated listenings, I came to the conclusion that ATYCLB is much more than \\"pretty good stuff\\", it is indeed great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen again","review":"If you didn't like this CD on the first listen, listen again. And again. It's one of those rare finds that gets better and better with repeated plays. As the lone U2 fan in our family, I started playing it in the kitchen while cooking supper. Then my husband starting playing it at breakfast. Then our 14-year-old son asked if he could borrow it. Track 3, Elevation, is our favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2: Beautiful Music for a beautiful day","review":"This is a solid and strong U2 album. The well known U2 songs and known as hit songs of U2, some of many actually, are here on this album. These are some of my U2 favourite songs that I don't mind listening to over and over. These songs are also favourites of many U2 fans out there and the CD singles have sold out like hot potatoes. 'Beautiful Day' and 'Stuck In A Moment' are the two opening songs and U2 standout songs. Bono has such a terrific voice like many vocalists do who hail out of the United Kingdom. 'Elevation' and 'Walkon' are excellent high pitched songs that encompass the wide range of skill and talent that this band displays after garnishing years of experience. After these songs the rest of the tracks are more of a slower pace and show listeners that U2 can mix it in many genres be it rock or pop. Excellent CD for any U2 fan to add to his or her collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant Piece of work!","review":"When I listened to \\"Beautiful Day\\", I thought, what'll they think of next? When I saw Elevation, Stuck In A Moment, and Walk On get in, the album was a must-have! It still is today!Enjoy the album because it is brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 with another masterpiece","review":"U2 have returned to center stage with this uplifing masterpiece. Just like the other masterpieces they have graced the music world with (Achtung Baby, War, Joshua Tree)this album buries itself in your soul and doesn't let go. With the hard rocking track Elevation, the soul stirring anthems Walk On and When I Look at the World U2 has accomplished exactly what they set out to do, create an album that cannot you can't live without. There is not a weak track on the album and this proves that they truly are the men they set out to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely overrated !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"this record had been highly successful and has sold over 13 million copies worldwide, and it sold 4,2 million copies in the us alone and has become a critics favourite.there are a lot of people who claim that it belongs to the 3 best u2 albums ever alongside THE JOSHUA TREE and ACHTUNG BABYbut im completely disappointed. I bought the cd and thought that all songs may be like the Radio Hit BEAUTIFUL DAY; but this was a big mistakeonly ELEVATION and WALK ON are songs which are ok, but nothing specialthis is one of those records of which you will remember only 1-2 songsi ask myself why it had been more successful than HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB(2004) which had at least 5 good songs"},{"rating":"1","title":"This one should have been called \\"POP\\"","review":"I guess U2 can get away with throwing together and sewing up songs like \\"Walk On.\\" But to me U2 always meant energy, not song after song of boring pop. Their last CD had a few problems, but also real guts in places. In the last part of POP, the creativity and energy died, and it carries to this CD (though Beautiful Day is nice enough). At least try to listen through the CD before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing spectacular....","review":"When I read the back of this book, I thought it sounded really good and couldn't wait to read it. Alas, the author couldn't quite make the story come to life for me. The hero and heroine was one dimensional and had boring personalities, (more so the heroine than the hero.) I love to read romance in which you can see the reason why the hero and heroine fell in love with each other, but I seriously wondered what Brahm saw in Eleanor. She was such a push over and there was nothing extraordinary about her. It seems that authors believe that if the heroine acts like a mother to all her siblings and does charity work for the poor, it automatically makes her irresistible. I want to read about a heroine that has a real life personaliy with flaws and all, but there was no such heroine in this book. The heroine's jealous sister is the one that kept the book somewhat entertaining, but I lost interest quickly since I didn't really care for the hero or heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care too much for this one","review":"I won't rehash the plot as the other reviewers did an excellent job on that count. I will say that just because he was drunk doesn't excuse his actions! Yet he makes it sound like they should be excused just because he was drunk. At one point he even says that a drunk really can't perform. Um . . . didn't seem to have a problem with Lydia though did he?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwound heroine","review":"I was eager to read this story, simply from the premise.Too bad it did not fulfull it's promise.Brahm Ryland, Lord Creed is taking his chance to win back the woman he loves, Eleanor Durbane. Years ago, their love was smashed by his drunken betrayal of her with her own sister, Lydia.It all flows quite well, Brahm arrives, is thoroughly castigated by Eleanor, her sisters etc. He takes it on the chin, he trys to win her trust, tells her his side of the sorry tale. Eventually she seems to forgive...Seems, alas. Because Eleanor then proceeds to torture both us and Brahm by changing her mind so often and confusingly, that she is like the old Jimmy Durante song and doesn't know whether she's coming or going.Ruined the book and sank it to the level of over emotive, turgid melodrama. It had me muttering to Brahm that he was well rid of her and to escape her clutches while he had the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprisingly good band","review":"Being a fan of Dream Theater and Fates Warning, I decided from the previous reviews to give these guys a shot. I must admit to being a tad skeptical, but from the opening song was impressed. Very tight musically, Evergrey takes the stage and grabs your attention, and never lets go. I found \\"When the walls fall down\\" a brilliant mix of metal, classical, even a tab bit of blues... and the overlay of the preacher confessing to his flock gave me goosebumps as I listened to the song.Don't care about behind the scenes stuff, I want good music, good lyrics and a singer that knows how to sing.Thankfully, Evergrey delivers excellent music, cool lyrics and the lead singer is one of the best I've heard in a long time.I felt myself thinking as I watched this, that if Metallica and Dream Theater could conceive a child, Everygrey would be that offspring.Excellent DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This is a must have for fans of hard rock/metal/prog of any kind!

I found this and got it instead, crossing my fingers. It is a total hit with him, his brothers ages 6 and 9 and their friends. We love to launch it and try to catch the rockets on the fly or on a bounce. I can personally shoot it so high that you almost can't see the rocket! My 4 year old can totally set it up himself and shoots it 1 1/2 times the height of our two-story house.

They take turns lanching the rockets and then fetching them. It is very sturdy and had lasted many many launches.

My brother and I have taken it to several parties and the kids loved it. Kids just love to jump off high places like stairs or a bench and watch the rockets go whizzing up into the air. The rockets go at least 35 feet in the air. It is perfect for using in your backyard or in an open space like a field. (If you are using it on grass or dirt you need to put something hard behind the air bag to back it up.) You can carry it almost anywhere.

My parents bought this for my and my older brothers to get us interested in music, well it worked for me the first time I heard this wonderful album.

Beautifully written and acted, it seems to me to be the result of a team who loved and respected Dr. Julian for his contribution to healthcare and for his dedication to humanity.

I have benefitted from Dr. Julian's contribution to my well-being through cortizone which singularly allows me to live a productive life. I'm sure my home is more beautiful as a result of his work with paints. The story of racism in America is tragic. I watch this program over and over.

The buyer should be warned, however: although the book created a publishing sensation when it appeared in 1927, finding enthusiastic admirers ranging from the ranks of the University to the inmates of His Majesty's prisons, the steady decline of educational standards may render the book difficult for the general reader of today, and even the best-prepared could spend a lifetime exploring the many levels of meaning and allusion in Miss Waddell's pioneering work of genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"This woman is terrific !!!!","review":"This album is a MUST for any fan of female vocal, jazz, and/or R&B music.

We're not talking about the already absurd super pursuit mode from the original series here--he TRANSFORMS into a TRUCK. That, and the fact that the writers basically discarded the point of the original series (\\"One man can make a difference\\") by having about 3x the supporting cast that is necessary, really ruined the show for me. After the mid-season reboot, the show did improve a bit, and I had hopes for a much-superior season 2, but it was too little too late.Save your money.

The episodes I've seen so far (1 and 2), I will admit are along the same level of production skill as the original show in the 80s, but I don't understand what they did with KITT. They went from a nanotech-laced skin than can change a certain degree of the shape and color of the exterior of the car to a full-fledged transformer that can convert from a Mustang to a full-sized 4x4 King cab pickup. I know they won't change that back to the set-up they had in the premiere, but I do hope they try to come back into the realm of scientific plausibility or I'm afraid the show will fall flat before it can get out of the garage."},{"rating":"2","title":"how far we have come with technology","review":"It seemed that only yesterday that we were introduced to vcrs,apple computers,atari and nintendo home video game systems and other items that we had in the 1980s.

My wife (Who has similar tolerances to TV that I do) and I agreed a few minutes into the episode that we couldn't bear to watch it anymore.The production quality appears to have dropped from the pilot. Parts of the premier appear to have been filmed backstage (Literally, at one point they walk by a door that has Star Trek font lettering on it).

The instructions are clear and easy to follow. Does not damage the paint surface at all.

For some reason I have collected a large assortment of small dents in a short period of time. So after seeing a commercial for a similar product on TV, I went to trusty Amazon and decided to look at reviews for products like this. I really didn't think it was going to work and bought one just to try. Well, it took several months before I got around to using it since I fully expected it to be a waste of time, and to my amazement it works! It is fast and easy. I tried it on the first dent and when I peeled away the adhesive, there was no longer a dent. So I went to the second dent..same results. Same for the third, forth and fifth. Only one dent can still be noticed when the light is right, but I don't think I would notice it if I didn't know where to look.

So, I thought I would try to work my way from the outer portion of the dent to the middle. After about 2 hours and around 40 trial and error pulls, that spot looks great. It does work, just be prepared to put in some time and have a TON of patience on your side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I had a dent right above my left rear fender well, and I figured I would give this thing a shot. The first pull took out alot of the dent I was really surpised. So I tried more pulls switching between the small and large dent pullers and I got most of the dent out. Although you can still tell there was a dent there it's not nearly as noticible as before. It all really depends on the dent you have, I could see this product working really well for some people or not at all for others.

Entering adulthood without a scrap of self esteem, and having the mental maturity and naivete of a child, it is no wonder why all his hopes and dreams were destroyed in the Legion. While suffering from acute chronic alcoholism and clinical depression, if the author had never joined the Legion, we may well be reading a bitter expose he has written about his failed attempt at college, a marriage, or any other various activities which require a commitment and effort.The reader must keep these facts in mind when reading this book, and due to author's emotional problems, must also take the facts as presented with extreme suspicion, as people bitter and disgruntled by an experience will tend to exaggerate circumstances to further their message that they really were not a failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why?","review":"The one question that keep's running through my mind is, Why did this guy join the Legion? Reading \\"Mouthful of Rocks\\" is like looking into the mind of a little boy who, while playing \\"soldier\\", gets upset and decides to take his toys and go home. I enjoyed reading the book, but not for the reason's I had hoped to. The book has little to do with life in the Legion, but has everything to do with Mr. Jennings seeming life long quest to blame everyone and everything around him for the decisions he makes. From page one, he seem's to want us to know that he is irresponsibile, childish, and a drunk. It is no secret that life in the Legion is hard, but Mr. Jennings goes out of his way to make it even harder. Constant disregard of orders, joining a clique of racist's, and avid drinking all point to the only ending this book could have; the little boy running away. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone with an intrest in the Legion, but any intrested in a childish mind would find it a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad Case","review":"I was interested to read that \\"The Viet Cong\\" beat the American Army so we got out of Vietnam. I further found out from this loser that the reason the Legion was beat in Vietnam was because of the French civilians. Mr Jennings, the French military is a joke which is why they have a Foreign Legion. I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that the American Army has NEVER been beaten in the field by anyone. Including Vietnam. If you are interested in the Legion this is not the book for you. Mr Jennings has never seen combat. He in fact is a whining misfit who ran from his commitment, and has been rejected by his own country's military. There are plenty of good books out there about The Foreign Legion. This is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY GLORIFY DRUNKEN THUGS","review":"As a former USMC Recon leader, I was told about this book several years ago and just read it. I understand that it is not a recruiters guide to joining the legion but how can anyone take this organization seriously? The Marines and SEALS used unpleasant discipline as needed but we did not experience any deserters that I recall. If this behavior and treatment are accurate, they must have the lowest readiness, training, and morale percentages of any third world thug squad. I was disappointed with the book and its depiction of the legion. I expected to leave with a more positive perception of them. At least with the amount of drukenness, lack of deployability, and horrible small unit leadership; the legion cannot be taken even remotely seriously as a military force. This fortunately leaves the business of warfare and the gravity of its outcome to capable professional such as the American servicemen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"I went through basic with Chris Jennings in ORANGE with the 1er REC ,his tale is full of inaccuracies about the people he did basic training with (he even uses their real names for some odd reason and others did not even exist) , people he said deserted during basic did not , his own achievements are highly over exaggerated and so on ,although his account of treatment of recruits was fairly accurate , basic was done in Orange which was very unusual and I think the 1er Rec were determined to turn the recruits out better than Castel...at any cost, I doubt Jennings could ever visit France or Legion reunions without repercussions. .....save your money ,\\"Marching With The Devil\\" by David Mason is more accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jennings was a lousy soldier!","review":"While the book is relatively well written, it is obvious to anyone who has ever served in ANY modern military organization that Christian Jennings would have failed (and did) in any military endeavor made. He failed in the Brit Paras (no surprise) and failed in the Legion (even less surprise). Having served two years in the USMC and another 23 years in the US Army, I can honestly say that Jennings behavior would have gotten him thrown out of the USMC and the US Army. This admitted deserter deserves little credence, his opinions colored by his own failures."},{"rating":"1","title":"A view to publishing....","review":"This is not a good book. Having spent half my life in the army I can't understand why Jennings got so far into the Legion. It's like he was thinking about writing it all the while instead of getting on with his life and work there. He's almost too articulate for his own sanity.I also had the feeling there is a second voice in the writing, either an editor, or ghost writer, who is leaving things out. One thing I found disturbing, there's a thread of homosexuality running through this book. It's as if Jennings wants to be the man he longs to be, a sort of super-heterosexual-action-man, and hopes it will rub off on him by joining the French Foreign Legion where there must be the type of man he longs to be. When Jennings discovers this is not the way to manhood he deserts."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Author with no self esteem","review":"After reading \\"A mouthful of Rocks\\", one would have to wonder if the author succeeded at anything he tried in life, of even cared to finish any commitment.

It is not something I feel I will want to see again in the next twenty years or so. There is only so many times I can hear about how \\"Chet\\" made Elvis what he was.

I've now had this service for 12 for over 3 years and it still looks great. It complements my fine Wedgwood china as well as my everyday. The Continental sizing is a plus, and the weight and feel of the pieces are excellent.I haven't experienced any of the pitting or rust problems others have, perhaps it has something to do with water quality or detergent?"},{"rating":"2","title":"exceeded my expectations!","review":"This flatware set resembles that used by fine hotels and restaurants. The pieces have a beautiful shine and fit nicely in the hand (slightly larger, continental size). The pattern is very versatile, can dress up or down.

Needing to replace the flatware at my permanent home, I ordered flatware with similar criteria from the same manufacturer, since the previous set was unavailable. I was extremely disapointed in the quality... the \\"hand\\" was poor, the balance even poorer and the workmanship was non-existent...the set looked to have been stamped and was not even centered on the utensil. I'm sure I could have found similar quality and at much lower price at a big box store. To top it off, I paid for shipping to my home and paid almost $20 to get the product returned to Barrons. Two lessons learned...pay attention to the ratings and always order directly from Amazon...Barrons customer service is an oxymoron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Stainless","review":"I've had this set for about two years now. At first I was thrilled with the selection of utensils in it and felt that it was a great value. However, after a few months I began to notice that all of the forks were rusting between the tines, which makes them look like they are dirty and have caked-on food between the tines. This kind of poor quality stainless is typical, in my experience, of stainless products that are manufactured in China. Chinese flatware was exactly what I was trying to avoid but unfortunately that's exactly what I got when I purchased this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light weight.","review":"I expected this set to pretty much match the set I purchased several years ago from Williams Sonoma - same make, pattern and both state they are 18/10.

After reading a few chapters of the book deep conviction fell upon me to stop reading this book. I wrestled with this conviction for some time and question if i was just being silly or was it the Holy Spirit. After some time i eventually stopped reading the book and the conviction ended. There is hardly any scripture in this book and alot of his 'doctrine' is based upon experience. I never finished this book due to the conviction of reading it. I do not suggest this book to anyone to answer the questions of biblical anthropology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think Over Again","review":"Watchman Nee is one a great cloud of witnesses in China, and I respect him much. However, some of his teachings may not be close as what Bible says. Especially in his concept of Spirit, Soul & Body, it will easily make us to live in the world separately, and we somehow may be proud of using our own effort to please God, just like the Pharisees. 1 Thes. 5:23 not necessarily means we should be separated by three parts. I didn't see the other parts of Bible has that kind of teaching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good combination!","review":"This series is terrific for the Christian who wants to break out of the religious rut and a must for those who want to help them.

Great price and great service from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I started this book one year and finished it the next. It's not difficult to read, but it is extremely deep and one is left wanting to think about the ideas being presented. The author initially published this book in 1928. He presents the idea that God is tripartite and since God made man in His image, we too are tripartite - the body, the soul and the spirit. Mr. Nee builds an excellent case for this and backs it up with Scripture. He then goes on to explain how one should live a Spirit controlled life as opposed to a soul controlled life (the soul being the mind and emotions etc...). Very thought provoking. Disclosure: I read volume I alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm And Tender Part 2","review":"If you liked Charlie's 1993 release \\"Warm and Tender\\" you will enjoy this one as well.Gershwin,Cahn,Cole Porter just to name a few of the song writers in this 14 track collection.

Linus is there, dispensing bits of understated romantic wisdom, with blanket in tow. There are some classic football scenes (with coach Peppermint Patty amusingly evading her players' question upon viewing her game plan: \\"So, are we the Xs or the Os?\\"). And Charlie Brown's google-eyed panic attacks and his climactic, slo-mo walk down the aisle toward his first kiss always throw our kids into fits of laughter. A worthy addition to any Peanuts library."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I only had the money!","review":"This book was interesting to see how rich people pretend to be poor. It's obvious the author doesn't know what it's really like to start out from school with nothing. My guess is she never ate macaroni and cheese 7 nights a week and wished she could afford peanut butter. She probably ate sirloin and wished it was porterhouse!That's how this book made me feel. It assumes you have money and alot of choices. It doesn't help with the (limited) choices if you don't have a trust fund."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Groovy Guide that doesn't lecture like your parents!","review":"I thought this was a wonderful little book that was really helpful. No one book can tell you everything you need to know about \\"real\\" life. Meyer does highlight all of the major things that one forgets when they are panicking to find an apartment, friendless, almost broke and tired of eating only pasta. It was great for helping me organize my own thoughts rather than relying only on some author's. As for qualifications Meyer has been there and done that! Experience is the best qualification!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My daughter got this book as a graduation gift. She's still not talking to the relative who gave it to her. The title is misleading, beacuse there really isn't any information on how a young person can stand on his/her own two feet. The least of my daughter's worries is how to decorate her apartment. She needed more substantial advice on entering and surviving in the workplace, balancing a budget, setting priorities on expenses. This book offers none of that and was very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this Book!","review":"As a guide, this book is useless. I was looking for sincere help on getting started after college. Instead, I got glib remarks that did not aid me at all. The author is pretty self-congratulatory on her success in life. But clearly, she was given more of a financial boost than the rest of us. The book has no substance and isn't worth the paper it's printed on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A light, funny read","review":"Meyer's book is funny and well-written. Sprinkled throughout with tales from the author's own experiences, it is a fast and easy read. This book is best for the grad who has never lived on his or her own before, and probably too basic for those who had their own apartments, jobs and roommates while in college. While not a comprehensive guide, it does give good ideas on where to start. Don't depend on it to tell you everything, but count on it to give you a push in the right direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Real Life?","review":"I didn't make it through the third chapter of this book. I was too annoyed! After my own struggles and mistakes to arrange transportation--bad used cars, unreliable car pools, overpaying for a new car--it was frustrating to see the advice to new adults today is \\"Have someone give you a car.\\"Reminding people to read the lease is fine, but how do you find the right apartment? What defines the right apartment?This book is worse than useless. It gives incomplete and incorrect information. Better advice can be found in a random chat room!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!","review":"I bought this book for my grandson's graduation and was disappointed. This is not a proper guide for the graduate. Instead it rambles on with cliches in lieu of any practical advice. This book is not researched. Rather, it is one person's very skewed experiences after college."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This Book for Real?","review":"This book is a fluffy stream of consciousness of unresearched rubbish. Near as I can figure, the author has no credentials on which to craft a self-help book. No single topic is given any depth. Inaccuracies abound. The entire \\"manual\\" seems based on her own limited and sheltered experience.As examples, advice on getting a car includes asking a relative for the gift of one! And darn if her first car wasn't a gift from grandma. Words are spent in helping the young graduate decide between buying or renting. Unless the grad is starting out with a healthy trust fund, buying is usually not an option to consider. To meet new friends, apparently the author feels you should talk to any stranger anywhere and develop a friendship. Mercifully, she follows up such odd advice with safe sex tips.It is an absolute mystery that this book got published in the first place. It will be more mysterious that anyone should proceed to buy it. It's too late for me. Save yourselves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone else's shoulders and how to sit on them","review":"I picked up this book as a graduation gift for a friend's son. The title seemed cute and appropriate and skimming through it in the bookshop, it did seem to cover a lot of the things a grad would find useful. My friend's son thought differently. He thought that it was a joke, and particularly useful for those people who do not need to worry about where their next meal or rent is going to come from. After reading it thoroughly myself I find myself in total agreement. It is educational to see how the well heeled view the world but I am afraid that for the most part most of us have a somewhat different view.

But USELESS!","review":"I bought a HS-850 with great expectations after seeing the Cingular rep demo the unit. The swing out boom works great (with my Nokia 6682). Boots up and establishes connection very fast once you swing out the boom. Very comfortable on the ear if you don't mind a bit of \\"flop\\" (it never FALLS OFF even though you think it will..). Very lightweight so you don't even notice it is there. NOW, as far as usefulness, it rates a ZERO. Even with maximum volume on the phone and on the headset, the volume is TOO LOW! This is a universal problem as it is posted EVERYWHERE on the web.. I only wished I had READ before I BOUGHT. My mistake! Only useful if you are in a quiet room with no background noise. Forget about using this headset outdoors (with or without wind noise) or in a car. Gets a FIVE STAR rating for looks and style, hands down.. ONE STAR for actual usefulness as the volume problem is very real."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't hear anything","review":"I bought this because I had just bought a Motorola RAZR phone and had trouble hearing the phone. I had intended to buy a Jabra headset, but when my wife was shopping at cartoys, the people there said that a motorola product would work so well with the phone, since it's motorola. In a quiet room, the headset is fine. The instant that there is any background noise, such as a bus, walking down the street, etc., the headset is useless because you can't hear anything. I tried to take the headset back to cartoys, but they wouldn't accept the return without the manual.Summary:1) Don't buy motorola. The headsets are useless and the phones are too quiet. If you want an expensive toy that doesn't work well as a phone, the RAZR is the one for you.2) don't buy wireless plans or products from cartoys. Even though Cingular gave us 30 days to try the phone out, cartoys only gives 14 days, so we weren't able to cancel and switch back to Verizon without having to pay cartoys $300 per phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! It's not that good...........","review":"This case is a disappointment. The little leather bars which are supposed to prevent the case making contact with the controls fails to do so if you try and use this as even a minimal credit card case.The old equivalent case for my m500 easily took half a dozen credit cards, driving licence, a book of stamps and a few business cards with no problem. With this, more than a couple of cards and the thing switches itself on and runs the batteries down.So it'll do the job but only if it's the Palm only. Beyond that, forget it. For the first time, I wish I'd gone for the metal case.(The Tungsten itself, by the way, is superb!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely adequate","review":"When I bought this case shortly after the TT came out, there weren't a lot of choices. I settled on this case because I don't like metal, but now wish I'd bought the metal case. My TT is a very important tool for me in my work as an ER nurse, and it is aggravating to pull it out to access ePocrates and get a blank screen because it accidentally got turned on in my pocket and drained the battery. Even tho I have it set to turn itself off after a minute, it must get turned on frequently as I standup, sit down, and move about the department. At least once a week this happens, where I'll go to work with a full battery, and try to turn it on to find it drained.The case is nice looking, and fine if you carry your TT in a briefcase or a large purse or backpack. If you have to carry it in a pocket, as I do, you will not be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok but flawed","review":"I agree with some of the comments about the unit switching itself on when the case is closed. This is simply ridiculous. If the case is in a bag and something presses on it, the date book or address book button will switch the palm on and there goes your battery without you noticing it. It's happened twice in the last month and it happens even if you don't have anything in the credit card sleeves on the left hand side cover. I used to have a case for my 500 that closed all the way with a zipper (better protection) and never ran into that problem. Otherwise this case is ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, elegant, but...","review":"Nice case. The TT is held in place by clamps on both sides, similar to the plastic hard cover that comes standars. Holds the PDA firmly in place. It's sleek and elegant, not bulky at all. One big problem though, when the case is closed you can't access the voice recorder button nor the headphone jack, which makes the PDS useless for MP3 playback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the first two chapters","review":"After the first two chapters of An Essay on The Principle of Population, Malthus rambles on and then ties it up at the end.

If that makes sense.I use the Art of Strength dvd when I want a good kettlebell workout. However, I think when you're pregnant it might be better to use an easier dvd. I can understand that throwing around a heavy cast iron bell while pregnant isn't so safe. She has you do a lot of stationary bell lifting. For example doing a squat while holding the bell. You can use a regular weight just as well with this dvd. It's a good way to stay in shape, but don't expect to use a kettlebell to it's full capacity in this dvd. She only does a couple of trademark kettlebell moves. I think this is safe when you're pregnant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good challenging prenatal workout","review":"This was the my main workout during my recent pregnancy. Most everything else I tried held no challenge. Other reviewers have summed it up well. If I had to say I anything negative about this, it would be that it seems rather low budget for the price. Didn't LOVE the music. And Lauren, while in FANTASTIC shape, doesn't seem thrilled to be there. I can't remember if she smiles even once! None of these were a deal breaker for me. Lauren's credentials are excellent.

Also got a two inch pad. Between the two the 3 inch is better if you are a bigger adult. I have a 4 inch pad I bought a few years ago which I like better as it is a higher rated memroy foam. At 5.5 you can tell this is memory foam, but it isn't quite up to the higher rated pad. For the price though it will revive an old or cheap matress and make it liveable. These various memory foam (vs just foam) have helped my back a lot and I would recommend these types of products. Thicker (3\\"-4\\") and higher density foam is better.

I never expected it!","review":"Down a Dark Hall is one of the best books by Lois Duncan. I think it's tied with A Gift of magic. Down a Dark Hall is pretty scary until you know what's going on. It's about a teenage girl who goes to a school, suposidly to learn, but through the book they find out otherwise!You have to read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"When I bought this book I expected it to be really great like Stranger With My Face or even half decent like Locked in Time, but this book was so unlike Lois Duncans other books. The ending (which to me is what leaves the lasting impression) was VERY abrupt and when you put the book down you have so many questions like, \\"Did Lynda really escape the burning building?\\" or \\"Will Kit ever close to portal to the haunting ghosts?\\" I couldn't stand it the way it never really ended and I couldn't beleive at first that it actually had. Overall, the book was pretty spooky, no romance at all, and was a page turner, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. I do suggest that you read this, though, if you are a Lois fan and have read the rest of her books, but otherwise I wouldn't take my time to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This book was good because it goes to another level of reading.

The book was \\" updated\\" by Lois Duncan to make it appeal to today's teens. Once I had that down, the book was a good read. The one fault that remained was in the discussion of ESP and ghosts. Today these things are treated as facts on tv so much I think that the girls would be suspicious earlier on. a good book for kids who are past the Goosebumps phase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly Dark","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I started reading this book, but it did not take long for me to become totally involved with the characters and the mysterious events within the story. Ms. Duncan has created a book that will appeal to readers who can't resist a hauntingly dark, spooky adventure...which is most of us. Down a Dark Hall churns with chilling suspense and the anticipation of evil lurking around every corner. Once I started reading, I found it to be a quick, exciting read.(Thank you to Hackette book group for my review copy.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Lois Duncan book","review":"Down a Dark Hall is my favorite Lois Duncan book. Even from the first, the book drew me into the intricate plot. From start to finish, you could have never guessed the ending. It's a story about this girl, Kit, who attended this exclusive school, Blackwood. She's only one of the four \\"special\\" students. Along the way, Kit learns about the dangerously eery history about Blackwood, solving mysteries after mysteries and unlocking hidden secrets that could have cost her life and the other students if they had stayed hidden. Down a Dark Hall is truly a gem and I recommend it to anyone who loves a good suspenseful mystery. I couldn't put the book down until I had finished. The ending left me breathless."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will keep you guessing!","review":"Mrs. Wagener's juniors and seniors said-- This was a good book. It was about 4 girls who go to a boring school and they have ESP, but they do not know about it until later on. The story was short and scary. The best part of the story was the last three chapters. We did not like the book at first (because it was sort of slow-paced), but we really got into it as the story went on. We thought the book was really mystifying. To find out more about it you should buy the book. We're telling you--it's a good book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book kept us on the edge of our seats!","review":"Mrs. Wagener's period 3 said: This book was both awesome and freaky! It was a great book because you didn't know what was going to happen next.We think that Lois Duncan's Down a Dark Hall was a terrific mystery story -- it was action packed with a long list of great characters in the story. Lois Duncan did a fabulous job writing this novel because we could actually imagine what was happening as it was happening. It was a hell of a scare!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book ever","review":"i just got this book a week ago, and it was one of the best books i ever read. It was so scary, yet interesting. All of her books are unpredictable. If you like mysteries, you'll love Down A Dark Hall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"The beginning was a tad bit sluggish, but once it found it's pace, this book was one I couldn't put down. It was interesting how Lois Duncan makes you create your own conclusion in this book, by not completely clarifying what happens. But I'm not giving away any of the story-this is a complex and incredibly multi-layered book so be prepared with a blanket and a rainy day to read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book looked very interesting so I chose to read it for an 8th grade assignment. The book was very thrilling until about the middle of the book, when the conclusion suddenly became evident. The rest of the book was very boring for the most part, because you already knew what was going to happen. I can say that this was one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I disliked \\"Down A Dark Hall\\" because Lois Duncan's books from the 1970s were much better. I don't know if Duncan was trying to modernize her writing style, but it sure as hell didn't work. \\"Down A Dark Hall\\" was too easy to read and like too many other books I've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT READ THIS BOOK","review":"This book was ok. but i expected more from lois Duncan. I would read her other books, but not this one. the only reason i had to start and finish this book is because it was for school. We had to get into groups and read one of the lois duncan books. And i was stuck with this one. theres not enough exciting events and things happening in this book. Don't waste your time people. PLEASE DON'T. READ SOMETHING BETTER, like ( I know what you did last summer). You'll be more satisfied with that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild Wild Racing is bloody ace!!!","review":"After seeing the generally average reviews of this game at release, I didn't expect much from it & avoided it.

This is about the only place where this game succeeds, so I gave it one star. The rest of the game sadly falls short. The reaction time is slooooooow. For a racing game that's pretty important. The backgrounds are generic afterthoughts. The tracks are simple with very few variations. One of the few games I have bought and within minutes felt ripped off. I'd stay away from this one for it makes very little use of the power that the Playstation2 offers.I hope this review helps to save someone [money]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wild Wild Racing","review":"This game got a 2 star rating because of its graphics, the rest got a zero. The game was not fun but annoying and agrivating. To begin, the controls were horrible when you start. After a while you get used to the controls but never start to like them.Also, hopefully you wont get hit by another car because your car will spin around and off course causing you to come in 4th place. Also, hopefully you wont flip over because when you will automatically get put in 4th place even if you were in 1st. Dont try to hit other cars to knock them off course because it wont work, you will just get messed up driving and lose. Theses are just a few problems with this game.

It was Sluggish and hard to get the vehicle to turn left and right. If you like racing games I suggest you rent or buy something else.

My daddy bought me this game and I really feel sorry for him for spending that much money. Once you play it, you don't want to play it again, what a dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"... Racing","review":"This game, to me, was horribly made. It had no \\"new\\" aspect or quality that hasn't been done many times before, no part of this game sets itself apart from any other racing game from the Super Nintendo or Sega Genesis. Their are NO physics in this game, now I think that physics are a crucial part of any racing game, as we are in the 21st century and it's not very hard to see that to make a game real, you need realistic physics! Their's no drifting, sliding, \\"realistic\\" jumps or even realistic turning, everything depends on your 3 stats, which means that the creators we're just very lazy people, or they don't know we have a little known word, called \\"gravity\\". The levels are very plain, nothing stands out, your just racing around within the borders of a type of fence or barrier, so theirs no exploring. What you should do, is just play it smart and wait for Gran Turismo 3 to come out, and get the best of the racing genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"The graphics are ok, the controls are easy, but the overall the game suffers. You only get a few courses, and those are extremely long, uncreative and boring. You get little choice on cars as well, and they lack excitement as well.

However, for those who do know the music well, listening to the CD is quite interesting.I do like the Quattuor Mosaiques, I also like the Lindsay's, I can forgive them their \\"imperfect ensemble\\" - as one can more technically call their playing - for their attitude to the music.

Never in my life have I seen a horror movie this bad. Not even the worst Friday the 13th could hold a flame to this movie. What's funny about this movie is that the acting and direction is decent, but the plot is not developed very well. The thin storyline that is in the movie features 4 grad students who are being haunted by something that terrorized them as youngsters. I felt soooo bad for making my friends see this with me. A large majority of the people in my theatre were sighing and yawning. I kept wondering, \\"when's it gonna get good?\\" The scares are cheap and scarce as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"H.P.

What a disappointment that was for me to know that I just wasted my money on this movie. The suspense was pretty good I give it that but the ending not one of my favorites.

But when I saw that the movie, made by Wes, was only PG-13, it made me wonder what kind of movie this really was. The story based around Julia Lund (Laura Regan) who, after witnessing a horrific and traumatic event, gradually comes to the realization that everything which scared her as a child could be real. And what's worse, it might be coming back to get her. This isn't a new idea or story and that's why I was fairly disappointed with this film.

The only thing good about THEY is the alternate ending but by then you're so bored it doesn't even save it. Remember movies like: THE THING, ALIEN, NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET? Those were good scary movies. Don't waste your time or your money on this one.

Great atmosphere and some decent tension elevate this spooker about THEY. However, they (the filmmakers) never really clue the viewer into who THEY (THEY) really are; except in the psuedo-clever alt. ending. Too bad really, with its decent prodution values this flick could've been a lot cooler with some script tweaking and sturdier direction. A standard issue shocker that ends up going nowhere special, THEY (the movie) is merely okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"They\\" Smell","review":"The most excruciating thirty minutes of my life.

Throughout this entire movie i was trying to figure out what it was. I thought it was something between a huge killer spider and/or a jagwar.I give \\"They\\" 2 stars; one for how scary it was, and another because i didn't mind watching it [BUT I DEFINITELY DO NOT WANNA WATCH IT AGAIN!!!]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"The opening scene of this movie is all you need to see, it's too long and by the time SOMETHING (not sure what, but something I guess), happens, you don't even care.

This is the worst horror movie I have seen in my entire life. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the mark","review":"Despite sounding and even looking like a high quality supernatural thriller, this movie really never kicks in. The storyline is based around some unknown entities that hide in the dark, kidnapping victims while disturbing electrical fields and children. This is as much as I understood after the movie was over. The scene with the disturbed child describing their tormentors as \\"THEY\\" would not be unfamiliar to anyone who has ever seen the atomic age mutant ant classic \\"THEM\\". As the movie wore on, I kept waiting for some big secret or key fact to throw everything into focus and make it all make sense but this moment never came. The DVD I saw had an alternate ending that seemed to have a completely different spin than the one in the actual feature, and this raises my suspicions that the makers of this movie were none to sure what the story was supposed to be about. Overall I'm afraid to say that I found this movie was a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE EXPLAIN!","review":"If you know that there are creatures out there that lurk in the dark and want to kill you, why not just take up residence in the lighting department at Lowe's? Honestly, I couldn't enjoy this movie because it seemed like the characters were neglecting the most basic self-protection. Me, I'd buy a generator, candles, battery-operated lanterns, etc.Other than that, the movie is OK. The alternate ending on the DVD would also have made this a better film."},{"rating":"1","title":"more doldrums from the master of the obtuse, Wes Craven","review":"I don't know what I was thinking when I got this movie.

Maybe one nightmare-and unintentionally so."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078","review":"THEY are part of one of the worst movies I have seen in years. I'm not even sure who THEY are! Usually Wes Craven doesn't put his name on something unless it's decent. This isn't even close to decent. This is the slowest, most boring horror film I've ever seen! \\"Hey remember that thing that scared us 19 years ago, when we were kids, well all of a sudden it's back, so ummm call your childhood psychologist.\\" Laura Regan is laughable, getting more upset by some crap on her finger than her friend blowing his head off in front of her, and it's just downhill from there.

Wes Craven used to be good. After the Scream trilogy, his movies have gone downhill. This movie is basically about night terrors. It wasn't suspenseful, wasn't scary, and had no real storyline to it. I waited for the entire movie to see maybe 30 seconds of something cool and horrorific happen at the very end. But even that wasn't scary. I collect horror films. This will never be in my collection.

Ah, help.No explanation as to why 'they\\" come to eat you, or what their purpose is, okay, maybe all they do is eat. Like Jaws. Why they didn't explain that? Yawn.

Yes, the set is traditionally opulent, even fussy, but I do not need spread legs (even seen from the rear), nor a pair of unattractive breasts bouncing about. However, since this is about singing, aside from the inadequate McLaughlin is an attractive Alfredo sung by Walter MacNeil with an equally attractive but unexciting voice and the same may be said for Brent Ellis' Germont. This is not a TERRIBLE performance, but one I'll never watch again except to demonstrate to someone how Traviata should not be done.

In all my years of listening to good and obscured music, this one gets to the point and it flows through any era gradually, especially now. Like most who have heard these songs 'Two Hangmen' gives a kick and yelp to those who haven't had enough from The Byrds or even sitting and getting blazed with 'You Finally Found Your Love', so beautiful and yet brings tears to my eyes like losing a love one. All the songs here express the agony of establishment and maybe that could perhaps be the reason it didn't get much airplay. I like it, I own it and well worth the money for purchase. Let your mind expand and feel free with 'Wanted', you'll appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 Hangmen","review":"Many moons ago, some girlfriends and I got together.

Most self tanners make you very orange and leave streaks/lines. I would recommend if you purchase this (which you won't regret doing) make sure you rub it in around your ankles and wrists and make sure to wash your hands afterward. I have never experienced any streaks or lines anywhere but friends who have tried this have. It gives you a very natural looking tan and it smells amazing. Everywhere I go I get complimented on the smell, and it lasts for a while. After 1 use you will see a very significant \\"glow\\"/tan. I love this product, and continue to use it again and again!

However, just because she's departed from her country roots doesnt mean that the cd is bad! I think its an excellent attempt to crossover into the world of pop/rock. Whats more, I think she'll succeed with this album because her voice is still absolutely gorgeous. She doesnt sound electronic, like Britney or Christina. She's 100% pure talent, and this cd just shows what she can do.Personal Faves: Love Is An Army (I think this is the best song on the cd), You Made Me Find Myself, Sign of Life, Twisted AngelHorrible Song that Should Never, Ever be played, Ever: Tic Toc (who wants to hear an orgasmic Leann Rimes?!)Overall, this is another quality cd from a quality singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lycea","review":"I wasn't too impressed with this album.

LeAnn branched-out and it was an amazing effort. Too bad people didn't take notice. She has had HUGE cross-over hits, but evidently people weren't ready for a full album. Go get this, you will learn that LeAnn is an artist on top of being a wonderful vocalist!

I gave it 5 stars then. I now have to reduce that rating to 2 stars. I'm a little conflicted. I like all of the songs on this album except for the dreadful song \\"Twisted Angel.\\" All of the songs are great. The down side is they are not great enough for me to want to listen to them. I think I've listened to the album a total of 5 times. And most of those times I forced myself to listen to it. LeAnn is my 3rd all time favorite singer. You'd think I'd be listening to this album all day long. But I just can't get into any of these songs. They sound good. But they're just not for me.

On TWISTED ANGEL, Leann Rimes sings Pop(lotsa on the album), Rock(Suddenly) and even R&B(Troubles With Goodbye). Although shes not singin Country music anymore, it doesn't mean she can't produce anymore good song.My personal favourites on Twisted Angel includes DAMN, REVIEW MY KISSES, WOUND UP and also the first single off the album, LIFE GOES ON. This is an album that proved that Leann Rimes is the most successful crossover singer in Country, from Country to Blacks R&B. Don't believe me, buy the album and you'll believe me.Theres a couple of filter song on the album such as SUDDENLY cuz she can't sing rock, Twisted Angel cuz she can't sing the Blues...

Whomever it is...they are way behind on what people are wanting in music these days. It is certainly not this techno-pop laiden, britneyesque attempt at mainstream music.

The album has received very little media interest and has been slated but if u're a LeAnn Fan, this won;t bother u. Life Goes on is the first single to be taken from this album and wot a corker!! I luv the guitar feel t her music now. I've liked leann's music since Can't Fite the moonlite. Most of the songs have the guitar feel of Life Goes on, with my fave songs being Life Goes on, Suddenly, No Way Out and Wound Up. I am not too keen on Love is a Army or any of the more country styled songs cos it's not my style. Worst song is Tic Toc, it has no real puropse and has annoyed me since day 1. But LeAnn's voice overcomes this glitch and pulls off a great pop album. LeAnn Rimes now sits at the top of my cd rack along with Bellefire. Good stuff LeAnn and keep it up. Suddenly is rumoured to be the next single - good move"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan any longer","review":"Leann has a beautiful voice, but you would never know it from this CD.

I have always been a fan of her music (and that includes her pop hits) and this style just does not fit her. She tries too hard to imitate Britney Spears but Britney Spears sounds better. LeAnn has a beautiful voice but she just doesn't show it on this album. EVERY song on this album is either about her new love/sex life with her husband Dean or how strong she is now that Daddy is out of her way. Another thing, the pictures inside the cd booklet look like complete trash! I've never seen LeAnn this sleazy before. What was she thinking?! I would NOT buy this album and if I had a chance to do it over again I would have listened to it before I bought it. Sorry LeAnn, but I think you should get back to you roots and reconsider life with Daddy by your side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, excellent, excellent","review":"I believe this album is something of a sleeper. After I listened to the album the first time I thought it was pretty good. After listening to it again, I thought it was very good. The more I listened to it, the more I loved it. I think this album far exceeds Christina Aguilera's album \\"Stripped\\" and Faith Hill's album \\"Cry\\". Just about every song is truly fantastic!

The songs doesn't fit Leann's voice... and then there's this ballad \\"You Made Me Find Myself\\" written by Tina Arena. She totally blew this song off the limits, she was screaming and going off the notes! Tina should've not allowed this woman to record the song in the first place. Get Tina Arena's \\"Just Me\\" instead, there you'd really appreciate Tina's version of \\"You Made Me Find Myself\\".

I have medium length/medium weight hair which can go straight or wavy depending on what I do with it - but can definitely go frizzy in the summer! This conditioner keeps it beautifully soft and silky with no frizz but it does give it a little less body. However, given that, I actually feel that it makes my hair look and feel healthier. I then use other styling products such as gels or creams to give it wave, body, or hold. If it just leave it straight, this conditioner leaves it super silky smooth. I haven't had an issue with the fragrance and I've been using this product for years. I'm not a big fragrance or perfume person but it seems fine to me.

You won't hear any sound performed by ohtsuka, so kiai will not be noticeable. the rest of the video is quite interesting for mudansha people (he who doesn't hava a dan-degree). when you have reached a dan-degree and become yudansha, the rest of this video is not very much extra knowlegde. Be careful not to study only from video, form might have been changed and training much without an instructor will only serve a negative purpose. please consider ANY video as back-up material and not as a study guide.

The live take of \\"Masochism World\\" isn't really essential, but that overdriven tear through \\"Eight Miles High\\" is pure genius, and \\"Makes No Sense At All\\" b/w \\"Love Is All Around\\" is Husker Du at their most gloriously pop-influenced. This EP would be a great buy at $3.98 or $4.98, but charging the same price for this that you'd pay for FLIP YOUR WIG, NEW DAY RISING or ZAN ARCADE (the latter a double LP!) is nothing short of ridiculous. Inspiring music, but at this price it's poor value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky release!","review":"This EP combines the two non-LP singles Husker Du released during their career. Their cover of the Byrds' 8 Miles High is jaw-dropping, especially the way Bob Mould twists and transforms the orginal song's raga-ish 12-string guitiar into a hardcore frenzy. And this version of Makes No Sense At All, released as a single, is a different version from the one on Flip Your Wig, and sounds even better than that fantastic version. The b-sides are a live version of Masochism World (from Zen Arcade) and a cover of the Mary Tyler Moore theme, Love is All Around. This EP is tough to find and as such, can be a little pricey, but to complete your Husker Du collection, it's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best cover EVER","review":"Husker Du's \\"Eight Miles High\\" is the best cover ever, blowing away the original, adding layer upon layer to it, and turning it into the best drug song ever (yes, I know, the Byrds said it was about airplanes--they were full of it). As for the price that some reviewers have complained about: have you ever seen a CD single or EP that WASN'T a rip-off?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the most amazing vocal...","review":"The cover of Eight Miles High is a MUST for any Husker Du, Bob Mould or fan of rock that you didn't hear on the radio in the 80's. Mould's vocal is so strained with emotion that I'm not sure, even after listening to it for many years, whether it's conveying his pain or pleasure. It's simply amazing. Just thinking about overwhelms me with nostalgia for the mosh pits, goth chicks and the after hours club dancing of my mis-spent punk rock youth. I like the other songs too, but seriously, I hardly ever play them. When I need an electrifying jolt of pure emotion, I just slap this on my CD player and hit 'repeat 1'..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for the memories","review":"I have been a musician for most of my life, which unfortunately makes me overly critical of music videos as a rule. I enjoyed virtually every song on this DVD and would recommend it to anyone in a heart beat (no pun intended)! It seems that they could have planned their set a little more carefully to maximize the momentum of the performance but the quality of the music is simply fantastic. Your money could not be more well spent than to buy a copy of this. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Great Sounding Concert: Mixing and Playing Lack","review":"I, like many who purchased this DVD, am a long time fan of this talented duo. Seeing them live in the 80's solidified my appreciation for their music and ability to perform. Then, last year I attended a show in California (2nd row center) and was very disappointed. Hoping I caught them on a bad night, I picked-up this DVD. Unfortunately, it is no different.First, the performance. At best, a parody of themselves. Not far from tribute band quality. Then there's the music quality. The back-up musicians were forgettable and sounded as though they needed more practice to be cohesive and worthy of playing in front of paying audiences (see any Eagles DVD for the opposite). The mixing and audio quality itself is, as others have noted, amateur.If you want to remain a Heart fan - skip this and cling to their old recordings and your fond memories of a great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sounding DTS","review":"I own about 70 concert dvd's and this own is one of the best sounding. Maybe if you are listening to it in regular sterio it sounds bad. The mandolin in The battle of evermore is unbelievable.

To tell you the truth I wasn't that much of a Heart fan before watching this dvd. I am now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart still rockin ......well!","review":"Wow what a great show.....some of the reviews are quite puzzling though such a mix. This DVD is great for the existing heart fans, but why all the comparisons about two newer band members,Mike Inez, & Jerry Cantrell. After watching crossroads show on 12/28 these band members work as a team & yes after watching jerry Cantrells kick [...] shredding of Led Zeppelins rock n roll there's no doubt of his awesome talent. To say that it's beneath either of them or a sell out to work with these heart sisters is going a bit extreme though. They have been around for a very long time & have proved themselves enough ,there equally as talented , just from a little different era . As for the pmsers what's that ? Just take this DVD for what it's about a Group of very talented musicians giving us a show.

It was in perfect condition but I still doubt it was new as there was no paperwork at all inside it. I know dvd's can be re- wrapped so the fact that it was still sealed doesn't mean it's new.

Out of my entire collection I think this DVD has the lowest quality audio of Anne that I have ever heard. All you hear is a lot of echo. I can live with 5.0 surround but the echo is so bad that I just previewed the DVD and could not play it completely. Who ever mixed this soundtrack has no idea what he is doing. Anne's voice is Heart. I recommend you do not buy this DVD until it is re-mixed. What a shame that such a great group's first DVD has such poor sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one messed up HD-DVD","review":"I could not get this disc to work right on either of my HD-DVD players.

The way they interact and play off each other, they have evolved into a sort of hard rock Indigo Girls type of group. Where's the group unity? It's all about Ann & Nancy and that is obvious here. Ann is a shell of her former self. She should be forbidden from ever performing live again. Nancy looks all burnt out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real treat!","review":"Heart just gets better and better, and this performance is a real gem, This will end up being considered a real classic.

Not only does it feature the strongest line up, but the DVD in in the Widescreen format and has both Dolby Digital and DTS sountracks. The only thing missing is the smell of Ann & Nancy's perfume and the smell of the candels.For a number of years I took photo's of the band for the media and so I have heard the band live with many different lineups, but this one really rocks the house. Ann's voice has never been stronger and their harmonies are right on.The DVD features most of the Heart favorites and a few new ones as well. This DVD will surely please any Heart fan or first time listner as well.Buy this DVD, lite up the candles, kickback and prepare to to be transported to Seattle and experience what the audience experienced that magical night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo","review":"I love this DVD! It is recorded at the end of a tour. They are home in Seattle and the band is very tight. They appear to be happy to be home and they put a great show for the home audiance. There personalities really come through on this dvd. Ann and Nancy Wilson prove that they are two of the best female performers on the planet. Ann's voice sounds great on classics like \\"Alone\\". Nancy's shows off her guitar playing on songs like \\"Love Alive\\". They play all the classics and in the middle of the concert Ann and Namcy do an acoustic set which ends with a great Elton John cover of \\"Mona Lisa and Mad Hatters\\". Their vocal harmonies are like ear candy. The whole band sounds great. They have gotten better with age and have work hard to master their craft. Their covers of Led Zepplin are outstanding. They have stood the test of time. I highly recommend this dvd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead on Arrival","review":"This is a HD DVD, although not so stated on Amazon.

Rock on, Ann and Nancy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound, No Substance","review":"Much of contemporary music (by composers who are still active) have little going for it other than individuality. Salonen knows how to work the orchestra and he produces some astonishing sounds. The music is indeed original, even if does on occasion sound a little like Rautavaara. But the Variations seem disjointed with one dazzling episode following another with any sense of continuity or cogency. It seems that the Variations would be just as effective if it were ordered randomly. The music isn't academic, but one comes away with the impression that the work could be a series of unrelated examples from an advanced orchestration textbook. Ultimately the music is highly individual, but unmemorable. Great performances though."},{"rating":"1","title":"more new sounding music","review":"This is more new music by a mediocre conductor and composer. Lucky to have employment in america, probably most likely because of his foreign lineage.Salonene shows that he has, by studying others techniques, the ability to write music; but what is his point?The playing on this cd is very good, but the lack of expression and color is sad, and hopefully he will just get better with time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wes Harrison - Classic Comedy","review":"For those of you that would like something more that oneliner standup comedy.

I've always wanted to find another copy of it and am excited to see it's now on CD.Yes, even back then the jokes were a bit tired (as mentioned by another reviewer) but material that would receive total silence at the hands of another performer can get you laughing hysterically when combined with the amazing sound effects. This guy will blow your mind.In the late 70s, I saw him perform at Wisconsin Dells - where I believe he still performs. Though the routines were exactly the same as on the record from almost 2 decades earlier, they were still funny.

I saw just now, in searching other editions for this review, that there IS a synopsis -- which would have precluded my further interest in getting this book. AMAZON, you do your potential buyers a disservice in not letting us know about the content of EACH edition. Unfortunately for me, this book has a Christian preaching bent to it, \\"saving Gordon (the boy),\\" with the dog, Twig, as an incidental. Granted, I've only read the first few chapters, but as I have no interest in Christianity or being preached to (been there, done that, found something much, much better), I will immediately consign this book to my \\"giveaway\\" pile.

Didi Conn (who I love, btw) is fine. Anita Morris is great, but has been hamstrung by the changes to her character. Doug, well, what can I say, Doug was a great magician and it's wonderful to see him perform.And, **perhaps**, if that's all you're looking for..great magic and the one (Lion Tamer) or two (Up to His Old Tricks (although the arrangement is not as good)) hummable songs they've allowed to remain, then maybe you won't be stunningly disappointed that you spent money on this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Magic, but...","review":"I saw this show in previews at the Cort Theatre in New York. It was never a great show, but had three things going for it: Doug Henning, a terrific supporting cast and some great songs by Stephen Schwartz. On this DVD all you get is Doug Henning. Three of the best numbers (Goldberg variations, West End Avenue and Solid Silver Platform Shoes) are missing or replaced. Didi Conn, who is a lovely comedic actress cannot sing Lion Tamer, which may explain why they dropped West End Avenue. The rest of the cast is fair.

That's like \\"Annie\\" without \\"N.Y.C.\\" The actors seem misdirected into making huge, over-the-top (ala bad children's theatre) acting choices, not that the book's material gives them much else to choose from!

While appealing on the surface, it is a waste of time to think like this.McMurtry should realize that oursourcing is a reality and American companies have no choice. Nor is this a new issue. Shirts being made in Singapore? Give me a break -- he should find a real cause to wail against, not one that was lost years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece - quite impressive","review":"This is a masterwork. James McMurtry, with Childish Things, has created an album that won the Esky award for 2006 (an award for music that goes beyond the expected) and he beat out Neil Young last September when Childish Things and \\"We Can't Make It Here\\" won the Americana Music Awards for album and song of the year, respectively. That win put Neil's Living With War and Let's Impeach the President into second place!Neil is my favorite popular artist - but James' album is truly as fine an album as one could want.

McMurtry is a gifted storyteller - in Childish Things, he creates poignant vignettes of drifters, the regular guy in hard times, hopeless relationships, mortality, the decline of American Heartland and old memories, both good and bad. But it's not all doom and gloom - McMurtry's tales are often cast with a hint of hope, often delivered with his humorous, wry wit. Artists like Richard Shindell and James McMurtry are so adept at telling a story, they are in a league of their own.GENRES: Rock, Mellow Rock.BUY IF YOU LIKE: Lucinda Williams, The Jayhawks, Neil Young.MUST HEAR TRACKS: \\"Childish Things,\\" \\"Slew Foot,\\" \\"Restless,\\" \\"Six Year Drought,\\" \\"Holiday.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"You Owe It To Yourself To Hear This CD!","review":"James McMurtry seems to me to be one of those artists that you either like or don't like...not much middle ground here.

There is only one real disappointment: The Mustafa has very little coloratura capabilities. His voice is a pleasant deep bass. The other singers all do fine with the coloratura requirements. The Isabella has a strong edgy mezzo with nicely blended registers. The Lindoro has a nice bright sound with easy high notes. The Taddeo and Haly have pleasant voices. The Elvira has a strong bright edgy soprano. The sets are nice with realistic looking ocean in the background. The costumes are nice. My only qualm about the directing is the little guy dressed in a chimpanzee costume supposedly as a pet of the Mustafa - seemed a little distracting. All in all, this is a good representation of the opera, notwithstanding some of the Mustafa's singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUK!","review":"When I received the book, I thought wow.

He had no concrete authority for some of his thoughts. I do not think you can just espouse a theory without providing hooks to help it stand up to argument.

I decided to purchase this series because I had seen other films that Roy Dupuis (Ross Desbiens) has acted in and I was sure that I would not be disappointed. I was right! The series was very enjoyable. I am a big fan of Roy Dupuis. Michael Ironside (Bob Durelle) was great and evil at the same time. You will enjoy him. I liked seeing Don Francks (La FemmeNikita - Walter) play his guest shot. He was the the total boss, because no one ever sees him come out to anything.

Soul Blade was actually my first introduction to fighting games and I loved it. It had an incredible storyline for a fighting game. Most fighters such as Virtua Fighter 4 have ablolutely no story behind the characters. I want to know what drives the characters to fight . Why does Sophitia leave her family to search for a cursed sword? In Soul Calibur II everything is improved upon. The only thing that dissapointed me was that there wasn't a seperate Weapon Master mode for each character as there was in Soul Blade. But, after playing it for a bit, I found that I preffered it this way. Some missions are just easier to complete with Nightmare than Killik. When I first heard this game was coming out I went to the arcade to play it. Even in the arcade it was a lot of fun. Now that each platform has its own special character, it makes the game even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Game","review":"This is an awesome game, totally worth the purchase, it has its difference from Tekken, as you DO use weapons. Combos and style of play are different BUT, nevertheless, being a tekken freak, I personally recommended. I got it today and by the looks of its just awesome. Some friends came in the afternoon and we just finished playing, 6 hours straight. It has lots of extras like the Weapon master mode(which unlocks a ton of stuff) and of course, the 200+ weapons you can own. Bottome lines is GET IT, you won't regret it. Tekken fans will surely like it and chances are newcomers or just casuals will too!One of the things i really like are the effect of weapons, some are long range,like swords and big axes, some are short, like knives and daggers, each character is entitled to around 10 weapons, each with abilities or disabilites, some cooler than other, each weapon has a different style and background, which really adds to the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT SUCKS","review":"THIS GAME REALLY SUCKS CUZ THE PLAYERS ARE WEAK AND STUPID.I M REALLY TIRED OF ALL THESE RETARDED PEOLPLE LIKE LINK.DON T BUY THIS GAME IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"soul calibur sucks!!","review":"Let me start by saying that I am not a kid I am 14.

Now in my strong opion you should be able to set the difficulty of Weapons Mode because eventaully your oppent beomes to sissy by blocking a WHOLE lot. And then there buying stuff. the weapons you get 90% of the are useless no wait lower than that. And the cost for a new outfit is insane. The cost for that is at least the of 4 weapons.

I must admit the idea of weapons is alright but to make that the key aspect of the game you would think it would be a bit more complicated then just pressing buttons randomly.

It has little flaws and can be a great time killer. But after the first few weeks of playing it, I started to lose interest. Weapon Master mode seemed great at first but became tedious after the first 10 or 11 missions. Doungions can become agravating, this is because they throw the same character at you in every section, not in all doungions but a select few. Playing under certain circumstances they give you can be difficult to perform especially with certain characters. Placing mines and such on the floor is an \\"ok\\" idea if it didn't only affect you and not your opponents. Weapon Master is also very short. Arcade mode is fun the first couple of times to beat, but after youve beaten it 5 times or so it becomes pointless. Soul Calibur however has amazing graphics and music.

Foremost among these is the ditty \\"What Was Left Was Red\\", which sounds features a bullhorn style vocal over what sounds like a toy piano figure and some synth noise.The dirgy \\"Relapse/Recover\\" is another strange departure from the traditional LT model as well.There are a few familiar sounding punk numbers as well, however, including the opening track, the Bobby Belltower penned \\"Walk Like A River\\", and \\"There's Room For You At The Bottom Of The Pool\\".Over the years I think I've found this album to be the most challenging and perhaps the most rewarding listen in the Leaving Trains discography, but not necessarily the most representative of their trademark sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SLIPPERY","review":"This product is not suitable for active children who are running or climbing on smooth floors, playground equipment etc. There are two patches of fabric on the bottom of the shoes which make them extremely slippery.

The opening song \\"Never Givin' Up On Love\\" is the best song on the album and one of the better songs of his career. But the good stuff doesn't end there as every song is a winner.

Instead it is a shuttle combat game. The missions are extremely tedious and HARD even on easy. I got really frustrated with the difficulty of the game and the repetion.

I do not recommend buying this game, even if you are a Star Trek Fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Trek Fan and Gamer","review":"Finally I thought they would make a Star Trek game good. But nooooooo, they have to make it one of the hardest games I've played in a while. First of all let me say that the one star is for the graphics. They did a great job bringing the ships to life but thats where the fun stops. Do the people that make these games ever try to play test them. Come on!!! All the computer ships do is fire straight at you until you hit them or until they pass you. There is no skill on their part. And how about 10 enemies vs 1 little ship...BOOM! I do have to say that fighting the big ships is fun, at least once you figure out their blind spot. Why can't they make a Star Trek flight sim fun instead of fighting for 30 minutes just to die at the very end or have the Ecselsior blow up and have to start all over. Save your money or rent it and make your own conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shattered Universe shattered my nerves","review":"It's rare I find a game which makes me run screaming from the room. Shattered Universe is one of those. My quick thoughts:The good: decent voice acting from the actors who made Sulu and Chevokv famous; set in the Star Trek universe.The bad: Game play is repetitive and boring after just a few missions.The ugly: The game is just too damm hard on some missions. The aiming controls don't work well, and when you are trying to save the dead in the water Excelsior from 2 capital ships and 10 or so bombers, it's not worth wasting your time.BOTTOM LINE: Beam this piece of garbage into space Scotty!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than I had expected","review":"This game look promising but it had some fatal flaws. There were no training level. The control is too complicated to figure out. The action sequences get very repetitive after awhile.

Now with that being said I believe Paramount has made more than enough profit from all the combined shows, movies, syndications and books to put someone on the job to finally create an awesome game for the FANS. If it was not for us they would have a lot less moola. I'm not going to go into tearing this game to pieces over my dissapointment, I'll just say it was not worth it and I feel that Paramount owes me and the rest of the ST fans around the world a good game. So Paramount here is my challenge to you, Can you finally make a game worthy of the Fans that have made you more rich than you would have been without us. Get off your duffs and do something.Lloyd E.

Even on the easy level it's extremely frustrating, you will repeat levels over and over again, no matter what your skill level. It's pretty much the same thing each level as well, just described differently. The character models are articulated like undead zombies and the lip syncing with the dialogue is non existant. Characters sound good, having used the real Sulu and Checkov actors, but man did some putz do an extremely poor job on the graphics for them. Face it folks it's a complete stinker, you're better off spending your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time, and Money","review":"I love Star Trek, but this game did not cut it. Belongs to the rentals. I had hoped to fly capital ships, decide whether I use up all \\"auxilary power\\" for the shields, or phaser banks, or for the warp core. This game was even cheaper than a \\"Star W**s\\" game. Flying with a small fighter, and the Klingon Bird of Prey was so small!! small as the little fighter we had to fly. The Bird of Prey did not even come close to the size of the capital ships. I am sorry for the people who authorized this production, and for the quality control testers, you did a bad job. Try this game, by renting it. Not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT!","review":"I'd been looking forward to a good space action shooter and i'm a big star trek fan but this game is rediculous. I like the theme with the Excelsior crew in the mirror universe but the game is far more difficult than it should be. You just get frustrated when you've been playing for 3 hrs straight and are only on the third frikkin' level. Also the scenery is way too visually loud. Every level so far has some kind of colorful nebula or something that makes it more difficult to see the small fighters in the distance, space is mostly BLACK and dark anyway! My advice, wait 6 months and buy it used from other suckers like me who are fed up with it. If i'd paid 20 bucks i wouldn't have been as disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Gay Romantic Movie","review":"I have watched this movie for about ten years now and every time I view it I feel it is as fresh as when I first saw it. Actually it has become somewhat of a timecapsule of how young gay people are. With all the recent non community that this gay world of ours are handling there lives it should be viewed by more to remind them of just how real and fun life can be. Yes it becomes sappy at times but thats the movies my dears. It is a wonderful viewing for anyone looking for top notch acting and editing of a film. The go go boy is perhaps the best looking gay character ever in a gay film in my opinion. Absolutely beautiful and at the same likable.

I've have shown this film to many of my friends and each one of them has a big, beaming smile on their face whenever they talk about \\"Trick\\". The story is one that many people can realate to: One guy wants to be with another guy, but something is keeping them from being together.

It had a brief run in the theatre and disappeared. I ran across it in a video rental store and took it home. I loved it. I bought it and it is one of my favorite dvds.It's basically about a young Broadway hopeful songwriter who meets a young guy in a bar and later on a subway. They decide to have a one night fling. The songwriter (Christian Campbell) has a straight roommate who is bedding his girlfriend. Campbell and J.P. Pitoc, the guy he picked up, roam the streets of New York looking for a place to make out. A whole series of hilarious and touching misadventures plague them. Tori Spelling is a talentless actress who is Campbell's best friend. The scene in the diner is worth the movie alone. Jim Fall's impeccable direction. and the wonderful performances of Campbell and Pitoc make this a must see film. The ending is quite predictable but that is a small price to pay for this little jewel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misfire","review":"After reading all the sterling reviews, I couldn't wait to treat myself to this \\"gem.\\" Next time I will be more cautious. The film lacks the sense of humor it advertises. It has no sense of timing. And I felt the characters were generally lifeless, except for the one played by Steve Hayes.

I had low expectations, I suppose, but I ended up finding it redeeming. It is a gay-themed movie, to be sure, but there are more complex things going on than a simple exploration of gay relationships. It's about Gabriel, a clean-cut, young man who has just landed on the comfortable side of being out, who meets a go-go boy he's attracted to. The plan is for them to hook up for the night somewhere, but various things get in the way, including Gabriel's best friend, played by Tori Spelling. Some of their impediments also slow the movie down a bit, but ultimately it's satisgying. There is a lot of play with stereotypes, but they get turned on their heads, subtly. The movie critiques the \\"gay scene\\"... That and other critiques play subtly through and make \\"Trick\\" very satsifying to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"awww it's soooo sweet......","review":"I don't know why I'm bothering to add my voice to the 45+ reviews when the majority are positive.

I remember living in NYC, in the very same places where the lead character is living, and all of the things that happens to him were things I remember so well from being in the theater there.Jim Fall has captured such a lovely, heart breaking, and hysterical story, and has put together a bunch of really lovely actors in all the roles.Who can't fall in love with the lead hunk, Pitoc? Who doesn't love what Tori Spelling does in this role? And Campbell is so charming that you just want him to have a happy ending, in more ways than one!!!This is a film that should be a part of everyone's DVD collection..period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"What a great film. While it certainly is not deemed a classic film by any standards, it is a gay-themed film that should be seen by all.

I was smiling at the end, and what better recommendation than that is needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly accurate","review":"One thing that I loved about the movie was the fact that got the lingo and attitudes of the characters so precisely.

This is one the gay community could have done without. I guess this movie would be alright if you're a stereotypical showtune-listening, Tori Spelling-loving, club kid, who falls head-over-heels for anything that looks good in a tight shirt.The lives of most gay men, however, consist of much more than this. I prefer a film with a bit more substance. There is simply too much cliche in this film: gay club, one-night stand, broadway musical, and a muscle queen. And I think we've seen it better before.There's very little originality here. If you're the kind of person that thinks these are the key issues in a gay man's life, and are willing to see them time and again, this film's for you.

Original feminist thinkers on race (many of who hooks shamelessly borrows from) are Toni Cade Bambara, Michelle Wallace, Hazel Carby, Toni Morrison, Angela Davis... there a long list, and bell hooks does not hold up to them under any kind of scrutiny.

There's just enough there on the DVD to let you know that the performance must have been an incredible experience for those lucky enough to be in the audience, but so little there that you don't get any sense of Follies as show - no sense of what connects the songs, and no sense of who the characters are.

The stars and the songs are incredible. However, this DVD only shows parts of most of the songs and omits some of the very best songs and scenes altogether. It is also a grainy copy that looks like it was dubbed on an old VHS video tape. Please save yourself the time, the money, and the memories, if you have seen this show before.

It ONLY displays E,A,D,G,B&E and whether they are flat or sharp. That wasn't clear when I bought the product, and I would have purchased the cheaper GA-30, which is chromatic, if I had known. I play upright bass and like to use it to check my intonation. Because this tuner is specifically for bass I thought it might track the low notes better, but the GA 30 is definitely a better product. I think this tuner is more suited to rock guitarists that like to use lowered tunings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yak...","review":"There are better tuners out there. Far better. This could be good, but it seems to me that all Korg products seem to think of Standard tuning as the only tuning out there, and they don't even tune it well to Standard (especially when tuning the G string)! I personally play exclusively in Standard for my electric playing, but sometimes I want to fiddle around with open-tunings on an acoustic. This piece-of-junk makes it incredibly difficult to tune to any tuning using \\"F\\" or \\"C\\" notes. I have no clue as to why that is, pretty stupid if you ask me, especially once you consider that majority of this generations guitarists are metal heads playing in drop c tuning or acoustic d-bags (I say that with love) that play in open tunings.

Just pluck a string and if it's in tune the needle will point straight up and the light will be green but if the needle is to the left it's flat and if the needle goes to the right then it's sharp and a red light will appear. You can also use this to tune a 7 string guitar, a bass or acoustic guitars which is a plus because I own an electric and an acoustic guitar. It's also small and easy to carry around with you.The first time I used it on my guitars it took a little while because they were both very much out of tune but it was easy to get them in tune and now when I tune them it's easy and fast.I don't have any experience with other tuners but I do know that this is a good tuner with some good features at a cheap price and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a tuner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Best tuner i've used yet, period.

The \\"needle\\" is all over the place, both on acoustic and electric guitars. If you hit a string, it may show it to be quite flat, without touching the tuning, if you hit it again, it shows it quite sharp.

If you're backstage, you better have a light source or you're out of luck. Secondly, I had to kick in the active electronics for it to even register a signal on B,E strings. The tracking was very neurotic and non-committal. This wouldn't have been an issue if I didn't lend out my trusty Sabine ZIP-700 (..and it was dropped for the last time).Conclusion, if you're tuning up in the dark backstage with no light source on your Sadowsky 5 string, forget it. I'd suggest you move up to a better tuner.

In case you're not familiar with binocular design, eye relief specs are extremely important because poor eye relief will leave you seeing almost nothing so you'll be forced to take off your glasses. Well, the eye relief is \\"very good\\". Could be a notch higher into \\"excellent\\" but you'll end up paying much more $ if you want that. Overall optics are excellent.

Rather than offer suggestions or alternatives to what she sees as areas of difficulty between the American and Afghan cultures, she seems to prefer the approach that if you shout loudly enough, someone else will come up with a solution.

There are 20 ringer sounds to choose from, only 2 of which are bearable. The ringer is hard to hear even on its loudest setting. After a few days the phones stopped displaying the caller's name and number and only displayed \\"no data\\" or \\"incomplete data\\" (I know its not my service because my upstairs phones were displaying it fine). The sound on the answering machine is terrible, my outgoing message sounds like I am talking into a can while standing in a cave.The only good thing I can say about it is the range. I was able to walk all over my house, upstairs and down, even go outside, and I never lost the connection or heard static.

I had a Sharp which I liked but needed to get another for my the teens' tv room. The Zenith was on sale. I don't use it much but here's what I don't like about it so far: programming is a pain. You can't use the number pad, and unlike even my 5-year-old VCR, you have to use up and down keys for the hour&minutes combined (that is, you push the up arrow and it goes from 12:00 to 12:01, up and it goes 12:01 to 12:02, etc. you can't separate the hour from the minutes for faster programming). On my Sharp, I can use either the number pad (with hour & minute separated) or the up & down arrows. In addition, it seems to have little versatility on rewind or FF. The same DVD which I can rewind in tiny segments on my Sharp can only be rewound (or fast forward) in big chunks on the Zenith. I have a feeling that Zenith is using the oldest available technology. The pathetic thing is that it cost just as much as my Sharp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Service is HORRIBLE.","review":"After two months the VCR stopped recording video.

This is especially great for folks with older TV sets wanting to go DVD. I can also attach it to a newer digital quality TV when I'm ready. I happened to like the silver and mirrored front, esp. if your going for that monochomatic, mirrored, sleek look for a smaller area or bedroom. It has played every disk that I have put in it, DVD, CD, CD-RW.

If you turn off the timer, it deletes your program. So what's the point of entering a recurring program if it can't be saved and turned on and off?My 10 year old VHS recorder is more accommodating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"The best things you can say about the unit is that it's very quiet. However, the response to commands from the remote is extremely slow. By the time the VCR unit stops either FF or REW you're so far past the point where you wanted to be that you have to do it all over again. The Commercial Skip feature sounds great in theory but in practice you have the same problem as with the FF or REW, and you have to use it 4-6 times together with REW. Programming the VCR to record a program can take forever because you can't set the hour and mins independent of each other. There are many other shortcomings with the VCR but too many to list. The same also holds true for the DVD player. Also, since the remote isn't a \\"universal\\" it has no volume controls so you have to switch to your TV's remote every time you need to adjust the volume. I've had better performance from very inexpensive VCR and DVD units than from this \\"high end\\" unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great talent","review":"Listening to our local jazz station (KMHD) in the Portland area, I heard Kaeshammer's West Broadway from the No strings attached CD and was sold.

I have heard her live and sung onstage with her, no one can touch Miss Eaglen.To say that she is not a great talent is to demonstrate a complete lack of credibility to your knowledge of operatic singing.This CD while not a great representation of her abilities is still a lovely presentation of most of these arias. But to get the Real Jane Eaglen expirience, one must hear her live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!!","review":"I don't really understand all the fuss around Jane Eaglen. She's perhaps the most overrated singer of our times. Comparisons to Flagstad and Nilsson are just preposterous and a disrespect to them. Eaglen has a big middle voice and that's it. No top or lower register. Why would a soprano would like to sing Gioconda, for example, without some measure of chest register? But if this recording is vocally uncompelling (not to say completely inapropriate) it is also blemished by a lack of any interpretive insight: every aria is approached in the same way as the previous one. It is so sad that such a mediocre singer and actress is being hailed as the most important hochdramatisch soprano of our times. If there is some hope to find a successor to Flagstad and Nilsson clearly Eaglen is not it. She lacks the voice, the class, the temperament. An awful singer, a terrible recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performances","review":"With due respect, I don't think Jane Eaglen is any diva. Her voice is emotionless and not as powerful as some people may think. She sounds both miscast and uneasy in these famous Italian operatic arias. There're a huge number of singers who can sing this repertoire much better than Eaglen does at present. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing CD in many ways","review":"If this cd is used to demonstrate the art of opera singing, then I'm afraid that opera is soon to become extinct! Yes, Jane Eaglen does produce some beautiful sounds from time to time. Yet, it's all bereft of meaning! The listener can feel no emotion with all the different characters sounding the same in every case. This is one of the blandest aria album I've come across for many years! I just won't do! Besides, I'm surprised that Eaglen's top notes are so weak and her Turandot is really not exciting at all. I don't think I would like to return to this cd in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane's beatiful voice envelopes these pieces","review":"Jane's voice and line are completely flawless in this CD. Her incredible legato line is awe inspiring. I have never heard these pieces sung with such exquisite technique and line. Occasionally I would like to hear more expression, or more chest voice. However this CD alone could be a lesson in bel canto legato line singing. Anyone who can't hear that simply doesn't have an educated ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane deserves better!","review":"I can't believe how poorly Jane is recorded on this CD. She is such a wonderful singer, she has a huge, beautiful voice - yet you can hardly hear her. She sounds like she was recorded singing in a closet. A real shame because it could have been a terrific CD. The sound engineers get a big thumbs down for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most beautiful voice","review":"She just has the most beautiful voice. It's just the greatest. And the way she approaches high exposed notes is just brilliance. Her In questa reggia sounds better than most. Her Vissi d'arte and all the Madama Butterfly are my favorite renditions so far. I really love her vibrato. It's not too slow where she'd fall underpitch, but just slow enough that it stays perfectly in the area that's beautiful and exciting. This album is just pure gold. I really wish she'd actually SING these roles. Her L'altra Notte In Fondo Al Mare is also quite good. I'm very happy with this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the feebler film guides I've read.","review":"I enjoyed the \\"Films of the Seventies\\" book from this series, and quite frankly I expected better from \\"Films of the Eighties,\\" which I found not only riddled with typos (not to mention glaring factual errors that a single viewing of the movies in question would have corrected) but saddled with limping, uninspired prose.

It focuses on the balance Christians should have between having an awareness of Satan and his schemes, while not giving him any glory by focusing more on him and his power than on his total defeat on the Cross.

This book has only a vast vast number of Bible verses and a few anecdotes so un-lurid that they wouldn't even interest Pastor Fletcher Brothers on a dull day.

No real excitement.As for the Kindle edition, this is a DISGRACE. There were NO quotation marks or apostrophes at all, which made reading dialogue very awkward.

This film genuinely made me laugh! And that is not a frequent event for me while watching movies--even intentional comedies. Liu vents a natural, unforced humor, that carries the story along and even cheerfully colors his fights; he's funny without, apparently, trying to be.This is one of my all-time favorite kung-fu films for hero portrayal and development.

These thugs then pull your family out of the bedroom and hold knives to their throats. Not only that, they grab hold of you and make you watch while they're murder your family. It doesn't stop there! They then force you to the floor and chop off your thumb. Do you know the things you are not able to do if you are missing a thumb? Never thought about it, right?

Even if that leaves you indifferent, this is an excellent spy novel and well worth reading. Ignatius's research -- geographical, historical, and organizational -- is superb. While his story briefly spins into something not quite believable, his underlying description of the CIA and its employees rings true. Ignatius neither glorifies nor deamonizes them, he simply recounts what their lives must be like and what he believes they must feel.And if you are one of the rare few that is interested in Armenia as a backdrop for at least part of a novel, you will not be disapointed. Late in the novel we are introduced to Armenian character, and we are eventually transported to Armenia with some of the characters. Ignatius gets nearly every detail right, and it was as though I had actually visited Armenia, however briefly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very gifted writer with strong sense of humor","review":"This is a most gifted novelist with natural paintbrush. Every book written by Ignatius was thoroughly reseached before put into writing. If you are keen enough in humor, some of the chapters and paragraghs were the most humorous creation ever written by a novelist! Some readers might find this book somehow not so easy to read along since the Cold War was over and CIA is really and actually in deep shit now. But Ignatius never failed to amazed the readers that he could adjust himself pretty well and fast; he proved it in his recent good book, A FIRING OFFENSE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"There are only two tracks on this CD: two versions of the same song, each is too long.

I didn't use the gold filter basket (included), because the fine coffee sediment leaked through (leaving the fine grounds in the bottom of your cup...ewww!) So, I just used a typical \\"cupcake liner\\" filter. I did like the \\"auto shut-off\\" feature, and coffee taste was o.k., but it was hard to fill with water (the lid lifts off to the back, and you have to have good aim!), plus the carafe leaked everytime I poured coffee, unless I poured way too slowly. I'm disappointed that this was not a cheap machine, but only lasted a year. When I go to buy my next coffeemaker, it won't be a Black and Decker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best buy","review":"This coffee pot had the best rating by Consumer Reports and I see why. Not only is it cheaper than most, they put more thought into the design. It has a wide, flat mouth on the pot itself- no spills. It displays two levels on the pot: water and coffee (there's always a slight loss of water when brewing). You don't have to wrestle the thing open to put the grinds in (it's easy)- they put the basket in the top, so when you open the top, you have access to both the water and the basket. I don't like to fight with my coffeemaker befor I've had my coffee, so I'd like to personally recomend this for ease of use with half open eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffeemaker","review":"The coffeemaker was reviewed in Consumers Report Mag.

Saw very positive reviews on the DCM2500B and got one.Love the very large filling area under the one-piece swing up cover. Controls are straightforward and easy to set. The unit actually keeps the coffee HOT for the two-hour warming cycle. The only flaw in the whole unit is that condensation runs down the outside back of the machine when you take out the filter basket to clean it.For the price, the DCM2500B is unbeatable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consumer Reports was right","review":"We purchased this coffee maker based on Consumer Reports evaluation of coffee makers. We are extremely pleased with everything about the DCM2500. Our previous two coffee makers were Mr. Coffee, and this one is much easier to use - primarily due to the easy to pour carafe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended by Consumer Reports","review":"I ordered this coffee maker in late 2008 because it was the top-rated \\"Christmas Gift Idea\\" from Consumer Reports. Lo and behold, a few months after we received it, Consumer Reports did another coffee maker rating, and this Black and Decker didn't even make the top 10 list!! So much for timing. It's a good machine, but awkward to fill with water since you have to crack open the entire top. Also, the cup scale is impossible to see unless you turn the coffee maker 90 degrees to the right. The carafe is easy to use and pour; the programmable feature is nice. My biggest complaint is that it doesn't get the coffee hot enough. The coffee is very warm, but not hot enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meets or Exceeds your needs","review":"There are more expensive coffee makers, but this one is reliable and no nonsense. The digital clock is not so bright you could land an aircraft at night by it, and the controls are simple.

That way you do not run out of paper filters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak luke warm coffee","review":"We wanted a larger coffee maker for when we have guests but I normally only fill to the 4 cup line (equals 2 real cups) for my morning brew.

My husband has been so irritated in the past with coffee makers that spill all over the place when you pour a cup of coffee. This one doesn't miss a drop. The water reservoir is excellent. Plenty of room to pour in the water. The only negative thing that I could say about this product is that the coffee isn't hot enough. Other than that it is an excellent buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken","review":"We bought this coffee maker because it is one of the few products that does not beep at the end of the brew cycle. The product arrived defective. When I filled it with water to run the first cleaning brew, it leaked all the water out from every seam. I would not give the product any stars, because it never worked, but Amazon forces you to give at least 1 star. The other impressive thing is that the Amazon partner company electronicsexpo.com refunded the money for the coffee maker, but not shipping either way. The return policy states that because we decided to return, not exchange the product we must pay shipping. So basically, I paid about $20 to transport a broken piece of junk to and from my house. I wouldn't buy from them again, nor would I recommend them to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good.","review":"Bought this pot on July 27, 2010, today, September 8, 2011 it died.

The heating mechanism was defective or something, but it stopped brewing. So I sent it in and got a replacement...the replacement had a broken hinge. So whenever I open the top, it falls all over the place. But it's still connected to the water head so I can't just take it off and put it back on when it's time to make coffee. This coffee maker has been such an annoying experience. But it is just coffee and it wasn't that expensive. BEFORE it broke, the coffee pot worked just fine, and I really liked it.

The warmer keeps it warm but it's not too hot so as to overcook the potted brew.The pots no spill feature is a nice touch as is the way the carafe places on the warmer.Yes it pops a bit when the tank is near empty but, so what. The coffee is what counts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good coffee maker","review":"This is my second one. Makes consistently good coffee (I am a daily drinker) and you can't beat the price.

Unfortunately for us, the KF 510 seems to be discontinued, and we chose this as the replacement.Our machine is on its way back to Amazon because a) it was broken (the clock \\"reset\\" after every brew) and b) the coffee just wasn't very good (which is why it's a return for refund and not a return for replacement). The coffee is barely warm (not hot) even directly after brewing. I assume the lack of heat also has something to do with the weak coffee it produced.Pros: Great Carafe design, easy to use, decent price.Cons: Faulty electronics (search the reviews for \\"clock\\"), coffee is weak and luke warm, red numerals on the clock are distracting (it makes you think it is \\"on\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic danger","review":"I purchased a Black & Decker DCM2500B SmartBrew Coffee maker from Amazon in September, to replace a MrCoffee that we used daily for many years. When it arrived, it was thoroughly washed and run through its brewing cycle with baking soda and clear water in the hope that the acrid plastic odor it gave off would be purged from it. It filled the house with the smell of plastic and the water that passed through it was not even potable due to the fumes.I put the unit on our outdoor steps and let it recycle water for several hours, and let the unit sit for several weeks to air out. Then I made a pot of coffee which tasted like industrial waste. I am convinced that this is an unhealthy exposure to VOCs, and should not be used.

It's a great coffeemaker for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"After a mere 6 weeks of occasional use, the reservoir immediately leaks all the water when it is filled. The water somehow comes out the screw holes in the base of the machine. When it actually did brew coffee, the temperature was, at the hottest, lukewarm. The coffee does get warm enough if you have the time to leave it on the warming plate for a while.Returning it is just not worth it. Amazon's return policy is confusing, and they will not give a full refund. The phone person said 15-20% restocking fee, but the return policy page says up to 50% of the item's price.

Over the years, my main complaint with many brewers, even expensive ones, is that when pouring the coffee, there always is a spillage that doesn't make it into the cup. It runs down the carafe, spilling onto the counter. This problem has been solved by the flat shape of the pouring area. Not a drop goes astray. The Black and Decker folks have designed the carafe to perfection!! And by the way..... the coffee is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked for 17 days","review":"I purchased this 17 days ago.

I'm notpleased with this coffee maker's performance. If you are not real careful to makesure the pot is exactly where it needs to be, OMG what a coffee ground mess you willhave (has happened twice already). Now, the basket style filter as opposed to the conestyle filter. Sorry, but the basket style loses sorely. Regardless of how many scoopsof coffee I put into the basket it will not duplicate the taste of cone filtered coffee.Needless to say, this unit is going on Craigslist this week as soon as my new Oster witha cone filter comes in. The Oster was only $10 more, so don't waste your money on this one.Unless you like mediocre coffee that you have to baby sit (to makesure it doesn't overflow)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee's Good, but Problems Persist","review":"While Consumer Reports gave this coffeemaker a good rating, I have to disagree on two points: one is the clock, which will jump ahead by several hours when you turn your back (in fact, I don't even know if it has the numbers 7, 8 or 9). Hence, you cannot program the coffeemaker because the time is always off by a mile. Second, the pour spout is wide, which makes it nice for not spilling, but not so great for keeping the coffee hot. I have to nuke it for 25 seconds for a steaming cup. Oh, and it has annoying hissing habit, not when it's first warming up, but all the time.

I poured 1/2 a cup of water into the carafe and sure enough it immediately began leaking out of the bottom... out of several different areas. We have owned much cheaper coffee makers than this one and we never had problems with them.

Typically we make a strong pot to the 6 cup line. The 1st time we used it, the 'sneak a cup' feature caused a back up when it overflowed the paper filter. With no separate filter at the water entrance the heater element packed up with overflowed grounds and refused to perk. After flushing it out (and pulling the save a cup feature off the unit) we noted that the pot is poorly designed and dribbles. My guess is the plastic lip varies from unit to unit.

But very soon after we bought it, it began developing a nasty-looking flaking and blistering on the face of the heating element. Doesn't affect its functionality but looks like hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this brand name coffee pot for my son-in-law. He was so excited to receive it since it was a surprise for him. His old coffee pot was just about to bite the dust, and about time, he has had the old one, Gevolia, for at least 5 years, probably longer. He and I both were under the brand name impression that this, Black and Decker coffee pot would go on to work even longer than his old coffee pot. He loved the added features too. After responsibly using the coffee pot daily for only one month is stopped working. Just wouldn't brew. I was shocked. I am writing this review as a beginning to have the coffee pot replaced with one that will withstand normal use and time. Sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black & decker Coffee Pot","review":"I like this fast model with pause and serve and 2 hour turn off.

I made 2 cups of coffee per day for exactly 2 weeks and the coffeemaker stopped working. Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clock Trouble","review":"This is the second Black and Decker coffee pot I've had. The first one had problems with the clock going out so I had to send it back. After receiving a new one it worked fine for a couple of years until the base started to leak. I just ordered a new one and this one has a screwed up clock again. The time does not stay set so you can't set the clock for automatic brewing which is why I bought it in the first place. I'm still waiting for my replacement coffee pot to arrive but I won't trust Black and Decker again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"The first coffee maker I received had to be returned, because the time constantly reset itself, making the timer useless.

I decided I could live with clicking in exchange for a great cup of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital clock 2, me 0","review":"I bought my coffeemaker at Sears and was curious about the buyers' experiences here. I'm zero for 2 on the digital clock. Mine jumps ahead 8 hours just as the clock advances from 2:59 to 3:00 - both AM and PM. It's really strange how many people love this coffee maker and how many people hate it. Put me in the hate column."},{"rating":"1","title":"DCM2500B SmartBrew Coffeemaker","review":"Bought this because of the top rating in Consumer Reports.Making and pouring coffee was great. However I sent the first one back because the clock would go berzerk after a day or two and therefore the auto brew would not come on when it should. We woke up to cold coffee that was made in the middle of the night. When the clock changed you couldn't reset it because it would go from 1:00 to 19:00 (rather that 1:00 to 12:00 AM/PM as when first plugged in), almost like a timer. We had to unplug the coffeemaker for 30 seconds to get the clock to reset only to have the same thing happen in a day or two. Sent it back for a replacement and the new one did the same thing. Maybe our kitchen TV or Laptop was causing interference because they were close to it. Either way it didn't work for us. We sent the second one back for a refund and bought another Braun, just like the one we were replacing in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks on Counter","review":"I bought this Coffee Maker (B&D model 2500) from WalMart last week and it leaked all over the counter twice in three uses.

The carafe pours a high or low volume without spilling a drop. Making 8 cups instead of 12 will take the recommended 5-6 minutes of brew time.

This coffee maker has a nice pouring spout but the coffee never seem hot enought for my wife and I.

I use it about four times then put it in storage for a spare and got another cone filter pot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic store","review":"Fantastic product.

Immediately the hinge on the lid broke, so you have to hold it with your thumb whenever you pour coffee. Hard water has caused a problem with our coffeemachines in the past, so I have been scrupulous about giving it a vinegar rinse every 6 weeks and using filtered water... to no avail. The machine just stopped percolating today, One year and 2 months after purchase. I called B&D as there were no \\"troubleshooting tips\\" in the accompanying pamphlet, but they just said, \\"Hmmm, don't know. Guess you'll just have to buy another.\\" Not another Black & Decker thank you very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great For The 6 Months It Worked","review":"This is a great coffee maker for the 6 months it actually worked. I will not purchase this model or any Black & Decker model since this guy had such a short life.One down side is that is turns off after being on for 2 hours. I thought this was a great feature when I ordered it...so I never have to worry about leaving it on by accident and leaving the house. However, there are many mornings that I make coffee very early and by the time my husband is ready for a cup, the machine has turned off. Coffee snobs would say you should make a fresh pot if it has been sitting out that long...but we aren't that fussy and wish this feature could be switched on or off to suit our needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope.","review":"Bought this Black n Decker coffeemaker on recommendation I noticed Instapundit blog.Worked fine.

However, we like our coffee a bit closer to the ideal brewing temperature of 200 degrees not the 165 this coffee makes brew at.

A basic coffeemaker is all we needed, and this one works just fine for us. The best thing about this coffeemaker is the carafe because it does not drip/leak when you pour the coffee (which was my biggest complaint with the old Braun). The worst thing about it for me is the large \\"lid\\" on the top of the machine. I have to pull it almost completely out from under the cabinet in order to open the lid and pour in the water. (However, I already expected that because of another review I read before buying.) I also don't care for the bright red clock; I'd prefer blue/green or one that doesn't light up at all. These little complaints are not a big deal to me though. Overall I really like this coffeemaker! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"read ALL reviews before you order","review":"This item had 3 stars and we ordered without reading all the reviews.

I also see that the user controls are placed in much more logical positions on this machine - a much better engineered unit!We have had this for about 6 months now, and it makes very nice coffee, and the machine functions well. Nice price too ($29)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud with a short life","review":"This was a fine coffee maker for the price...assuming that you're willing to replace it every few years.

The first one DCM100B failed in less than six months. This one-DCM2500B. failed to turn on 28 days after being put into use. For the first 26 days, the coffemaker brewed perfect coffee,and I thought I had found a winner. Today-November 5, 2010, the pot did not come on. Nothing.

I had heard that Black and Decker was a good brand. ALL 3 of the coffee pots lasted less than 3 months. There is no warning about faulty engineering or poor manufacturing. And when the heating element melts the plastic reservoir for water; there is no warning about the electrical shock hazard as the 2 quarts of water are dumped onto your counter and your electric appliances are sitting in the pool.Yes its VERY easy to program, looks great. But - unless you need a paper weight. I'd say its completely unsafe and unusable.Don't buy any B&D; coffee maker - if you expect it to actually make coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky piece of junk","review":"You would think a large company with engineers could design a coffee pot that didn't leak when you poured from it. Once it was manufactured they must have tested it and found that it was unacceptable, but apparently they did not care.

When I got the seed I immediately used it... by the instructions. 2 weeks later I have only a couple little shoots of grass which you have to look at real closely. He has since cut his area in half, I continue to spray his pee in the one area and the other area I do not.

After a week of no grass despite my Dobie's assistance I decided to reseed and use a garden hose to do the watering rather than depend on my faithful companion.

Two stars might be a bit harsh, but it didn't work for us so I couldn't justify rating it any higher.Update: We tried it a second time a couple months later with about the same result.

It also would start to die if it didn't receive a lot of water, and we're talking much more water than the rest of the grass, including sod I had down.Every area where this grass was has been replaced with grass from other places in the yard from gardens I dug up this year.

My advice - find some real music and don't bother with this bunch of horrible songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Country for those who listen to rock","review":"The band sounds like a rock band trying to do what they think is country.

Lameo songs that have no originality, back-up musicians who are just ordinary, and some moaning/groaning/gutless lead vocals that make you want to run for the border. Approved by the man in black himself? - I don't think so! This is 100 proof JUNK and the lead singer needs to keep his face hidden at all times because that's the scariest part of this CD. Will someone please give him a cowboy hat that covers his dog ugly face and do us all a favor? I long to hear good alt country but this ain't it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this book sucks.","review":"I am just sitting here reading this book, studying for a huge exam tomorrow morning, and I am just getting so incredibly frustrated with this book and decided that I should let it out on here. Oh my God, there is a mistake on like every friggin page... and to make matters worse, all the mistakes are right smack-dab in the middle of an example problem. So there you are, trying to learn how to work certain problems, and all of a sudden, there's something that just doesnt seem to make any sense. And the whole time you're thinking that you're stupid and you just cant figure out the correct way to do the problem, until a wasted-hour later, you finally realize... \\"oh, its just ANOTHER stupid mistake these idiots made, and i thought i was retarded.\\" Grrrr, this is killin me.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is given one paragraph of space which refers back to four other equations in the text. Understanding the use of this popular equation requires a convoluted page-flipping to try to work through the author's many equations leading up to it. (And by leading up, I do not mean to imply there's a logical conceptual sequence.) As others have written, the chapter review questions aren't covered adequately in the text and the questions themselves aren't always clear. The Solutions Manual for the text is worthless, tossing out more equations and giving no indications of where the numbers used come from.

This isn't the book students need."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best reference material","review":"If you have to get the book for a class..do, but the book itself has many errors even when it's already in a later edition. the answers in the back is not always correct and there are typos in formulas.

I will be graduating Cum Laude this spring, and I just suffered through Quantitative Analysis using this book. The problems do not match the examples, there is little background given to the concepts described, and there is no study guide that shows the methods needed to solve problems. My Thermal Physics instructor finally gave up using another Saunders book for the same reasons. Saunders books are more devoted to working problems than describing or teaching the processes that occur.

We went back and re-read all the material we've collected over the years, and purchased new material but still didn't get enough information about a reactive temperment until we read this book. It was a true AAha moment. Armed with accurate knowledge of this dog's behavior and our previous training experience we are finally reaching a break through point. Although the book is informative and comes to correct asumptions about the reactive dog it is not the basic step by step training manual and for people looking for basic obedience training I would not recommend it but for those who can't seem to build confidence and dependability in an otherwise trained dog this is your book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TOTALLY EXCELLENT!","review":"Excellent, very specific & usable plans of action for ANY reactive problem with your dog.

The watch looks great, but has an unusual feature in that the date does not reset at 31, but continues up to 39 - a minor but monthly annoyance.Today, I dropped the watch when putting it on - it fell from counter height. When it hit the tile floor, nearly all of the numbers broke off and are now floating inside the face of the watch.

Someone needs to take this girl back to the studio to find a new sound. Her backround music is so loud that you can hardly hear her voice, and when you do, it's very bland. She's not especially pretty, she doesn't have hardly any talent, and doesn't even have catchy songs.

She is so cool. She is a bit slow, but the cool thing about her is her sword can fall apart, revealing a whip. Other characters are fast and acrobatic, some are strong and preform new tricks.

Everything in the game with the setup of moves and the controls to perform them are just perfect. It has the most replay value I have ever seen in a fighting game with the story mode lasting you well over 30hrs.There are so so many options in this game with over 200 weapons which is quite nice with each having there own power to help you out. The gameplay options with match types and extra bonus matches all add even more replay value to the game. Everything ties in to be one great very tight game.

Mostly all of them are half naked and disguisting, every movement you can see up their skirts and its gross.But ignore that and you have the boys. The most gorgeous bishonen they have is Nightmare, one of his nipples is even an eye and with long blond hair is the ultimate fighter of the gae carrying around a giant sword (and I mean a weapon lol).Their are extras which makes the game even more fun, a map to take your character through the world of Soul Calibur and opening new costumes (mostly only for the girls though grr..) and information, as well as new weapons and other things.I bought the Gamecube version to use Link from the original Nintendo 64.

I beat this game in literally under 10 minutes on the first try! What a waste of 8 dollars. I'm glad I could return it. They made it out to be like some epic battle but it's just sad. It's like a cheap immitation of Mortal Kombat. Maybe this will appeal to some of you who like relentless \\"versus\\" games but I am not a fan of quick easy games.

The only redemtion to this recording is Cash's \\"I'm on Fire.\\" What, that isn't even a Nebraska song. My faith in Cash remains strong, he had sense enough not to dirty Nebraska. I will keep the CD only because of Cash's great contribution. Without it I would scrap it.After listening to this thing I had to throw in Nebraska to get the foul taste out of my mouth (ears.) Why didn't they leave Bruce's greatest alone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Like many other reviewers, I am a huge fan of Bruce's Nebraska, and I was excited to hear these re-workings of his excellent songs.

Sadly, not so.Many of these covers are needlessly obtuse. Ani DiFranco's \\"Used Cars\\" comes close, but rather than her usual intensity and directness, we get meandering weirdness. Chrissie Hynde had disappointed me for the first time in her entire career.Los Lobos, Dar Williams, Johnny Cash and Raul Malo do serviceable jobs... but really, this album just made me want to hear the original stashed in my collection.Sorry - this was a waste of cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea...","review":"that went terribly bad. I cannot comprehend how some of these \\"artists\\" were chosen for this. \\"Atlantic City\\" and \\"State Trooper\\" are embarrasing to say the least, but they sadly showcase what is now Nashville's finest.

I really tried to like it. I listened to it on the couch with head phones. I listened to it in the car and while I was working in the office or the garage. But it always seemed like a cheap imitation. Only one singer on this recording made the song his own, and that (you guessed it) was Johnny Cash. In the end, I realized the rest of them were just trying to imitate the Boss and they could get no where near him. I give it two stars because Mr. Cash's cut deserves ten and is worth the price of the CD. But the others drag him down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing.","review":"This product has so many different connectors it feels like I need to hire a specialist to figure which way is in and which way is out.But it did feel TEN times more sturdy than the picture sudjested.

Unfortunately I was sadly mistaken. User is the worst piece of crap I have ever wasted my time on. Did Nelson want me to hate all of the characters and assume they are all stupid, annoying turds? There was no plot, no character development, no interesting characters. There was however, a bunch of idiots running around saying things like \\"We just did heroin! We are so cool!\\" Seriously. Please, Blake Nelson, give me the 2 hours of my life back that it took me to read your pathetic excuse for a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frustrating but a good read.","review":"\\"Girl\\" became my favorite book seven years ago when I first read it.

The style he uses here, the short choppy sentences, took a while for me to get used to, but it is very effective. The main character, quickly sails in and out of his days with few lessons learned. Obviously, the perfect girl for him is right there, but he keeps looking over her shoulder for something better. It was an interesting way to learn about the male's mind, though I never did get a clear answer.

I must say this, the first 10 - 20 mins are slow, however I enjoyed the fighting between Toa (Liu) and his wife. I took away one star because I wished that it was in widescreen format.

Now that Spur finally found his gold, the rugged mountain men have been supplanted by prospectors (bordello and all); Jim ends up in all sorts of contrived contests with his new rival (this ends up being the main plot of the film); and the teddy bear-like Brian Dennehy shouldn't be allowed to tie Harrison's boots, much less play his part.If you found the first movie to be a work of cinematic art, spare yourself from spoiling it, and stay away from this shamefully coattailed sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love horses and romantic stories this one's for you..","review":"Don't let the review from Leonard Maltin's Movie & Video Guide fool you.

Codebooks and other secret documents were captured from the U-505 which assisted Allied codebreaking operations.On 4 June 1944, United States Navy Task Group 22.3 (TG 22.3) captured U-505, the first time a US Navy vessel had captured an enemy at sea since 1815, when USS Peacock seized HMS Nautilus during the War of 1812. The action took place in the Atlantic Ocean, at 21<30N, 19<20W, about 150 miles off the coast of Rio De Oro, Africa. The American force was commanded by Captain Daniel V. Gallery, USN, and comprised the escort aircraft carrier USS Guadalcanal (CVE-60), and five destroyer escorts under Commander Frederick S.

Gallery masterfully uses submarine logs and diaries from the German commanders and sailors to make a complete picture of the war in the Atlantic come alive as few people are able to do. Based on a true story of the only submarine ever captured in war, this is a good reader for adolescents or for those interested in a beginning study of the Naval confrontations in the Atlantic during WWII. It is a fairly easy read and only a couple hundred pages. I think it is a classic for history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This is a great book about an important event leading to the Allied victory in WWII.

This one came highly recommended. I give it four stars. I generally like it, especially its ability to leave the pieces in place, while putting on the lid.It has some annoying features.The first problem is that a bishop looks a lot like a pawn. Especially in low light, or if you're in a hurry to set up, it's easy to confuse the pieces.The second problem is that some of the magnets weren't well glued to the base of some of the pieces. I went through the pieces one by one, and reglued the magnets to about 1/4 of them.The third, minor, annoyance is that it doesn't have letters and numbers for algebraic notation of moves. I tried using a P-touch labeler, but that ended up looking tacky and cheap, so I hand-lettered the ranks and files with a black Sharpie.I'd buy it again, even knowing these problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"I also heard this was a great set but...1)There is not enough room for the pieces to the side as they come off the board.2)I prefer a green/white color combination3)the bishops and pawns look too much alikeI would find something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing piece/bad customer service","review":"My daughter receive this as a gift off the Amazon wish list.

Well when I moved the pieces many were glued to the black paint and removed the paint from the dark squares.

Over all I like the it, but there are many little tweaks in design that could have made it great. The board is rather large to store. This isn't a pocket chess set. Since they are all the same height it's difficult sometimes to tell a pawn from a bishop. The pieces are close to the same size as the squares and the magnets tend to attract as you move around the board.With all of the complaining it is still a good set and I would buy it again. But if other toy makers read this, it would not be hard make better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor manufacturing quality","review":"There are two major quality problems I have with this set:1. The magnets aren't properly attached to the plastic pieces so they tend to fall off when you move the pieces by lifting them off. I removed each magnet and reattached with hot glue.2. The magnets' rough metal surface scratches the board when you slide the pieces. I stuck little self-adhesive felt pieces to the bottom of each piece to remedy this problem.One minor quibble - the pieces aren't initially easy to tell apart but you get used to that.The magnets are pretty strong - kids can play chess in the car, even bump against it with their knees etc. without the pieces moving.Probably wouldn't buy this again - too much hassle for such a simple item."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great thing, but don't leave it in the car!","review":"I love chess, and have been a student of the game since I was 10, collecting numerous chess books, sets, computers, etc. I should be a grandmaster by now, but how many people have the time for that. My father-in-law gave me this Drueke set as a present. Very nice. I do find the proportions of the pieces to be a bit strange, but the magnets are by far the best ones I've ever seen in a magnetic set. I left this in the car recently during a hot spell, and the plastic case has melted. The board itself didn't melt, so from the outside it looks like a Salvador Dali object. I'll probably replace it, as I feel bad about letting it melt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth $5","review":"Pathetically cheap construction. The magnets are simply slipped onto a plastic extrusion on the bottom of the piece so they simply slide off this post and stay on the board when you move the piece.

Got to wonder if they got a different version of the game than we did.Its nice you can close the lid and later resume your game.What isn't nice is that the paint sticks to the magnets better than to the board surface. The Bishops and pawns are almost identical, and the pieces are ultra cheap (the top edges of the rook break way too easily)Saw a different set at SupernationalsIV for last week for $3 that has all the features of this set, and NONE of the drawbacks. The $3 set was smaller, fits in a shirt pocket, could be closed and game resumed later etc....Also, it doesn't label the ranks and files, so recording your game is more difficult.Not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"very scratched after the first game","review":"I like the fact that the lid fits while the pieces are in place but the board is pretty cheesy and the black squares started scratching off immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the money...an excellent buy...","review":"My son (7) with not-so-great vision recently took up chess but we found that finishing a game was sometimes a challenge...this has turned out to be a perfect way to move the game around.The pieces are small, but even with his less-than-perfect vision, he had no trouble differentiating. The quality seems fine.It is obviously not of heirloom quality and feel - but for the low low price and the ease of portability without screwing up a game mid-play - very well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paint pulls off chessboard","review":"As another reviewer wrote, the paint will pull off when you leave the pieces on the board when you store it.

So many of those tunes, which were great then, would be so relevant today. They're even greater when I listen to them now. \\"Walk in the Shadows\\" has one of the best guitar solos ever recorded. The way Michael and Chris trade off is incredible. \\"Gonna Get Close to You\\" is another great tune. I could go on and on, but I think I'm going to go listen to the cd instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe I waited so long to get it!!!","review":"What was I thinking????? But one listen and this Queensryche fan was hooked... but that is to be expected, no? My fave? \\"I Will Remember\\".

I like the back photos.. I miss those days!!! ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO DID THESE PHOTOS ???!!!!","review":"To listen to this album, you must first throw away the booklet and the back cover of the CD. You just will not believe that QUEENSRYCHE accepted to dress like that, just copying the glam /posers bands that were around America at the time. This single fact alone almost killed the band credibility to me, but they redeemed themselves in OPERATION MINDCRIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCCUMBED TO GLAM","review":"In this album QUEENSRYCHE succumbed to commercial pressures and dressed themselves like POISON or MOTLEY CRUE, producing one of the worst back cover arts I've ever seen !! As for the music, is more along the line of the horrible PROMISED LAND."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird album, but really good.","review":"Rage for Order is my least favorite of the 80's Queensryche's albums, is actually weird, many techno music efects and a strange atmosphere over all. Plus if you add the vampire look of the guys and the super gothic video released for I'm gonna get close to you(actually a cover song) you get what I would called Gothicryche. Still, is a good album with a solid performance and Geoff Tate's voice is here as intense as ever. A good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing. Ryche at their absolute best.","review":"Even back in 1986 when this album came out, it was a masterpiece. Brilliantly written songs, awesome guitar solos, and some really cool synth effects on a couple of tracks all make this album an absolute must for any metal fan. And now, 24-bit Re-Mastered, it sounds so fresh that you'd think it came out last year.The re-mastering was done very well and the 4 extra tracks are awesome, especially the Live version of 'The Killing Words'. Do NOT pass this one up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neue Regal is here!!!","review":"This album is mind-blowing. I first heard it about 10 years ago and I never tire of hearing it. It's a great prelude to Mindcrime and it matches that album in sound and creativity.

It was very much a case of not fully appreciating the style and quality on first listen. Later it grew to be one of my favourite albums. To some people the album may be a wierd combination of operatic metal fused with cyber-metal. Or rather, this album shows how Queensryche moved ahead from a sort of straight-forward operatic sound to something more futuristic.As always, people may disagree with this, but I feel as though this album was on its own as regards its style and is a passing point, sytlistically, from The Warning to Operation Mindcrime.But all that aside, it's just a damn fine album, up there as one of their best, not that I dislike any Queensryche album( at this point in time I haven't heard tribe)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of The Best Games Ever Made","review":"Oni, is one of the best games ever made. It combines revolutionary hand-to-hand combat and 3rd person shooting. Oni has is just challenging enough that it makes you work for the next stage in the game.

This game is absolutely fantastic. No question, BUY IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome game","review":"First, this is GREAT game! Love the story, the character, and the action.Second, you CAN remap the keys. Inside install folder, look for key_config.txt file. Alter the keys listed, save, remapped!Third, the save point system is fine ats the beginnin, buts later the save points are too far aparts.Fourth, and the BIGGEST complaint is thats weapons on ground slowly vanish. Once one weapon is used ups, me would like to swap out to weapon over their... oops, it gone now. *slaps Bungie for BIG design flaw*Fifth, me would likes to carry two weapons.Me nots have game this much fun to play since Syndicate Wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great fighting sequences but lacking overall.","review":"This game is really cool when there are enemies to fight,dynamics are amazing,but most of the time is spent running around opening doors,pulling switchs or activating computers.The plot is very confused as to what your missions are and there is not any variety in the game. Graphics are blocky and all the misssions look the same as do most of the characters in the game,the save game makes you repeat a lot of gameplay and there is no way to remap the keys.Control of your character would be much improved if you could remap the keys,default keys are to far apart and untuitive for fast paced action.On the plus side sound is okay and there are quite a few fighting moves which have been obviously been copied from the Matrix. Final word buy this game for the fights but you will get bored after about 1 hr of play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but Hype","review":"Do not waste your money. Like many before, I agree the game had some amazing fighting and great Character Animation. But other than that the game play is absolutely TERRIBLE. The worst thing about this game is the environment. Other than running around in a box with some Half Life style crates the environments were completely empty, and boring.

I disagree with the fact that it has a bad saving system, and the fact that it is difficult.

It has got to be one of my favorite games i have ever played. The PC or MAC versions are much better than the PS2's. If you want to play this game, a two button mouse is a MUST HAVE. This game has superb graphics, amazing gameplay, and it is very immersive. The only thing wrong is the bad graphics in the cut scenes. They are just the ingame character models. I highly enjoyed this game. I played the demo and was hooked in 15 minutes. I highly reccomend this game to any person who likes fighters.

I'm glad I didn't buy it like I was going to. The premise of the game is good, and I like the animation and graphics, however this game features the worst controls ever. To move your character you use one set of controls forward and back, and you use left and right for orientation. There is no side to side,or Strafing, movement. Aiming weapons is done with the mouse and is all but impossible to do. So if your looking for an easily controlled adventure game this is not it. Hopefully the control setup for the PS2 version of this game will be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"This game is has many things wrong with it. First of all, the controls are some of the worst that I have ever seen. There is no smooth movement in Oni. It is very choppy, making it hard to control your character. Second, the camera angles are horrific: there are parts were the camera decides to zoom and unzoom, especially when fighting and it makes it very hard to see who you are fighting. The graphics are halfway decent but nothing worth looking at. The best thing about this game is that I kept the receipt."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must-have for anime fans","review":"...This game is great! the graphics are sweet, control system is unparalleled, levels are awesome, and you dont even need the cd in your computer to play it!!!if the reason i like this game so much is not the graphics,control,story,characters, or feel. it's the allure of anime, i'm an avid anime fan... and to me this game is a messiah, now, for once, I...

This book was also the basis for an equally revolting episode of A&E Biography about Tony. If you want to know about Perkins' life, watch E!'s 'True Hollywood Story' about him.

It's not the least bit scary, and if it were, it wouldn't matter because we don't care about any of the characters. Jared Moses as Rip is the only decent actor in the bunch, so you just know they gave him the smallest role. Kelli Maroney, in particular, is laughably bad.

Although these are not essential to how the machine works, they certainly reflect the overall quality of the product. Haier should be shamed about the fact that they put out such a shaby product.

I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a basic calculator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oops - Wrong Album","review":"I wrote the review below believing this page referred to After the Flood, vol. 1, which I suspect is no longer in print.Volume Two is, I believe, composed and performed by many of the same performers (notably absent and lamented is Sage's Marc Olsen). Two discs, one more song-oriented, another more ethereal and ambient, comprise the set, which includes several loose-leaf art pieces. The packaging is somewhat irritating, but that's a small complaint compared with the praise I have to give the music. While Volume One had a basement tapes feel to it, this has a stronger studio/producer presence, though the sense of listening in on someone's private despairs and elations still holds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal Overtones","review":"It is imperative for parents to read and discern literature before children do. I give credit to the author for writing a book about deomcracy, but D is for Democracy has subtle liberal undertones (especially in the illustrations). Underneath the surface, the leftist agenda is pushing for Communism...an enemy of Democracy. PARENTS BEWARE! Know what your children are reading. Teach them to love LIBERTY everyday, lest the liberal socialist agenda deceive their minds and continue to pluck away freedom after freedom. Children should long after the American Dream that they can work hard, pursue their dreams, and be whatever they want to be because of the FREEDOM that is unique only to America. Give them the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,With My Rifle By My Side: A Second Amendment Lesson,American Soldier Proud and Free, and great biographies of the Founding Fathers and their families...but please, leave D is for Democracy on the library bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing....","review":"My parents have an old, shady version of this movie, and I've watched it many times.

The outdoor light overcomes the problem of dimness and, really, who cares about distortion?

It's just laugh out loud funny, for both kids and adults. I heartily recommend it. Barbara Parks has a wonderful way with children's dialog.

I don't know why the author found it necessary to have Junie speak so poorly. Although some adults may find bad grammar spoken by kids to be cute, kids rarely do.

I enjoyed the plot of the book and the fact that it is abridged probably cut down on the highly technical details that the reviewers of the hardcover version found difficult or too involved. However, this version also leaves out any Donovan reference and no author's note that many found interesting.Further, the narrator's style did not fit with the characters, at least not as I had envisioned them. In many ways, I felt as if she were a kindergarten teacher trying to do different voices for different characters and exaggerated too much.

I was especially looking forward to seeing Eric find love after so many years. Ms. Lowell's most recent attempts at writing are more reminiscent of her writing as Anne Maxwell than the Elizabeth Lowell we have come to know and love while she wrote for Avon Publishing.

I have waited since Enchanted, for Eriks' story. I was so excited to see this book thinking that it might start off modern, but surely it would go back and tell the story. There were to many characters. There was barely any connection to the original characters. I could careless about the characters in this story. I am really disappointed in this and I think she should have stayed with the historical aspect of the story line. It was hard to follow with so many different characters. To much sub stories that had nothing at all to do with the main story. If you liked Enchanted, Forbidden....Then do yourself a favor and pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very forgettable book","review":"This is the first Elizabeth Lowell book I've read in a long time. I had tired of her books and stopped buying them--all the \\"warrior\\" stuff was tedious, and they were all minor variations on a theme. I couldn't find anything else I wanted to read, and was marginally intrigued by the plot line, so I shelled out the money for a hardback. Silly me! It was a waste of money and my time. Boring book, boring characters, and the standard, boring Lowell style of writing. In fact, it was so boring that I had forgotten I had read it! Searching for a book, I noticed this title on an end table and picked it up, thinking, \\"Oh, I need to finish this book.\\" As I started leafing through, looking for my bookmark, I realized that I had, in fact, finished the book. It was that forgettable. Don't waste your time or money. Lowell is definitely riding on the few earlier publications that were worthwhile, and this is formula writing at its worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Bother","review":"This is my first read/listen of this \\"author\\".

As a romantic suspense (with a hint of history), the romance was a 1, the suspense a 3 and the details of illuminated manuscripts a boring 1. There was very little romantic chemistry between the lead characters and the only thing that redeemed the book was the slightly interesting (if not tidy) ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually awful","review":"I haven't read much of Ms Lowells later works. When I read the early reviews of this book, I thought it would be a great merge of old and new. Don't be fooled, it is a droning story of two modern people that keep hinting about the past. I'm almost finished listening to this tape, and it's taken me more than a month. There is just no reason to keep listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect vacation book","review":"When you read Elizabeth Lowell, you do not expect classical literature.

Moving Target was fun and I had a great time reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Lowell Fan, but......","review":"After waiting so long to get Erik's story, which was already in place from Enchanted, Forbidden, and Untamed, I am greatly disappointed in Moving Target. Even if this story had not been about a \\"re-incarnated\\" Erik and Serena, the reading of it was often tedious due to the excessive description of the Learned Pages. The prologue, which immediately grabbed my attention, and had me on the edge of my seat, was not a reflection of the action that took place in the rest of the story. Personally, I feel that Erik, the learned, still has a story that has been left untold."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is very disappointing","review":"I have read literally every book that Elizabeth Lowell has written, usually on the first day that they come out and all in one sitting. I am a major fan of her work, but had I not seen her name on the dustcover I never would have guessed that this book was her work. The characters were one-dimensional and I never really got to a point where I cared what happened to them. There was never any explanation of the past history between the original Erick and Serena, nor was the Book of the Learned explained. Characters from other Lowell novels were thrown in but their appearance was not fully explained. For the first time ever with a Lowell book I had to force myself to finish reading, and it took me several days to do it. Since I have always loved Elizabeth Lowell's work I am considering this a little \\"bump\\" in the road and eagerly awaiting her next work.

Actually - I feel better just pretending that Erik's story hasn't been told yet than to think it was this piece of drivel! I'm sorry to say but since EL left those books, the Only series and Autumn Lover/Winter Fire behind - she hasn't written a decent thing that has to do with romance! If you want to write suspense or fiction or whatever RIDICULOUSLY descriptive book you want on jade, pearls, rubies, jems, ancient manuscripts, gold etc., etc. then STOP calling them ROMANCE novels! Move into the suspense genre of fiction and stop using the true romance fans out here to buy your books that don't have a THING to do with romance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and a big disappointment","review":"I have not read any of her previous books so I wasn't sure what to expect. I found that I was interested in Selena and Erik's story and Erik the Learned but she didn't often focus on these characters.

Both are well done, but this was better in terms of the well-honed dialogue, plot and historical information on druidism and the art world. Also, there was a very neat, unexpected geneological twist at the end that I didn't see coming! Next on my list is Die In Plain Sight as I eagerly await the NEXT TWO DONOVAN BOOKS (hint hint)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lowell's best in a while.","review":"This book had good, strong characters and a well-developed, interesting plot. Both Erik and Serena were captivating, he as a strong, quiet intellectual, she as a stubborn, self-sufficient loner. She could have been stronger, but Lowell isn't known for her brilliant heroines. SErena might well be the best since JADE ISLAND. The minor characters of Erik's bosses were well-written, adding to the plot and the humor. The plot was evenly paced, though the suspense could have been taunter. It mixed the mystical with the practical, the past with the present in such a way that it kept you guessing. The best part of the book, however, was the Author's Note at the end. Life is sometimes stranger than fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Moving","review":"Generic old time Harlequin romance with missing art tacked on. Derivative: soup cons of Krantz, Roberts; a line about trailer hitches made classic by Willy Nelson in the movie Electric Horseman; Donovans make a cameo appearance in chapter 19.

I've read it - or tried to -and I have absolutely no clue. I was completely lost by the second chapter when the author began her lecture on 'leaves' and 'illuminations' and yada yada blah blah blah... In Moving Target Lowell goes through lengths in trying to impress the readers on the tiniest and quite boring details ancient manuscripts, the making of them, the forging of them, the making of them again and again and again. Erik and Serena become secondary characters to the boring history lesson. We (the readers) don't get the chance to know or understand Erik and Serena as they're development is hindered by the numerous (insignificant) secondary characters and the constant lectures by the author.All in all, I'm sorry I wasted my money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book of knowledge dull","review":"I found the heroine and hero weak. I also found the subject matter confusing. No real surprises in this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read would recommend to all","review":"I found Moving Target to be one of Ms. Lowell's best yet. The book kept my interest from start to finish. I can not wait for her next installment of the Rareties Unlimited series. It is good that she has introduced new characters and brought back some old ones. I love reading anything by Elizabeth Lowell. Keep them coming!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Miriam","review":"I have been waiting for the sequeal to the medieval romance for Eric & Serena, however after reading the reviews I don't believe I have the heart to read what clearly will be a disappointment. PLease consider writing a book during the medieval time, I have kept the triology for 8 years and patiently waiting for the fourth, faithfully devoted reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, a total waste","review":"This book is a total waste of time and money. EL, like other romance authors has insulted her fan base and thumbed her nose at her loyal readers...by going 'mainstream'. I guess what goes around comes around, because instead of the bright spark I've seen in her other works, this books is a dim-bulb.Instead of great writing talent, we get too much information about antiquities, not enough character development, lame 'romance' and yes, I was one of many who wanted to see Eric's story completed. It's the usual, predicatble 'what dunit' and sadly, just is a bore.So, good like EL in seeking your new fan 'base'. I'm outta here."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"Until this book I have never regretted buying anything by Elizabeth Lowell. She repeatedly introduces new \\"characters\\" and then just sorta leaves them hanging there. I got no sense that her main characters were actually people. Everyone in this book is one dimensional. The book doesn't end, it just stops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme diappointment","review":"I am a big fan of Elizabeth Lowell and eagerly anticipated this new book. I did not think I could get through it - what a let- down. This book dealt way too much in reincarnation - that is all the main characters always thought of - example - why does he seem so familiar - why do I feel like I know her. I never felt like I knew these people - it was very hard to feel anything for them. The Donovans were people you cared about - these people I never felt a thing for - they did not connect for me. I sure hope her next book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very \\"fey\\" read...","review":"I'm not a reader of Elizabeth Lowell, but the book jacket grabbed me in the airport because of my love of historical fiction and all things Celtic.... I was disappointed, and LOST most of the time... She chose a very obscure and complicated premise (ancient illuminated manuscripts)and, I think, had a difficult time translating all that she had learned in her research into something understandable to the general reading public. I originally was caught up in the chemistry between Erik and Serena, but that, too, got old. And what's with the overuse of the word \\"fey\\"? Is that the word of the week?"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than Romance","review":"Moving Target rewards the reader with more than suspense and romance. Lowell's books are quite informative on unusual topics. Unlike her others featuring the jewel authority family of Donovans, Moving Target focuses on the world of rare manuscripts. The interesting characters will engage the reader quickly. I could not put this book down until I found out if Serena would find the Book of the Learned. In fact, I finished it in one sitting. I really appreciate an author like Lowell who does her research to make her fiction believable. I only have one question--when is she publishing her next book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Elizabeth Lowell I love to read!","review":"I was so disappointed with Moving Target. I loved the Untamed, Forbidden, and Enchanted books and always wondered why Erik never got a story of his own. When I found out about this book I was so excited. The book just didn't deliver. The characters were not up to her usual standards and the story was no where near as romantic. I'm hoping this is her only book like this. This is the only book I have ever been diasappointed in by her and I have every other book she has written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointing","review":"I have never been so disappointed in an Elizabeth Lowell book as with Moving Target. I have read all of Mrs. Lowells books and this was an absolute let down and in no way did it even come close to the magical and passionate Enchanted, Forbidden, Untamed or any of her other books for that matter. There was too much talk about vellum this and palimpset that, and blah, blah, blah. There were too many characters and too much annoying banter between the sexes. Next to nothing was revealed about what was actually in \\"The Book...\\" or who the characters were. Overall there was too much talk, not enough action, virtually no passion, and generally boring with an abrupt ending. I am very sorry I paid the hardcover price for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"This book could have been a whole lot better. The history of the Book of the Learned was never well-explained, nor was the relationship between the original Erik and Serena. I guess the whole mystical/memory thing between modern Erik and Serena, as well as the importance of the Book as something other than historic art, would have made much more sense to me with a better handling. As it was, neither hero nor heroine were particularly interesting characters. Frankly, Mr. Picky the cat and the afterword about Lowell's trip to Scotland were the best parts of the book.Can we have more Donovans please?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful ending to a great trilogy","review":"If you've read Forbidden, Untouched and poop I can't remember the other one, but they are all about the Learned and the Glendruid Witches...this wonderful modern story links the story of Erik and Serena the Weaver Sorceress to another modern Erik and Serena the weaver. It is wonderful, suspenseful (even I couldn't figure out who the troublemakers were until the end) and steamy. I love her books, and she managed to continue the story of the Learned here too.The only pitfall was dragging in a brief cameo appearance of the players from Amber Beach, Jade Island and Ruby Bayou. It didn't make much sense.Now...if she'd only tell us Niall's story. Hmmmmm."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad book","review":"I hated this book. I have read almost all her books and I think this is the worst book. Some of the people appeared in this story were irrelavent, like the Donovans. The action in the book was boring, and slow-paced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not surprising -- didn't like it.","review":"Sorry -- I can't recommend this book. I have tried to read Elizabeth Lowell many times, and I just can't get into her books. I find the dialogue between her characters boring and/or corny. Attempts at humor are lost on me, and there is little to no chemistry between the main characters. As if this wasn't bad enough, we have to get a school-type lession on different types of collecting (depending on which book you read -- this one is manuscripts). I don't want to know every detail there is to know about this stuff -- a little info. would be fine.

I feel strongly about supporting the software companies making them because they are starting to drop like flies. Still, this program was an insult to flight sims. I think 90% of the budget went into producing the deck scenery - which admittedly is cool, but after that almost everything about this sim is below par. The graphics and flight model are reminiscent of sims I played 10 years ago, yet my PIII still had difficulty producing adequate FPS to get any sensation of flight. Landing on the deck was like a fly hitting fly paper - bazaar! Even a patch won't help this one. Sorry DID.

These films give you both. The only one in the series I have actually seen is the one about the Cubs and Steve Bartman. Being a true Cubs fan that one was of course heartbreaking and intense.

He saw being on top in horse racing as heaven and hell as dealing with his private struggles. In contrast to the stories of Seabiscuit and Secretariat, the euphoria of beating the best or winning the Triple Crown races goes from sweet to bitter in the story of Charismatic and Chris Antley. Both the experiences of the horse and the jockey as individuals and as a team bring emotion to this touching story. If you loved the other stories of triumphant horses, as well as their jockies and owners who were underdogs, you will be touched by this film, but the feelings you will be left with at the end will be quite different. This is another testament to the emotional investment horse racing fans have in the sport and how it can reach out and touch something in even casual race fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slippery tags","review":"Not good for writing with a pen because paper is too glossy.

A book for every parent.","review":"I bought this excellent book for friends who are in the process of adopting a child and found myself unable to put it down. Besides being beautifully written the essays are insightful and personal -- ranging from funny and surprising to heartbreaking stories about love and what it means to be a parent. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"And now you know the rest of the story...","review":"So much of the writing about adoption winds up with the supposed happy ending: We got a child and loved it instantly and created a family, lucky us. But of course that's only the beginning, for any family.The essays in this collection go beyond that Kodak moment to tell us what happened next. What happens if you've promised two birth mothers the stable home they can't provide -- and then your husband tells you he wants a divorce? Can you honor your daughter's ethnic heritage without arranging for her to study Chinese? How do you respond when your 13-year-old announces, \\"I don't hate you because I'm an adolescent who's trying to adjust to the fact that he was adopted. I hate you personally.\\"These accounts, by 20 skilled writers who are also adoptive parents, are sometimes heartbreaking and sometimes comic, but they're always stunningly honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving Reading","review":"As aunt to an adopted niece and grandmother to an adopted grandson, I read these essays with keen interest. The range of issues is fascinating, the breadth of family constellations is impressive and the individual stories are alternately moving, thought-provoking and humorous. I was also impressed by how beautifully each writer told his or her story. I'd recommend this book to any person--adoptive parent, adoptive relative, friend of adoptive family--whose life has been touched by adoption (which I guess these days is pretty much everyone!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly","review":"This was a wonderful insight into the many approaches to adoption and the many ways in which it happens. The authors in this book did not shrink from telling it like it is from their perspectives, and I appreciated the honesty in which they conveyed their adoption stories. No matter what kind of adoption you're going through, there's something in this book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Country Music Lovers....This is one you Gotta have!!!!","review":"This young lady pours her heart and soul into every note she sings.

This album is a compilation of some of their greatest numbers from a variety of their albums, including \\"Love is in the Air,\\" \\"As Time Goes By,\\" and a fantastic version of \\"I'm Confessin'\\". The band shines more at times than others, but the album overall is quite enjoyable. The music accentuates Sam's sensuous jazz saxophone, quite different from the grinding, honking sound he made during his time with Louis Prima. The music also features Sam's trumpeter Buck Monari, who is ever-present on these recordings as Butera was on Prima's. This CD is truly a work of art. Every note is on target, and Butera is still one of the greatest musicians today.

It relies on Old Paradigms in order to describe the New Paradigms. This was so 'formula'....'Hollywood' that the real power of these children was trivialized and contrived.So much potential wasted. Sad. I don't know if it was a lack of money, focus, or pure intention...but so much was lost here.Hoping for a better attempt later by another team."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave new movie","review":"I felt that this movie was a decent first attempt at opening up the subject of Indigo Children for discussion. The movie in my opinion focused on a psychic child and not all Indigo children are psychic. I wish that the child was a better representation of an Indigo Child which Jan Tober and Doreen Virtue have done such a great job explaining in their books. Many people in the audience brought their children to see the movie and it was not a children's movie. This was a brave first attempt to bring this information mainstream.The movie sponsors were selling a CD called Indigo Dreams at this event. I was already familiar with and using this CD with my son. This CD has been a fantastic addition to my childs life. All children would benefit from the meditation and stress management techniques presented in story format on this new CD.

Nothing enlightening going on with this movie. We all have \\"attention deficit disorder\\", as Indigos are claimed to have. Most of us can't look at a candle flame for ten seconds without a thought entering our mind. Lee Carroll will probably continue pacifying his audiences with lies, when the truth may possibly be that some children are agitated from serious, unconscious psychological problems, albeit from past lives. People know the truth when they hear it. That's why Kryon flops and \\"What the Bleep\\" is a phenomenon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Dumb ...","review":"... I don't know any better word to describe it. This DVD is just plain dumb, an insult to the intelligence and spirituality of even the \\"average\\" person.

What I saw was a poorly strung together and acted out drama about an indigo. Nobody attemps to explain anything about the children except that they seem to have something special happening around them.

This piece is not much better than a watered-down, made for TV, Lifetime for women, movie-soap opera. It's cutesy & unrealistic. The child, the teenagers and a lot of the other acting is 2-dimensional and cliche-ridden. It's like watching a bad adaptation of a really good, important story. Indigos deserve better PR than this, not some saccharine, Disneyesque, moralizing, preachy infomercial of a film.

I still have to empty the tank and fight the reset switch.This was my first unit. I have looked at other dehumidifiers and find others offer better systems to drain the water, the water tanks do not have to be emptied manually.I would not recommend this unit.

I checked it one more time in the morning just in case it fixed itself...you never know but still dead as a door nail. So I packed it up and returned it to the place whose returns are from 7:00am to 10:00pm....you could maybe guess where with that info.One more was in stock and it was obvious that it had been returned due to the open box and the adhesive tape removed from the top and back.

I'm returning this unit and will look for something that turns on/off automatically based on a target humidity level, as you might expect a device like this to work.Edit after 5 days of use: This unit started short-cycling and stopped removing any significant amount of moisture from the air, so I returned it.

The unit was running and ticking so loudly I was worried it was going to start a fire in my basement. There also was water leaking all over the floor and out the front air vents on the unit. This is a bad product that gets a lot off bad reviews. Read the reviews on Amazon and consider buying a Soleus. I have one ordered from Amazon and expect to get much better results."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd one that's broken","review":"Absolutely DO NOT buy a Haier!!!

Instead this is a mixed chorus with fairly insipid arrangements, and even though the credits say it has been digitally remastered, there is a tinny quality to the production.I think there are much better Christmas albums you can find, and I will get another CD that has the group I remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes Me Back","review":"This album takes me back to the late 50's, early 60's when I was a child and this was my favorite Christmas album. Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Santa Claus is Coming to Town, all come to life in this wonderful action filled album. One of our favorite songs is Christmas is Coming. The Carols are wonderfully done with the orchestra and choir. I was also pleasantly surprised to see that they kept the original picture and not only printed it for the CD cover, but the CD itself is done in the setting of animated carolers singing outside by a street lantern. I loved it then and still love it now. I bought three. One for myself, and one for my brother and sister. They too are delighted that someone decided to bring back some of the Christmas music for our kids and grandkids to enjoy.

He was a true believer in the Amityville story and tried to convince the Lutzes and another researcher to become involved in a book deal with him so he could cash in on the story.

Material Faith is a collection of journal entries that outline Thoreau's thought process that led to his renowned conclusions.Having written his observations in the mid 19th century, many of Thoreau's scientific understanding seems primitive by today's standards, yet his revelations are timeless. Thoreau explained that, \\"The question is not what you look at - but how you look & whether you see.\\" He indeed saw much about the nature of this world that science neglects.This piece represents only a small portion of Thoreau's philosophy, but it fully delivers.

This album is close to matching the emotion and beauty found in Offerings. It has the beautiful slow ballads that helped put Third Day on the map, and the rock tunes that interest new fans. \\"Get On\\", \\"Forty Days\\", and \\"Come Together\\" are the most uptempo songs on the cd. \\"Come Together\\" being an excellent choice for an opener. The album is slowed down with the lilting \\"Its Alright\\" and \\"My Heart\\". The slower songs having beautiful string arrangements that give a very relaxing atmosphere to the album. The guitar work on the album is superb as is the musicianship by the rest of the artists. Mac Powell scratchy vocals and poignant lyrics continue to \\"wow\\" the masses. Definitely another excellent album by Third Day. Christians will love the album for it truly does capture the grace of worshipping the Lord. Not as good as Offerings, but great nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing! These guys never fail to amaze me!","review":"With Time, and Offerings putting forth such great quality of praise, I never thought Third Day could keep up the same caliber of music for long.

It has such a friendly yet almost wistful feeling to it. Its the kind of song that would sound best when your driving through a lonely desert...something about it is nostalgic. \\"When the Rain Comes\\" is also a beautiful song (with great guitar), while \\"I Got You\\" is more of a classic rock-on type of song. \\"Come Together\\" is a fun one too. A few of the songs do sound rather 'familiar', but I'm sure old Third Day fans will like this. All in all, a strong, solid disc, one that I trust will go far.

Step out of your artificial christian comfort zones, turn on the radio and listen to what real music sounds like. Southern country hick-rock died just after hootie's first album, but apparently Mac Powell didn't take notice.Only in CCM can bands like Third Day put out such crap and still be able to make thousands of dollars. What a joke of a music industry. We need to stop encouraging people from putting out music that belongs in a trailer park.Third Day's first album was okay because trailer trash rock was in back then.

Really, I could have gotten the paperback cheaper and I would have gotten more by getting to see some of the images. There are two Kindle readers in our group and we were more than a little miffed about this exclusion from our books.I say, it's a great read but make it even better and buy the paperback so you can get even more information (i.e. the pictures).

Unlike the recent biography of Lady Hamilton, which was utterly ridiculous yet immenently readable and entertaining, this book is neither of those things and thus kind of boring. Although Crossland has \\"discovered\\" some new aspects of de Chirico's biography, she doesn't really investigate him and his motivations in-depth. Instead of offering insight, the book has a formulaic feeling to it. Furthermore, if you're reading the book for scholarly information instead of entertainment, you're going to be disappointed in that respect as well. This is not a work by a historian or art historian, and it shows. That being said, sadly this is the only full-fledged biography of de Chirico.

The author should refrain from interpreting what motivated the paintings because she seems to have a superficial understanding of what art is really all about.

For example, on page 114, following the death of the painter's mother: \\"When he go back, in 1938, he had intended to have a splendid tomb built ...\\" Fortunately, I bought this book as a remainder and even then paid too much at $16.98.

I think this provides a clue to a more interesting perspective on his work, that his paintings should be viewed as explorations of philosophical mysteries rather than the haunting imagery of dreams. The author also frequently points out that Giorgio de Chirico's paintings bring the real and the unreal together. In a philosophical context, this is not the same as saying they represent the surreal. The only objection I have to this book is that she places too much emphasis on his relationship with women which seems a bit self-conscious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior Biography","review":"This book is written in a comfortable style similar to regular conversation. I applaud Crosland for choosing a familiar style rather than the objective academic scholarly style. She shows all sides of de Chirico and this forms a realistic view of the metaphysical painter.I have also read, Paolo Baldacci's book. I thought his book was the definite source.

Regina no longer feels safe and, just then, in steps the handsome stranger (Wahlberg), to her rescue. This sounds like the original, correct?Well, The Truth About Charlie is that Johnathan Demme (The Silence of the Lambs) should have left Peter Stone's original screenplay alone. This remake is disjointed and badly acted. Newton's performance is weak, Wahlberg is stiff, and halfway into the movie you don't care what the truth about Charlie is....you just want to return the film.Buy this DVD as cheaply as possible, only because it includes a copy of Charade on the flip side.

I had to actually turn off the television, eject the dvd, and return it to the store! Mark Wahlberg is the pastiest, dullest actor to hit the big screen. He was horrific. Horrifying facial expressions, and absolutely no charisma with Thandie Newton (who was actually quite good). However decent Newton's acting, the tricky camera work, and completely stale ideas for bringing \\"artistry\\" to the screen made for a boring film. Tim Robbins was absolutely abysmal. Dull City.

Remaking at all was idiotic never mind the addition of bad actors and gratuitous nudity."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 1 Star is for The Truth About Charlie Not Charade!","review":"I bought this DVD but only for an inexpensive way to get a nice widescreen version of Charade because that classic is included on the B side of the disc and because I can't afford to buy the Criterion Charade DVD. In all honesty The Truth About Charlie is a horrendous movie and I think the director was trying too hard to make some kind of artsy French movie but wound up making a pretentious artsy fartsy mess instead. The director said he let The French camera crew do what they wanted to do and let the American crew do it their way but did he tell them to make sure it all came together flawlessy in the end? apparently not and it showed as this movie was very uneven and disjointed! Watch the original instead or watch an actual French movie that this movie is trying to imitate!

A total waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie made me want to vomit...","review":"The only sort of alright thing about this movie was Thandie Newton. But even she didn't do justice to Audrey Hepburn's Regina. And Mark Wahlberg just doesn't have the charm, poise, or presence that Cary Grant brings to the screen. Most of the best, witty, and funny dialogue between Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant was cut from this remake. The Truth About Charlie just doesn't have the heart or pacing that Charade had. I couldn't even watch the entire movie.If you want to see a funny and witty mystery movie that keeps you on your toes see Charade. Skip The Truth about Charlie, its a waste of time!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truth About this Movie is that......... it Sucks","review":"Where do I begin? Well for starters the poor dialog, the complete lack of any plausible plot line, and the absence of acting talent. This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen.

It was hardly an adaptation and then boring to boot! Don't waste your time in renting or buying this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"My husband and I just watched this movie yesterday and both agreed that it was terrible. I have seen (and loved) Charade previously, but he had not and we both did not like the movie for the following reasons:1. The Chemistry between Walberg and Newton was non-existent. You kept asking yourself during the movie, why do they like each other, and why do I care what happens to them.2. The constant close-ups on people's faces was annoying.3. Charlie's crazy mother was a bizarre addition that was not entertaining.4. The plot dragged along and seemed to go nowhere. There was no suspense. Tim Robbins appeared to be suspicious and guilty the entire time. And when they all go out dancing together, you wonder why Newton is scared of any of them.I could go on, but those were the main reasons we didn't enjoy the movie. Watch Charade instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it for the Charade bonus disc.","review":"TTAC was a bold remake, but missed everything that made the original so charming. The sexual tension and age difference between Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn made the screen light up. If George Clooney had played the Mark Walberg role it could have been salvagable. If you like slow, French impression films or are a film student, you might appreciate the pacing and lack of important dialogue. Otherwise, stick to the classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't beat the original item","review":"Get this for the original \\"Charade\\". \\"The Truth About Charlie\\" is that the characters are all wooden and boring. The \\"actors\\", with the exception of the French, act like they just want to get the thing over with and get out of town. \\"Charade\\" could have been remade into a great modern version ala \\"Ronin\\" or \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". This turkey is dead boring though. The DVD I received was trashed on the Charlie side with some sort of clear spray that caused the movie to skip and stop. Whatever the substance was it would not even come off with glass cleaner. The \\"Charade\\" side fortunately was flawless like the original film. I purchased this item through Amazon from another company as new. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the original, but it's still an exciting movie","review":"For a remake, this was not a bad movie. I liked the twists and turns in the plot and I thought some of the acting was good. Thandie Newton was sweet, yet sexy. Mark Wahlberg was tough but at times quite gentle. Christine Boisson was fantastic as the detective. The Tim Robbins character was incredibly boring. Of the villains, only the female character kicked butt and the other two were lame. The shots of Paris in the rain rocked, leaving me homesick for the City of Lights. The soundtrack is outstanding and I've reviewed it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Play side B","review":"I don't know what is wrong with Jonathan Demme lately: why is he only remaking films that don't need to be remade? The difference between Charade and The Truth about Charlie shows the difference in filmmaking techniques over the years. Films have gotten more slick, more glossy, and more realistic-looking. They have also lost a lot of charm, wit, and intelligence. The plot of Charade was hard to follow, but I still have no idea what happened in The Truth about Charlie - and I'd seen the original. The craft of screenwriting was declined notably over the years: dialogue has gotten bad and plots have become incomprehensible. I will not pick on Mark Wahlberg for not being Cary Grant - that's too cheap. The cast in this film is YOUNGER - apparently because one must be young to be a film star in this day and age.The best thing about the DVD however is that it contains the original movie Charade on the other side - it is worth owning for that reason alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"the truth is a charade","review":"Do yourself a favor and save your money. This is a poor remake of \\"Charade,\\" which was charming movie with Cary Grant and Audry Hepburn, with a few notable supporting players, including Walter Matthau. Re-cast the original, coarsen the language, add some more gratuitous violence, eliminate the chemistry, and you have The Truth About Charlie. No matter how earnest the acting, it is once again proof that Hollywood can do nothing but remake and ruin (think: Sabrina). Interesting as a last-minute or date diversion, but stay home and rent the original if you want warmth, charm, and a fine good guy/bad guy/ guessing game."},{"rating":"1","title":"IN A WORD? AWFUL!!!!!","review":"You're telling me that this drech is supposed to be a remake of the classic film Charade?Gee, that sure was lost on me, since The Truth About Charlie bears about as much resemblance to that GOOD film as Audrey Hepburn does to Rosie O'Donnell.Badly written, badly made, BADLY ACTED & a total waste of time & money.Thandie Newton is cute as button, I'll give the other critics that & ONLY that, but even SHE can't save this tripe from itself.Mark Wahlberg is supposed to be Cary Grant? Yeah, ok.Maybe the casting director would also like to use Roseanne Barr to play Grace Kelly, if there is ever an onscreen bio.And, hey, I like \\"Marky Mark\\", but ALL of the the actors in this film should have spent their time making something worthwhile & moreover, worth watching.Oh and the gimmecky cinematography is nothing more than than an annoyance.And amateurish to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmally bad.","review":"The Truth About Charlie is a remake of 1963's Charade, starring Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant. Charade isn't a masterpiece, but it's a fun lark of a movie, with the captivating chemistry of its two stars and a witty script by Peter Stone its main assets.Unfortunately, even if The Truth About Charlie weren't a remake of a well-remembered classic, it would still be a truly awful film. Apparently, the cinematographer forgot his tripod, cuz the camera shakes and quivers in his arms as he swirls around the two leads--Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton, who have zero chemistry and not a single witty line to deliver--making this flick the first movie in a long time that made me bolt the theater in revulsion.Save yourself the effort and just rent the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"tortuous but recommended","review":"The whole movie is a tortuous experience just like the storyline then the last two minutes brightens visually and the mood does a complete turnaround just like the Korean's face. Tortuous includes Mark Wahlberg's trademark menacing and guilty face, Thandie Newton's unsmiling face with overplucked eyebrows, Paris looking dirty, rundown and exhausting, the camera moving in too close and the background looking too crowded. We, the audience, are intentionally made to suffer along with the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't mess with classic cinema.","review":"I am not a movie critic by any means, but I have always felt that re-makes and sequals are tricky business at best, and some films can never be equalled, such is the case with Charade, I think any attempt to remake it will fail in some catagory and this one sure did for me anyway.The flim is uneven, and at times seems to be too tongue in cheek. The characters are ok, and Tandie Newton does bear some physical resemblance to Audrey Hepburn, well she does a little. Mark Wahlberg is ok as the stranger who comes to her aid, or so it seems, and then there is TIm Robbins as a mysterious government like official, but still it seems like this movie got to a good start and then the script blew away and they said well just wing it. Like I said, im no Siskel, or Ebert, but I know a good film when I see it and this one didnt hit the mark for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY DID THEY BOTHER","review":"Sometimes when a director wins an Oscar, as Jonathan Demme deservedly did for SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, it seems that they decide to indulge their own fantasies. Is that the case with TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE? I don't know, but the end result is a real mess. Inspired by the Cary Grant/Audrey Hepburn CHARADE, CHARLIE never really kicks into gear and the performances are all pretty mundane and uninspired. Thandie Newton rolls her eyes and smirks a lot; Mark Wahlberg seems completely out of place and disinterested; and Tim Robbins might as well wear a flag saying DON'T TRUST ME. Add the cameos by Charles Aznavour which come out of the blue completely, a dizzying music video direction style by Demme and a slow, tedious plot and you end up with CHARLIE. Truly a misfire for all involved. Stick with CHARADE and Henry Mancini's timeless score."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorite movies","review":"For those that love classical movies, this review is not for you. Watch the original. For those of you who, like me, find the old \\"classics\\" slow and contrived, this is the fast-paced modern version you should watch. Its got a touch more realism (but still an escapist adventure), a much better soundtrack, and a cast that I found to be more interesting across the board. Hepburn is too haughty, Grant is too old for her, and both the bad guys and the Paris police are more fun in the new one. The original, while very well-written, still comes off a typical Hollywood 60s product. The remake, an edgy take on a clever story with great twists, is superior. Its a shame everyone else reviewing on here seems to be classical fans looking for the same old product."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one atrocious movie","review":"Where do I even begin?

I watched this without knowing it was a remake. After about 20 minutes I could see a thin plot of Charade popping out. This film was a bore and really annoyed me. I kept wanting Cary Grant or someone nearly as good looking to come on the screen. Mark Wahlberg was a bore and lacked the romance/grace of Cary Grant. Some movies should never be remade. I love Charade. It would have been good to know it was a remake. I only watched it to the end to see how badly they could butcher Charade."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie I've seen in years (maybe decades)","review":"The only reason this film deserves one star is because the DVD includes \\"Charade\\". Do yourself a favor and watch \\"Charade\\" and skip \\"The Truth About Charlie.\\" This is honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is laughable, the directing is a mess, the cinematography is terrible, the editing is inconsistent, and even the soundtrack is lacking. The only decent thing is the plot, but all the other elements of the movie are so distracting that the impact of the plot is completely lost. Which is why you should just watch \\"Charade\\" and scratch the heck out of the other side of the DVD with your car key in case you're ever tempted to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You know what's wrong with this film?EVERYTHING!","review":"You can tell the Hollywood is clearly losing ideas on what movies to make next.After the ... awful remakes of both Psycho and The Time Machine,they decided \\"Hey,howabout we remake another classic film.\\"This time the remake is the old 1963 classic \\"Charade\\" staring Cary Grant and Aurdrey Hepburn,the remake is called The Truth About Charlie,staring Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton and the truth is this movie is one big mess from the start ... and the only thing good about this DVD is that you get Charade on the second side.Take my advice and watch the original instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired and boring!!!","review":"The Truth About Charlie, a lackluster remake of \\"Charade,\\" about a Parisian widow menaced by a gang of crooks, is uneven and uninspired.

Another thing that is funny, woman in the Calhoun family seem to fall in love very quickly. Come on, it took less than a week in COURTING CATHERINE. Unrealistic, unimaginitive. I am glad though, that Ms. Roberts managed to squeeze in a bit of the mystery that she often adds to her best sellers. I can't say that the Calhoun Women series got a great deal of that spice that makes her best sellers, but it trickled in. Great job on MONTANA SKY, DIVINE EVIL, THE REEF, The Templeton series, and the Ireland series.

Sadly, the director has limited skills, and the supporting cast is just so-so. But, Willem Dafoe more than makes up for these flaws with an astonishing portrayal of an ancient, cranky vampire who is vain enough to want to be a movie star, and ordinary enough to be willing to suck the blood out of ferrets in return for being the center of attention on a movie set.Is Dafoe's performance Oscar-worthy?

There are only two good things about this movie! The acting is very very good, and the plot is much more original than in ordinary vampire stuff.And that's all!

As other have said, the acting is great, and has some fairly good humor, and comments nicely on what is real vs. illusion. Unfortunately, the narrative is muddled, scenes are poorly edited, and some lighting is absolutely terrible. I was easy to forgive these shortcomings, but with ending scene I had lost all hope that this film has any redeeming qualities.

I've seen Nosferatu several times before, and I tell you: it's nothing special. So, why bother making a movie about how it was made? In fact, nothing in Shadow of the Sleep is true. Hey, remember the wife of Bram Stoker sued the makers of Nosferatu for copyright infringement and won the case which caused the company to go bankrupt? Now, the makers of Ed Wood can do the same too for Shadow of the Sleep. I am a big fan of Willem Dafoe, but this is okay. But John Malkovich? Yech!

Max Shreck in Nosferatu had a bizarre, creepy, rat-like appearance.Dafoe just has the wrong face for the part. I don't know what it is. Also the script is not very interesting. Even Malkovich, one of the greatest actors of our time, seems to phone his performance in. And Eddie Izzard seems miscast as a very dull character.

The rest of the cast also performed well, including Udo Kier, who has come so far from the camp/trash Andy Warhol horror flicksFlesh For Frankenstein / Blood for Dracula 2 DVD Set Criterion PAL. I enjoyed watching him as much as Dafoe! But John Malkovich, plays John Malkovich. His acting here as in most of his movies is worst than Udo Kier in the Warhol films. By no means let this stop you from buying this movie because, not even Malkovich's terrible acting can ruin it. If you haven't seen Nosferatu with Max SchreckNosferatu (The Ultimate Two-Disc Edition), it's a must that you see it first to appreciate Shadow fully. It's as important to the enjoyment of the film as seeing Plan 9 From Outer Space before watching Ed Wood. Then see Klaus Kinski in Werner Herzog's 70's remake of NosferatuNosferatu: The Vampyre/Phantom Der Nachtfor another perfect performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This movie is working with the premise that Max Schrek, who played the vampire in the classic Nosferatu really was a vampire. The premise works and does so brilliantly. Malkovich is more frightening than the vampire as he plays a man so hell bent on making the perfect vampire movie that he has no problem with risking the lives of his crew, especially his leading lady to do it. William Dafoe plays a vampire so old that he can barely remember life as a man and he is stunning, especially in his monolouge on the movie set. Both he and Malkovich should've won Oscars for their peformances.

I didn't find it to be scarry, but it's two great characters played by Willem Dafoe and John Malkovich are trully captivating. This is a low budget vampire movie compared to Dracula(Gary Oldman).John Malkovich played renowned film director F.W. Wurnau who wanted to make the ultimate and realistic vampire movie. He casts a myterious actor Max Schreck(played brilliantly Dafoe) to play the vampire. There is no character research or preparation for Max prior to filming, because he happens to be a real vampire! Things on the set gradually go from smooth to scarry when Max started to misbehave and disobey Wurnau....John Malkovich is very good as an eccentric perfectionist. Willem Dafoe's portrayal of the vampire is mesmerizing, and definitely one of his career best roles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would someone please keep Willem Dafoe away from me.","review":"Wow. This was a tremendous story. Willem Dafoe is really convincing while Malkovich is great as the success driven director.In this film, we see an amoral movie director(Malkovich) who has hired a real life vampire(Dafoe) to star in his newest film. Of course, the vampire just won't cooperate and things steadily become worse until finally, a violent showdown ensues.As for Dafoe, he is simply devilish. He looks and acts the part of Nosferatu perfectly. This is a great vampire movie and contains some morbid elements of humor. Hope you enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quirky but enjoyable film","review":"This is probably the kind of movie that you will either like or not. Don't expect to be terrified by it, because it wasn't supposed to be an excruciatingly frightening movie. There were however, some extremely funny parts between John Malkovich as the director and William Dafoe as Count Orlock, and the acting at times seems as if it's really happening. This movie is definetly a must see for anyone who is looking for something a little different, a little freaky, and very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left it smiling...","review":"When you put Willem Dafoe, John Malkovich, and Eddie Izzard all in one movie, it's bound to be good. And this film does not dissapoint. Its a little like watching something on the History Channel in it's mockumentary style story- a serious spoof of sorts- presenting the behind the scenes story of the great classic German film Nosferatu.

Dafoe's character is downright comic. Let me take that back, he's ATTEMPTING to be comic. He's not funny. The sad part is he isn't even scary. Malkovich is unconvincing as Murnau playing the stereotypical egomanic director. The fake accents and bad \\"recreations\\" of scenes from original silent film really put me off.If I worked in the film industry, I might have enjoyed this film. As it was, I felt like it was a series of \\"inside jokes\\" and I was not an insider.I suppose I need to attend film school or something to appreciate this film.

This was frustrating as I would have to stop reading and return to the beginning of the chapter to find the speaker.There were some great scenes throughout the book but not enough to keep my interest. I simply didn't care enough about characters to find out how things turned out in the end"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"I could appreciate the plot of this book, with me being single and having single friends. But I felt like the characters were so sterotypical of black characters in all the all black books...you always have that one that is gorgeous but is a \\"hoe\\" and has many men taking care of her. Then you have the really smart one, who is career driven but thinks she's really above everyone else and then the one with the baby daddy....I had some semi respect for Vivian, when she started working on herself, FOR herself, but then she went backwards and ended upwith her baby daddy anyway....I was dissapointed, and glad that I didn't buy this book!

The wireless capability is great and works well for me both at home and at work. There are three things that keep me from giving it a 5 star rating: 1)the documentation (what little there is) is pitiful--Handspring provided an excellent PDF-based manual; 2)you can't buy the accessories most places--Best Buy, Circuit City, Office Depot, etc. I guess that's what Early Adopters face!; and 3)you have to be very careful to seat the unit properly in the cradle on the first try. If you don't, you'll have to reboot and try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"breaks easily, can't be repaired cheaply","review":"I purchased an HP IPAQ 4155 several months ago and was initially impressed with its functionality and power. However, the touch-screen fractured shortly thereafter, rendering it useless. I don't recall placing any stress on the screen or striking it, but it fractured while sitting in my pocket in its 'protective' case. Very fragile. The replacement touch screen cost $85 (I was just replacing the touch screen, not the LCD itself)! My trouble was only beginning. I am a trained computer technician, but I could not even OPEN up the damn unit to replace the touch screen without the case breaking into pieces. What a rip-off. They purposefully designed the unit so that you have to buy a new one if anything breaks, or send it in to HP so they can charge you an arm and a leg. I will not buy another HP product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best pda I've owned","review":"I switched from palm OS to the iPAQ and am happy with every aspect of this great PDA.

Cracked Screen","review":"I agree with an earlier review, that this product has some reliabliity issues. The screen seems to crack on it's own. I was bending over and the pda slipped about 12inches out of my pocket and cracked the screen (in the protective case). If you are going to spend this much money on something, it seems rediculous to not come with some kind of way to protect the screen. I used to have a Sony TG50 and I dropped it all the time. It took a licking and kept on ticking. It makes me miss my Sony TG50 that came with a protective covering.

The 4155 never worked--the only screen that ever appeared was the alignment screen. Due to the holidays, I didn't get around to calling HP Technical Service until Jan 8. HP confirmed that the 4155 didn't work and told me that it could be repaired but not replaced because it was more than 30 days since the purchase date(35 days after receipt).HP TA said that the case had to go to Customer Relations to appeal for a new one.Hearing nothing by Jan 21, I called and HP said no customer relat no. was available & to wait one more week to hear from them.

Previous HP palmtops that I've owned have been sturdy and could handle being dropped even in parking lots. I accidentally dropped the iPAQ 4155 in my house two months after purchase. It shattered. I had made the mistake of not purchasing an accidental damage warranty ($100/year).

I have wifi in my home and it connects to it without a hitch. I also have a Pharos BT GPS device that works great with it. It uses com 6 though, despite everyone saying its supposed to use com 8. The IRD is a problem on this ipaq becuase its on the bottom of it! You have to turn it upside down to use the IR. I downloaded TV Remote controller from pdawin, which works fine, but I have to turn the h4155 upside down to use it, and it only sends a signal up to 5 feet and has to be in line of sight. I love everything else about it. The colors are good, and I have not noticed a yellow tint that others speak of. The sound quality is pretty good also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screen Breaks and it will.","review":"All the good reviews are from people that have just purchased this item. Wait till the screen breaks by its self.I have owned 5 ipaqs, starting with the Aero and going all the way to 4155.One day I looked at my ipaq and it had a crack on the screen about 1 inch long. I knew immediately that the crack will grow and it did.The unit has never been dropped or mishandeled. Its does not even have a scratch on it. I am a person that uses a super fine tip fiber tip for my regular writing and never exert any pressure on the pen, letalone the stylus.The crack came by its self and now the repair costs are in excess of 180 $.After reading all the people that have broken their ipaq screens I am thinking of filing a class action law suit against HP. They should provide free screen replacements to their customers.

I sent it to the service, but after one month! they gave it back to me and told me that it is not possible to repair it, or the cost will be more expensive than buying a new one. So I spoke with Hewlett-Packard, and they assigned my case to a \\"customer advocate\\", but that person is a real HP advocate who told me \\"HP products doesn't fail..\\"??So I have a nice US$700 pocket pc that doesn't work.

The thing to realize here is that this is an interesting work of international relations theory. The work is great in its methodology and presents relevant and unique empirical findings (unlike some/many of the recent academic work on the democratic peace).

Not even close!","review":"I really disliked this book. I stuck it out until the end and was rewarded with an ending that made me throw the book aside and sigh. The writing style is pretentious and the so self-conscious. The character development was uneven. There was no continuity in the story, dialogue or characters. I often enjoy non-linear stories but this one was a dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not a rollercoaster - it's more like a slomo carjacking","review":"This fantastic narrative of the very privilaged life of a cluelessly happy man, his conniving wife, and their life long friends tells you from the begining that disaster has already struck. The narrator then draggs you back to the begining of their story and takes you through their life, ever moving slowly forward to that inevitable end. I could not put down the book in suspense as to how their lives would play out. It was really really great - teasing and suspenseful without being overly so."},{"rating":"1","title":"hate to say it, but confusing drivel","review":"I don't know if the other reviewers read the same book I did, but this book slogged through random descriptions that seemed to go nowhere, tried to make a point about these people's lives that never really came to anything for me. It messed around in terms of timeline, jumping all over the place with no real effect except confusion. I got to the end and still didn't really get the point. All the characters seemed either clueless, or cruel, or otherwise extremely hurtful to everyone in their lives. In his twisted way the narrator tries to get us to forgive them for this, but in my case fails. I would not recommend that anyone take the time with this book getting to the end, and hoping, like I did, that somehow it would come together. You'll get to the last page and be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIT OUTDATED.","review":"I bought it to try and rescue data and pictures from an old broken nokia phone. It did not work as described by the manufacturer. The instructions clearly state that a \\"free\\" software download is needed from the nokia website. This is where I explain (outdated).

And I now have to pay s/h both ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing here for developers","review":"If you are looking to learn RIAs and are coming from a non Flash background skip this book. There is absolutely nothing here about the huge differences between developing Flash apps and developing in more conventional application environemnts under say, Java, or C#. Even basic things like structuring code (on frames, or central, use of timeline) are glossed over completely. There is no mention of the new Flash MX Pro 2004 screen or forms. There isn't even a discussion of preloading issues and transition between user interfaces. Over all I only found one useful thing in the book, and that would have been found just by doing a better read of the macromedia documentation. Very disappointing. This book is a big reason I try not to buy online. Had I leafed through this at a store I would have not brought it home."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"This book was very disappointing.

It is the only book that I returned out of some dozen and a half books that I bought in the past year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy..","review":"This book did not meet my expectations at all,I own 30 other Flash books and this was the first real disappointment.Not that it is badly written, I like the style,it's just that the content doesn't get me what the title suggest;the largest part of this book is about project managment, good practices, debugging etc,instead I was hoping to find some real examples with sourcecode explained,how to code RIAs, which components to use, what the new Classes are for and how to write my own for these RIAs;this is sometimes touched, but never fully developed.Also, the inclusion of 2 entire chapters on Flash Com might be very interesting for some;I skipped these coz I don't know of any affordable hosting for a personal website which features this with their hosting plan..No need to learn a technology if you can't use it (and forget localhost, what good is an app' on your local comp when it's s'posed to be on the internet..).It's a nice read, just not usefull enough from a practical point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Approach","review":"My view after reading this book is as a beginner it offers an insight to the world of flash and taking it to the next level. I tended to focus on certain chapters I required for projects I was working on and avoided reading from start to finish and to be honest got what I wanted. It put the ideas into my head and gave me a starting block to build on. It is not one of these 'tell you everything and work word for word tutorials' and I use it in conjunction with other books but all in all has helped a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"who is this for??","review":"I'm not sure yet where this book lies in the spectrum of Flash books out there. This book seems to be targetted at the somewhat intermediate or experienced Flash user - which is where I am with Flash. But doesn't hit that mark. It doesn't tell you much about RIAs, actionscript, or Flash 2004, the things an experienced user wants to learn. It certainly doesn't cover anything to interest the intermediate to advanced Flash user, all of whom could probably circle the author in knowledge (or at least what this book leads you to believe). Yet it isn't for the beginner either, who would have no use for this book either.So I've really come to the conclusion this book isn't for most, which is where the rating comes from (that, and some mistakes/holes). Overall, I just see this book as a weak offering overall. I think it was just to rush a title on the market before the other books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice chain","review":"I like the weight of this chain.

It's highly recommended to the casual reader, those interested in small town New England society plus those who enjoy first class writing for its own sake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening and useful","review":"The book is excellent in giving some insight into what makes Japan what it is. The author describes the complexities of its society, as well as, the richness of it. He analyzes step by step each factor of consideration that has shaped the Japan we perceive,as well as, the one we do not. He comments on the success of the Japanese, their economy and on the sacrifice and hardship the Japanese had to deal with, etc. The book is useful and of interest to any student of Japanese culture, student of business looking for some reference material regarding the Japanese people and its economical success, but also interesting for a businessmen or person planning to travel for pleasure or business to this country. I consider this book a must for anyone interested in this country and its people."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Seasoned Runners Only","review":"This book is not helpful for people taking up the sport of running for the first time in their 50's.

It doesn't fit will with other books in this series, such as Strength Training Past 50, which is perfect for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"This book explained complex concepts about running in a very easy to understand way. When talking about hydration, soft-drinks, caffeine ingestion, it explained pros and cons in a very lucid way. Best feature of the book is the anecdotal stories of many inspiring 50+ runners. It's a great read and hard to put down. I am a fitness runner, not a competitive runner but this book talking about old competitive runners doesn't bother me at all. Even though I wasn't good at distance running when I was young I admired those who excelled. Understanding the mindset of elite master runners helps me plan my running career after 50. Some day I will race even though it's not my current goal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Saver","review":"Wow...what a help.

When I tried to use it to eject a small pill, the pill never left the gun when I pressed the plunger all the way--it just stayed stuck in the gun end.

And yes, Ms. Forden provides some historical facts. But remember, this is a book. It should be readable. Ms. Forden's constant and trivial inclusion of far too much 'stuff' is more annoying than enlightening.This book could be condensed into 200 pages. Thoughtfully written and entertaining by someone other than Ms. Forden. It is a laborious task to tread through the boring an completely unnecessary details. Ms. Forden, no one cares about the work history of then-Head-of BergdorfGoodman.Poorly written, this book is one long magazine article. Paragraph after paragraph of unnecessary filler. I suggest you find some other way to capture the history of the Gucci company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just a Business Book","review":"This book is a surprising fast paced book that reads more like an unauthorized tell all scandal book then one dealing with the business world. It is just a fun book to read. There is a good amount of history that does not take away from the story (as sometimes to much dull history can). The author got the mix right. It also gave me a lot of insight into the fashion world that I really was not looking for, but was interesting all the same. Keep in mind that part of the focus of this book is the business that has been built up; it is not just details of the family. A good effort by the author and one worth reading if you are interested in the topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"This was a great book! It was so hard to put it down.

It was one of those books that had an interesting basic storyline, but unfortunately, was written more like a reference book at times. I felt that the author did a great deal of research and wanted to stuff all the facts into the book, whether or not they were relevant to the main story (or at all interesting). This made it tedious at times. I seem to remember too many trivial details bogging things down. I'm afraid I was bored. I commend the author for the hard work. I just wish it had been a more focused effort on making it an interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I found this book to be so tedious, filled with unnecessary details and way too many characters.

Written with by someone who clearly understands business and corporate law, so be prepared for a lot of technical and legal terms. It is a good read if you are interested in fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"And you thought the Ewings were dysfuncional in Dallas?!","review":"This is a true tale of the Gucci family/business and how it came to be sold to a multi-national corporation. It is also a true-crime murder mystery. The book was obviously an enormous undertaking - just look at the long list of interviews! It is very interesting and informative, but could have been better organized. It is akin to Gucci under the 2nd generation : disconcerting , flip-flopping madly to and fro from one thing to another, and one time frame to another.The author's c.v. includes fashion/business correspondence at Women's Wear Daily and this basis is apparent in her writing. In the course of the Gucci family saga, she incorporates detailed descriptions of offices, houses, furnishings, attire and cuisine at meetings, etc.There is an essential family genealogy tree on the frontispiece and accompanying photos of the major players. The index in the back is also quite useful as a \\"memory refresher\\" as one perseveres through this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rodolfo's teaching","review":"I'm from Taiwan so I read Chinese translation. My opinion just focus on Rodolfo's teaching his son, Maurizio, just gave him small cash to avoid spending unlimited. However, he didn't thought they were a rich, famous family, whatever they eat or wear, they used the best. Not like poor family children, he didn't feel what's wrong to spend money in luxury way.I think why Maurizio couldn't control using because of this, he couldn't ask money in the face of his father but his friend and Louis, they could lend him. As long as he take the authority, his weakness show on cash flow immediately. If he had a brother like Roy Disney, maybe the result is different.I think it's a problem for some family, which parents was born from poor but their children live wealthy life to teach them how to cherish or the meaning to use proper money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"This book was very dull.

But it stunk on my mom and daoughter too! So, now I am researching the smelly Splash product on line and see that more ladies think also like me: the new Jean Nate Splash STINKS.

The firming body lotion is wonderful. Clean and refreshing the way Jean Nate' use to be. I have written Revlon several times and they said they changed the formula 2 or 3 years ago with no explanation as to why.

The new formulation is simply awful. I've given it several tries, and end up scrubbing it off each time, so bad is it. I loved the classic. It was an amazing product - fresh, uplifting, with a truly urbane, sophisticated lemony note that belied its affordable cost. I knew I could always go into a drug store, and find this wonderful staple. I've had many compliments wearing this. I would always get an appreciative reaction from my husband on smelling it on my hair. I'm so disappointed in the new 'Original' formulation. It's actually kind of nauseating - a sort of cinnamon note mixed in with the lemon verbena. How in the world did Revlon come up with something so bad? 'Banal' would have been a better formula option than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"They changed the scent - phew!","review":"I've loved Jean Nate for years.

The Old Jean nate Splash that I used lasted all day and into the AM I could still smell traces of it on my wrists.The new Splash is offensive, it acutally made my stomach turn after I had it on awhile.

I don't care what some of the novice listeners of this album may say, Barrett's mix of, at times, surrealist psychadelica and times of straight ahead folk rock merely show the range and breadth of this maddened genius' poetic expanse.

It has that kind of elusiveness, where you like it, and then again, not really, but then you know there's something there, and by the time you're on your 3rd listen, you're hooked. Same thing with the Smiths and Robyn Hitchcock, but this album is, I feel, a little better than all of that. ha! Wonderfully arranged song structures that have the perfected craftsmanship I-know-what-goes-where of the Beach Boys and the Beatles without being overly casual as Guided by Voices are. Kind of like the perfect balance between the perfectionistic virtues of a classical Chinese poet and the prolific brilliance of Shakespeare.

As for Mr. EuphoricPossum (who doesn't even spell genius right), all I have to say is, Roger and Dave TOGETHER, couldn't have written a better album than The Madcap Laughs. Criminy! They couldn't have even come close to the greatness exhibited in No Man's Land (one of the album's weaker moments, albeit still a lyrically and musically impressive track.) I'll GLADLY take this over anything Floyd did after the closing lyrics of Jugband Blues! It all turned to crap after A Saucerful of Secrets.

Before you cat lovers all get upset about this remark, let me explain. According to Bailey the majority of cat behavior is rather simple, basic needs for safety, exploration, food, etc. Cat behavior is also rather simple: tail up or down, rub off scent, etc. This makes portions of the book repetitious. This is not a complaint. It is better to be truthful and a little bland than to invent a bunch of human response and lay those on the cat.All in all it's a good book and worth owning.

I knew what his characters were going to be doing pretty early on. Thought the whole reason why the doctor chose that family as about the stupidest reason ever. I enjoy dogs. I really do. How come though it seems in half of his books they are always the smartest? Also, why do they always have to be retrievers? Ok Mr Koontz, I get the idea, you like retrievers! What about a German Shepard, even a poodle? Maybe even another animal? I did like the Skeet character. It was about the only original thing in this story. For a really good book by Mr Koontz, see Strangers. It had many of the same elements with a better story line...END"},{"rating":"2","title":"a huge improvement over the last several books","review":"I absolutely hated the Moonlight Bay books and Sole Survivor.

The villian of this novel is the most intersting character in the whole book and you begin to wonder how our heros, Martie and Dusty Rhodes, will defeat their adversary and survive. This is a book worthy of not only die hard Koontz fans but will entertain new readers who have never read any of his works.

When I finally began it I wasn't able to put it down. His ability to deeply define his characters while sucking you into the story is something that you can find in his novels such as Phantoms, Dark Rivers of the Heart, Watchers, and Lightning but False Memory is a new high for him. You have to find out what will happen to the characters because you begin to feel a connection with them. I STRONGLY recommend this book to ANYONE who enjoys fastpaced novels with twists, turns, and surprises."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a real thriller","review":"It is a real thriller. The writing is good, the characters are engaging, I'm really enjoying it.Dean Koontz is a great writer. He really cares about his readers.(wink).Not only is this an intriguing thriller (I'll admit I listened to the audio book - time isn't what it used to be) - but it contains, or suffices, as a review of the Manchurian Candidate that makes you want to read that book as well, and a good, fast-paced, entertaining story with - while not suprising in any way - a solid, happy ending.Gotta love them retrievers.So - wherevery you are, Dean Koontz -- \\"I'm listening.\\"Mark Ehriman"},{"rating":"1","title":"False Memory","review":"After reading Watchers I was hooked on Koontz and made him my number one author. I have read everything published under the name Dean Koontz and I found this to be the worse book to date. I felt is if Koontz was filling in space with a lot of unnessary babbage. The book was very hard to read and not at all interesting. This book could have been written in less than 100 hundred pages. Since I buy all of his (Koontz) books in hardcover (those that are published in hardcover) as I did this one, I am truly disappointed and feel as if I've been jipped. I only rated it a 1 star because a 0 rating was unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many times can he write the same book!","review":"The continued success of Koontz both saddens and amazes me. It certainly shows that the average American reads somewhere below the ninth grade level, and/or has some serious short-term memory problems. I started this book and soon realized it was way too similar to two other Koontz works I had picked up (one I read, the other I brought back to the library after ten pages). How many times can this guy write about paranormal/esp type experiences involving criminal behavior, and have the public eat it up time and again? Obviously ad infinitem! Sad, very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! Continued.","review":"In my previous post I expressed the hope that I could finish this book, and that it would be worth the effort. I finally did finish it, as it picked up some a third of the way through. Though the pace became faster, the ease with which the protagonists figured out the evil doctor's brainwashing techniques and the unrealistic, cardboard cutout characters toward the end ultimately provided a very unsatisfying read. I found Koontz's use of popular real life entities (Keanu and Amazon.Com) to advance the plot off-putting. Any suspense generated was dulled by too obvious red herrings planted earlier in the story (the kevlar vests, for example). Try again, Dean. You struck out with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Memory","review":"Tried really hard to enjoy this book, did not enjoy what I had read,so will not finish it.

Koontz, but this really is a repeat of earlier books. I had trouble finishing it and during the struggle it took me I had the feeling of DEJA VU throughout the book. It has a lot of pages, but I found myself skipping more and more because it became very boring. Usually I am in the habit of reading a book more then once.

By this I refer to formula plots, standardized characters, and being written to as if very thick headed persons needing step by step diagrams repeated regularly to allow us to grasp the storyline. We overlook this because we love the story. Koontz can tell an enthralling and heartstopping tale. This book, alas, is not one of those. It is boring, and that is unforgiveable. It actually took me two weeks to choke this down. I normally read a GOOD Koontz straight through in hours. I felt obligated to read it as I had paid for a copy.

False Memory just isn't one of his better books. I can't put my finger on it, but it seemed to me that Koontz was trying to do something outside of his pattern. This one just missed the mark.

Unlike roses, however, what hangs round is not quite so pleasant. This book plainly stinks.Dean Koontz is a hack and incapable of an original thought. If indeed he was inspired to write this drivel, the book is evidence that one's muse is not always kind.If you're considering reading \\"False Memory\\", my recommendation is, \\"Forget about it.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This is a very long book and it is equally slow in developing characters that are interesting. As the story unfolds you quickly learn the dark aspects of the Dr. Ahriman. He is one of the most disgusting and vile characters in a book I have ever read. SPOILER ALERT this character is raping women, planting ideas in childrens head that there parents were molesting them, and getting off with this power that he has. This book was a complete waste of time and I wish I have never started it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to \\"less is more?\\"","review":"Boy this book was so long winded. It took forever to get into it. And Kootz's writing style ... way, way too much description and detail on everyday things that were boring and redundant. I did, however, enjoy it once I got into it (more than half way through it). Even then, I had to skip the descriptions and details. This book is nothing like \\"The Door To December\\" (which was excellent!). I don't know if I will be reading anymore of Kootz's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am so bummed!","review":"I have been a fan of Dean Koontz for many years and I was thrilled when I saw his newest release. I was, however, bummed when I tried in vain to read it. I loved his characters, always do, but the story was impossible to get into.

Koontz need an editor with a BIG RED PEN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What I liked and what I didn't...","review":"This book has a great plot and good, likeable characters that we care about (a true Dean Koontz specialty). However, the author does tend to ramble with the psychobabble (and there is a lot of it). This book would have been FANTASTIC if it was about 100 pages shorter. I found myself skimming in places. All that aside, I would like to thank Mr. Koontz (and that other guy, Stephen King)for maturing with their loyal readers and realizing we need a change - it is possible to scare (and entertain) without having to heap on the slobbering monsters. I will continue to buy his books as soon as they hit the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Disappointing Koontz","review":"Did any one else notice, that with a few changes, this book could have been \\"Strangers\\"? The plot is hackneyed and hacked together. Always have been a strong fan of Koontz, I have almost everything he has written under all of his names. What has happened to his books lately? Story line, from the first chapter, was predictable, and aggravatingly wordy. Have not finished, but can not put it down, in the same way you worry at a sore tooth.All in all, I am just plain disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the usual standards","review":"Not as good as his other books. You'd be better off to skip this one - or get it at the used paperback store later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"This book took way too long to develop into an interesting turn pager. The first 300 pages were very difficult to digest, and I found myself having to read the book in 10 page intervals before I really became interested in the story and the plot itself. After getting to the heart of the plot, the story became a bit clearer and more accessible.I really do not like Koontz's writing style at all. The word usage and metaphors just come across as pretentious. The length of this novel could be cut by well over 100 pages if Koontz would quit the intellectual posturing, and just stick with basic story telling.For all I know, a majority of the positive reviews for this book come from Koontz himself, under 59 different e-mail addresses."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Way Koontz Wrote This One","review":"Let me just make a list of negatives, then positives:-Misleading intro. The cover and/or inside jacket of the book says that \\"False Memory\\" is about authophobia (fear of oneself), which is BS because it's NOT.-The villian is revealed too early on, so the suspense is gone before the book is halfway through (unlike in his Midnight, where readers don't know too much too soon)-Too much phycological description.-Disgusting description of the death of little girl, which belongs in a police file about child molestation, really.-One dimensional bad guy-The killing off of characters that had great potential in the story.-Dean Koontz \\"no espeekee Spanish.\\" He keeps misspelling a young girl's Spanish name.-A saccharine fairy tale ending that I could not believe.The positives:+It could happen in real life+The characters felt real very likable+I'm glad I purchased the book second hand for only $1"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big letdown...","review":"This was my first Koontz book, and it may be my last. Not even half way through the book you find out \\"who done it\\", and the rest of the book is everyone trying to catch the guy. I probably read the last half in about an hour, just flipping through the pages and finding nothing interesting. I'll stick with Vince Flynn, whose books keep you guessing all the way to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome, Tiresome, Tiresome","review":"I've enjoyed Koontz's books for years, usually finishing them rapidly and recommending them to friends. Yet I could hardly get through False Memory because of its uninspired plot, overloaded scenes, tiresome detail (excessive and pointless in the extreme.) For example, does Koontz HAVE to LIST brand names,prices, adjectives, constantly? - \\"...Gunsmoke Dodge City playset by Marx for only $3,250, and a die-cast Johnny Lightning Custom Ferrari for only $115.\\" Maybe he's being paid by the word? Do you think? Bottomline for me: I was very irritated by the whole thing. Very disappointing, especially as I've liked so much of his previous work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too similar.","review":"I'm afraid False Memory did not meet my expectation of a sizzling read. Although the character development was typical Dean Koontz quality, I found the story line boggy. Intensity kept the reader's nerve endings tingling which was simply not the case in False Memory. I this reader's opinion...False Memory is not one of Mr. Koontz\\"s best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most else","review":"Dean Koontz continues to be the most fascinating fiction writer out there. While this story is not breaking any new ground, Koontz has the unique ability to drag the reader head first into his world and to give characters that are smart, strong, and worthy of the reader's interest. The worst Koontz book is better than most anything else and this is far from his worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, God, What Trash","review":"Why does this guy have such a following? Now THAT would make a good horror/mystery story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Memory","review":"Don't get me wrong...Koontz is one of my favorite authors and I immediately pre-order his books before they're released. This one left me cold. It was just unpleasant. Yes, I know this is a horror writer, but usually his books have some clever supernatural twist to them that keeps me intrigued. This one bored me to tears. I finally gave up after 200 dreadful pages. Dean, go back to great themes like you used in Watchers, my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Favorite.","review":"I've got to say, this book fell short for me.

I just finished this 784 page book and will admit that I skipped over large chunks of it in order to avoid his overuse of descriptors and similes. Also, he seems to be more and more infatuated with grotesque sexual/abusive themes.I was very intrigued with Koontz after reading his excellent 'Lightning' 16 years ago. It remains one of my favorite books. I ended up reading many of his books written about the same time as Lightning and enjoyed those as well.At 700+ pages, this book takes a long time to get to Koontz' usual happy ending. I felt like the conclusion to the mystery/problem was presented in a rushed, contrived manner.It pains me to admit that my last few outings with Mr. Koontz' writing have left me dissatisfied and turned off. Perhaps he is going through a different creative stage and will one day find his stride again.I hope so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Suspense Novel","review":"This book is super creepy! The beginning is a little slow as Koontz builds the story, but as it progresses the book sucks you in. I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I have been a big fan of Dean Koontz for a long time & till now liked all of his stories enough to read them more than once, but I couldn't even get through this book.It is now in the bookcase without ever being read. It started off OK, but it became so long & drawn out that I gave up. I didn't even make it half way through the book. Sorry, Mr. Koontz, but it seems like you were having an off day when you wrote this one. After \\"Fear Nothing\\" & \\"Seize the Night\\", which were really great, I thought that this would be as good as they were, but it was a big disappointment. I'm still looking forward to the next one, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another re-encarnation of a geat story","review":"He has done it again, taken a good story and made it less appealing. This whole \\"fear of open spaces phobia\\" was in another horror book and it was even made into a movie with Sigourney Weaver and Harry Connick JR., in this False Memory, Koontz has taken the concept to deeper levels, but it is really not that appealing in the sense that he tries too hard to make you feel the fear of his protaganist, it is not realistic, nor exciting enough to be fantasy. I recall this once before in \\"Fear Nothing\\", he used the idea from another great book, \\"Between the Shadows of the Night\\", which was much more compeling than Fear Nothing and much more imaginitive. Dean Koontz is a great writer, but he needs to be more original with his new titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"Sorry but the book is silly. Characters act as if they have a script in front of them and mouth what's written there...not natural...of course we have a wonderful couple here whose lives smash into pieces...except that any logical person would overcome those problems the villain allegely lashes on within a week. No fun factor (one of the most boring dialogue writer I have seen around this Koontz man), no intelligent side stories, no underboiling story line, a silly, imitative, boring book...Makes someone wonder how on good Lord's earth these books pass past the editors and publishing houses. To cash in on author's name? May appear better to the lowest common denominator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get into it.","review":"Let me condense the first 107 pages: \\"Woman helps agoraphobic friend to doctor, gets squirrelly herself while her husband helps his similarly affected addict friend.\\" Who cares? I cared more about the dog, the only worthwhile character introduced in the first 107 pages. I normally quit a book after 50 pages if no \\"hook\\" has been set, but since it was Koontz, I gave it over 100. That was a mistake. I recommend that publishers strip off the author's name and let somebody independently review each book, then a poor effort like this wouldn't make it to market. I mistakenly kept reading two recent dogs from Pat Cornwell on the strength of reputation and I didn't want to make that mistake here. I wonder if sycophant editors don't have the guts to tell these authors that they have no clothes, or are the deals locked in ahead of time no matter how the product turns out?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this tape!","review":"I don't care if you're a Koontz lover or a Koontz hater, do not buy this tape. Check it out, if your libray has it, then you can return it immediately.Probably the perfect reader for a writer in love with his own verbiage; Lang is desperatey in love with his own voice. From the affected, not-quite-English accent, to the infuriatingly irritating renditions of women's voices--every single one sounds like a helpless, spineless,whiney, cloying female impersonator, to the inexcusable mis-pronounciations: if Koontz's god-awful writing doesn't drive you round the bend, Lang's voice will.But then again, I obviously dislike Koontz. If you think he's just swell, maybe Lang's just what the Doctor ordered..."},{"rating":"1","title":"warning","review":"I have actually enjoyed every Koontz book I've read up until I came across false memory.

Ever since STRANGERS and THE WATCHERS I have yet to enjoy any of his books. SOLE SURVIVOR wasn't bad. I feel Koontz's writing is too embellished and monotonous. I was falling asleep trying to keep up with all his wordy paragraphs. After trudging through 300 pages I finally put the book away because I found it too disgusting. I know this may be a turn on to some but it just went too far for me. I got to a point where I really didn't even care about anyone anymore. However I personally felt if Koontz could have cut out half of the boring narrative, maybe I would've finished the book - actually I would have since I read 300 pages and that is about how thick the story should have been!"},{"rating":"1","title":"false memory","review":"I'm a big fan of Mr. Koontz but I'm sorry to say this is not a good book.

I've listened to the unabridged editions of almost everything he's done -- and he is the best. I could not get through the second side of the first tape. It dragged. It plodded.

Scott Fitzgerald He Ain't","review":"As a long-time Dean Koontz fan, I slugged it out. As always, the premise of his novel was great. What I found most objectionable however, was Koontz's endless and annoying literary devices. Koontz is a great storyteller. He is neither Hemingway nor Fitzgerald and should stick to what he does best - telling the tale. This book is as full of similes as there are drops of water in the ocean, if not more. Hopefully, Koontz will stick to the story and stop trying to dazzle us with these tedious, ponderous and cumbersome forays into the literary realm."},{"rating":"1","title":"bored to distraction","review":"Started this book two weeks ago, stopped after 100 pages, read Tami Hoag, started book again, stopped, read Michael Connelly, started again, stopped at page 182, bored with 3 psychologically disturbed people.I'd rather be cleaning,and I hate cleaning. I've read many other Koontz books, and those I read at every spare moment. I can't describe much about the plot, because in 182 pages the big event might be one character taking the other to the psychiatrist's office. Wish I'd bought it at a \\"guanantied good read\\" store because I'd return it in a heartbeat. Koontz's other books are far better."},{"rating":"1","title":"plot drags...","review":"This book is extremely long for the message it is trying to convey.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddled metaphors","review":"I find it hard to believe that Dean Koontz actually wrote this book. Maybe he has cloned himself. WATCHERS was interesting, as well as a couple of others, but FALSE MEMORY is what I hope will soon be my false memory. Agonizing, tedious descriptions, similies and metaphors on every page, a ridiculous plot. Granted, Koontz is, at best, a time filler, but at least 350 pages could have been cut. Koontz' edge is that he writes about the area I live in, so that's usually a good hook. But this writing is so banal and sophmoric, I doubt whether I'll ever pick up a Dean Koontz story, no matter how bored I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding!","review":"I've read every one of Dean Koontz's books and I loved this one!

Would love to see Martie and Dusty in another one of his novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Intellectual Diatribe","review":"At his best, Dean Koontz is one of the best suspense writers of all time. Unfortunately, however, his writing is often a vehicle for a philosophy of neo-anarchist romanticism and anti-intellectualism. This book, which deals with the implausible concept of mind control through deep programming, is basically an anti-intellectual diatribe. Intellectuals and government are seen as the source of all the problems in the world, and we are told that action guided by moral purpose is all that is needed. We are supposed to learn how to live from the superior wisdom of dogs. Koontz's prescription for living would seem to be something like this: Love a dog, get a gun, take care of your own, drop out of the political process and don't think too much. Yeah, right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Run from the fork! Run from the Fork!","review":"How many pages should a writer fill to explain that a character is afraid of forks, knives and mirrors? Two? Well Koontz takes over a hundred, and repeats, repeats, repeats. 500 pages should have been cut from this book. Repetition weakens writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected so much more....","review":"I have read one other Dean Koontz book, From the Corner of His Eye, and it was much better, although still long. This book, Falso Memory, was also too long winded- also, everything was revealed before halfway through the book. I kept reading because I \\"just knew\\" Koontz would have something up his sleeve. But he didn't, for the most part. A few surprises, but not 750 pages worth. He still hasn't touched Valerie WIlson Wesley's \\"When Death Comes Stealing.\\" Way better read.Everyone is so obsessed with Koontz- sure his vocabulary is floral, but that's where it stops- either he loses me, I can't feel the characters, or both.

I have read most of Mr. Koontz's books and I was shocked how poorly this was written. I found myself scanning the pages waiting for useless, boring, cutsie dialogue to end between characters. So much time was spent trying to develop a base for the plot, there was no time for real story content. I feel most of the book could have been edited out. At the end I was very let down. I would not recommend False Memories to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can wait long enough . . .","review":"the book will get interesting. The interminable description of Martie's autophobia indeed is rather boring, but once the story finally gets started, the read is almost worth it.

MORE KOONTZ","review":"Dear Mr. Koontz. Please don't listen to any criticism of your stories all being the same. (Couple and dog fight forces of evil). I would buy every book like this you could ever write. Although many of your books share that theme, there are so many different evils to fight (and your imagination astounds me) that each one is wonderful. I prefer your stories with no kids. There are 400,000 writers that write about cute kids. Ugh. This book is now tied for my second favorite. You will be hard pressed to top Watchers ever, but this book, the Snow stories, Dark Rivers of the Heart and Dragon Tears are all fighting for number 2. The reader of this tape also did a marvelous job. Scary! After listening in the car, it was a frightening walk from my garage to get to the safety of my big dogs. Was Keeanu out there? Maybe....."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Start","review":"False Memory is pretty much your standard Dean Koontz fare. There isn't very much about it that is terribly different from the last fifty books he's written, and the very fact that he is so prolific is probably an indication that he has discovered the secret formula of writing pulp horror.We read this book with dry amusement, and even the horror fans in our bookclub couldn't muster up much enthusiasm for it. It is so wordy, so OVER described, that the people pale into insignificance along side the things. It would seem that Koontz has done some research on phobias and mental health problems, but it's no more than you would get from a precursory glance at the DSM IV. The plot of this book is enough to offend any practicising mental health professional, the sheer abuse of power is perhaps the most horrifying detail in this trite novel.We can't honestly recommend it, but to be fair, it isn't our usual genre, and we aren't THAT kind of bookclub. Sorry guys, but steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Memorable","review":"I had not been able to finish the author's previous two bestsellers but did finish this one. I wish I had not wasted my time with so many well-written novels waiting to be picked up. Its about time the reading population realizes that the bestseller list literally means nothing as far as good literature is concerned. \\"False Memory\\" starts off with a bang and ends with a fizzle. Unfortunately, about half way through the novel the plot becomes unbelievable and the characters likewise. I quickly lost interest in who was controlling whose mind and for what purpose. Koonz should have done more research on the subject as all of a sudden all the characters became masters at mind control. In a nutshell, this novel is too long, too ridiculous and too verbous to recommend as good reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"He should have warned us","review":"I love Dean Koontz' work. I own and have read almost everything he has written; but as a victim of brutal childhood sexual abuse, and being currently under the care of a psychiatrist to deal with issues related to that abuse, and having not been believed by my parents, I never made it through this one. It was a brilliant story, and he portrayed the horror and shame of sexual abuse from the victim's point of view masterfully, but it was more than I, and I dare say most people who have actually experienced abuse, could handle. Next time, please, warn us when there will be rape and/or other sexual abuse (that may re-open old wounds we aren't quite ready to deal with yet) graphically and repeatedly used in a story line. I'm looking forward to his NEXT book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Dean Koontz","review":"False Memory is a classic Koontz novel. He uses vivid descriptions to show the reader what is happening.

Unfortunately, it looks like the author didn't have a plan how to develop and end this story: by the end it was so dumb, it wasn't even funny. Koontz wasn't even trying to keep it believable. I gave it 2 starts for the effort, otherwise it's a solid 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it. Didn't like it.","review":"I have read several of Dean Koontz books in the past and have enjoyed them. So I was looking forward to diving into this one. Although I enjoy a thriller I found this book disgusting. The graphic descriptions of many sick scenes were totally unnessesary to the story. The basic idea was a good one and at times very interesting, but the needless gore ruined what I was hoping would be a good read. It will be the last Koontz book I pick up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A haiku for Mr. Koontz","review":"book lacks focus, lifereads as though quickly writtenhair weave too tight DeanI should have known when I was able to buy _False Memory_ in a thrift store for $1. How did this best seller hit the skids so quickly?The copy I had was obviously rushed to press. The text had words hypenated as line endings but appearing in the middle of the sentence, which was distracting to the extreme. (It's like try-ing to fig-ure out what the in-tent was. Hurts reading that, doesn't it?)Picture this: A publisher's heart-to-heart with his best-selling author. \\"Dean, they're just not buying the surfer lingo of your cooler-than-frost genetic reject Chris Snow. Can't you produce some of that psychic chill you're famous for?\\" Factor in a late night with a double feature of _The Matrix_ and _The Manchurian Candidate_, some dodgy sushi, and you've got _False Memory_.Hey Dean, better luck next time with the sushi.

This book kept me reading on the edge of my seat. I had never read any of Koontz's books before, and this one made me an instant Koontz fan. It is a bit lengthy and wordy at times, but overall, it's my favorite Koontz book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dean R. Koontz is one crazy MOFO!!!","review":"Almost no one one will believe me as I right this but what I say is probably the truth. Dean R. Koontz is insane. This man is emotianly disturbed beyond everything. I don't say this because he writes about this kind of disturbing thing, many people do. But there are little things that you notice: His obsession with sexual situations, esapecialy with children. You can find this in many of his books. This man scares me, he writes more than just as a fantastic writer but more of as a crazy psycho who instead may be writing his own fantasies, if he hasnt already commited some of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manchurian Memories","review":"Anyone familiar with The Manchurian Candidate has a leg-up on this book, from the start. It's not giving anything away to say so, because the book itself makes it pretty apparent early on.This is essentially the much better version of Koontz's earlier Night Chills. A number of people in a given area begin displaying bizarre, atypical, destructive behavior. Of course, they all have something in common. That something is what the hero of the piece has to discover - and put an end to.A very involving read, though it has a shaky beginning. Koontz's characters, especially his psychopathic villain, are typically well-drawn. There are some nice comic touches, throughout.This is one of Koontz's few good books of the last several years. Nothing new, really, but at least he's back in the saddle with this one, and not exploring quasi-scientific metaphysics. False Memory is just a good, straightforward Koontz thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my time and money","review":"I have been a fan of Dean Koontz since high school and have enjoyed most of his books. Unfortunately, this was not one of them. It was so bad & boring that I didn't even finish the book. People keep telling me the second half of the book is really good but I just couldn't get through the first half that was really bad.The first half was just too slow and overload with details. I know that details are essential to a good story, but an overdose can kill a story real fast. The first 250 or so pages could have been condensed into 50 pages and Dean still would have been able to get his point accross to the readers. It took that long for him to develop Martie's unusall phobia and I became just annoyed with her and totally lost interest in the story.I wish Dean would go back to writing the horror novels that I enjoyed in high school & give up on this suspense garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointed","review":"I LOVE Koontz, but this was the first book I read by him that I was really disapointed with. It took me a little over a month to get through this. Usually with a Koontz book I am done in about a week.The beginning started out good. I had my hopes up. But it just went downhill from there. I hate to start a book and not finish it, so I was more or less forcing myself pick it up and get through it.Hopefully his next book will be better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"too long with annoying distractions","review":"This book was way too long and Koontz's tedious metaphors and many descriptives were too distracting. However, I did like the good-hearted Martie, Dusty, Skeet and Valet characters, and the villian was satsifyingly evil and often hilarious as well. Also unlike some other readers I don't mind knowing who the villian is sooner rather than later, because it keeps you rooting for the good guys to catch him. But this book was filled with too many unnecessary details and descriptions. And towards the end, inexplicably one of the nutty patients suddenly seems to get rational enough to hire a lawyer to get her out of the trouble she got in due to a mental illness which she previously seemed to have no control over. What was the deal with that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I was disappointed in this book. It's over-written and unrewarding, not suspenseful in the least. I also tried another of his books, Odd Thomas, and while it was better than False Memory, I won't be reading any more of Koontz' books. Stick with Stephen King -- at least he's not pretentious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruel and predictable","review":"I have been a fan of Koontz for a long time. Most of his books I find engaging, entertaining, and (of course) somewhat frightening. This book was only cruel. There was little suspense and too little reward. I'm glad I got it at the library and could just check it back in."},{"rating":"1","title":"The koontz library in a blender","review":"I'm a big Koontz fan so I was looking forward to \\"Fear nothing.\\" So it was with some disappontment that I finished the last page. There is nothing particularily wrong with this novel, it's just we've read it before. The mind-washing of \\"Survivors\\", the evil doctor (more sadistic it is true)from at least 2 books, the shadowy organisation (though it is never truely realised here and so on. It feels as through Mr. Koontz threw his past plot index cards up in the air and caught a few at random. This is a great starter book for new Koontz readers, but for fans disappointment awaits. Fingers crossed for the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tautly Stretched Rubber Band of Tension","review":"A tautly stretched rubber band of tension that does not let up, literally, until the very end! This is the first nbook I've read by a favorite author that I almost had to quit reading. The villain was so deeply, disturbingly hatefull and annoying that the upper hand he keeps throughout most of the book is almost too much for one to bear!But as usual, I couldn't put Koontz down and boy was I glad I didn't! As satisfying as any of his books, this one has an edge-of-the-seat shootout in a car in the snowy backroads of Arizona that has you standing up in the library shouting \\"YES!\\" over and over again until the Librarian kicks you out!There is even a quirky little reference to these online reader's reviews on Amazon.com that is as funny as it is thought provoking.The ending is definitely a surprise, as well as quite satisfying.All in all yet another in a long line of intensly entertaining and worthwhile books by a master of susepense!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!!","review":"This book did not capture me at all. I tried, but I never evenfinished reading this book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A SUSPENCE THRILLER YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS!","review":"This was my first Koontz book and it wont be my last. This book kept me interested with its twists and turns. It could have been a little shorter but it was still an excellent book. Each of the characters has a mental condition so if you like psychologial thrillers this is the book for you! One day out of nowhere Martie, a computer designer becomes overwhelmed with the fear of herself, a condition called Autophobia. Susan, Marties best friend has a intence fear of open spaces and then there was Skeet, Marties husband's brother who claims to have seen an angel when threating to kill himself. Koontz has an exceptional talent, bring the all the characters to life and leaving nothing unanswered. I encourage everyone to read False Memory its a book no one should miss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, My first Koontz","review":"I saw someone reading this book and picked it up myself and became engrossed in the writing. Koontz does a great job of letting you see inside these people and really experience their fears and horror. I thought it got a little far fetched at the end but a very readable book that is hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Slow....","review":"This is the first Dean Koontz book I have read and I have a feeling it will be my last. I only picked up the book after my Mother and Sister ranted and raved about it forever, so you can imagine my disappointment when the book dragged on and on. The first half of the book was pretty good, but it went downhill after that. It took me about five weeks to finish this book because I found myself wanting to do so many other things besides pick it up and try again. I eventually forced myself to pick it back up and skimmed the rest of the book. I was extremely disappointed in Dean Koontz and his writing capabilities. I find it hard to believe so many people would love him if this was his best effort, therefore I realize it cannot be. Perhaps I should give another book of his a chance before I write him off for good - but there are so many other writers I enjoy that he just might not get another chance. I wouldn't pay the hardback price, but I guess it's worth the paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD TO THE LAST DROP!","review":"Dean Koontz is such a gifted and skilled individual when it comes to writing. I have read all of his novels and practially loved every one of them. He is a very unique author that combines Stephen King and John Sandford together. I believe that \\"False Memory\\" was one of his best novels. I like it a lot that Dean Koontz is starting to get away from the supernatural books that he used to write and is writing more mystery and believable type books. There is nothing supernatural in \\"False Memory.\\" It is about a crazy doctor who wants to turn all of his patients crazy and puts them into a deep sleep in their sessions and hypnotizes them to do evil things, even kill people. Marty, the main character, must try and stop this deranged doctor before Marty's best friend is turned crazy. Dean Koontz will always be one of my favorite authors and I am greatly awaiting his new thriller, \\"FROM THE CORNER OF HIS EYE\\" on DECEMBER 26, 2000!"},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR REVIEW TURNS AUTHOR INTO PSYCHO KILLER","review":"A HUGE fan of Dean Koontz (think I've read them all), this book was a HUGE disappointment. Still reeling from Chris Snow and his adventures which left me panting for more, reading this book was an out and out chore. Seemingly written in a weekend with weak characters and an even weaker plot, the only thing I found gratifying was the motive for the psycho killer to target Marty in the first place . . . a poor review written about the killer's book on (get this) Amazon.com. C'mon Dean . . . were you just wiped out?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment.","review":"This book disappointed me. I am a die-hard Koontz fan, but this book actually bored me. It was hard to sympathize with the characters, the plot was thin, and the book lacked the magic usually present in a Koontz novel. The dog had potential as one of those magical Koontz animals, but even he turned out to be a real nothing in the book. I'm glad I didn't spend any money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cookie Cutter","review":"The characters are all cookie-cutter characters from his previous novels, up to and including the adorably intelligent golden retriever. The first third of the book is excellent, and his peek inside the heads of neurotic people are spooky. Then in the next third we meet the obligatory megalomaniac-genius-evil-doctor and the rest of the book might as well have been any other of his 'let's get paranoid' thrillers. The last third is highly improbable-action-adventure, however it redeems itself when we meet the wonderfully bizarre family of the male lead. These characters deserve a book of their own. But the plot is interesting and I think the first third of the story makes it worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"False Memory\\" Not Memorable","review":"To be honest, I have been a huge fan of Dean Koontz since reading his elegant and terrifying novel \\"Whispers\\" in the early 80's. Unfortunately, Mr. Koontz appears to be completing his downward spiral started with the dreadful Chris Snow novels...Although this novel starts off with a promising first half, the plot becomes laborous and strained when the true villain and his implausible plan are revealed.True to form, Mr. Koontz's characters are well developed and thoroughly detailed, and the reader does come to care about Marty, Dusty, Susan, and Skeet... it's a shame that the characters are trapped in a flimsy spider-web of cliched, B-movie, plot cast-offs...This is one Koontz fan that hopes that \\"False Memory\\" was a result of writer's block... \\"False Memory\\" is \\"Truly Forgetable\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up! I can't finish it!","review":"Thank god I just borrowed this from someone and didn't spendmoney on it. The last couple Koontz books I read frustrated anddisappointed me because he drags unimportant scenes out so long. The last couple of his I read I found myself flipping ahead out of desperation and finding that the same boring scene was STILL in progress! It was when I found myself doing this YET AGAIN that I tossed it aside in disgust. Plus, his use of pop culture references is somehow irritating and his characters are increasingly becoming cartoons. I have to admit it: I think I've gotten way past Dean Koontz and better start looking elsewhere. Apologies to you devoted Koontz fans. (I used to be one of you!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What can you say?","review":"This thing should've been called *The Book of Counted Whiners*. Look, I like Dean Koontz. And I realize we need to feel sympathy for the leading characters, but you just want to take all of these people and put them in a closet. Partly, this is due to buying the audio tape. The guy reading this thing is so in-love with his own voice that he needs to get either a hotel room or a restraining order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demented","review":"I find it disturbing that an individual could consciously write something like this. It is both sick and tactless. If this is the way Dean Koontz is going to write from now on, I'm finished with him. I value the sacredness of life and of the mind, both of which Koontz shamelessly exploits in this novel. And the way he seems to write disparagingly of women in this novel (most of the victims in this book are women) angers me greatly."},{"rating":"2","title":"False Memory-One Book I will Remember","review":"Being a die-hard Koontz fan for more than 3 years, I was thrilled to hear that he had a new release out. When I first started reading, the book immediatly had my attention, I litterally could not put it down. I was gripped by the way he peered into phobics minds, quite spooky. I was fasinated by the psychotic doctor, I mean, who would've suspected the PSYCHOLOGIST? VERY VERY GOOD KOONTZ! One more thing I'd like to say in referance to this book....The writing was good. The plot was entertaining. The characters were colorful. I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much descriptive, repetitive writing","review":"I have read most of DK's books and this one was almost painful. Things really don't start moving until half way through. I forced myself to continue and did a lot of skimming when it came to the wordy descriptions and detailed repetative drama in the beginning. Rather disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and not worth the time.","review":"I have tried 3 times to get through this book and now I'm chunking it in the trash can. Other reviewers have commented on the excessive LENGTH of this book. The detail and repetitiveness make this book a huge waste of time. I made it a third of the way through and, after reading the other reviews, I realize it's just a big waste of time and energy plowing through this tome. I've always enjoyed Koontz, but this thing is stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book of Koontz I've read","review":"I have read alot of Koontz, and all have been excellent, until this one. It was slow, it dragged. I had trouble finishing it. I did though, thinking it would get better, it didn't.The dog really annoyed me in this one. I was waiting for him to show some spunk, but he remained a wimp all the way through.I'm not sure what happened here, but this is one Koontz, I would skip if I were you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good story!","review":"This was a very good Koontz book. That said, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because while it was good it just wasn't one that stayed with me. I know I'm not reviewing literature(sometimes I hate that word) and this book delivers great entertainment but, personally, it does not touch Fear Nothing. I know, apples and oranges but I'm honest. The characters(one of the most important aspects to me) were great. The story was great. Well, maybe 4 and a half. The premise is not too far out there and everyone reacts in a very real way. While I enjoy stories that go way out on the limb it is good to see one that just puts a foot on that limb and makes sense in every way. Very good. Read Fear Nothing first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it...","review":"I've read lots of books with lots of words in them. False Memory was only the second book that I couldn't read in recent days. The other was She's Come Undone by Wally Lamb. I don't read horror, but I liked the concept. When last I left the story, Skeet was in rehab again. Marti's best friend was still afraid to leave the house. Marti was struggling with her own reality. The dog was the only one that knew what was going on in the story. Dusty missed obvious clues that his wife was going bonkers -- guess he was, too. I'm glad other people liked it. I admire Dean Koontz, but it was taking too long for Dusty and Marti to find one another after the craziness happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Thriller","review":"The only flaw the book has: it is a little bit too long. The time it takes before the plot gets under way may be the time when some impatient people stop reading and turn to another book. But from then on, let us say from page 150 , this novel is excellent. The characters are very well developed, the plot foreseeable as the author works with dramatic irony from the start, but the suspense does not feed on the question: What will happen? but on: How will the characters get out of this mess? or: Will this villain be punished after all? And Koontz manages to give the plot some nice unexpected twists that keeps your interest alive.What is always enjoyable in Koontz' books is his expertise in dogs, especially in golden retrievers. I have never had dogs, but in some of his novels I really got to like them. His dog characters are a treat in itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"false memory","review":"I have tried to pick up this book 3 times now and just can't seem to get into it. Does it start out slow.

Give me some input please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story and Full of Suspense","review":"I have read most of Koontz's work and I give this one 4 stars. I got tired of some of the phobia talk and I wanted to just jump in and make the characters shape up. It is a busy story and the characters (most at least) are very likeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good First Half..","review":"False MemoryAfter the first 250-300 pages I couldnt go on.

I tried, really I did, to get through this book. However, I finally stopped and sent it back to my friend. It was awful. The author takes too long to get into the main plot of the book for one. He also describes the worst kind of psycological horror and cruelty, and great detail of rape. I could not take it. This was not entertainment to me. I do not recommend that anyone read this book.

Only the love they share for one another will keep them grounded as mysteries unfold and the truth about those they trusted is exposed. Forced into unreal situations with no where to turn and no one to trust they set out to save thier own lives and the lives of many who may never know the danger. The enemy within and without proves to be a viable foe as they press through.Koontz lends good twists and a fairly intersting plot. Full of prose and poetry the good and bad guys in this novel teach us a lesson about power and love. The love story makes it worth the read. Not for those who seek climactic showdowns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"This was not one of Duncan's best. The ending wasn't good at all. Most of the book was too predictable.

Mystery books are my favorite and Killing Mr. Griffin kept my interest. My favorite part was when Mark, Jeff, David, Betsy, and Susan found out Mr. Griffin was dead. David said, \\"He's not asleep, he's dead.\\" End of chapter. I had to keep reading. My least favorite part was when one of the characters almost died. \\"It\\" was my favorite character. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes mystery books because things happen that you wouldn't expect to happen and I love that about this book. I can't think of anyone who wouldn't want to read a nail-biting book like Killing Mr. Griffin because it's a book that you just can't put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"The story is good and unfolds (or unravels) very well.

As the old proverb goes, everything is just fun and games until someone loses an eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very believable!","review":"This book seriously makes you think. NOt only is it suspenseful, it's a teen angst novel, too. It shows you what happens when peer pressure goes too far.

I don't see the point of taking us inside the minds of teens who would even consider such a brutal crime as kidnapping and terrorizing another human being. This has none of the layers and provocative questions of \\"Lord of the Flies.\\" It was, to me, pointless. Most teens I know are interested in cleaner fare, in deep questions about life on other subjects. And despite the predominance of disturbing themes and plots in teen novels, many teens I know look for other books instead; they really aren't that interested in stories of kidnap, rape, incest, suicide, and murder."},{"rating":"1","title":"book","review":"I was forced to read this book as an assignment.

I was a little disappointed in the ending, but it was still very good. It has suppense, mystery, worry, and more. Throughout the whole book, you are kept in suspense and wonderment. The dialogue is very realistic, and it has a genious plot. This book is not that scary at all, so if you dont like scary books, you should still get it. If you like VERY scary books, this might be a little bit of a disappointment. I could barely manage to put the book down. It is about how a group of students get together and plan to scare their English teacher, Mr. Griffin, because they hate him. They only meant to scare him, but it turns out that... well, you'll have to read it. They have to cover their tracks and everything, leading up to the surprising, but a little disappointing, ending.

But when the kidnapping goes wrong, and after we see a lighter side of the man, who is really that bad of a guy; something unexpected happens. he dies of heart failure.

I thought that it was very creative and was very well written. I felt as if I was a oartof the group that murdered him. I loved the fact that it was a thing that many high schoolers have thought about doing, but have never actually done. It dealed with a lot of things like having to deal with a death and what tou have to do in order to make them right again. Even though I wouldn't have hidden the body and the evidence, I think that most kids would have. A lot of kids have a fear of getting in trouble so thye hide everything.

So they took him up to the mountains to scare him. He needed to take this certain kind of medicine but he never got it because of what they did. What do you think will happen to Mr. Griffin?

One reviewer called it a \\"culmination of the trilogy\\". Sure, in the sense that it is the culmination of all the left over footage from the last two movies.

This film has no meaning. Don't be fooled by the director telling you it has a meaning. He's lying through his fake teeth. Seeing an 90 minutes of CGI number patterns, inverted images of nature and images of people eating McDonalds hamburgers is not a statement. It's a waste of the viewer's precious time.

Instead of the beautiful cinematography of the first two films, this film relies on animation and special visual effects. If there is a single purely \\"in camera\\" shot, I didn't see it. It is very tiresome to see scenes so distorted by visual trickery that they are entirely disassociated from the real world. The Phillip Glass music sounds like someone trying to sound like Phillip Glass. The jumbled and distorted images eventually grow monotonous and it felt like a very long film for being only 90 minutes.The best thing about the DVD is the interview with Glass and Reggio who you rarely get to hear speak about the trilogy.

Then again, perhaps this film should not so much be critisised as a feature film, but as a music video, or in fact a video installation that took the wrong door. Watching this as a feature film is unbearable for anyone with a sense of plot. Also, it has so many flashy effects that there should be a seizure warning on the package. But the film certainly goes well as a background for Phil Glass' very enjoyable music, or for running it in the background during a weird, geeky party you are having in an abandoned Detroit warehouse..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Botched Opportunity","review":"First, let me say, I LOVE Koyaanisqatsi, the original film in this trilogy. Koyaanisqatsi is a true visual poem that tells a straight forward story about what we humans are doing to the earth.The second film in the trilogy, Powaqqatsi, wasn't as good as the first but it was still fairly understandable as a critique of how humans exploit one another.Naqoyqatsi could have been the best in the series since it had ample opportunity to show us the horrors of war. Instead, it comes off as a sophomoric exercise in video experimentation, nothing more. If not for Philip Glass' music, I would not have given this film any rating at all.I write this criticism in hopes that Godfrey Reggio sees it. He should pull this travesty off the market and reshoot the entire film with stronger footage showing us, as clearly as he did with \\"Koy\\", why war (the topic of \\"Naq\\") is so horrific. If you want an effective critique of violence, try \\"Clockwork Orange\\". Naqoyqatsi is simply a mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"not quite like its older sisters","review":"beautiful photography and the musical score is not quite so repetitively redundant as the predecessors, but the production in general moves much more slowly. That is sometimes to its advantage; it is, so to speak, less exciting and more contemplative. If I had it to do all over again I'd do it all over again (buy this DVD, that is). Just be prepared for a change of pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasia was prettier, Beatles cartoon funnier","review":"This is 90 minutes of slooow computer graphics, mingled pretentiously with montages of wax-museum faces, bits of advertising of all eras, still photos of abandoned buildings and of course The Mushroom Cloud! \\"Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\\" I have liked much of the music from Phillip Glass's operas; that's why I bought this disk. I have to say, the visuals here succeed in making Glass's score sound melodramatic, trite, and vapid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naqoyqatsi is a horrible film-and not at all worth seeing","review":"I doubt Reggio decided before doing Koyanisqatsi that he would create a total of 3 films-all which have no correlation whatsoever. I think it is false advertising to call these 3 films a \\"Trilogy\\" when the only thing they all have in common is the fact that it is all images and no dialogue. I watched this on DVD and saw that Reggio compiled a bunch of stock footage and just edited it creating a hodgepodge of meaningless, repetitive visuals that were lacking in originality.Koyanisqatsi was a great film, in my opinion. Unfortunately, Naqoyqatsi did not live up to my expectations and left me w/a poor impresson of Reggio as a director. My boyfriend and I scanned fast forward on the DVD and could not believe how nothing tied together. If people want to sit and assume, or buy into the idea that this is a masterpiece-then you are creatively challenged. The only way to find this remotely interesting is to drop some blotter or fungi and watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Fricke = No Backbone","review":"In plain English: a team of self-important politically correct types decided to prove that they can do it withoit Ron Fricke, who was the artistic spirit behind the previous two films of the series. They failed. Thickly laid-out propaganda, tiresome, flickering, mostly uninventive computerized graphics, envious prejudice masquerading as its own cure. Philip Glass repeated himself one time too many: anybody musically literate can write better. True talent and acute intellect (Ron Fricke) left this group; what remains is pitifully disjointed and shallow. Watch the beautiful, stunning \\"Baraka\\" instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Vomit","review":"What a complete disappointment. I waited patiently for 15 years for the completion of the Qatsi trilogy, and Reggio pukes up a video nightmare. The first two films had moments of beauty to contrast the theme of technological hell, but Naqoyqatsi is completely bereft of any aesthetics whatsoever. Only the beginning shots of an old Michigan train station and later of deep iterations of the Mandelbrot Set held any kind of aesthetic quality. This is just a moralistic harangue about how the 21st century, with all its dizzying digital unreality, really and truly sucks. Yo Yo Ma was good, but that's about it. Man, I hate the 21st Century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music Great, but the Movie Absolutely Sucked","review":"This movie is the weakest of all of the \\"qatsi\\" movies. I've watched it 3 times now and it still has no rhyme or reason to it. It looks like they made it because Philip Glass had written the final score of the trilogy and they just a slapped together a movie to go with the music, which is a shame because the music is excellent.I gave Koyaanisqatsi 5 stars, Powaqqatsi 3 stars, but this I give this 1 star all just for music. Save yourself some money and buy the CD, which is fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many [American] Flags","review":"This film has some beautifully striking moments but, on the whole, there are just plain too many [American] flags for most people to stomach and, after a while, even the most admiring aficionados of the \\"-qatsi\\" series are going to notice that the letters \\"U.S.A.\\" appear too often. If you want patriotism, go to a baseball game with \\"Who Let the Dogs Out\\" as piped music - for \\"Naqoyqatsi\\" it goes as well as cyanide in the blood stream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Primary resource material of the greatest interest","review":"More than a century after his death in 1897, Henry George remains one of the most original and influential economic thinkers in American history. His revolutionary theory on land taxation gained a tremendous following, reshaped the nation's political and economic debate, and continues to be widely discussed throughout the world.

He made the most extensive use of the newest technologies, took the best care of his men, and had the best record of all of the commanding generals - not one loss - even though he was originally from Virginia and fought for the North. He was thus perceived as being a threat to the advancement of the careers some of the other generals, notably Grant and Schofield. This excellently written and documented book by Francis F. MicKinney lays bare the political cross-currents and intrigues in the military of those times and presents Grant and Sherman as they really were and not as they made themselves out to be in their memoires.

I found it easy to read and thought provoking. Although other reviewers have been disappointed in the \\"happy, God loves you, grace for all, tolerance\\" message they claim the book holds, I didn't feel that way. I don't think this book was written for a non-Christian audience who is seeking a Savior. I found it an encouraging and interesting way to see what my Savior did for me and all of us on the cross.

It's always great to hear Margo singing and her supple, expressive tones. The songs on the new CD are mostly acoustic oriented, although they do rock out (a little) on occasion (as on \\"Stars Of Our Stars,\\" which has a hint of 10,000 Maniacs to it). I like the winding blues of \\"Hunting Ground,\\" one of those dramatic Junkies songs that gradually closes its grip on the listener and builds to an impressive climax. This is some involving Americana music. (I guess technically it's \\"Canadiana.\\") I do wonder, though - some tracks have an unnecessarily harsh or fuzzy sound, as if they were going for a spontaneous \\"jam session\\" feel.

She deserves all the credit in the world, not only for succeeding, but for championing a segment of the wrestling business not generally accepted when she entered it. Women's wrestling has always smacked of \\"carny\\", as does its male pantomime counterpart. This Lady made it (sans drugs, cocaine, pot or steroids!) with dignity, self-confidence, and very little to eat in her early mat years. That she last won her title back at the age of 76 is nothing short of astounding. A lot of people can't even walk at that age. Her life - and how she lived it - make for great reading, but I'm sure even greater living. Now that it's over and completed, and the final chapter has been written, we can truly realize that Lillian Ellison - The Fabulous Moolah - was, indeed, FABULOUS, in every sense of the word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moolah is Fabulous, in her own mind that is","review":"After the success of Mick Foley's first autobiography it seems that everybody associated with the pro wrestling business is now writing their tales of the squared circle. Sadly, while Foley's book was excellent, the majority of these wrestling books are cheaply put together pieces of lies, fluff and self-promotion. You can add Lillian Ellison's name to this list, although to be technical, the actual name would be Fabulous Moolah. Moolah is one of those people who got famous by being around for so long, that everyone would just assume there must be something special about her. This book, however, shows just how conceited and deluded she is when it comes to her place in wrestling history. To read these pages you would think that wrestling begins and ends with Moolah. Well, women's wrestling nearly did end BECAUSE of Moolah, but that's another story....All in all, yet another ... cash-in on the wrestling boom that is insulting to the readers' intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme a break!","review":"Gimme a break if you wanna read a good wrestling book read Mankind Have a nice day dont waste your money on this book!

For example, the book mentions Warren's Met Audition on the Air. A fellow artist, John Carter, recorded his parts of the program - which included the duet from THE PEARL FISHERS with Warren. The annual CD for a UK magazine, THE RECORD COLLECTOR, included this track. Why couldn't it have been used by the Warren Foundation. Ditto for Warren's live Met material, much of which is beyond the 50-year copyright limit.The answer is that instead of celebrating Warren's art, their goal was a quick buck from readily availabe material.

I am assuming that if you are considering buying a complete season of a TV show you know what the show is about and therefore won't comment on the show itself but on the boxset details.The box is very slim (which I like - shelf space is a scarce resource here). It comes with only 2 DVDs (11 episodes each) and a small episode guide in a sheet of paper, that's it.There's no additional material whatsoever (no featurettes, etc), which is fine with me anyway, since I'd rather get all the episodes at this very decent price than pay... more for an interview or whatever.Picture quality is very good, which is news to a 10 years old TV show put in DVD.

Verizon wireless charges $30 for theirs, so I thought I would save a little money. The cable that they sent connects to the phone, but doesn't work with the vcast software or samsung software. The only way that it works is with some basic, third party software that is recommended by the company. It doesn't organize playlists or work with existing systems in the phone. It's no more than an ftp client for the storage card. That wouldn't be too bad, but the data tranfer rate is about as fast as a serial cable. It took over 10 minutes to add one song onto my phone.

Alice Hoffman is one of my favorite authors because she writes wonderful novels, this one was no different."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was very disappointing.","review":"Sorry Alice, you are my favorite author but this is the worst book you have ever written! This book is basically about a post Vietnam war gangster scene and a girl who will do anything to belong. However, not only was the portrayal of violence swayed toward dark comedy. Many questions were left unanswered. Consequently, the scene is drab and never changes and always refers to the street or the gangster's club house. I wanted more! I wanted to know who the main character's family was, and who MckKay really was.

It is an excellent book written by Alice Hoffman. She is my favorite author. I am never let down when I pick a book to read by her. Property of is about a girl who wants McKay, the leader of the pack on the avenue. She will do anything to get him to love her. She will lie for him, do drugs for him, or anything just to be around him. She loves McKay so much. She doesn't belong to him though. She belongs to no one. When McKay starts doing heroine and can't stop, will she know what's best for her? Will she still want to love McKay? The book will make you see how someone can really be in love to dedicate themselves to a person. It is a great book that is worth reading.

I hope they never make a movie of 'Property Of', thereby ruining it. Potential Readers: Try and ignore the naysayers. Why pick apart things you don't like when all the things put together make the novel what Ms. Hoffman intended it to be? True, heroin and gangs suck in real life. Just because you might never have wanted to belong so badly doesn't make the book a bad one. I still have my original copy from 78? 79? and it's coming apart. I'm buying another copy because I want to pass this one on...This is a great book. Dark, yes, depressing at times, yes. But very realistic to falling in love with a guy who doesn't know what love is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, Superbly Written Novel","review":"Alice Hoffman's first novel contains some of her best writing--fascinating and well-developed characters, phrasing that will remain etched in your memory for a long time. The emphasis on drug use may be off-putting to some, but if this won't bother you, this is the book to start with if you're new to Hoffman's writings--or to get posthaste if you like her work and have somehow missed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"PROPERTY OF SHOULD BE PROPERTY OF THE BIRDS! FOR THE BIRDS!","review":"I hate to be a dissenter, but I just didn't like this book. Although it was well-written and a realistically grim picture of urban gang life, I just could not like any of the characters. Danny the Sweet was the only quasi-decent one in the bunch. Even though this is trivial, I found the sobriquet \\"the Sweet\\" irritating. What bothered me most was the sheer sexism that was not only practiced, but accepted and even welcomed by the female characters. The title itself is very revealing -- women were nothing more than \\"chattel,\\" or \\"Property.\\" I didn't like the onstant references to the female characters as \\"the Property,\\" \\"Orphan (or Pack) Property.\\" It was a dehumanizing treatment of women and certainly made for some very unsympathetic and unappealing charcters, including the unnamed protagonist. I loved every other book Ms. Hoffman wrote except for this one.

Adam Smith gave the bourgoise a theory stating that their oppression of the working class was for the common good of all mankind, thus serving as an apology for oppression.This book is a lousy apology.

Only people who has never been to Brazil will find this book interesting and that is because they don't realize that it is just a sequence of either inaccurate or absolutely false information.

There are some memorable stories, such as Space Brain and fan favorite Dragon's Domain. The stories still have a pedestrian pace, the dialogue is atrocious and some of the acting questionable. But the production and special effects are top notch.Though, I have to question about the actual prints. Overall, they look great, but episodes like the Testament of Arkadia has a very dark look to it, almost if the transfer from film to DVD wasn't done properly. Or was it always this dark? Also, very few extras. It's a shame really, as Space:1999 DVDs released in the UK and Japan have far more extras, and the selection screens far more creative. France has just released the entire series on one huge boxset with loads of extras, including an episode of UFO.

WOOHOO!! The science is, well, almost non-existant.. but for some reason in this case I can forgive that. The show is the ultimate adventure and when you combine that with the hypnotic music.. wow! I just watched Deaths Other Dominion and was reminded of the incredible acting in this episode. VERY dramatic!If you like science fiction and can get past a little bit (well, a LOT) of bad science and just enjoy the adventure, this is definitely for you.

Most notably is the episode, The Full Circle, which I thought was similar to watching an episode of Gilligan's Island. The crew of Moonbase Alpha go down to yet another planet, walk though the mist, and become cave people. The last bad episode worth mentioning is The Last Enemy. On the one side of the battle that Moonbase Alpha gets caught up in are military women who look like they've just come from the hairdresser, or are backup singers for the Swedish group ABBA, and the other faction consists of an old man with his eyes closed. This was a bad episode, I mean REALLY bad, like Mystery Science Theater 3000 bad.One halfway decent episode, which is why I give this DVD set a rating of two stars, instead of one, is War Games, which has the greatest number of explosions and destruction since the first episode, Breakaway."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic sci-fi!","review":"I've always loved the space 1999 series for its fabulous sets and its exceptional special effects-even by todays standards.

I used to love them. The last order I received was put up in a generic paper container with really flimsy cellophane wrapping. There is no writing on the paper sack whatsoever. The taste is sub par as is the amount of rinds. As I said, I used to love the product.

But I have to ask if I am the only person who is displeased with the format of these discs? No \\"play all episodes\\" option..............multiple steps to go through to play each episode individually then to return to the main menu again...........just very inconvenient. This is the only reason not to love the MTM Show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MTM tonight? Yes, please....","review":"I am not a fan of sitcoms, or even TV but MTM is awesome!

This collection is Part One of what I have been waiting for concerning the MTM Show! I am truly impressed with the quality of this collection and the care with which it was produced. All of the extras included on the DVDs are just superb. This set is a keeper for a lifetime. 20th Century Fox, I hope you are reading this! Give me more! I do look forward to the DVD sets of the other 6 seasons. And I think a disc of outtakes/bloopers would be a great addendum! Mary and the rest of her cast and crew really shine in restored glory. Buy this - you will not be disappointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Box Set","review":"I must wholeheartedly agree with those who have praised this box set. It is wonderful! I grew up with the show and watching it really warms my heart. The writing and the acting are both excellent. Buy this set! I can't wait for the 2nd set (and the rest)--Thank you FOX!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth comes out?!","review":"The latest word on the street is that the main reason FOX canceled plans to release more MTM on DVD was due to a legal battle between the studio and Ed Asner's son over inclusion of his overpriced season-by-season documentaries.If it's NOT true, then why wouldn't FOX just release the 2nd season without the documentary that Asner made?Once again, the fine print is what messes everything up! And if they don't clear up this mess, we fans may not see any further MTM season DVD sets for a very very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary Tyler Moore Season 1....JULY 05 MTM SEASON 2!!!!!!!","review":"When I was younger, I thought this show was incredibly dull and unfunny. So funny how it turns out its now one of my top most loved shows of all time and Season 1 is awesome, every episode is gold. And here is the main reason why I'm doing this review, to tell everyone that FOX HAS FINALLY COME TO THEIR SENSES, thats right, MARY TYLER MOORE SEASON TWO IS COMING OUT JULY 2005, so you all BETTER BUY IT or we could be completely out of luck for any further seasons being released. ENJOY!! JULY 2005"},{"rating":"2","title":"Closeout Sale","review":"Amazon has just bumped its discount on this DVD to 52%. Looks like they've also given up hope Fox will release subsequent seasons of the show. Maybe with good reason. A leak from Fox?I know someone out there is going to buy a crate at this price, offer them on eBay in a couple of years and get $500 a copy.How about fans of the show launching an email campaign to Bill O'Reilly at Fox News, who's relentless in his criticism of the state of current TV programming? Let's find out if O'Reilly's really serious. Love to have him as an advocate for more MTM seasons; persuading Fox either to release the remaining seasons or to sell the rights to another distributor.The situation for more seasons doesn't look very promising as Amazon begins dumping its inventory at clearance prices."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mary Tyler Moore Show-Complete First Season","review":"Oh Mary, you are now on DVD, I hope the rest of the seasonswill follow soon. Put yourself in another time, where yourbiggest fault is a bad dinner party. This is a great DVDwhen you want to get away from the real world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny","review":"As a fan of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, I had wanted to buy this First Season set for some time, but had been hesitant due to some other bad TV-to-DVD sets that I had seen and heard about. I took a chance and bought this one, and I couldn't have been more delighted with it. The sound and picture are tremendous (a BIG improvement over the videotape set that was released several years ago) and the special features are above and beyond anything I've yet seen on other TV series DVDs. And don't get me started on what a superb value this set is - you won't find another collection with so many extras for such a great price. If you're a TV comedy fan, do yourself a huge favor and buy this set...I guarantee you won't be disappointed. Kudos to the folks at Twentieth Century Fox for doing such a fantastic job, and here's hoping they keep it up for the remaining seasons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Our Lips: Release Season TWO!","review":"Just when you thought that Fox couldn't get any more clueless comes word that in March they will release a Season One \\"Starter Set\\" -- a single DVD with four episodes from season one.Now, and here's the really inane part, this single DVD set, which will carry a ten dollar list price, will also come with a ten dollar off coupon for the Complete First Season set. In other words, pay ten bucks for four episodes, then use a ten dollar off coupon (that you have to pay ten bucks for) to buy the Complete First Season set which will then render the \\"Starter Set\\" obsolete.Attention Fox ninnies: WE WANT SEASON TWO! Why is that so hard for you to grasp?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Before Its Time","review":"I have been collecting the FRASIER and CHEERS sets on DVD for over a year now. I decided I would allow myself to collect one more series (they are expensive). There was no doubt it would be MARY TYLER MOORE. I assumed it was yet to be released. I finally did a search on Amazon to see if it was forthcoming. I was shocked to see that it had been released over 2 years ago! I immediately ordered season 1.In 2002, MTM must have been one of the first series released on DVD. Maybe the newness of the idea of collecting series on DVD had not caught on yet. Or maybe the $50 price tag was seen as high back then.Now that everything is coming out on DVD and collecting series is popular, the studio should rerelease it and come out with seasons 2 through 7."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD But Sales Soft","review":"This is an impressive, comprehensive and beautifully rendered presentation of one of the best television shows ever made. As an aficianado of MTM, however, I am concerned that Fox may pull the plug soon on this series. Peter Staddon of Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment has said that sales of MTM Season One have been disappointing. In fact, he has openly wondered whether Fox should have produced a \\"Best of MTM\\" set instead. While Season Two has already been announced for March 2003, I think it is time that fans step up to the plate and buy this wonderful set as soon as possible in order to preserve the studio's faith and interest in releasing the complete remaining seasons (up to and including Season Seven) on DVD. It would be a shame to miss out on even one classic episode of this legendary series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of laughts","review":"My family really enjoyed watching these shows over again. I had forgotten how funny these shows were. It gave us some real good and clean entertainment. I have been looking for season two now for over two years. I would buy it in a heart beat. It was advertised on season one that there was to be a second season out a long time ago. What happened??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show - love the 70s!!!","review":"I was lucky to have found season 1 & 2 of MTM at Target last year and bought them ($20.00!!!) So, we all know how the greedy people can be when selling DVDs! I currently own all 5 - yes, FIVE seasons. I am on season 5 now and I have NO COMPLAINTS about the show! It's great to turn off regular TV/Cable and watch MTM commercial free. I went from all the Dick Van Dyke seasons onto Mary Tyler Moore - what's next? Rhoda? Too Close for Comfort? Most likely :)You'll want to add ALL the Mary Tyler Moore DVDs to your collection -- it's a great escape. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands the test of time...","review":"This show is every bit as funny as it was when it was on TV!

After watching the original broadcasts, it was torture to sit through the horrible quality syndicated versions! But everything looks better than new here-I haven't seen seen the subtle facial expressions and interplay of the cast look like this since the 70's. Grab it while you can, and lets hope Fox gets around to season two!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster is the best.","review":"I don't believe in all of that data transfer b.s. and any other stupid claim.

Disappointed in NJ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cord stopped working in less than a year and I hardly used it.","review":"I normally don't bother writing reviews unless I'm really happy or really disappointed with a product. I bought a few Monster Cables in 2012 along with some other less expensive cables for use with a double bass and an acoustic image bass amp. Both Monster cables felt very sturdy and were heavy duty but both worked intermittently? Last night, I had a rehearsal and I forgot to pack my inexpensive cables and the only cable I had was the Monster cable. It seemed to be working and then in the middle of the first song, it stopped working and then started and stopped again. I couldn't get it to work so I tossed it in the trash and borrowed a cable from the guitar player. I'm now about to order a few 10 and 12 foot cables that are not manufactured by Monster. Save your money and buy another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster cables, Monster sound!","review":"These cables are the best I've ever used. Heaavy duty, clear sound quality.

Then, it didn't fit--cut the breasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"wires poke through, but good bra","review":"I keep buying this bra, because I can't fine anything I like better... but I have one complaint: the stitching at the inside front where the wires end ALWAYS COMES UNDONE. The wires poke through after a few wearings. I wind up poking the wires back into place, and resewing the seam... and then they're fine for a long time. I just with they would reinforce the area where the wires end in front. Only complaint after years of wearing this style. But it ALWAYS HAPPENS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Fit, Didn't Last","review":"I loved this bra until the sharp metal underwire cut through the fabric in the front. I don't think this is repairable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah!","review":"I hope they never stop making this bra. Everytime I find one that fits and does the trick as well as this one the style gets discontinued. It is a particularly good bra for ladies who are over 50 or/and who need larger than a \\"c\\" cup.This is a great bra! Snatch some up."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm satisfied","review":"This is a good quality bra, especially for the price. True to size cup. I wear mostly minimizer bras (36DD)that don't give me the \\"back fat\\" bra lines. This bra does give me some of those lines. Otherwise, very nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"wacoal bras","review":"I have been wearing Wacoal bras for years because they offer the best fit, and this style has become my all time favorite. However, when ordering my usual size from Amazon, I immediately noticed it was somewhat \\"snug\\". I thought probably it just needed to be washed, & would probably stretch out after a bit. However, it is still just as tight. Then, this morning on NPR, during a segment on sizing, there was something mentioned about how imported garments that are shipped from other countries are not always sized appropriately for US sizes. Bingo! This must explain it. My advice, be wary of ordering expensive products that you can't try on first, or be prepared to return it. Don't think that just because you order the size you usually buy, that it is necessarily what you're truly getting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wacoal body t-back bra","review":"I love the front closure bras and this one feels comfortable all day. I was happy to find it on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Favorite bra has major flaw","review":"I love this bra because I have narrow shoulders and the t-back keeps the straps always where they belong (although this is not a good bra for wide neck tops for that reason). It is also very well made, fits well, is comfortable, and looks good under a t-shirt. I have 5 of these in nude in size 38C. Unfortunately, over time, the underwire, which is actually plastic, has broken in every one. Some lasted over a year before this happened; in others, it was less than six months. I wash them in a washing machine, and then hang them to dry. They have never been in a dryer. Maybe if I always hand washed them, this wouldn't happen. It's very disappointing, because they are expensive. I have been meaning to write Wacoal to see if they could supply me with replacement underwires, but haven't gotten around to it. I give them 2 stars because I really do love them, and I did get at least several months of wear out of them. Sigh. Back to the search for the perfect bra."},{"rating":"2","title":"COMFY!","review":"I typically do not buy bras online; my body-type and shape is hard to fit. However I could not find a t-back bra in any store whatsoever. I took a chance and went for it and am very pleased! Now I have a bra that looks great, is comfortable to wear and the straps are hidden under my sleeveless shirts. LOVE IT! I will buy more from Wacoal... no doubt. A little pricey but completely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bra!","review":"I have a hard time finding a good fitting bra and really wanted a racer-back bra.

I love this bra and I'm going to order in white and beige as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Does Run Small","review":"Absolutely gorgeous! A perfect replacement for those nylon and spandex, unlined bras Calvin Klein used to make, that made the breasts look completely natural and not \\"packaged\\" like they do with \\"contour cups.\\" Unfortunately, the band and cups do run small. A 38DD fit like a 36C. In fact, this is the second Wacoal Bra I've tried that ran small (see my review ofWacoal Women's Halo Lace Full Coverage Underwire Bra # 65547). I'd buy three if the size went up to 40D!! But alas, 99.9% of racerback and racerback-like (close-set straps) bras stop at 38D or DD. If you're a smaller chested woman, this bra is THE CURE to all those ridiculous euphemisms for padded bras: \\"molded cups,\\" \\"T-shirt bra,\\" age-defying lift\\" and my favorite, \\"seamless.\\" Thank you very much, but simple nylon over my own breast is actually seamless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missized","review":"I'm a 34DD and have worn and do wear Wacoal bras and this particular bra exclusively. I totally love this bra and all my other Wacoal bras. This is the first time I have purchased them on Amazon. Unfortunately, this time the bra was miss sized. It only measured 23 inches around. That's more than 10 inches off. Due to, no return policy, I had to keep it. I will not buy any more Wacoal on Amazon again. Obviously these are 2nds and miss sizes. Went to Macy's and picked up 2 of the same exact bra in a 34 and they were perfect. Buyer be ware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect the first time!","review":"One of the few garments that I have purchased that fit perfectly, comfortably, and securely. It is as supportive as my exercise bras and I have worn it for hours without having to adjust continuously to maintain comfort. I have ordered two more in different colors because I am so pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable","review":"I am a 34DD and with this odd size it is often hard to find a good supportive bra. Well this bra has been great for me. It lifts, supports and seperates very well. I was nervous about the sheer part seeming too flimsy but it seems to hold up well so far. It is very comfortable and is now my go-to bra. I just wish they came in more colors like cranberry. Good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"I'm not really sure where all positive reviews come from but this bra did not seem worth the $44 price tag. Like the previous reviewer I also thought this bra was lightly padded. The cup fabric is very sheer and stretchy and the bra is not at all supportive. Sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another overrated '60's band","review":"This greatest hits package demonstrates that The Spencer Davis Group really were just a one hit wonder (and \\"Gimme Some Lovin'\\" isn't an all-time great pop song, although a previous reviewer is correct in saying that probably every dj that ever played oldies has played it at every gig they've ever done. Quantity of plays doesn't always prove quality, as the works of Michael Jackson amply reminds us). Moving beyond the \\"hits\\", these songs aren't all that great as individual pieces either. Some band members might have gone on to some other things, but all in all, this group of r&b rockers is pretty mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hire an editor!","review":"This review has two parts.1. The information about each episode is invaluable.2. The writing, proofreading, and editing are so poor this book is physically painful to read. It also has no index.If all you want is a list of episodes with information about broadcast dates and casts, do a Google search for the various radio logs available for free on the web.

And if someone in your life is screwed up and treats you like crap, it's YOUR fault because YOU didn't PRAY hard enough. Save your money. This book isn't worth it even if they gave it away.

But now that it's no longer free shipping with Amazon I probably won't be ordering it again, which is a shame. Though, now that it's colder, I had a hard time getting it to grow, and when it did grow it didn't last as long... I think I will search for a way to grow grass for my cat that is a bit more permanent than this. But I will miss the ease of use this has, and when it gets nasty (bugs or wilted) you can just throw it away.I gave it only 4 stars because it has to be put in a container, which is not the best solution since if I had a pot for growing things I wouldn't be getting this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got it but hasn't grown yet.","review":"I got my package 3 days after I ordered it.

I'm a beginning amateur, so I don't have a significant amount of gear, and wanted this bag just for times when I wanted to take everything with me, and for keeping it stored at home. While the size might have been okay, it's still probably a tight squeeze for even my small amount of gear. The problem with this bag though, is there is a lip of fabric that covers the zipper. It is very snug, so to zip and unzip the case you have to fold the fabric up all the way around. No one else mentioned this in the reviews I read, so maybe this doesn't bother other people, but I can't see how it wouldn't.

I do have a couple of complaints, but overall it's a good bag. My first complaint would be that you can tell that it's cheaply made. But for the price, I wouldn't expect anything other than that. Second, I have a Nikon D50, and it's a bit of a tight squeeze. Once you get the camera body, lense, battery charger, and tabletop tripod (included), you can't fit much else. If I were to buy a spare lense, I doubt it would fit. I would've also liked a few more pockets. But if you have a smaller camera, such as the D40, I could imagine it would fit pretty well. If you have a few spare lenses, you might want to try something bigger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy but small","review":"Nice strap, sturdy construction. The flap around the zipper can be tedious, but feel like its more of a safety thing, so not complaining about it.Overall I'm pleased with the bag for the equipment I have.

I also carry my battery charger and extra lens cap, plus my tripod attachment and cleaning rag. It's a tight fit, so if you have more than that, go bigger!Oh yah, the table top tripod is a joke.

The plot was action-packed and kept me wanting to read more. The military scenes were usually very realistic. The characters were well-developed and you wanted to get to know them.My only complaint is the very basis of the book, the Face on Mars, is somewhat far-fetched, barely explained and strange. I understand that there are more books coming explaining the Face of Mars, but I found this blatent twist of reality annoying in a book that otherwise went so far to be realistic and accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Marines only.","review":"I've read the first 6 books starting with \\"Semper Mars\\", when I got 1/2 way through book 6 I became fed up with Mr. Douglas trashing the U.S.Army.

The characters lack depth, the dialog is banal, and the premise is laughable. Take out the very small bits of science fiction and you have a U.S. Marine soft porn story.The author makes the same mistakes that Ayn Rand made with her novels.

This might disqualify me as a reviewer. On the other hand, I can't think of the last time I stopped reading a book this quickly, even a terrible one. What's more, the jingoistic U-S-A tone of the book is actually a nice attraction for me. So what's the problem? First, lame and stereotypical dialogue. Second, a crude and tasteless sex scene. It's tough to turn me off with a sex scene, but this one managed it in spades. I recommend skipping this series and going straight to Jack Campbell's Dauntless series. Besides its other merits, Campbell's series has a great opening that gets you into the action right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ohhh-rahhh","review":"After \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and this book, you'll want to reach out and thank every veteran and serving service man and woman.I just fininshed it today and am still emotionally attached to the marines portrayed.

Not just for Space Marine fans","review":"After reading all 3 books of the \\"Heritage Trilogy\\" I felt compelled to write a review. I am one of those many readers who go through 'phases' and read tons of different types of books. I read most of the 'Starfist' series, which I found mildly enjoyable (except #2, skip that one). Anyway, I figured these would be quick, action packed, easy reads. I was partially right. There is action, and alot of Space Marine patriotism. Just what I was hoping for. A very pleasant surprise however was Mr. Douglas' excellent plot and character development. Unlike many series, where it appears the author(s) just decided to stick a new story onto the last one without any real regard for continuity, The Heritage Trilogy delivers. I found it to be fresh, interesting, and much more than just a bunch of Marines-fighting-against-impossible-odds cliches. I highly recommend \\"The Heritage Trilogy\\" in its entirety. Each book is better then the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"The author MUST be a combat-tested Marine","review":"I find it difficult to give five stars to any book, but if 4.9 had been available , this one would have received it.

Reading is one of my favorites forms of entertainment and with the advent ebooks and self published authors, the number of new published books are staggering.

'16mm' is a more cohesive, haunting, beautiful and listenable record than 'Vent fou' was, even though that one was already astounding. On here Jorane experiments with moods, rythms and arrangements. You can feel the passion for music and the lust for life through every song, even though many are quite dark. She also decided to give up words for this album, which to me is a good thing because I always felt they were intruding on her universe before. Her voice does not need any word to speak. A magical, strange and important album that I will always cherish.

Due to his short comings in life he went through numerous marriages, friendships and relationships. I've read the actual manuscript seized during the search warrant of his Eagle Rock home. It matches almost line for line what occurred at fires that were started in Glendale and some that were many miles away from where he lived. Coincidence?????? I think not.....I KNOW he committed more arson fires he was never charged with nor convicted of.......I know of one other individual that he convicted for arson fires that he (Orr) committed.

It includes a arsonist act of a large hardware store that killed a toddler and his grandmother. As the former book discusses, this was the actual event of Los Angeles fire that left a boy, grandmother, and others dead. The author, John Orr, is the culprit. I read the Wambaugh book, but I have not read the convicted killer's book. I have no intention of giving him the satisfaction of buying the book. I hope that he reads this review.

As my grandmother had this disease also several years ago, and I cared for her also, I wanted up to date information on the disease and our options. I was the only caregiver for both my grandmother and my mother, and this book was invaluable in validating my feelings of sorrow, frustration & lonliness. It explained the disease and it's progression, also that it is NOT a bad thing if you ask for help from professionals and friends. When a person has Alzheimer's disease, the primary caretaker is usually a family member, and quite often is isolated from most outside activities. Many times, other family members and friends avoid the caretaker & patient. For myself, this disease is a slow grieving process, as you see that person leaving slowly, while still being here. This book is a great resource to help the caregiver in their life with the Alzheimer's patient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Politics as Usual","review":"After reading \\"America Afire\\" by Bernard A Weisberger, I understand just how smoothly the last two Presidential elections here in America went. I can't even begin to imagine Rush Limbaugh's take on the campaign of 1800. Of course he couldn't have done job back than, because he would have been arrested under the sedition acts.The election of 1800 which gave us Thomas Jefferson as our third President was truly the first of its kind. A truly contested office with more than one National party and plenty of back room deals. It was also the blueprint for what our forms of governmental elections have become. In this book you will learn to appreciate a few hanging chads in Florida and some uncounted absentee ballots in Ohio. Perhaps the most importation lesson that can be learned from to great men [Jefferson and Adams], is that you can have truly differing belies in how best to govern our country, be political enemies and yet still stay life long friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy Urban Cooking","review":"This book was a gift for a couple who live in a huge city and want to cook healthy meals.

It then prepared you to expect the rest of the book to have simple meals that new cooks could do. That wasn't the case. The recipes look good.

I don't know what happened. I have broken two high E strings now in normal tuning with normal playing. No crazy bends, whammy bar pulls, or anything like that. I just play on the string and they snap off right at the bridge. Worthless and a waste of money.

Keep in mind the negative reviewers are probably a little more vocal than the positive ones. :PI had an old set of 11-52's on my guitar for almost two years, I decided it was time to change them just because they were so dull sounding. I keep my tele tuned to Eb instead of E, so the strings aren't tensioned as tight as they might be. I put these new 12-54's on and the high e (e flat actually) string broke within 5 minutes of playing. I was doing a full step bend, not incredibly stressful for the string. Not cool. Like I say I've never had a problem before though, so it could just be an anomaly.One little thing that has changed is the end spool things. I think they used to be anodised, now they are painted. It really doesn't matter since nobody sees them but they aren't as pretty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummed out in Afghanistan","review":"I ordered these to replace the strings on a 3/4 size Strat I found.

O.K. it is only 3 bucks but still, You stole 3$ from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Substitute for Super Slinkys","review":"I bought these because they were slightly less expensive than the Ernie Balls, and they're pretty good.

I picked these strings up for him and he was very pleased. The strings are color coded, making them very easy to put on, and with moderate use (two or three times a week) they should last for three to four months before needing to be replaced.The strings have very good slide for about the first month but will start to stick a bit after that if you don't keep them clean. It's a good idea to pick up a good string cleaner to keep your strings working at their best.I'm not the guitar player, my husband is, but he really likes these strings and we will continue to buy them, especially at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Industry Standard","review":"I have these strings to my husband, a professional musician, to test out.

I bought these strings for my son as he likes to play with the drop D and C at times. When you put a heavy gauge on the bigger strings, you get a very nice response even when the string is looser to accommodate that low grunge sound that the modern bands are using. It does what it is designed to do and it does it very well.

I got turned onto them about a decade ago by a coworker. The color coded ends are great whether you are new at changing strings or just want it more automated if you are an old veteran. With stretching, they stay in tune fine. The unknown truth about non-nylon strings (and maybe even them, too) is that there are only a handful of string makers, and D'Addario actually makes them for other companies (Gore uses them for their Elixir series, and just adds the polyweb coating). I also use the GHS standard .010 sets, and they are good too. My faves are the Ernie Ball sets, but they rarely go on sale. I don't remember who makes what strings for what companies, though. With offshore production a standard thing now, it's no telling where they actually come from anyways. I DOUBT that GFS strings are domestic production, for instance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 2 for the price of 3","review":"The strings are great but I gave this rating because when I bought the 3 pack of strings in one of the packs one of the strings was to short, so I really only got 2 sets that I can use....."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sweet sound of music...","review":"I replaced the factory strings on myDean Playmate Avalanche Junior Solid Body Electric Guitar, Metallic Silver, 3/4 Sizeand what a difference in sound.

The best part is, the sound is so much brighter and louder. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price for great strings","review":"I've been loyal to D'Addario for a very long time now - and there's nothing wrong with finding a decently priced 3 pack of strings every now and then, especially since you can spend upwards of $8-10 a pack these days in certain local and chain storefronts.So, there's nothing more to say outside of that these are the same great quality strings for a much better price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar strings","review":"These strings sound great they are easy to bend to the next full note.

With these strings, though, it's like a new instrument: absolutely playable and sounds great! I can't vouch for the quality of whatever was on there before, but I have to say that these strings can perform miracles under the right circumstances. They have a nice bright sound and impeccable intonation. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"D'Addario makes the best","review":"Folks, I've tried them all from Dean Markley to Ernie Ball. All have their good and bad points. But after 22 years of guitar playing, D'Addario still makes the best electric guitar strings for my money. Although I prefer the super light top, regular bottom version, I have always loved the feel, tone and durability of D'Addario strings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Strings","review":"D'Addario EXL110 guitar strings are a bright, crisp sounding string that guitarists have been turning to for decades. They have a full tone and hold their tuning exceptionally well during the course of a set. They are one of the best sounding strings I've used on my Gibson SG Standard, though not quite as warm and rich sounding in comparison to the Gibson Vintage Reissue hex-core strings I normally use. These D'Addario EXL110 strings tend to go dead fairly quickly though, I'd give them 2 weeks between restringing before they really start sounding flat and don't hold their tune. This isn't really an issue for the active players who like to change their strings between gigs though, these aren't the best suited for the casual player who thinks they shouldn't change their strings but once every few months. I'd not hesitate to recommend giving these strings a try if you haven't yet, these are pretty much the \\"standard\\" other strings are judged by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clasic sound, great quality","review":"These bright sounding strings are easy to play, hold up well and rarely break. One of my favorite strings for my Les Paul. I tend to go with Ernie Ball Super Slinky's on my Strat, but these would probably sound nice on a Strat as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thick, rich tone with fast and flexible tops","review":"These string are exactly what I've been looking for. I've been using them about 6 months and have been through enough packages to really grow fond of them. Thick round lows that can still be bent in a pinch, but also fast and slinky top strings that can really fly and wail. Set your amp bass up a bit, a little treble too and lower the midrange to get that crisp hollowed out middle to sound very present and warm or a little snappy based on what you play. Since guitar is a midrange instrument anyway, these strings help the overall range by making the most of the tops and bottoms, especially bottoms.This is like picking out a custom gauged set except you don't have to buy all the strings individually. D'Addario has matched up a cool set that is at home with rock, jazz, country, etc. And of course, the quality is D'Addario. 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite at the right price","review":"This review is forD'Addario EXL116 Nickel Wound Electric Guitar Strings, Medium Top/Heavy Bottom, 11-52.For a recent project, I started needing to tune to Eb, dropped Db (Db,Ab,Db,Gb,Bb,Eb). My usual strings were a little too loose for this. I prefer solid tone and sustain to ease of playing. I tried several brands and gauges of strings. None felt quite right until I put a set of these on. I put them on, gave the a good stretch, and knew right away I had found my new strings. I now use them on all of my guitars. On the ones that are tuned to E, I could imagine a slighly lighter gauge being better for some people. It does get a little tight. But I can deal with it. And these are perfect for dropped tunings down to Db/C#, and even down to C."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lennon's voice is good enough","review":"I recently purchased this CD even though I had been warned that the sound was really bad. Yes, the sound is pretty bad, but I just wanted to hear Lennon singing these songs. I love Stand By me and when he started singing Bony Maroni I started grinning.

In it he belts out some of the old standards--and they are unrestrained, raw and raucous. \\"Stand By Me\\" outshines the original. Only a lightening bolt has more energy than these performances. The remastered version contains some new tracks and they don't add a lot to the original. No matter, it's still a must-have for all Lennon fans. By the way, if any of you are ever in Cleveland, make sure you visit the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The original leather jacket that Lennon wore for the album cover (and it's the same jacket he wore during his Hamburg and Liverpool days) is featured there along with a lot of other Lennon memorabilia. It's rather touching to see it in person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock On!","review":"Being a Beatle fan I'm ashamed to admit that I didn't know this album was out there. I discovered it when I read Tim Riley's biography of John Lennon. Some of my favorite Beatle songs are the old rock and roll numbers from their early days. This CD did not disappoint. We are all familiar with \\"Stand By Me\\" but John's renditions of \\"Be-Bop-A-Lula,\\" Sweet Little Sixteen,\\" \\"Bony Moronie\\" rock. Pun intended. If you like early rock and roll John's musical journey back to his roots is a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"A turgid mess","review":"John Lennon revisiting the rock-and-roll gems of his youth? Sounds great, until you actually hear the results. Aside from the first cut, a snappy version of Gene Vincent's \\"Be-Bop-A-Lula\\" (which Paul McCartney also covered on \\"Unplugged\\"), the whole thing is a soggy, bludgeoning mess. Phil Spector, who Lennon brought in to produce, left after completing only four tracks. Alas, Lennon chose to adopt Spector's elephantine production style, dangerous enough in the hands of its inventor and pure poison in anybody else's. It's a pity. Buddy Holly, Little Richard, Chuck Berry--they all got the red-carpet treatment from the Beatles, who not infrequently matched or surpassed their original inspirations. Here you find Lennon paddling clumsily in the wake of his heroes. Even his off-the-cuff version of \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" on \\"Live Peace in Toronto,\\" hastily rehearsed during a transatlantic plane flight (!), puts this recording to shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"OLD SONGS","review":"If you like old rock and roll get this one. john is in top form soon after this yoko stepped in oh no !!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD, but . . .","review":". . . you have to appreciate the music period the songs are from and accept the fact that the sound recording could have been done better.

I would play my little plastic guitar (im an accomplished blues/rock guitarist now; I'm almost 14)and I would sing whatever I thought the lyrics were. I would drive my parents nuts with this tape later on. In the car, I would listen to the same songs over and over again, just every time I got in the car with them. The three specific songs I would always listen to were Slippin and Sliddin, Peggy Sue, and Medley: Bring it on home/send me some lovin'.

I like the Draw 50 series, some books more than others and this is one of the best. It follows the Draw 50 format of a text intro and then many pages of step-by-step projects. It can be easily followed. I'd rate it for ages 8 and up. It is a great way to get started with drawing. You need to start somewhere and this book almost guarantees good results. While you are following the directions, you are also learning about building up shapes, etc. Even for the non-beginner, this is a good reference book. Sometimes, I am more in the mood for playing with colour (coloured pencils, watercolour, etc.) and this helps get the drawing done well, when one doesn't feel like fussing. That can help unlock artist's block, too. Overall, it's full of basic, good lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankyou","review":"My 86 tear old Mother Loves her new panties she says how comfortable they are fans easy to pull up Thankyou"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I haven't had the occasion to use this product, hence I cannot comment on it's performance!

The only reason the overall rating is 4 stars is because the graphics are low by today's standards, but in 1998, they were some of the best. The network games were a blast, but sometimes one your partners would freeze up and be unable to move. Maybe if they update and re-release this game the network games will be able to handle large networks of players and maybe they can work some AI Karma into the plot line. I seldom play this game (or any other) now, but I played it when my neices and nephews were visiting and my wife commented, \\"You've been playing that game for 10 years!\\" It is pretty awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It gets your attention right away then slows things down so you can become invested in the character and their development. I also read the other 2 books which I love them as well. I think it is awesome they now have this on Kindel so I never have to worry about lossing my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian Propaganda =(","review":"The beginning of the book is fantastic. However be warned that seventy percent into reading everything becomes unrealistic.ALL the characters end up being like the princess: absorbed in God's grace to the point of blindness. This transformation is told unrealistically. Three people in the book give up addictive opiates with no difficulty??? Jesus saves all who call except the bad guys. A godly message is fine all and good but the author should have warned her readers that this book is Christian propaganda with a good beginning and pitiful ending. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy and Predictable.","review":"While the story itself was nice, it was fairly standard fare as far as man has hard childhood, does bad things, woman redeems him with her faith.

Unfortunately the whole book reads like a sermon and reaches an obnoxious level very quickly. Unless you are really religious and like to say \\"praise god\\" every couples of sentences I'd skip it and spend some time banging your head against a wall, its certainly more entertaining than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I got this book expecting a medieval historical fiction sort of novel but instead it was a Christian story. I wish the book summary was more clear on the Christian aspect so I knew before that it wasn't my type of novel. The further into the story I read the more the characters mainly talk about God which made for slow plot development. I also felt like the story ended halfway through the novel and the author just didn't know when to stop writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong start; abrupt fizzle","review":"What starts out as a potentially worthwhile historical fiction tome takes an abrupt detour into a weakly written, boring and relentlessly proselytizing Christian dialogue. The author knows how to grab and pull the reader in.

I am thinking of getting the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Urg! Warning: Unreadable Except by Fundamentalists","review":"Amazon, please include in brief reviews of books when their content is entirely religious. The movement towards \\"christians\\" (fundamentalists who believe in strict gender divisions, that violence can be justified, and that the devil is literally among us in heathens) writing fantasy books and marketing them for free through Amazon is very frustrating when I download them thinking I might get a good read in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly \\"truth in advertising\\" moment","review":"I read this as a free title for my new Kindle gift. I am glad that it was offered free. I truly enjoy medeival, \\"historical\\" type fiction. I thought the book well written, and the characters mostly well-fleshed. However, the over the top proselytizing, Christian thumping became quite heavy handed by the last third of the book. I have no issues with Christian based fiction but think that the engaging plot got washed over by the desire to overpreach the message. To be fair, it should be mentioned in the write up that this title is heavy in Christian themes and discussion. I find that I do not wish to read the second book in this line as I really don't wish to wade through the religious smackdown created in the first to re-engage with the characters in this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont let the free price fool you","review":"I happened upon this novel and decided to give it a chance after all it was free. As it turns out this is one of best books I've read in a long time. The story has well developed characters you can care about. Tahn is a man tortured by a cruel set of circumstances but in the end the book really speaks to the heart of forgiveness. After reading it I actually sought out other books by L.A. Kelly and brought both her other Kindle books which are sequels to this story. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes christian fiction but even if you don't, the story is worth reading. It is set in kind of medieval times when men rode on horse and fought for a ladies honor. There is plenty of action and the book moves quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tahn: A Christian Novel","review":"I couldn't make it through half of this book. Heavy-handed in Christian speak, I felt it detracted from the story itself. It was a chore to get to the point where I stopped reading because I was hoping it would get better. I don't mind books with religious undertones but this was screaming with it...sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Christian' is an understatement","review":"I could have liked this story.. the title character is almost compelling. But the \\"salvation through Jesus\\" is just too, too heavy handed. Maybe \\"uber Christian\\" is a better label. It is like Jesus/loving God is a character in this story. If I had realized just how preachy this book was, I would have never bought it, even for free. It is the first book I actually \\"deleted\\" from my Kindle. There is a good story... but it really just a vessel for the author's mission to spread the Word. And that's I'm sure what she had in mind. She does describe writing as her calling - this book is her outreach ministry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive","review":"This novel is presented as dark fantasy but is really a cover for the author's preaching. It is set in a fictional world but still refrences Jesus and quotes Chritian scripture. Unacceptable as fantasy, unbelievable as Christian fiction. I wish Amazon would identify which books were religious rather than leave the reader feeling duped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too religious","review":"None of the reviews I read warned me that every second sentence had the word God or Jesus in it. I have no problem with religious characters in a book, but this was over the top. Otherwise I liked the story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"uber christian","review":"way way way to christian for a regular reader. it was distracting how often they bring up God. i am super disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"It started great but then.....","review":"This book started out great with lots of action and good character building. However, about half to a 3-quarters way through it really started to slow down. It almost seemed like the story was done and the author was just trying to prolong it a bit. Overall, it's interesting and has a good plot, it just tends to be a bit preachy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish...","review":"The beginning of this story was absolutely fantastic; I was captivated and submerged into the story. The beginning encompassed both mystery and a great style of writing.About 30-40% of the way through the book, however, the dialogue becomes rushed, and I felt like I read the same message about God's mercy at least 50 times per chapter. I am an extremely passionate Christian, but the forced dialogue ruined my motivation to continue reading. The characters had great potential to be well-developed, but the author neglected many details which would have made everything more realistic.It's a shame because it started off so great. You'll become immersed in the story from the beginning, but don't expect it to get any better; you'll more than likely end up disappointed as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story but....","review":"I picked this book up at the library based on its interesting cover and write up on the back- I love medieval era fantasy. I had no idea though that it would be so full of proselytizing! There is no indication of this on the book anywhere. I can barely read Netta's self righteous rantings. The book has a great plot though and I am going to continue reading hoping her character matures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hell disguised as a novel.","review":"This \\"novel\\" is largely a waste of time. Characters are poorly developed, almost cartoon-like, melodramatic stereotypes. Consider the image of the good guy getting shot in the heart, and then taking 14 minutes (or 22 pages) to die, all the while orating about the grief of living, the ultimate success of \\"the good\\", the Grace of the Lord, and the price of chopped liver. Tahn suffers to a degree that becomes farcical, all the while denying and seeking God, while the \\"Lady\\" twit who inspires him comes across as a religious bozo. The plot is a crude morality play, fit for 6th graders, maybe, if one wishes to damage their psyches. Serious Christian questions are answered only on the elementary school level, yet manage to resolve the deepest mysteries and unbelievable suffering of the characters. Pure melodrama, but not particularly interesting. I propose that the greatest suffering about Tahn will be on the part of the reader.Caveat emptor."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Christian \\"fantasy\\" novel...","review":"There are enough reviews to give a good synopsis of this book. I merely wanted to sing some praises as a former skeptic of this genre. I love Christian historical romance novels... but the fantasy side of it?What I like about this book is that the religion is actually Christianity... not a parallel faith with different names. I suppose that was the main deterrent from reading books like this in the past. But the back of the book appealed to me so I gave it a try.A beautiful story of forgiveness, accepting grace, and breaking the bonds of the flesh, this book captured my attention from the beginning. It was full of suspense, well-developed characters, and plenty of plot.A terrific story... very well written. I look forward to more from this gifted author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading...","review":"I obtained this title as a free Kindle version, the the description sounded quite entertaining; a medieval adventure, of sorts. The story line started out fine, and the characters seemed fitting and likeable enough. THEN, about a third of the way into the story, the author begins to insert Christian inuendo and dogma in an effort to \\"convert\\" the main character. As the story progressed the religious tone and assertations became quite overwhelming, and totally overshadowed the storyline, itself. While having respect for others' religious beliefs, I cannot stomach having it shoved down my literary throat. All in all, the story was entertaining, but, I'm glad I didn't have to pay for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly disguised propaganda","review":"I forced myself through this to the end because I can't stand to not finish a book. But I should have stopped and not wasted my time. I'm assuming this was the author's first attempt at writing. Poor character development, trite plot, lame action. It feels like someone wanted to write a sunday school story but tried make it interesting to draw in preteen kids so threw in some \\"medieval-like\\" action and setting. Every other page is some repetitive speech on God's love. Or someone says \\"help me Jesus\\" and is immediately cured of some sort of opium addiction with no withdrawals or work on their part. A woman in a crowd throwing things at a suspected criminal overhears him mumble something about God or Jesus and immediately stops the abuse because she now wonders \\"Is he a murderer....or a Christian man?\\" Because of course the two things are mutually exclusive. I even got the book free on kindle and was mad that I wasted time on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tahn: A Novel (Kindle Edition)","review":"I read half this book.

With every second paragraph being a repeat of the infinite nature of Gods mercy it was, at times, difficult to determine that the story was both implausible and badly written. The characters were two dimensional at best and quite unbeleivable.

If you're looking for a great band like The Tossers, Flogging Molly, The Korrs, whatever, this isn't the one. Most of it sounds like that horrible early nineties alternarock, the Gin Blossoms come to mind. It's painfully generic in it's sound and lyrics. Infact, the lyrics sound like they were written by a goofy high school kid a couple of days before the battle of the bands. The \\"Irish\\" sound that I usually love often comes out sounding more cajun than celtic. I almost threw this cd out of my car window on first listen. If this album is going to be sold under \\"Irish rock\\" it should be sold next to the Proclaimers and 500 miles from any good band like Blood or Whiskey and Flogging Molly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goosebumps!!

What I really like about this book is its construction. The size is perfect for one thing...On a solo canoe trip I dumped because I saw a spider move right next to my head(no joke LOL. I suppose I could explain more to justify my reaction and save some pride but this is a product review). Me and all my stuff went in the water. This book was in the small hydration pack and didnt get completely soaked through but very close. Well the pages are wrinkled throughout the book and it feels somewhat stiff but there was absolutely no bleeding of ink in the text and the few color pictures that are in it. Considering how much water it absorbed and how long it took to dry out its a solid construction. The book is still fully usable. That seems important for a field guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summary","review":"Great color prints and line drawings that help to identify the plants. Good fast delivery.

The content is identical except for the cover. I've owned it since it came out and have written extensive notes in it. My copy has gotten a lot of use and been taped together more than once. I love the Peterson Field Guide system, where similar looking plants are grouped on the same page, and distinguishing features are pointed out. Wish I had the art talent that Lee's father and Margaret McKinney had. The drawings are superb, simple, yet clear. Lee did an excellent job in compiling this guide. Yes, there are a few mistakes, and after trying a bullhead pond lily rootstock, cooking it as Lee recommended, I have a hard time believing he has actually eaten one. But this is a must-own book as far as I am concerned, a great reference that has helped me learn to identify scores of edible wild plants."},{"rating":"1","title":"check your copy carefully","review":"My copy has several blank pages - missing photos, mostly.

The author shows well how to identify the edible plants and how to distinguish them from toxic ones that look similar. He also gives practical advice how to cook and eat the edible plants. I only wish the book had more color photographs.At the end of the book you will find extra sections that help you find edible plants in a specific season. For example, it is spring and you want to make jams, salads, or pickles from a wild plant. The book lists all the plants you can collect during that season. Another section deals with location: which edible plants grow in meadows, wetlands, etc.The book is well organized, color-coded, fully illustrated, and well indexed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Useless","review":"This book has very few color illustrations.

For starters the pics are all drawings, and not that great, you honestly cannot use a drawing of a plant to indentify it because so many plants look similar the leaves and the flowers can look a lot of like the color is what is different and this book limits the colors, some pic depict leaves as large when the are infact small, vice versa, buy a book with color pictures, I could identify 50% of plants with this book due to black and white illustration just to much of a pain to use really.."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my main book.","review":"I love this book and have been using it for about 10 years. The subject of edible wild plants is one that needs alot of study and I study this book even when I am not actually looking for the plants. I like the illustrations almost better than photgraphs that some books have because the detail is better. The book is divided into flower color sections as well as terain sections and types of food sections. When I first identify a plant it is from the color of the flower so I use this section the most. Even though this book is written for the East Coast it still identifies most of the edible plants that I see in the West."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"It's great to look through and find plants you've seen all over place and finally put a name on it.I can't wait to take it camping/hiking this summer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect choice","review":"As usual the Petersen Guide did not disappoint me.

The black and white pictures aren't hardly as detailed as they should be for such poor, colorless representation of the plants. How in the WORLD am I supposed to accurately spot edible wild plants when the drawings are so lame?! I'm not stupid, I know how to utilize a book to my best advantage, and at most I would say you could use this book as a cross-reference but this would not be the only book I would take with me while foraging. I initially had doubts about this book when I looked at the negative reviews, but was optimistic. Now I wish I had chosen another book. Lame Lame Lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Information, But Difficult to Determine What Plant is Being Described","review":"There is a wealth of information packed into this book, but it is very difficult to really get into it and understand: as the old saying goes, a picture says a thousand words and while there are certainly a lot of black and white pictures, there are only 15 pages (or less than 5% of the total page count) of color pictures. It would be very easy for misidentification to occur due to hand-sketched nature of a black and white drawing of various plants - while I understand color pages cost more, I'd have certainly paid it so I could make a better determination of what I was observing in the wild. The text in this manual is excellent, but I have a hard time being able to point a particular section of this book to a visual of whatever the plant is in the guide. Knowing my luck, if I relied solely on this guide I would be preparing something poisonous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Choice I've seen","review":"I looked at many other guides and all lack in some way. This one is the most well rounded and useful. Good quality pictures (some color, most black and white). Tons of plants described in detail. My favorite part is the guide to what type of plant you would find in \\"open fields, open woods, moist woods, swamps, bog, thickets, praries, etc.\\" and what season you are in. Also if a poison plant is close in appearance to something you want to eat, how to tell the difference is actually life and death, and this book tells you.Some recipes and ideas for long term storage is also a nice feature. Pictures and descriptions together. I'm going to buy another (one for my go bag and one for the family to use anytime)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Though still an excellent field guide buyers should be aware that this book is merely a rejacketed version of the 1977 edition.

Irrefutable evidence.Look at the track list, and there are dozens of stone-cold classics. From the breakneck, breathless \\"White Riot\\" to the rollicking \\"Rock The Casbah\\", we are witness to growth and evolution in songwriting, musicianship, experimentation without sacrificing any tunefulness...oh Dear God this is great stuff.Like a surge of adrenaline, The Clash demonstrates all that is great and important in passionately performed rock music. No music collection should be without this disc. You do not know rock if you do not know The Clash."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only album that matters","review":"There have been other compilations by this band:\\"The Singles\\",\\"The Story of the Clash Vol.1, and \\"Clash On Broadway\\". But there are a few factors that differentiate this from the others.For one thing, it's not an expensive box set with extra tracks the average listener does not need to have. Also, chart success wasn't what they were known for so there's more emphasis on tracks that weren't released as singles but are favorites to fans and music lovers alike. Most of the first disc is from their first album alone. Finally this double disc set puts their very best in chronological order ending with the track \\"This Is England\\" from their last studio album \\"Cut The Crap\\". This collection displays the pioneers of rebellious punk rock at their most vital. No rock fan should be without this one. Nothing here has been edited or remixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good album - essential Clash!","review":"Comprehensive 'best of' collection. Very happy that I bought it.

You get a wide selection of their music across two discs including the well known favourites \`I Fought The Law' and \`Should I Stay Or Should I Go', but there is more to this band than just those two songs. The booklet has a small essay about the bands history and makes for interesting reading. The Clash are an influential band and had a huge impact on the music scene and on artists since and this collection goes some way to show just why that is. Disc 1 has a more punk feel to it and Disc 2 more ska. You get their punk playing, discordant but completely apt singing and catchy as hell songs, what more could you want? Well worth a try.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far, the best compilation","review":"By far the best The Clash hits compilation. It's funny because I bought this CD by mid of 2003 only for the song \\"Straight to hell\\". An amazing song I had heard at the end of a Pearl Jam concert in Mexico, that type of songs the DJ play when the show is finished and wants all atendees to go home with a big smile on the face. How big my surprise was when I got home played the CD, and noticed at that time that the old and unique The Clash CD that I had by that time (Story of the Clast, vol 2) did already have that song too.Anyways, this compilation brings 4-5 new songs compare to the previous CD.I don't quite agree with a review I just read, where this person says the first CD is the one that matters. Well, I can tell you, both CDs are gold for me!.My favourite songs, surprisingly with Mick in vocals, \\"Bank Robber\\", \\"Stay Free\\", \\"Lost in supermarket\\".Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good (CD 2) greatly outweigh the bad (cd 1)","review":"I fell into the clash thanks to the Grammy preformance of Bruce Stringsteen Dave Ghrol and Mr. Van Zant.

The two companion DVDs, if you can find them, are amazing and illustrate the beginning chapters beautifully. Learning by watching someone actually do the hooking is even better than reading about it. A lot of books for beginners gloss over some important steps, and you are left wondering how to correctly put the pattern on the frame, or which direction to hold your hook, or how to turn a corner, or how to fill in a little space,etc. I don't mean to imply that the book is at all simplistic, because the later chapters detail quite advanced techniques.

And thoroughly unrealistic. The novel ,which up to the introduction of the Chalfens was rich and realistic and very, very funny, took a downward turn that it barely recovered from due to the ridiculousness of the Chalfen-clan. I am obviously recommending this book, and Zadie Smith IS an extraordinary writer, but I feel that in order to demonstrate one of the book's main purposes of alienation and the search/struggle for a personal and national identity, she unnecessarily, perhaps inadvertantly, streamlined middle-class whites into a forged stereotype. Which is a shame, as the rest of the novel is quite textured and even at times intimate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aims high, falls low","review":"It's tough to write a plausible novel in you mid-twenties. You've had limited life experience. Even worse, you don't yet realize that. If you're wise, you stick to your personal sphere and come out with something like disguised autobiography, and many authors have found success following that formula. Stray from it at your peril because if you're brilliant, you'll end up with Pickwick Papers. But if you're ordinary you'll produce something like White Teeth. This is another in that depressing line of books written by someone who's looked at life mainly through a TV set. Characters ape their on-screen representations instead of the other way around and are consequently believable only to those for whom life mimics pulp fiction. The story hops around in a vain attempt at drama and creativity. There are excellent books up for literary awards in the UK this year and some fine first novels (try Azzopardi's The Hiding Place).

I have to say though that Smith is no Dickens. Charles Dickens had compassion for his characters even when they were presented as caricatures. Zadie has the caricature part down but needs to work on the feeling. Such a cold cruel book, goodness.

I don't understand why they do what they are doing. and sometimes i think the author's language, sentence construction and word choices are getting in the way of telling the story. with this book, i have the same frustrated feeling i sometimes get when i don't quite understand what makes some modern art so \\"good.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't plow through this one.","review":"I couldn't finish this book. I just got tired of the people and it didn't seem like there was really a plot. Lots of potential, great dialog, interesting ethnic melting pot, but it lost me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grinding (my) teeth (would be more enjoyable)","review":"This book focuses on too many characters with too little development of any of them. I completed it without caring what happened to the multitude of people I'd been introduced to. It had religious, cultural and racial tones that were too diffuse to prove anything. It included two May/December convenience marriages; Muslim extremist vs. agnostic/buddist vs. born-again Christian extremists; stereotypical rejection of all that is East or West--destiny vs. scientific intervention; and racial undertones that were off base at best. An implausible and meddling \\"perfect\\" family attempts to come in half way through the book and fix the poor mixed up lower classes who are too ignorant to take care of themselves. To some, this apparently makes for a 4 1/2 star story. If you still feel a need to read it, check it out at the library and make sure you don't have overdue fines--it isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dazed and confused!!!!!!!!","review":"This could be, by far, one of the worst books I have ever read! I actually had to log on to Amazon and read the editorial review in an attempt to explain (or understand for that matter) what the book was about. An extremly slow, wordy, overly elaborate first novel, with no particular reason for being. I will say that the author has a wonderful ear for dialogue and all of her voices are quite believable, but that's all I can say. Spare yourselves and take those many hours it will take you to plod through this mess and take a nice long drive in the country!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over- rated","review":"I usually finnish a book by the end of the week but I find it hard to finnish this one because of its very flat charaters, the fact that you can't care or want to care about the characters, the plotline was like something out of Eastenders and also the fact that its very unrepresentative glimpse of black and Asian communities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engossing read","review":"Maybe it's because I'm somewhat ignorant to British, West and East Indian cultures (i.e. i'm American), I thought the book was a fun and engrossing read. I haven't really read much because I've spent the last 10 years working on a bachelor's and two masters degrees and the last thing I want to see most I the time when I get home is a book. But I found myself absorbed and completely involved in the plot and entertained from beginning to the (somewhat disappointing) end. I did think that the character of Irie was underdeveloped, though. Simply put, I liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.","review":"Not a single person in our book group could get through this book. I kept trudging through hoping something would happen, then just gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassingly bad","review":"WHITE TEETH's problem is less its story than Ms Smith's style, which reminded me immediately of Douglas Adams. But while the late Adams's constant authorial presence, leaning over the reader's shoulder to shoot acute observations at his characters, their plight or just plain LIFE, was perfect for his offbeat genre fiction, it is immediately grating in WHITE TEETH. The author lacks the wit (and, perhaps, life experience?) to make that style work, and it sits poorly with the suburban banality she seeks to ground the characters in. Frantically page-turning to see when Marvin the Paranoid Android showed up, I bailed at ~p.100, with no interest in the characters whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-credible writing.","review":"Somewhat interesting, but slow reading. My personal annoyance is her complete misrepresentation of Jehovah's Witnesses. At first I thought it was amusing and a great basis for a character. However, I am personally acquainted with many Witnesses, and her many mistakes in describing their beliefs is disturbing. I realize that this is a novel and it involves fictional characters, but she misstates so much that it erodes my belief in anything she has written about other characters and their customs and backgrounds, be it Islamic, Bengali, East Indian, West Indian, British, or whatever. She is completely non-credible as an author. Try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Have The Time","review":"I don't have the time to list all of the factual inaccuracies in this book.It is terribly distracting to read the best written prose or watch the best told film that have been poorly researched.The next time this author decides to write, homework needs to be done, and better editors need to be selected.Sorry, but we are not all that ill informed, naive or, stupid. I spent a year in Jamaica and traveled extensively throughout India on numerous trips.Please have some respect for your readers intelligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully ambitious","review":"I applaud Ms. Smith's debut. So many young women writers fall back on simplicity, cliche and stereotype in their novels, but Smith chose to tell a multi-generational, multi-ethnic, multi-layered story. With utter disregard to the oft-perpetuated \\"write only what you know\\" advice given to young writiers, Smith has crafted a complex, moving and zesty narrative which breathes life into mad families and dysfunctional individuals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, same old","review":"While \\"White Teeth\\" is at times a funny and interesting novel, it is symptomatic of many such books and films about British ethnic minorities, for example \\"Bend it like Beckham\\". While the hardships of serving up curry or running a corner shop might raise a few laughs first time round, to turn the observation of cliches regarding South Asians and Jamaicans in Britain into a fictional genre is a step too far. And this is what \\"White Teeth\\" is - not more than a catalogue of cliches regarding Bangladeshis and Jamaicans. The characters are likeable but rather one-dimensional - why buy \\"White Teeth\\" when you could chat to a Jamaican or a Bangladeshi about their historical experiences ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I have just finished this book well actually I've got about another 100 pages to go and I don't know if I can be bothered to read anymore. I had heard such good things about this book but I really just couldn't get into it and even now all this way through I am not sure what the point of the book is. As for laughing out loud well I felt more like crying. Over-hyped and over-priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOOTHLESS","review":"I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GAVE THIS BOOK SUCH A GOOD REVIEW!

WE ARE A VERY DIVERS GROUP WITH PROFESSIONALS VERYING IN AGE FROM 85 TO 24. THERE ARE AT LEAST 50% OF OUR GROUP THAT WOULD READ AN ENTIRE BOOK EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT, BUT THIS BOOK WAS NOT WORTH THE TIME OR THE MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks!","review":"Don't believe the hype! This tripe may have appeased the politically correct crowd, but My God, give me a break. Unfunny, preposterous drivel. Obviously, Ms. Smith must have a very good friend or family member in publishing. Just abysmal. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loser Gets Second Chance","review":"I'm not a fan of books where losers get second chances at life. Had her protagonist succeeded, we all would have had better things to do with our time.Smith can write, but her subject leaves me cold. Would she had left him colder."},{"rating":"1","title":"could someone correct the record please?","review":"Why were Smith's glaring mistakes passed over? Because everyone likes to laugh at colonial subjects and so getting it right is the least of it? Well just to say that \\"irie\\" is not Jamaican for \\"no problem.\\" \\"No problem\\" is Jamaican for \\"no problem.\\" Irie is a rastafarian word that means many things but usually a deriviation of cool, nice, okay... As for the other erroneous stuff about Jamaicans in the novel (it's difficult to imagine a Jamaican 19 year old woman calling a white 47 year old Briton \\"pickney\\"), I guess it goes to prove that having the blood doesn't necessarily mean you understand the culture better than the typical outsider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyed it","review":"This is an entertaining book. It's a shame that her others haven't been quite as good but this is definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"We don't get it","review":"My book group tackled this book after hearing rave reviews from National Public Radio talk shows. White Teeth was touted as THE best book of the summer. Most of the women in the group of 15 went out and purchased the book in hardcover, hoping for a wonderful experience.Instead, only two women in the group even finished the book. With the exception of one member, all found this book's characters impossibly hard to care about. The skilled writing style was not enough to keep us interested in continuing. Our discussion centered around WHY critics picked this book and WHY we didn't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of research on her part","review":"For about 1/3 of the book, the stories seemed to flow really well. After a while, I had a pretty hard time getting through the book. My biggest issue is her misinformation on Jehovah's Witnesses. As someone who's mother is one, I know for a fact that most of what she wrote about them is totally incorrect, and downright demeaning. You don't have to like or even tolerate someone of another religion, but at least get your facts straight before writing about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, Mature, Complex and Light!","review":"This book gives voice to all of the \\"Others\\" not usually given center place in Literature. Zadie Smith loves her protagonists in all their faults, complexities and strengths. This novel bursts with life and love of it but never simplifies. It respects the complexity of life and at the same time insists on the overarching forces that drive us. This is the best novel i read this year. The fact that this novel present a real depth in the treatment of her main themes is amazing because it is also HILARIOUS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"White Teeth more aptly titled ?Root Canal?","review":"This novel has been in my &#65533;to be read&#65533; pile for several months and I was anxious to get to it based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews by critiques. &#65533;Wonderful&#65533;, &#65533;Astonishing&#65533;, &#65533;Funny as hell&#65533;, the jacket promises. I failed to see the humor anywhere. What I found were angry ramblings in regard to characters that I don&#65533;t think even the author particularly liked. Ms. Smith touched on animal rights, radical organizations, love, friendship, war, marriage, religion, science, class and culture with such a brutal tone that I became more and more depressed with the turn of each page. There was no focus of the 400+ pages which (I believe) led to a rather ridiculous and completely unsatisfactory end. I&#65533;m very sorry that I devoted the time I did to trudge through this great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly overrated","review":"I was traveling to London for two weeks and saw this book recommended highly as a current composite on British life. In short I regret the time I spent reading it. It is a mass of stereotypes, disjointed stories and poor writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story, Unique Presentation","review":"Some have noted that Smith's novel introduces a vibrant character only to disappoint the reader by switching suddenly to another character for a chapter or so. They would apparently desire a novel focusing solely on the Chalfens, Archie, or the Iqbals. What is lost in character focus, however, is more than made up for by the novel's fascinating chain of events. Ironically, this achieves its purpose --- to demonstrate what happens when the worlds of these vibrant and Antipodean characters collide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Moving","review":"Although the book did prove to be well written the story itself seemed to get lost in too many words. What started off as a promising and entertaining story soon took a turn for the worst. Unfortunatly I feel compelled to finish a book once I have commited to starting it. I found myself flying through the second half just to get it over with. Thankfully the last couple of pages were able to spark my interest, but not enough to redeem itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspired, Erratic, Promising, Clunky First Effort","review":"White Teeth is an exploration of race, genetics, belief and family set mostly in the eighties and early nineties with flashback to WWII and the seventies.Zadie Smith has a pungent, comic style that is readable but not moving. I was intrigued by Millat, Samad and Joyce but didn't really care about them.The book displays deep knowledge of race and of being nonwhite in England but I found its forays into \\"science\\" murky and unconvincing.As a whole, the book fails to provide a convincing narrative or to develop its characters. Archie, whose attempted suicide opens the book, is sadly neglected.However, there are some wonderful moments such as Archie's discovery of his future wife, Samad's struggle with lust and Joyce Chalfen's obession with Millat.I can't recommend the book but I wouldn't be surprised if the author improves with age and ends up writing a book I heartily recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop-fiction","review":"Dreadful fin-de-siecle 'pop-novel'. I had the dubious honour of coming across jean-clad Ms. Smith at a literary awards ceremony the other day and her Oasis-like grunge dress sense reminded me of her writing.White Teeth is a 'cool Britannia' novel for the Blairite age: superficial and pretentious. They can try as hard as they like, but the Oxbridge-brigade can't write authentically about the trials and tribulations of life on the povery line. Caviar anyone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"I know everyone else raved about it, but I couldn't get into these characters. The plot meandered along so randomly (all those asides and flashbacks) that I had trouble keeping interested. I finally gave up about half way through the book, which I typically don't do (I'm usually a voracious reader & finish everything, even if it's a bit boring) so I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it","review":"As wtih many of the other reviewers, I wanted very much to like this book. A few good friends had told me how much they enjoyed it, but about half way into the book, I had to wonder if I was reading the same book they had. The characters were interesting and well developed, but I found parts of the plot to be unrealistic. The ending was particularly poorly conceived - abrupt and nonsensical. Overall, I was glad to be finished it. I am hopeful that the author's next effort is better crafted."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could finish","review":"It's not like me not to finish a book... and the truth is I probably will, but I've been stuck mid way thru for over a week now and frankly I have no desire to pick it up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to Read!","review":"The unlikely friendship of Archie and Samad, beginning in the cramped quarters of a WWII tank, makes for a fun and fascinating story. Smith's writing is ironic without being heavy-handed, and is full of observations about the small stuff that makes up our lives. The characters are ones you would invite in for a cup of tea, just to see how things are getting on.Take White Teeth on vacation, and bask in a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was like pulling teeth to finish it","review":"With all the great reviews and promise of an exciting new voice, I purchased the book to read on vacation. It took an enormous amount of effort to finish it. Yes, her mastery of several types of ethnic dialog is to be applauded but the story was painfully long and hard to read for something that didn't seem to say anything. She jumps from past to present from one paragraph to the next which confused me... it took me the next 3 paragraphs to figure out that she had jumped into a story from the past. And the end of the story was not indicative of the rest of the book. She spends 448 pages in excruciating detail about mindless stuff only to abruptly end the story in the last 2 paragraphs of the book - almost like she actually got tired of the story too.I've read some of her other writings and was impressed - which made this book a real let-down."},{"rating":"2","title":"white teeth","review":"I think all the reviews I read about this book have an element of truth in them.......I had the book on tape that was read by Jenny Sterlin and the job she did with the different dialects was incredible. I listen to a lot of books on tape and this was one of the most fun ones I've ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressive","review":"I thought this was a wonderful book about power and dominence and how the balance of those forces can shift: England over India; parents over children; men over women; old-world values and traditions over the new world's. And poor Samad is at the center of it all. Although India hasn't been England's \\"jewel\\" for more than 50 years, he can't keep English culture from infiltrating his family. He doesn't have the expected control of his wife, and his children haven't listened to him in years.I also thought it was very funny and even enjoyed reading about the characters I disliked (the Chalfens). Every character rang true. Well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone and endlessly awful","review":"I bought this book at an airport kiosk and was excited to get into it...The first couple of chapters I actually liked mainly because her writing is so flowing and descriptive, but towards the middle somewhere, I realized I just couldn't find the characters memorable at all and I simply got tired of reading it...In fact, I didn't even finish it, something that rarely happens to me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyable","review":"fun, hysterical, allusionary, sardonic, perceptive, exaggerated yet realistic... all around worthwhile"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, poorly written","review":"I was anticipating a clever, intellectual style of writing from Smith, but found the book to be a jumbled mess of uninteresting characters and a poorly developed plot. I put it down several times refusing to read any further, but it just bugged me not to finish it. By the end, I was really angry that I wasted my time. The author has very brief moments of clarity or interesting thought, but the book continuously slips back into banality. There's nothing even remotely humorous about it. It's just dull, disjointed (in the last paragraph, out of nowhere, the author addresses the reader directly??) and at times a bit crass for seemingly no good reason. A failed attempt at creating a deep and meaningful novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've tried to read in a long time","review":"This book is terrible. I couldn't get past 50 pages. Pitiful character development...no plot. Utterly boring. It could be the cure for insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potboiler","review":"What a disappointment. Smith has cobbled together lots of stories and lots of characters, but with almost no precision whatsoever. This is a page-turner for sure, but the almost total lack of characterization or observation of human nature, and smug posturing make for a tiresome read indeed. Comparisons to Rushdie are not only totally outrageous (he knows how to write with depth, feeling, and intellect) but also mildly racist, positing as they do that any writer of color chronicling immigrant life in London must be like Rushdie. Stop thinking about buying this book and go to the master. For a book on being a colored immigrant in London, pick up Satanic Verses instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I don't understand why this novel is getting such rave reviews. The first two-thirds of the book was enjoyable but not stunning - it was gritty and full of real-life dilemmas. I didn't find it particularly humorous - or at least not \\"laugh out loud\\" funny. As I began the final 100-200 pages, Smith was still introducing new characters to the detriment of the others that were not fully developed. The last 100 pages were intriguing as Smith wove the decisions and fates of the characters together, all pointing towards one room on New Years Eve. However, the end just plain falls apart and doesn't do the rest of the book justice. It's as if Smith herself decided the ending on the flip of a 50p coin and took about as much time to dash out the amateurish text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Everything it's Supposed to Be","review":"I think it's always a pleasure to find a novel that's going to stretch expectations a little bit. Ms Smith's novel is almost all it's supposed to be. It is a very entertaining read, and while it allows for some meditation on the reader's part, Smith fairly constantly keeps the characters grounded.As the story moves from Archie and Samad to the twins and Irie, I thought she sacrificed the story of Archie and Samad, allowing them to become caricatures more than full characters, but she developes Irie in compensation.There's a lot of Rushdie here, and the ending comes like a wall, but overall, the novel's certainly worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pimpin'","review":"\\"White Teeth\\" is an amazing read, a novel so large with a reach so extended one can only marvel at Zadie Smith's ability to pull it into one cohesive whole. Smith covers so many issues--religion, race, science, gender-- with so many characters that it's a true testament to her abilities I didn't get lost somewhere around page 300. No, each character has his or her own voice; Smith's ability to credibly speak for so many points of view is perhaps the greatest strength of \\"White Teeth.\\" The only caveat (and one not large enough to change my rating from anything but 5 stars) is that she sometimes seems in love with her own prose. The love is usually justified, given her obvious and considerable talents, but Smith's ramblings become tedious, almost contrived more than once. A great book nonetheless. ThE best novel I've read all year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"I always complete a book, ALWAYS. Not this one it's still on my table beside the sofa collecting dust. I tried to get to know the characters, I tried to get into the story...that's just it, I had to try very hard to like this book. One day I just put it down and never went back."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand the hype","review":"I got this book because I liked Zadie Smith's On Beauty. I was excited to read all the gushing blurbs at the back of the book. I started reading the book with earnest enthusiasm but sadly, not even that is enough to get me through all 542 pages. I gave up by page 250. I have no desire whatsoever to know what happened to any of the characters. Smith's writing was difficult to read. I couldn't get into the story or the characters and it felt like she was dragging her feet with her writing. The narrative was not one tiny bit compelling. I'm so disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not afraid to be contemporary and smart","review":"First off she's funny. And wicked smart. She sounds a natural voice from the Jehovah's to the street smart hustlers. That's a rare talent, to speak true from a multitude of voices. The plot gets a little tidy at the end but it's more than forgiven. What wit and cleverness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the title I would have preferred but entertaining nevertheless","review":"Ordinarily, reading a 400-plus page novel would drive me back to the bookshelf to choose another but this book is so gripping in the way it softens the most ponderous parts with humor that I will not rest until I reach the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"There was a lot of hype about this book and I sat down with it looking for an intelligent, absorbing, old-fashioned good read.Instead, I found a horribly over-written book about people and places that I could not warm up to no matter how I tried.The world in this book is an ugly, lawless place filled with characters that become less and less endearing as the book goes on. I was looking forward to the ending as I'd heard that everything came together, but it did not in any meaningful fashion, and I was so relieved to finally finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped","review":"I agree with other reviewers who mention Smith's lack of focus in writing the story and lack of compassion for the characters. It reads like the work of a twenty-something with limited life experience who is overly proud of herself and just can't be bothered to get anything right. Flip judgments of characters don't make for an entertaining or compelling read. This is one to avoid, despite the opinions of reviewers obsessed with the writer's youth and good looks. It's a look, not a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"a severe case of the emporer's new clothes","review":"After all the praising press,I'm curious to see how the book fares in the long view. This book was one of the rare few I put down without finishing. The author is smart (and young and good-looking) but her characters are blank and her story is flat and I was bored. It seems to have come from her head. I'll wait for the one that comes from her soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"This book is okay, but definitely not worth all the hype it has received. Yes it is an entertaining read, but at the end of it, all I can say is \\"So what?\\" This book did not touch my soul in any way. I also found her style to be HUGELY derivative of Salman Rushdie. A good pick if you are going to imitate someone's style, but not particularly original. And if you like that style of writing (which I do), why not read the master himself? Overall I'd give this book a big: don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Teeth","review":"Come on people, this book was highly overrated and plain old boring. I found it quite hard to get through it. Aside from Clara, characters are vacant and dull. The author just doesn't take the opportunity to develop personalities enough to conjure up any compassion in the reader. What could the editorial reviewers have been thinking of when they awarded this book such high praise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulling Teeth","review":"I'm always hungry for something new - especially from new writers. And I too am more likely to finish every book I pick up. While Smith seems to have a wonderful prose style and sense of humor, reading the long speeches given by Samad Iqbal (aka \\"Ick ball\\") was more like pulling teeth. And Archie Jones, though believable, was absolutely unbearable!I usually read a book of this length in 2-4 evenings, but I've had this one for about a month - I just can't do it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Genuinely overrated","review":"This is a fine first novel and shows signs of real promise-- it's witty, thoughtful and there's lots of energy on display. But it ain't the cherries jubilee the reviewers have made it out to be. Too long, too pleased with its own verbal-strutting, the novel is more like a show and tell of dialects and set pieces than a cohesive hole. And it does tend to go on and on and on when Smith finds a character or a subject she's hooked on. One day she'll write a terrific book. This isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"One great way to \\"read\\" this fantastic novel is to listen to it on CD. The performance is stunning. But, either way, this is modern Dickens and carries a giant, sweeping plot hurtling along with tremendous force. The characters are vivid and wonderful and the variety of ways she attacks race issues and explores racial relations is just beyond belief. She set the bar high and vaulted over."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it I really did!","review":"When I picked up this book, I had high hopes for it. I love starting a new book and becoming absorbed in the world of it's characters. Finally at page 266, the only excitement I feel is that soon I'll be through with this incredibly boring novel. I feel nothing for any of the main characters. I think this book would have been far more interesting if Samad was the one sent away. Less ranting and raving from Samad and more room for all the other potentially great characters in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Teeth Review","review":"This novel is fun, humerous and somewhat educational. Zadie Smith's characters come to life to represent different cultures, religions, and beliefs. You immediately sympathize with the characters and are eager to find out if they find what it is they are looking for in life. The best aspect of the novel was the humor. Smith uses funny nicknames and odd characters to make the novel more enjoyable. Although Smith tends to go off into tangents where you seem to get lost, she quickly picks up where she left off to keep you interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brush daily for white teeth","review":"This book is must read for any desi, african american, muslim, arab etc. minority. it's funny,insightful and tackles the awkwardness minorities encounter while trying to assimilate themselves into the English or American culture.

Is there another book named White teeth out there?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"What a great book! I borrowed this one from my sister, who said she could not get into it. I got sucked into it right away, and am shocked that more people didn't love it as much as I did. There are some really funny parts. If your parents are immigrants from Asia, like mine are, you will probably appreciate the parts about the accents even more. Check this one out - if you don't love it, pass it on to the next person you meet - I bet they will!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This is one of the best books I have read this year. It was very enjoyable to read about the immigrant experience in England, and what is really amazing is the way in which the writer effortlessly glides between different cultural contexts.

Our discussion centered around WHY critics picked this book and WHY we didn't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious fantasy","review":"The characters are artificial, the friendships and relationships contrived and utterly unconvincing , the anachronisms abound and the research is nill. Had Zadie Smith not been an attractive mixed race young woman I doubt this multiculti fairy story would have even been published. However it clearly fitted with the wishful thinking, fanciful imaginings of many of the privileged people in the media and book world expressing how they like to think multiculti London functions, and thus they were blinded to it's amateurishness and tedium.The fact that the author has failed to produce an impressive follow up, is something of an indicator of her lack of real application and talent IMO. I believe she has now quit novel writing entirely, evidence of the old maxim that 'those who can,do, and those who can't, teach', perhaps?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to the Reviewers","review":"The mid-line to one star reviewers have it right. This book is a chore to read. You do find yourself beginning to relate to a character and understand them and the author switches to another character. You will find that the author loves to hear her own voice. Or so it seems. I made it 7/8's of the way through the book and decided it was just not worth the effort. Leans toward pomposity and bombast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dazzling, never false","review":"White Teeth is a tour de force. How does a 24-year-old know so much about the really big questions? Totally absorbing, with characters you gotta love-- not a victim in the bunch. Best book I have read in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"I've just finished this novel and I must say, I just don't get it. It won two prestigious literary awards, plus has had any number of luminaries gushing over it. Huh???? I honestly don't even get what the novel was supposed to be about. It meandered all over the place, with characters dropping in and out of the narrative willy nilly. For example, Clara, who figured largely in the early part of the novel, drops out completely one third of the way through, and only makes a minor reappearance later: the author spends a long time describing the animal liberation group FATE, only to have them suddenly disappear into the ether. The characters were, without exception, objectionable, nasty pieces of work and not one of them engaged me emotionally. The novel is too long and I really found it a hard slog to wade through for very little return. I do not recommend this novel - please,spend your money on something else, don't waste your time with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This novel lacks bite.","review":"This book comes with a lot of hype. The blurbs are filled with the words \\"funny\\" and \\"witty\\". And it needs some humour to carry it along, since there isn't much in the way of dramatic structure. Unfortunately, for me at least, the laughs (or giggles or even smirks) were not thick on the ground. To be fair, I haven't finished the book. I kept asking myself \\"Why am I reading this?\\", without coming up with a good answer. The biggest problem is Archie, one of the protagonists. Given that the novel starts off in 1975, \\"drip\\" seems the appropriate word to describe him. A greater understanding of this character is not something the average reader would crave. Zadie Smith does do some things well in this novel. Her ear for dialogue is good, and she does the various ethnic dialects convincingly (although an American audience can't really know how authentic they are). And she writes about interracial relations in an insightful way. But it still didn't make me want to slog through this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book.","review":"This is the kind of book that is so funny, so rich, so dead on, that you want to ring up your best friend at 1:00 am and say, \\"Listen to this.\\" Zadie Smith is a gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Hype","review":"I was very excited to get this book and read it after all the glowing reviews. The first section was very good and I looked forward to the rest of the book. Unfortunately, it was downhill from there and I struggled to keep awake through the remainder. I still don't get what happened at the end....probably because I skimmed through the last fifty pages. I was so tired of the writing style it was giving me a headache."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supreme enjoyment. . .and you'll learn something too!!","review":"Zadie Smith is one of the most talented new authors out there. I enjoyed her debut novel so much that I read the second half of it very slowly, so as to savor the uncanny occurrences and outrageously funny scenarios for as long as I could. White Teeth gave me a better history lesson on places like Jamaica, Pakistan, and England than any world history class I'd ever taken. But the seed of this novel is just the plain insanity of human nature. You won't be able to control the laughter that will explode from you, and when you least expect it.Get your own copy and don't lend it to anyone. . .you may never get it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slog which would benefit from drastic editing","review":"Some members of our book club found the novel amusing and interesting, but the majority felt the work was a slog which would benefit from drastic editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong start, woeful end","review":"I wanted to give this book more than 2 stars--the writing is truly inspired--but the story itself fissled a good 100+ pages from the end. I worked hard to get through over 400 pages, and in no way felt rewarded by the end. Instead, disappointed. Too many characters of little or no sigficance bog down and are flat, and lead the reader astray. A little more editing would have made it tons more agreeable. Still, a remarkable undertaking for a first-time novelist"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost on Target...","review":"This is a superb first novel by Ms. Smith, although it is slightly disappointing. The story, characterization, and dialogue are outstanding, however, I believe that in her attempt to cover such a long span of time, and so many characters, Ms. Smith forgot to include more detail. The characters are introduced, and then glossed over and nearly forgotten, this is its only flaw, which would normally be a very dangerous one. However, since Ms. Smith writes with so much more skill than myself, it does not inflict a mortal wound. This novel focuses mainly on the lives of the Iqbal clan, most especially Samad and his sons. I wanted to read more about Clara, Archie and Irie, and less about the Chaflen's. Without a doubt, this is an outstanding first try and it has earned a spot on my crowded bookshelves, I highly recommend this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"As with many readers, I couldn't finish this book either.

When you finish, it is like having been part of a graphic novel. The characters are awesome, and as the plot unfolds you are drawn into the story. Combat sequences are fun and challenging. The only weak point is the colony-building interface. For the bucks though, you can't buy a better game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the name Star Control","review":"As a stand-alone game, this game is only average. The concept is good, but in actuality Star Control 3 lacks more than it can boast. The new hyper melee is alright, but the main game leaves a lot to be desired. The colony control could be better, the interface with the aliens could be improved, and the graphics and gameplay were terrible. If you've ever played Star Control 2 you'll be very disappointed.

This is probably one of the worst crime films ever made - profoundly poor acting, terrible script, a soundtrack that is too awful for words. And William L.

Its basically your typical cop movie, this one has pretty lame action, bad acting, no special plot, and no comedy or drama, another flaw is it is borderline porno, there is alot of sex and nudity, totally uneccesary, i hope the french connection proves better when i see it.

Having said that, this movie SUCKS. I bought it as a blind-buy because I grew up in the 80's and people raved about it. There's holes in the plot I could drive a bus thru. There worst of which is a secret-service agent(what, no FBI, local cops?) going after criminals. Uh, shouldn't he be protecting some politician or something. I don't have time to list the MANY others. The acting is average at best, and the dialogue is downright atrocious at points(\\"Listen-up amigo!\\")!

This movie is the forefather of movies such as Dark Blue with Kurt Russell and Street Kings - cops willing to do whatever it takes to get the bad guy, but stepping over the line ultimately brings about their downfall. Well, I guess Kenneau Reeves got away with it in Street Kings. This movie captures the tone and atmosphere of 80's LA to perfection, though now 20 years later the action sequences seem staid compared to the hyper-realistic gore of today.

William Friedkin masterfully painted a picture depicting how thin the line between the cops and the robbers actually is. William Peterson stars as a secret service agent who will stop at nothing to nab counterfeiter Willem Dafoe. Peterson's determination eventually leads him to go too far, pulling his partner John Pankow deeper into the depths of the city that made men like Peterson and Dafoe. Excellent cinematography of L.A., a stunning car chase, and a deep character study make this a classic picture.

The sun seems to set on the stench only to rise, far too quickly, over an even wearier, more dangerous world. From the clich�� start (partner shot hours before retirement, the ensuing vengeance), this film quickly flips into a more thought-provoking story, where the cop (a Secret Service agent) morphs into--or maybe always was--EASILY the most cynical, manipulative, vicious piece of work on film, pitting himself against a suave counterfeiter (Dafoe) who's almost likeable, given his counterpart.

One of the best \\"never saw it coming\\" plot twists at the end of the movie; when I first saw it, it was so perplexing that I thought it was a dream sequence. Okay, a little dated, but none the less a gritty, grown up, realistic action flick that delivered the goods and did not fair too poorly at the box office. This is one good film.

My husband and I loved it and we will continue to refer to it as we try to conceive our first child...something tells me it won't take long now! Thanks Toni!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has been my fertility bible - GREAT!","review":"I have a one year old daughter who took awhile to conceive. My doctor had told me that I could have a difficult time conceiving. The book made it so much easier and less frustrating, as soon as I got it. I read the book cover to cover, then continued each day to reference issues that I had. The book made me so aware of my body and how I can really make it work for me - or at least understand it. Now, I am trying to conceive my second child. The book is again,at my bedside. I flip through the pages daily with any questions I have. It is a great resource!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If only we had known this information at puberty!!!!","review":"Toni Weschler has given women (and men) a great tool for understanding the mysteries of the female body. She is so thorough that I know if I have a question relating to my cycle and/or body that I just need to pull out her book. If only we were taught this information upon reaching puberty!!! I am waiting for another book from Toni Weschler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked For Us!!","review":"This book really helped us a lot in conceiving a baby on our first month of trying. I believe if I hadn't read this book my husband & I would still be trying for a child. It teaches you the signs to look for when you are most fertile & how to chart your basal body temperature. I thought after flipping through the pages before I bought the book there would be no way I could do the charting. It seemed really complicated at first but this book shows you step by step how to do it. It answers most of your questions you may have about getting pregnant. So my husband & I would definitely tell anyone trying to get pregnant to get this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I got pregnant within two months using this book as a guide","review":"After suffering a miscarriage, I was desperate for information on how to moniter my cycle and be able to concieve hopefully naturally. This book did it for me! I read it and it helped me to pinpoint the signs of ovulation, etc..that i had overlooked before. I was able to get pregnant the second month of trying after reading this book! Great advice on natural birth control as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A thorough and exhaustive guide to your fertility","review":"This book explains everything you need to know to understand your cycles. The topic is covered in easy to understand language and makes you wonder that it was never explained to you this way before. After trying to get pregnant for almost a year, the simple charting technique explained in the book showed that I simply have very long, irregular cycles. Knowing the problem helped me to work with it and explain exactly what was happening to my doctor. It was a comfort to at least understand my body. Now that I have a newborn baby, I am reading the sections on cycles while breastfeeding and natural family planning. I have recommended this book to many people, and given it as a gift to my sister and sister-in-law. I can't say enough about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I would recommend this book to anyone trying to get pregnant","review":"This book was a big comfort while I was struggling with infertility. The first thing I noticed was that unlike other authors and medical professionals, Toni does not assume that everyone is alike. I got so tired of drs saying that I should be ovulating at day 14, when I obviously wasn't. The book was helpful in showing how to chart and describing the various tests. It was also the book that helped me to determine I was pregnant, based on the fertility signs described. There are lots of great examples of basal temperature charts. I have read it MANY times! It is a must have to those trying to get pregnant."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Big Help","review":"I couldn't have been happier with this book. It exceeded all my expectations. After trying for a year,I became pregnant two months after reading this book. It explained things so well. Every question I had was answered! I highly recommend this book for anyone who is trying to become pregnant."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great resource!","review":"I bought this book after 2 years of unsuccessfully trying to concieve. It took me two months to get pregnant after using some of the techniques. The book is thorough in its explanation of the body's cycles and the different indicators that the body uses to show fertility. However, the techniques discussed in the book do require a great deal of dedication and are somewhat time consuming, depending on how detailed your record keeping is."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book!!","review":"I bought this book because of conceiving problem I have, however, this book is for all the women to learn about ourselves that your school never taught you.

I thought I knew a lot about my fertility until I read the book cover to cover. I now have even more information regarding how to detect ovulation, even with my irregular cycles. It gives me and my husband new found hope in conceiving our 2nd child."},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked for me in one month!","review":"I cannot believe how this book tells you all of the things that every girl and woman should know. Why aren't they teaching this is high school? Well, I'm pregnant after 4 months of trying on my own. My doctor recommended this book and after one month of charting, I got pregnant! Couldn't be any clearer once you understand your body. It's amazing for pregnancy achievemnet and I would imagine as well as birth control. Buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative","review":"Although I am not pregnant yet (after 9 months) this book has been very informative to help understand where problems may lie by teaching me how to understand my fertility signs. I have an appointment with a fertility specialist next week and have a years worth of \\"data\\" that I was able to obtain by learning from the methods discussed in this book. If you are planning to see a specialist you will most likely need to bring 3 months of basal body temperature charts with you, and this book will explain everything you need to do that and much, much more! I don't know how anyone who's ttc can live without it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Those with known infertility problems, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK","review":"Thank goodness I borrowed this book from a friend and didn't waste my money on it! Nothing in the book was new to me, it was all info I had already learned from my (male) doctor. (They're actually not all clueless like this book implies.) This book is geared for people who have absolutely no problems with infertility and just want to know how to time things correctly. It is NOT for people with actual fertility problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much to Learn!","review":"I was amazed at what I learned from this book. As a woman I thought I knew all there was to know about my body. Wow, was I wrong. This book will help you listen to your body and understand what it is telling you. A must for couples trying to concieve!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for women! So much we need to know, taught simply.","review":"Ignorance is not bliss. The questions written on a piece of paper that I always brought to the many different physicians that the many different insurance companies sent me to, were finally answered in this book, simply and concisely with understanding and compassion. I actually couldn't put it down! Do not take all these positive reviews lightly. It's a wonderful feeling to finally understand the body's functions. I have a renewed spirit about the human body - it is truly miraculous - and i'm not religious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wished I had know all of this 10 years ago!","review":"Highly informative. Every gynecologist and obstetrician should give out this book to new patients."},{"rating":"2","title":"A straightforward, wonderful take-charge guide for couples","review":"I have 20 years of experience in obstetrical nursing. I found Toni's book to be a treasure! Whether planning or avoiding pregnancy naturally, this book is for all women and their partners. My husband has just finished reading it and was surprised at how much he didn't now about women's reproductive health. I have already recommended it to several friends who are attempting to conceive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This book helped answer questions I had regarding my own fertility. I already chart my temperatures, and the reasons behind charting are explained very well. I plan on following the FAM to achieve pregnancy. I recommend this book to anyone looking for more information about their bodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE \\"FERTILITY BIBLE\\" lol","review":"I am a member of some online message boards and this book was often reffered to me and said \\"you hvae to buy the fertility bible\\" I used to laugh it off. But ever since I caved in and bought it....I can understand why! I have since recommended this book to everyone I know, wherether they are ttcing or not. It's wonderful to know exactly what your body is doing and to dismiss all the myths! Although I am not pregnant yet (after 14 months) I have learned a lot. Our problems are with both husband and I, but by charting my cycles alone I have learned the most important information about my body yet. I reommend this book to absolutely everyone. And plan on teaching my future daughters to chart their cycles when the time is necessary. Great great book"},{"rating":"2","title":"I found this book marvelously detailed and very informative.","review":"This book is a good resource for both pregnancy avoiders and achievers, as well as anyone who desires to be more aware of their health, because of the great details it gives. Although I have born three children, I found much information that other books (and physicians) had never included. I was impressed by the importance placed on monthly self breast examination. The reproducible charts included in the appendices were very useful. I plan to keep this book as a reference to help unravel the \\"mysteries\\" of the female body for my own daughters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must-have\\" book for every woman.","review":"This is a fantastic book that boosted my knowledge of what really goes on in my body every month. I hope that it will be instrumental in achieving a pregnancy, but if not, it will certainly help me find out why. It's amazing how out of touch we women are about our bodies. This book should be required reading regardless of your fertility goals."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for all women","review":"This book is fabulous. I told my OB/GYN that she needs to recommend it to ALL women, not just those trying to conceive. As a nurse, I thought that I knew a lot about women's bodies, but there is information in this book that we were never taught. A great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very empowering book!","review":"This book was the best investment I could have made while trying to get pregnant. It helped me figure out what my body was doing or not doing. With the knowledge that I gained by reading this book I was able to help my fertility doctor skip a few preliminaries. I knew that my body was not ovulating, so we were able to start on a fertility therapy right away. I can not express the importance of being informed and knowledgable. This book is so well written that anyone will be able to understand the way a womens body should work. I was able to get pregnant, and carry to term, the first month! This really is a must have for every woman desiring a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"This book is a must have for everyone. I bought it initially because I was looking for a new form of birth control. I had developed blood clots on the pill, and am allergic to spermicide. Toni does a great job making the FAM method totally easy to use. I am now using it to try to get pregnant. It makes it easier to know what you are looking for.READ THIS BOOK!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Anyone wanting know more about their bodies and or trying to get pregnant should definitely read this book. I have learned so much about my cycle and conception. I can't wait to put the information to the test.It is also a wonderful natural birth control that is not the rhythm method and definitely works if you follow it correctly. Worth every penny! I am just waiting for another book to follow hopefully on pregnancy and post pregnancy"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read Reference Source","review":"The information in this book is so important for all woman, whether they want to get pregant, avoid it, or just to learn the most basic (and amazing) facts about their bodies.

As so many have asked here previously, why weren't we taught this before?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOW I know!!!","review":"After 6 months of trying to get pregnant, without the slightest nibble, I wanted to find a way of KNOWING when my best chances for conception was. I heard about this book from a message board on the internet and bought it right away. BEST money I've ever spent!!!EVERYTHING was made clear! Cervical mucus as a means for predicting fertility .. basal body temperature .. luteal phase. Now I KNEW what to look for to maximize my chances of getting pregnant! TWO months after I had bought the book, and applied the principles from it, I was PREGNANT!! This book is now my fertility bible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Necessary reading for every woman","review":"Every woman should read this book, whether she is trying to get pregnant (or trying not to).

I am eager to put her methods to use in my quest for pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Written!","review":"Toni Weschler does a wonderful job explaining the female reproductive system. My husband and I tried to conceive our second child for several months before I finally bought this book. I read it in one night, began charting, and became pregnant 4 months later! I quickly learned that my cycle was between 32-42 days long. I was even able to tell that I was pregnant, by a second rise in my BBT, even before taking a pregnancy test. This book will truely answer many of your questions as you try to conceive. It worked for us...don't give up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Me If You Haven't Gotten Pregnant!","review":"Toni Weschler did a superb job of informing the average women how to take control of their fertility. The book is well written, easy to understand and empowering. However, after reading all the success stories in her book - and on this review list - I want those of you out there to know that not all women get pregnant after one or two tries. I have been trying for seven months. But, don't lose faith! Your time will come, just like I believe mine will. I am thinking about writing a thesis on the subject of \\"waiting to get pregnant\\". If you've been trying, but haven't gotten pregnant, please email me with your thoughts so I can include you in my study: MeemerGirl1@cs.com. Thank you so much. And keep using Toni's method. It's still the best chance to get pregnant - along with a little prayer :) P.S. My gynocologist says it takes the average person one year to get pregnant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book for All Women","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to get pregnant and there were a lot of great reviews on Amazon. It has totally exceeded my expectations!! The book truly is an excellent and informative read, and really teaches women what to do to get pregnant and what to do to avoid getting pregnant. While I thought my cycles were \\"regular\\" before reading the book, after charting for a few months, I learned I was actually quite irregular. For several months in a row I was ovulating on day 16 or later. When I finally did get pregnant, I ovulated on day 12! Thanks to this book, I recognized the fertility signs immediately and was able to conceive my first child, to my surprise, on day 12.If you're like me, you may get to the section on the Menstrual Cycle and think you might skip it because you already know that stuff. Trust me, chances are good you don't know the half of it - Don't skip that section! It's way more than you learned in sex ed, and it's truly fascinating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've Become A One-Woman Marketing Team for This Book!","review":"Seriously, I have recommended this book to almost every woman I know! It is a fabulous, information-rich guide for anyone who is sexually active, trying to achieve pregnancy or even just thinking about it. Ms. Weschler speaks to women openly and with respect. It has allowed me to speak to my OB/GYN as an informed equal. I feel empowered and totally prepared for the day when my husband and I decide to \\"work\\" on getting pregnant. Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely for Beginners!","review":"This is a wonderful book that details every aspect of fertility.

A must read for all women."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is excellent and an indispensible resource.","review":"This book is well written, humorous, and contains information every woman should know. More than just a book on the Fertility Awareness Method, this book is a resource on women's health and I learned so much about my body--I am absolutely thrilled to have this book and highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"I cannot believe how little I knew about my body at the age of 32! My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant now for 7 months and this is the first month that I can honestly say I'm truly aware as to what's happening with my body. No more \\"guessing\\" about when to try to conceive! This is the most informative book I've ever read! Thank you Toni!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for pregnancy","review":"I would recommend this to any woman who wants to learn about their bodies. This book has material that all girls SHOULD have learned in those health classes, but didn't. A great reference. This book describes a woman's cycle and how to determine both things like your fertile time AND possible health issues: for example, by charting your temperature, you can tell not only when you're ovulating but IF you're ovulating (very necessary for conception, obviously!) and things such as thyroid issues, miscarriage etc. She provides a lot of examples and sample charts to make it easy to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"One-stop shopping for all the information you need","review":"This book should be a primary resource for all women to better understand their bodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reader in Wisconsin","review":"This is a great book for anyone just starting the journey of trying to become pregnant. It's very informative and really makes you feel in control of the situation. The information is definitely not something you ever would hear from your doctor. I don't agree that getting pregnant is as \\"easy\\" as they claim it is. Everyone is so different and I didn't find the instructions to be a breeze like the writer made it sound. Because it's been over a year for me without any pregnancy, I also just found myself getting frustrated because the writer didn't provide enough information about what to do if natural family planning isn't successful. The book does touch on fertility testing and other infertility options, but it didn't give me enough information to feel comfortable and confident with my situation. If you are someone just starting the giant rollercoaster though, it is an informative book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book every women should own, conceiving or not conceiving!","review":"I had heard about charting my cycles from friends online. I had a miscarriage in January and was wanting to try again. After 4 months I borrowed this book from the library and after reading, knew I had to own my own copy. Whether you are trying to conceive or not, you need this book. I have learned so much about my body and when I need to try to conceive. The first cycle we tried, after reading this book, we tested positive. But by charting my cycles and with the help of this book, I knew three days before, that I was again going to miscarry. The book told me the signs. I am now trying again this cycle, with hopes that I can carry this one. But if it were not for this book, I would still be in the dark as to why I can't get pregnant. It is all in the timing. I recommend this book to everyone I know that is trying to conceive or having fertility problems. They may not be problems at all! Thank you Toni!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely helpful!","review":"When I started trying to conceive, I wasn't going to botherwith charting temperatures.... I did an overseas move (which was verystressful), and I was really worried.... Then I picked up TCOYF, and I read where it mentioned that travel can affect your cycles for months on end. .... This book is great. Doctors tell so many women to chart, and they wonder why it doesn't work. .... ...[if you] just want to understand your body better, I highly recommend this book. So many women are uninformed, not infertile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take Charge!","review":"I sat down and read this book in two days it was very informative and easy to read. It was not written in difficult medical jargon but in easy to understand layman's terms. It has given me a new found freedom and the positive encouagement that was much needed. After trying to concieve for over two years I feel in more control over my body and my ability to concieve. I no longer feel that it is all my fault. Your western doctor will probably not offer this information freely. It is truly a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooray! Reliable natural birth control at last!","review":"This book's amazingly clear text demistifys the female reproductive cycle. I loved it! Anyone looking for an alternative birth control strategy or curious about really understanding female fertility will be excited to read this book cover to cover! Schools should teach this information!!! Parents should pass it on!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toni--write a book for teens.","review":"When I read this book, my first reaction was annoyance that no one ever taught me this stuff. I haven't gotten pregnant yet, but am feeling confident that I have the right information. And, if we have a girl, I will use what I have learned from this book to teach her about what is happening in her body. Why does it have to be a mystery? I would like Toni to write a book for teenagers so that they don't have to wait until their mid-thirties like I did before they learn what reproduction is all about. Great illustrations, examples and straight-forward commentary. I have even been able to use it to discuss sex with my slightly squeemish husband."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING","review":"This is a must read for all women. I only wish I had found this book a lot sooner. I finally have an appreciation for the way in which my body works and what it has been trying to tell me all these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative concerning both female reproduction and her body","review":"This book is not only for the lady of the house; but, for the man who sincerely wants to take a larger responsibility in the creation of their child. Hopefully this book will help men want to become more invovled rather then the idea of copulation. Contains information to help both men and women to understand their body and the changes which takes place."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found this book very educational.","review":"I learned things in this book that I never knew about.

I would say that most senior citizens and women need this tool. Applause to the inventor of this necessary measuring device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best design","review":"I tried these on two different cars and several tires leaked down over a couple of weeks. My first suspicion was these valve caps which turned out to be correct after I sprayed a mixture of soap and water on the caps. There was a very slow leak around the cap seals.Sorry, but this product is a terrible idea because it permanently opens your valves. That's just asking for a leak to occur due to leaking seals, sun-cracked valve housing, etc.The in-tire pressure system may be expensive but at least it doesn't cause a leak in your tires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same leakage problem","review":"I had the same leakage problem as Micah on two different sets. In both situations only one of the four caps had significant leakage, but in both cases it was bad enough to drop 10 psi in a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Junk","review":"These caps break very easily and once they're broken they will completely drain your tire(s) because they need to hold the valve open to read the pressure. Totally self-defeating product.If you do buy these, stay out of the drive through car wash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"These valve caps (and others like them) will result in leakage that simultaneously create pressure problems while displaying visual false positives.Tire Pressure caps are a great idea but are not as sensitive as factory Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems and will eventually cause avoidable problems (as described by other reviewers here).In short Tire Pressure Caps, as currently designed and conceived, are NOT ready for prime time. Save your money and your piece of mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective & Dangerous","review":"The manufacture is not indicated here, but the image displayed looks like the Legacy Mfg. Gas Saver Low Pressure Monitoring Valve Stem Caps I purchased at Wal-Mart. I did not purchase at Amazon, but potential purchasers should be alerted to the danger of these products. I installed these on Easter carefully following the package instructions for the 32 psi tires. I then drove approx. 30 minutes and my vehicle was parked for about an hour. When I returned to my vehicle 2 tires were flat. I had to spend Easter calling the Auto Club and waiting for emergency assistance to re-inflate the 2 tires. If I had not decided to go in the store, I would have been on the freeway with 2 deflating tires. This could have been a very dangerous situation. It is appalling that such a defective product can be sold to an unsuspecting public with the potential of endangering motorists and others. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap-made and useless product","review":"I bought set of them in Walmart and thought I got a useful little things. Not at all, I threw them away the same day. Reason? They really bad calibrated. They supposed to work on cars with 32 psi tire pressure, and to show red when pressure going under 27 psi. So, I inflated all my tires exactly to 32 psi with electric inflator with built-in gauge, and only 1 of 4 caps showed me green color. One more was between red and green, and 2 were red, and I got them to be green only by inflating tires to 34 psi. So, you see, it's useless. I don't want to see red mark when my tires properly inflated or just a little bit underinflated. On the top of it in manual it was warning that you should replace them to usual aps before going to high-pressure car washing, and that cold emperature in the winter can affect their work. Seriously? They didn't work even in normal circumstances, not talking about winter or car wash. Don't even waste you money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Break easily","review":"I bought these for my 2007 matrix and had them on the car for about 2 months when I noticed one of the clear plastic caps was missing.

What gets me is that people are comparing this to something Lovecraft might've done. I'm a huge Lovecraft fan and not once did I think of Lovecraft while watching this. I don't want to give anything away but yes there is a creature(we really never see it except in the blurry distance). What it is and what the hell it's doing is never really explained. Are there more than one of them? Dunno? The best way I can describe this movie is that the director may have had the germ of a cool idea somewhere in there but lacked the funds to carry it through. And therein lies a warning to any budding filmmaker with a minimal budget. Work within your budget otherwise you have a movie like this with a lot of filler dialogue, 0 special effects(which it needed), and poor screenplay(written by the director)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done","review":"I thought this movie was very good. I found myself quickly caring about the characters and pulled into their lives. I am very picky about what I spend my time watching, and always read the reviews, so I thought it only fair to leave one myself. This was well worth watching. The story was well written and the acting was very good. I like a good mystery. I don't like gratuitous violence and gore, and this movie was quite scary without all that junk. I know some of you like that kind of thing, but I am much more impressed when a \\"horror\\" movie can stand on it's on, with a low budget, no special effects, no gore, but just an intelligent story line and great direction.

This was nothing like I expected, was better than ninety percent of horror movies I've seen at the cinema in the last couple of years (and,yes, I'm including you, Cabin In The Woods)and was made on a miniscule budget.Without giving in to too many spoilers, let's say there is nothing predictable about these women's predicaments. A woman comes to help her sister declare her brother-in-law's death due to absentia as he's been missing for seven years.

The cover art on the box may make you think to bypass or rent this, but I urge anyone with a taste for creepy horror and H.P. Lovecraft to purchase this ASAP. I, along with so many lucky others, experienced this creepy, get-under-your-skin horror tale at a film festival and we were blown away. It's a great high concept story expertly translated with a minimal budget. The effects are terrifying at times while cast and crew deliver a nightmarish vision that may make you keep the lights on for weeks. I suggest blasting this through your audio system to get the full effect that will have you jumping out of your skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A slow burner that's well worth it","review":"Dread Central have been hyping this film up for a while and when I saw it available from Amazon-On-Demand I decided to give it a shot. I don't mind low budget films as long as the acting is good and the story is solid. I was not disappointed in the least with this one. The slow build of the story and minimal effects were handled excellently and combined to make a very unique and pleasurable experience. Highly reccomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time. Have more fun watching water boil","review":"What a dud. I only gave it 2 stars because everyone tried so hard to make a movie that did not stink but really it comes closer to a one star. They failed for the most part. The plot was awful. Spoiler alert. A bug takes people into walls and keeps them there 7 years and they come back once in a while not too much worse off. Same clothes, no real weight loss, all in all not bad for living with a bug in the wall. Really? Then get this, sometimes it takes them back again. It does not get much worse than this plotwise. You gotta buy an awful lot and even if you buy this nonsense all in all I just did not care one way or another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Been Scared of a Horror Film EVER BEFORE","review":"I have been watching horror films since I was a child. Yawned through \\"The Exorcist\\" (read the book first), laughed out loud at \\"Blair Witch Project\\" (I lived in the woods when I was a kid), etc. \\"Absentia\\" was the FIRST film to really scare me to the point of nightmares. I still have trouble walking alone at night, esp. around a creepy natural tunnel in my home town. I thought the entire production was minimalist but definitely on target for chills, without any of the usual \\"trappings\\" put into modern horror films. \\"Daniel\\" was especially creepy, and I had to watch it several times to understand the meaning of his several presences in the film. Even the basic soundtrack was creepy and never overplayed the scenes.You may want to brush up on your \\"3 Billy Goats Gruff\\" to truly understand the plotline."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"This is one of those awesome movies where they build up a feeling of dread of what is about to happen then you find out that what happened is you just wasted over an hour of your life. As you follow the characters along, you know that something big is about to be revealed only it really never is. A monster you never really see, a story that's never really explained and the spots in between filled with girl drama. When you watch this movie and you are half way through and you can't figure out how some people temporarily escape from the monster we never get to see, don't worry it won't be explained later on in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid","review":"it was very stupid i want my money back.dissapointed no doubtdont waste your time. i meen it nono no"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do I keep doing this?","review":"I continue to evaluate Amazon viewers reviews and if I have a gut feeling I will rent a movie based on those reviews.

Her parents relationship is appalling and dysfunctional. Agnes carries most of the responsibility of running her father's shops. The unfortunate circumstances that ensue in the family, drive the father to unseemly and violent action. He is a very dis likeable character and it becomes evident that Agnes despises him and shows a lack of respect for her mother. Things drastically change eventually however, through a series of events that modify Agnese's thinking and judgements. If you get to see the BBC drama of 'The Wingless Bird', it is well portrayed and intriguing and brings all the characters to life.

I am pleased that Paul has returned to Nina's life, yet I am saddened with the character's increasing 'rough edge.' I am sure anyone who has been following the series would agree that Paul should remain likeable and one of the good guys! I must admit I thoroughly missed Nina's adversary Jeffery Reisner in this latest installment. He is such a colorful character that no matter how dispicable he is, you miss him when he doesn't make an appearance.

A family of four moves into an old house in a town called Dark Falls. The name Dark Falls is appropriate as it always seems to be dark in the town. Even when the sun is out, the large, overgrown trees seem to always block it out. Josh and Amanda are the two kids that immediately have bad feelings about the town. They meet up with some other kids in town who act very strange and are very pale.Of course the parents are typical, unbelieving parents who dismiss the kid's as just having bad dreams or the like. But the whole family will soon learn the tragic secret of Dead falls and of the hazardous chemical accident that forever changed the town years before.

Brady's got all the fun of juggling family problems (including parents and in-laws) while trying to hold down a job and get people to take her seriously.

When he died, I was literally heartbroken that someone with such aspirations for humankind would never see his beloved species reach the stars. This is the kind of book to read when your faith in mankind has been tested; it will renew that faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good on the importance of space exploration part, but...","review":"The first couple chapters are filled with the usual Sagan illogical naturalism. I never understood how he could hold to such a irrational philosphy and yet push critical thinking on everyone (See Demon-haunted world). His best contradiction was proclaiming design and complexity in the universe, yet denying the need for a designer. He seemed to forget logic states \\"chance\\" has no power and that the Big Bang logically points to the need for a transcendent creator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the hardback version!","review":"I wanted to purchase the ebook version but after reading some of the reviews about the lack of photos I decided to purchase a used hardback edition.I would prefer a digital version, and I wasn't sure just how significant the photos in this book would be -- but they make all the difference in the world -- there is AMAZING glossy prints throughout and taking these out of the book would ruin the experience. Much thanks to the reviewers of the kindle edition for the appropriate warnings.Much of the text is not only related to a specific photo, the entire book is motivated by a single photo, and Sagan's wonderful poetic language is put in its right context when staring at these marvelous photos. I do wish an updated digital version would make better use of the technology and provide high-res images (and possibly short videos, such as the time-lapse jupiter shots from Voyager)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Sagan's finest works","review":"Once I saw Carl Sagan's TV documentary \\"Cosmos: A Personal Voyage\\" I knew I wanted to read his books. His style of explaining the things that surround us and intrigue our senses for ages is rather parental than scientific-like.

While the writing is still composed of Sagan's great and wise words, the book is but a shadow of itself without pictures, and the publishers should be ashamed of themselves for omitting them. This is a digital edition folks - it can and should contain multiple forms of media where called for, and there is absolutely no excuse for not reproducing the photography and illustrations from the original work. Until they release an edition with pictures intact, I must give this a one-star review and steer potential buyers to the actual book, not the Kindle edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humbling and Inspirational","review":"Read the opening sequence of the book and see our world as a tiny blue pixel from beyond Neptune's orbit. Try, as Sagan admonishes you to do, to imagine the conflicts fougt and wholesale murder that has been committed to control a fraction of that pixel. You are forced by the very grandeur of the Universe to think beyond your own provincialisms and imagine us as one world, one species, with the capability to go on to something great or destroy ourselves in an instant. This is the most frightening part of Sagan's book to some: Whether we make it or not, is up to us; the Universe won't care one way or another.Sagan then introduces you to the wonders awaiting us when we move off our dot and explore the solar system and surrounding stars. It's a magnificent journey filled with all the wonders that the cosmos has to offer. From the safety of your easy chair, you can journey to Mars, the moons of Jupiter and the outer planets.

Chick. Anything you could ever want to know about Chick, his writings, and his critics is collected in one volume. Here his evangelical comix are coded, sorted, analyzed, reviewed, and placed in context within the Chick canon. The obvious dedication and love put into this book is incredible. Equally obvious is the enjoyment, fascination, and obsessiveness of the author.The only way this book could be improved would be to spruce up the table of contents (page numbers would be helpful), make the section headings more obvious, and provide a key for the code (maybe it's there and I just haven't found it). But those are pretty minor flaws in an overall great work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Know what to expect with this book","review":"Just so you know, this book does not have an illustration of the cover page any actual Chick leaflet. When this says \\"self-published\\" it's not kidding. The book is a wide paperbook style but the pages are laid out two columns each and look as if a regular format book was coverted to be a trendy cartoon portfolio size. The font and style make it look like it was written on an old Commodore VIC-20.With that being said, the book is filled with information. It is, in effect, a catalog of Chick tracts and it is the most thorough one I am aware of as of this writing. It is just rather annoying that you are having the content DESCRIBED to you rather than SHOWN to you. In the back there is a collection of back covers of the tracts, to which I have to say \\"HUH?!\\" You can print the backs but not the fronts of leaflets?As widely-distributed as these things are you would think there would be a better book on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encyclopedic!","review":"I am a fan of JTC's comics and was amazed at the encyclopedic extent to which this book goes into his work.

No stressing here, just a singer who uses her voice to its fullest extent, without going overboard.

I've read reviews that said all the pins got mixed together, but I did not have that problem. There is a plastic covering and a foam pad over the pin compartments that kept everything in place during shipping. The kit has everything you need to re-key your Schlage locks, including springs, spring pins, upper pin covers, etc. The only thing it doesn't have is the tool you need to remove the knurled ring, such as on a deadbolt. This was a first time re-keying locks for me, and I screwed up once or twice, so I was really glad to have extra springs, etc. I actually enjoyed re-keying all my locks.

Unfortunately, it's not the miracle I was looking for. Not yet anyway. He's been sleeping in it for 3 nights now. I have to lay next to him until he falls asleep or else we go through the motions of laying him down, he gets up and we put him back in again. I was hoping he would love it so much that he'd stay in it. The alternative was a twin bed with Thomas sheets, pillow and comforter etc. I still wonder if he would have been content with that, but I don't think I will ever regret buying this bed, even though it was very expensive.My husband said it was easy to put it together. You do need to get plywood and cut it to fit. The toy chest is also deeper than I expected. It's a great way to get more use out of our crib mattress. Perhaps we can get some money back in a year or two when he outgrows it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"missing parts!

This is so irritating especially when you have your little guy staring at a bed that he cant play with.

The pieces appear to be built at different facilities, judging by how none of them really seam to fit together. Incredibly chintzy for 280 dollars. In fact, one piece (I measured) was incorrectly cut and simply would not physically fit into the notch it was supposed to go into.

I was also a little concerned that he might fall out of the bed and so far so good! We have had the bed for a few months and still no falls. He loves to play with his trains on the side tracks and put them in the cubby behind thomas' face when he is done.

One was too small (and had a funky screw head) and the other was in the middle of this big and small ones.Friendly tip = They tell you on the package that the provide no support for the child's mattress to go on. BUT read the package more! Use the cribs old spring support; it will for right into it. No need for plywood.I will say the package arrived quick though, and it is a fun bed great for a big fan!!!!!!

When the music swells in a loud place, the bass gets completely buried under the mid range, so you lose the roots of your chords. The Sonys have a much richer, warmer bass that never gets buried.Additionally, the Sennheisers are quite tight on my head, and I have a small head! They squeeze the sides of my face quite a lot, so they aren't particularly comfortable for wearing all day.Finally, they have a very heavy, stiff, bulky cord. I have to wrap it around my chair arm to keep it from flopping awkwardly. When it flops, or when it stiffly rubs against my shoulder or shirt collar, I can hear it loudly in my ear, so if I'm listening, I have to keep the cord still.Overall, not a good purchase. I like my $20 Sonys better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid headphones","review":"I didn't get these headphones to listen to music and I haven't yet. I watch netflix videos and use these headphones because the internal speaker on my laptop is not good. I think these headphones are awesome. They block out background noise and deliver a crisp clear sound. I had my air conditioner blasting all summer long and I sit by it while on the computer and I don't even notice the noise from the A/C until I take them off. The one complaint I have about this is that since I have a big head I need to stretch these out to their maximum size. It presses on the top of my head. I had this same brand before and they seemed more rounded and fit over my head without pressing down. If you have a fat head like me it's something to consider. Over all I still love them though."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor sound attenuation","review":"These headphones do have satisfactory sound quality and are pretty comfortable. However in terms of sound attenuation they are very inadequate for my application, which is operating a tractor and bushhog on my farm. Previously I had used a headset radio with good sound attenuation, and if I wanted to listen to music I would use earbuds under the headset and my Ipod. I hoped to replace this system as the earbuds are a bit annoying. Unfortunately the Sennheiser headphones are so poor at sound attenuation all I can hear is the racket I'm creating with the machinery, and so have returned to the previous system for this application. If I were attempting to screen out lower level noise they might be alright, but for my purposes were not the right choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for the Price - Excellent for audio editing","review":"I am a multimedia specialist & I use these earphones both at home and at work.

The problem is with the fit. I understand these are DJ headphones, but these are much tighter (& heavier) than you'd expect. Even at low volumes, using these for as little as 20-30 minutes is enough to give someone a headache.

I expected quality and I hoped for comfort. I got neither.Specifically, these headphones are very bright (louder highs softer mids and lows). This can be somewhat corrected with an equalizer but that's kind of a pain to have to do for everything. Most disappointingly, I found a heavy sibilance that I just couldn't ignore.As fare as comfort, these things are like a vice for your skull.

Merchant refused an exchange and I had to mail it back to Sennheiser. Except for a confirmation of receipt, which was e-mailed four days after USPS confirmed delivery, I have not heard anything or received the product back in over two weeks. My experience is that this product is of poor quality and durability and backed by even worse service. I'd suggest buying another brand.Sennheiser HD 280 - Headphones ( ear-cup ) - black"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Even at the Amazon discount price, this product has proven to be a disappointment. The sound quality is mediocre. The headphones cannot duplicate the deep basses of even a moderately priced speaker system. The sound is comparable to AM radio.Also, I agree with the comments that this product is uncomfortable to wear.I personally recommend to buyers to keep shopping. I believe there is a reason why this product is deeply discounted."},{"rating":"1","title":"bulky--heavy","review":"I am a big fan of headphones.

They sound decent but should sound much better for the price they are sold at. I think that these headphones were not made to the greatest standards by a company who normally makes high quality headphones. They do have an upside, they are durable and can withstand a beating aka traveling. They play audio at at good intrevals from high, medium and low without being scratchy or too heavy on the bass. For these to sound good, you do need a high quality audio source, mp3 players might not cut it, and computers may sound amplified through these headsets. The ear cups are full cups and quiet but due to air and sound mixes they give ear fatigue fast. So if you have time pick what you want, but not these. Others sound better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, cheap plastic and poor quality.","review":"The HD-280s that I just purchased are going back, well, except the company that sold them through Amazon won't return them so I guess I'm stuck with these expensive, low quality headphones (buyer beware). The sound is okay, but the fake leather earcups and foam are cheap with a crackling noise when you wear them. The phones are all plastic and look very cheap - poor quality. Not at all what I expected for $80. Also, the sound isolation is not even close to 32db. I have a pair of ear protection headphones at 26db and are twice the sound protection of the HD-280s. I would not recommend these headphones, especially because you CANNOT return them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as advertised","review":"I selected \\"noise cancellation\\" headphones when browsing on amazon.

These earphones are so tight around the head that it is painful. I left them stretching on a basketball for days to help loosen them up, but I gave up and returned them.

Comfortable, great sound, incredible noise reduction.Would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"good value, decent sound isolation","review":"I bought these to use while playing a Hart Dynamics electronic drum kit in order to isolate the sounds of the sticks hitting the drum heads. They work pretty good for that. I don't think they quite meet the claim of noise reduction that is advertised. It's probably just a matter of what frequency they are measuring the sound isolation. In any case, the sound quality is very good. Not quite as good as a pair of Grado SR60s, but with the isolation they work well for my needs. They've also proven useful for blocking out distractions at work. The coiled cord seems heavy duty, which is good and bad. You definitely feel the weight of the cord, but hopefully it will last. For the price, they are a nice pair of headphones with good sound isolation and reasonable comfort for 1 hour or so stretches of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST I'VE EVER HAD","review":"These headphones are the best I've ever had, which isn't saying much.

More round than your head is.They work great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headphones","review":"Disapponted. The headphones are heavier than I expected from previous online reviews and fit very tight on the head making them uncomfortable for prolonged use. Online reviews indicated light and comfortable. I had tried Bose and they were light and comfortable but Amazon reviews indicated they were not of high quality material and deteriorated quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"After reading the reviews here, I bought these headphones, because they seemed like a good value. I would say that the clarity is rather good, and for high-end and midrange sounds, they sound pretty good.On the downside, they were initially so tight that they made my head hurt from wearing them. Luckily, they have loosened up over time, but my biggest beef is that they have basically nonexistant low-end. Some of the music I listen to is bass-heavy, and I simply can't hear tones below a certain point that are clearly audible in other headphones and speakers.I replaced a much cheaper pair of headphones that I bought almost 8 years ago, whose plastic frame just broke on me (they still worked fine), and those sounded better than these.I consider these a waste of money, because 75% of my music sounds great, but the other 25% is basically unlistenable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Headphones","review":"These headphones are not for everyone as they sound completely true with amazing sound quality.The fit is great.

They have a muffled sound that does not give me the full dynamic of the music HD headphones are supposed to have. The bass is weak, the treble is muffled and the mids are practically non existent. If you are a professional music PRODUCER, STAY AWAY FROM THESE HEADPHONES. The average Joe Music Consumer would swear these are good headphones. But to those of us that Know better, stay away from these. Sennheiser is a very good company and the HD203's are some very good headphones. Buy those before you waste $$$ on these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive sound quality. Good noise isolation.","review":"I don't understand why these cans are rated so well for sound quality. Detail is good but only with certain recordings. Separation is non existant. Sound stage is relatively small. Overall they come off as dull and uninspiring. Sure they're meant as monitor headphones but I don't think I'm confusing flat with \\"just not that good.\\"I really wanted to like them for listening to music but after giving them more than a fair shake I'm retiring them to my pc for gaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good.","review":"I use these with my Yamaha DGX 620 Portable Grand and found a depth and richness of sound that I was not getting with the built in speakers.

Next upgrade is to get comparable sound in an external speaker system.I've lengthened the head band so that it does not rest firmly on my head, and find that the earpieces are comfortable for extended playing sessions.I went for the higher end product based product reviews and so far am quite satified with my choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music Head Junky","review":"Great headphones for a gr8 price. If u really want exceptional quality monitoring headphones in a noisy environment where you need it to be at a minimum then this pair the HD 280 is perfect for the job.

The Grado 60 has clearer high, more natural mid, deeper low and richer sound stage than this new Sennheisher 280 Pro I received today. The 280 does have better isolation due to enclosed design. That isolation also comes with a price, it get hot very fast while I can listen to the Grado 60 for over an hour without notice any heat or fatigue on my ears. I had my wife and son listen to both on various songs, with the volume lower on the Grado since that headphone is more sensitive than the 280, we have no doubt the Grado 60 is much better sounding than the 280 after 3 minutes.The Grado 60 cost me 69.00 years ago and it is still selling at that price, cheaper than the 280 on special sale. If you want to buy this unit, you owe yourself a listen to the Grado 60 first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile","review":"This set of headphones has great sound quality, however, it's only marginally better on paper than its Sony counterpart. Because it has problems with a very brittle headband, and will very quickly crack and break away entirely into sharp pieces of hard plastic, I cannot recommend these headphones except for review for product safety. Every time I have to send away my pair to get repaired I have to pay for shipping to Sennheiser, and I am without the headphones for weeks as a result. Save yourself a headache and possibly further physical injury and consider getting the Sony headphones..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not passive noise cancelling headphones","review":"I am not going to comment on the sound/audio because I really only purchased it for the passive noise reduction capability. I am very disappointed in that aspect, as these headphones hardly block any voices that can be heard. I even plugged it in my evo to see if the noise reduction is any better with music playing on, and it was only a minor difference because I can still hear the people around me. I was hoping it would reduce the noise to a low hum, but it did not even do that. Someone reviewed that they could not hear their girlfriend's voice when putting these on, and I am not sure how that can be possible as I can hear my family's voices even from a good distance. I need these to study because I am easily distracted, and these headphones just did not do it for me. I am not sure how some reviewers said they work amazing is blocking office noises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Sound Quality, AWFUL Comfort","review":"I bought these headphones to replace my earbud iPod headphones, which are obviously not isolated at all. I was hoping I could get a good, high quality sound with a comfortable fit. I got the sound part, but with these headphones, the fit is ridiculously painful.People comment mostly on the ear pieces being too hard, but it's the strap at the top that gave me a headache. It pressed down on my head firmly, at first giving a neutral, fitted feeling. But after about 5 minutes the band became uncomfortable, and after a half hour, it was downright painful. Even after taking the headphones off, my scalp was still sensitive and hurting.I do NOT recommend these headphones. I give them 2 stars because they do what they say they do. They just don't do it well. And certainly not $80 worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like these....","review":"But they were just not very good.The cushions were stiff and creaky and made listening a nightmare.Cord was long enough to reach the moon it seemed.In the end I returned these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality, uncomfortable","review":"My old Bose QuietComfort 2 (noise-cancelling) headphones were falling apart after years of use. I was using them at work, so I checked if my company provided headphones that I could use. They gave me the Sennheiser HD-280 Pro. I figured these should be fine -- I am happy with the Bose AE2 (non-noise-cancelling) headphones that I usually use at home, and while the HD-280s are cheaper, they are not _that_ much cheaper.So I put them on and started some music, and within about 15 seconds I took them off, packed them up, and brought them back. The sound quality was very noticeably worse than what I was used to. Furthermore, the headphones are much heavier than what Bose makes (you can tell from the picture), and they pinched my head too much. I ended up buying a second pair of AE2s instead (on my own dime). Much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound...comfortable to wear.","review":"Very comfortable (around-the-ear) headphones. Good sound. Good price. The only \\"complaint\\" (my fault...really) is that the cord is on the left ear cup. This is bad for me, because my computer sits to the right.

The sound quality is top-notch and the sound isolating is good too. But... they get a bit uncomfortable sometimes, mainly because they're kind of tight. Maybe that goes for all closed headphones; I don't know. But they get a bit tight on my head, and since they're so big, they're also a bit heavy and it sort of hurts my neck after wearing them for a long time while doing some other stuff. And the top of my head kind of hurts too; it could use a bit more padding on the top that rests on your head. But these problems only occur after wearing them for long periods of time, so it's not very big of a deal. I still use them all the time. These headphones do their job: high quality sound and sound isolation. But if you don't need sound isolation(which is basically just preventing sounds from leaving or entering the headphones), then go for some open ones. They should be a bit more comfy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, shoddy construction","review":"These headphones sound great, but after less than nine months of use, the cheap plastic headband is cracking apart, and I'd give them another week before it breaks down completely.Sennheiser put some great drivers into some comfortable headphones here, but if they have a terrible quality headband, what's the point? Given the knowledge that these would utterly wear out so quickly, I would not have bought them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Sennheiser 555 (modded to 595) and Sennheiser 598 are far better than these.Sony DLP777 is better in my opinion.Ear cups are not soft and made of a material that squeaks against my glasses.

I've dabbled in engineering over the years, and listen to music with headphones constantly (I'm a computer programmer and work best while tunes are being pumped into my head). Anyhow, I've listened to my share of headphones, and these are the best I've heard so far. For years I've had a couple of pairs of Sony MDR-7506's and loved the way they sound. One of them broke down on me and I saw it as an opportunity to try some other types that I never tried before. The Sennheisers were the best of the bunch, and are superior to the Sony's I had been using for the last decade. The audio quality is phenomenal -- I'm hearing albums on a new level. They might not be the best choice for real engineering applications because they color sound a bit, but for a higher-end consumer set these things rule."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones, better than slightly more expensive competition.","review":"It was between these and the Grado SR 125, and I'm pretty glad I got these instead. The ear cups are more comfortable, for me at least, on the HD-280s, and side by side, they have a richer sound. People have been mentioning lack of bass, I disagree. They also seem more sturdy than the Grados.I had to get a non-in-ear pair, because Etymotic ER-6 were killing my head after a few hours. These are great, and work fine powered by a macbook/computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Headphones Ever!","review":"These headphones offer the perfect amount of noise cancellation as well a great headphone sound. The second half of that comment might seem a bit remedial to the uninitiated but mixing engineers will understand. When mixing for headphones mixing for this pair will give you a pretty good sense of what to expect through a head set. These also work well as monitiors for the booth and for recreational listening. Sennheiser hit out of the park with these. I was first introduced to them by Music Production major roommate at Berklee College of Music and I've been a fan ever since. Someone stole my first set and they were so good I had to buy another pair. come to think of it they did well as a set of functional ear muffs during those cold Boston winters lol. Hope this helps!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound for the price, comfort is questionable though.","review":"The sound quality is commendable. The high and mids are crisp, clear and well defined. It is a little lacking in the bass though. My greatest complaint is in the comfort for longevity. These headphones are extremely tight. Im 6'4\\" tall and 230lb. I do not have an abnormally large head. These headphones fit very snugly. After about 2 hours they begin to get uncomfortable to a point where you are repositioning them on your head. The pressure around your ears is where the discomfort is greatest. The sound isolation is absolutely excellent though. I have a very loud air cooled PC right next to me and it is completely deadened by these phones. If you are larger than average, like me, perhaps consider another brand/model. I have worn these for about 2-3 weeks and have yet to experience a stretching out, or easing of tightness like I have read will happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A headphone masterpiece","review":"For the price, under 100 dollars, these headphones are worth every penny.

Well, the black paint then coats your hair, your ears, and your cheeks. And then the foam cushions start to wear down.After about a year of using these all the time, the head-crushing sensation went away, but the flaky paint remains.However, the audio is great. Not quite as deep and full as I'd like, but excellent enough on low volumes such that I don't hear my officemate enter the room. Or my boss. Always awkward.

The headphones are ergonomically designed so that comfortable for hours of usage, but it varies from person to person. The circular earpads blur speakings and sometimes block out certain soft sounds. The cords are extendable, good enough for me. I give them a five because I don't trust the quality of my sound files, but I still really love these.

You can't beat these headphones with any others anywhere near this price point,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't leak sound, perfect for office","review":"When my office mate got these, I suddenly couldn't hear any of his loud music anymore: they seem to be the perfect headphones for that situation. I promptly got a pair as well, and I can say they are very comfortable as well. I can't really speak to the sound quality, since I use them to drown out sound, but it seems fine to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the difference between BW TV and HD Color TV","review":"I just got these today and was blown away by the sound quality. I have never owned a pair of headphones of this quality before and am amazed at the sound quality I have been missing for years. I am not sure about all the complaints about head size and the fit of these phones. I wear a size 7-7/8 hat size and they fit me just fine. I do notice the side pressure a bit but I think that may be necessary to block all outside sounds. The clarity of the sound on these headphones is amazing. I have always had lower end cheap stuff and now that I have heard music with these I will be a lot more selective about headphones in the future. I am very pleased with the quality and sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound for very reasonable price","review":"This pair of headphones are awesome. For about $100, these have great sound and are very comfortable. They are a bit tight at first, but you need to break them in and they become very comfortable. Bass isn't terrific, but it is adequate for anything except maybe dubstep."},{"rating":"2","title":"They were a great gift","review":"I bought these as a gift for my husband and he loves them! He did most of the research before hand and chose these over the Bose or others.We live in a 3-flat apartment and can hear both our neighbors both above and below us (mostly bass and them walking above us). When he has the headphones on, he can't hear them or even me when I'm in the apartment - it's great.He says the sound is great too, he can hear things in the music he hasn't noticed before. He has not had any problems with fuzziness or buzzing.He did mention that they can be uncomfortable if worn for long periods of time, that would be his only complaint, and the reason for not giving it a 5 out of 5.He uses his mostly in his office on a Mac computer and with his ipod. He uses them all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice headphones","review":"These are very clean sounding headphones. I didn't have another pair of headphones to compare them to, so I can't give it a 5 star rating, but the sound quality is great (best coverage of the audio spectrum for the price) and they fit tightly but comfortablyover the ears. I was especially impressed by how well they reproduce the low end of some of my Korg Triton Extreme's synth sounds, yet were not muddy sounding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Shipped like said,very nice headphones,block sound nicely,nice screw type adapter to 1/4\\"feels much better than earphones"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing sound","review":"If you want an amazing pair of headphones for a low price, the Sennheiser HD-280 PROs are for you.Very clear sound, there are some complaints about the headphones being too small but this is false, I have a relatively large head and they fit me wonderfully. A large part of the cord is coiled so it doesn't visually extend very far if you don't need it to, but if needed, it extends at least a full body length."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are pretty good headphones","review":"For the price of these headphones, they are pretty awesome.They are best for vocals and listening to music cleanly. Though I have not bought other headphones, listening to music on these headphones allows me to pick up on the breathing and other things that usually go unnoticed on conventional earbuds. They do lack some bass and have a ultra-long phone-type cable though.These are pretty comfy in my opinion and do get a little warm on your ears/tight after half an hour. But you just need to take them off for a few seconds and you can wear them again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn fine headphones.","review":"Fantastic sound. Superb clarity. Low-end is slightly anemic, but tweaking around with the EQ corrects that easily. Sturdy design, aesthetically pleasing. Very comfortable on the ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"medicore and extremely uncomfortable","review":"I bought it since the price temporarily dropped. After using it for one day, I decide to return it.1. The build quality is ok, but it is 100% plastic feeling.2. sound quality is ok, clean but not deep nor expressive, but why do I buy a ~100USD heavy headphone just because it is ok?3. It is way tooooo tight. It is not about the pain on the ears, it is about the pain right on the contact point on my head.I don't have abnormal size head, the pain is instant on and it kills all the (possible) fun of listening to music.conclusion: if you love to pay ~100USD to get a device to press hard on your head, go for it.If you plan to buy a music listening device, then forget about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sennheiser HD-280 Pro","review":"These are the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever experienced.

So comfortable. So clear. So flimsy. The cord is not detachable, so I have gone through three pair already with the cord always getting loose. Having said this, after doing a lot of online investigations, it seemed that the Sennheiser 280s were rated closest in sound, have a detachable cord (feature not available in Sonys) and were supposedly comfortable. They are NOT comfortable. Sure the ear cups swivel and they collapse so you can travel with them, and they sound almost as good as the Sonys, but not AS good.. So, I will have to stick with my clear, flimsy, but very comfortable Sonys moving forward.... Oh well.."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"Seeing all of the great reviews and getting these recommended by a friend, I decided to buy them. I was very disappointed when i plugged them in and listened to them. There is almost no bass on these headphones.These headphones have very good treble tones and you can hear every detail of what you are listening to. They are also comfortable. But there is very very weak bass. This was the case when plugging them into my computer, my turntables, and my guitar amp (even while i was playing a bass with the bass knob all the way up and everything else down), so I think I have to blame it on the headphones.i will be returning these headphones and looking for a new pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"not comfortable, average sound quality","review":"The headphone is not very comfortable to wear, at least for me. Maybe this is just personal preference, but before buying it online, you'd better try it somewhere in a real store. The sound quality is just so so."},{"rating":"1","title":"very low sound dont buy it","review":"beside all the description that this headphone has, i need to add one more. Yes it has great features, quality of sound and everything else, but the sound that comes out is really low. You can hear people talking around you. The music is clear but no enough sound coming out of the speakers. I paid $100 for them, way too much money for poor low sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"The Sennheiser HD 280s had such rave reviews for sub $100 headphones that I couldn't wait to try them to replace my 8 year old Sony headphones which were getting pretty worn. In the end though, this purchase made me appreciate the Sony 7506 headphones that much more (better bass, much more present, and way more comfortable). Go for the Sonys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality, Bad bass","review":"Hi-These headphones have great response to sounds - AKA they sound clear. However, this is not the case with the bass. If you are a DJ, or a bass lover, they are lacking in that department. They can get solid bass really only when turned up very loud or when there are no mids/highs currently playing. But, all in all they have great sound.As far as durability, they currently feel solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crisp, clean, beautiful sound","review":"I'm not a sound professional. I am just a consumer.The reason I bought these is that I started messing around with making my own music, and I wanted to have a substitute for studio monitors to mix and master with.These headphones definitely put out the best sound quality of any I have ever owned or used. Every sound is distinct and clear, and you can really tell the difference between a compressed mp3 and a CD audio track, which I have never noticed as much with my normal speakers or $20 sony (over-ear) headphones.Highly recommended, especially at the discounted price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best $84 I've Ever Spent","review":"I paid $84 (obviously), with shipping, for these headphones and they are definitely worth it. I used to be a DJ and now I just do alot of music editing with Sound Forge and these are the best headphones I have used to date. What is impressive is the amount of ambient noise they cut when worn. They rival low end noise canceling headphones which I have used. I love that they can go as loud as you can tolerate. Skip the noise canceling cans and get these which cancel noise effectively and sound unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"All in all, these headphones are amazing. The sound quality is unbeatable; Bolero in these headphones is nearly concert quality. The addition of their ability to block out noise is also very nice. My only complaint is their weight. They are pretty heavy compared to open and some closed headphones, but they are ok as long as you don't wear them for too long at a time (5+ hours a day)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Right headphone stopped working almost immediately","review":"I bought these for my daughter, who loved them for a couple of weeks and then didn't love them after the right side of the headset stopped generating any noise whatsoever. This happened outside the 30-day return window, so I'm going in digital circles trying to figure out how to get a repair or replacement. Wish me luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snap Crackle Pop!","review":"The set I bought was comfortable, produced a nice sound, and passively blocked noise well. (Here it comes.) BUUUTTTT these headphones popped and crackled constantly with the two heavy bass test tracks I tried on them. If you're not going to use them with that kind of audio (super heavy bass) then they'll work fine for you. With that kind of restriction though, they just aren't worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, uncomfortable, cable coiling fell appart","review":"The headsets are fairly well built and the sound is good. I have a big head so they clamp down and after a while they get uncomfortable, but I would not call this a flaw.Where my problem came is on the coiled cable, the cable lost the \\"memory\\" of the coiling and it became an unruly mess; this happened 2-3 months after I got them as a gift.Mine were given to me by my wife Christmas of 2009, in November of 2010 I tried contacting the company to see if anything could be done, they told me I could buy a new cable and when I asked if this is not something that should be covered under warranty, I never received a reply.No way am I going to buy a replacement cable that will most likely do the same thing within a short period of time. I will look elsewhere next time I am looking for headsets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the headphones. Annoyed that the screw on adaptor was not in the box!!!!!","review":"Love the headphones. Certainly bang for my buck. One annoyance: the box was missing the screw on 1/4\\" adapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphones, but know what you are buying","review":"I bought these headphones as a gift for a friend and they did not respond as expected out of the box, but after a reasonable Burn-in period they perform just as expected. Good sound, comfortable for long listening sessions, great noise isolation. One thing that was a problem that i did not realize would be was the re-coiling cord. It acts like a spring on ones head more than i thought that it would, but for professional applications I can understand why this would be a feature and not a hindrance."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent sound","review":"truly 5 star sound quality, at least for my years.

I ordered these around Thanksgiving time and got a fantastic price which made this purchase a \\"no-brainer\\". The sound is exactly what I was looking for, no boominess, nice clarity on the top end, great cans for monitoring. They are very comfortable on my head, I like the long cord provided with them.

I got them for one primary reason - to block out the white noise at work. The Sony's provided great sound but a little heavy on the bass. They didn't do much to block out the noise.The HD280s block the noise so much that my colleagues throw things at me to get my attention when they come into my cube. They are also quite comfy. They do apply pressure but that's how they create noise isolation. The ear cups could be a little larger but they are comfortable enough to wear for extended periods.The sound is very clear and consistent across a wide dynamic range. You can listen to anything from classical to hard rock and enjoy every note."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headphones","review":"These headphones are really nice.

We'll see how long the next ones last..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Headache","review":"I just received them in the mail yesterday and these headphones hurt my head. After wearing them to watch a movie on my computer, I had a terrible headache. I will be returning them to Amazon for a refund and to find another pair. I'm really disappointed after hearing such great reviews about the sound. I bought them to replace my Sony MDR-V6. They are ok, but the Pads come off too much, and the sound isn't that great.So in all, the Sennheiser HD-280 Pro sound is good, not great, but the headset are very uncomfortable. They don't reduce external sounds. The price for them are good, but not worth these headphones. They seem very durable. They just need some way to adjust the fitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good not Great!","review":"I bought these headphones as a result of reading many positive reviews. I had it delivered as described and as soon as I put it on i realized it was a bit bulky and makes the user look a bit funny when worn cos it was real wide. I guess it's natural for a closed earphones. It tends to slip off your head when you lean back cause of the smooth top padding. This top padding also gets quite a bit annoying during a long use cause it puts pressure on the head. But enough about the physical aspect. The sound on these are great, the bass is wonderful and full (not too much and not too little - just the right amount). Treble is good but the mid range could be better. I've had to take off the headphones and look around several times cause I thought I heard sounds around me when they were actually coming from the headphones. Overall the headphones are great but I just wish they were as comfortable to wear as a Bose headphone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bang for the Buck","review":"This is my first purchase for a high end earphone and I am satisfied.Bought this after reviewing couple of websites and reader reviews and I must say these are adequate for my needs.Initially after moving from light earphones, these feel bulky and heavy but as time went by I am enjoying them more and more.They sound very good with the IPOD and once you wear them there is no noise leakeage - so you can blast the volumn."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent headphones","review":"I just got these and have to say that they are great! I can play music full blast, and I can't hear anything from the outside, and no sound travels to the outside.

I had to super-glued the left side so that I may continue using them a couple of months back and now I'm gluing the right side as well. These headphones are only used in the office so it's not like it was crushed in a backpack or something, only been behind my monitor since I bought them. I would recommend anyone considering these headphones to reconsider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound but very, very fragile","review":"First of all - I am a older individual who is very careful of my possessions.

Sound quality is incredible. I use them at work and don't have to worry about disturbing anyone. The only drawback is that they can get a bit uncomfortable after 2-3 hours of continuous use. If you get these, there is a bit of a \\"burn in\\" time. They sounded good right out of the box, but didn't have much bass. Now that I've been using them for a solid month, they sound even better. One of my co-workers has the Bose QuietComfort 2 headphones, and I like these better in a head-to-head comparison. These aren't noise-canceling, but the padding and the tight fit do a great job of blocking out extraneous sounds (fluorescent lights buzzing, computer fans, printers, scanners, etc.). Sometimes I'll even put them on without music just to have some peace and quiet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, very satisfied","review":"Sound quality is just awesome, and it blocks out most of the external noise. I have really large ears, and that usually means I have a problem with around the ear headphones. However the ear cups on HD-280 are not only large enough, but also quite comfortable with all the padding.Some of the down sides are that it feels a little heavy on the head initially, but you sort of get used to it. Also this is not one of those aesthetically pleasing headphones. So if looks don't matter much to you, go for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound but clamps head too much","review":"I purchased the HD-280 Sennheiser headphones about a year ago for $80 from Amazon via J&R. The headphones sound nice, but after 5 minutes of wear, I was getting headaches from the pressure. The headphones clamp on your head too much. I've tried to adjust them, but no luck, there's always excessive pressure. I ended up buying cheaper Sony headphones that don't sound as nice, but are extremely comfortable on my ears/head. I do not recommend these headphones. It doesn't matter how great they sound if you're getting headaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls apart with normal use","review":"As others have written, the plastic bits on the headband start to crack, break, fall off, and finally the headphones break to the point of being unwearable. This happened just by putting them on my head or just wearing them. No abuse, just normal use. They do have great sound and were comfortable before they started to break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphones","review":"I bought these based on the reviews and have no regrets. Great Audio quality and as far as I can tell (had them for a couple months now) great build quality. I've dropped these a number of times and unplugged/re-plugged them into my laptop many a time. They still are in perfect condition, also I remember some reviews complaining about the cord, I actually quite enjoy the coiled cord it allows for some stretching and it hasn't gotten tangled yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very high quality and nice sound.","review":"I am really liking these headphones. The only downside is that they tend to cause my glasses to sit on my face oddly and I need to take the time to adjust the glasses after I've put the headphones on. Otherwise the sound is great. If you wear glasses just be aware that you might have an issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out--Amazon has been shipping the unterminated HMD-280 instead!","review":"Hopefully Amazon has fixed this problem by now, but from the most recent review, I doubt it. I ordered these headphones and actually received the HMD-280, the same headphone but with a microphone. I might have been able to just deal with it, even though I didn't want the microphone or extra weight, but they're sending the UNTERMINATED model, with bare wires, that requires you to put your own plug on. It's probably great for DJs who want a headset and mic, and want to make sure the plug matches their equipment, but for listeners trying to order the HD-280, it's no good. I'm especially irritated because I bought an Amazon Prime membership, and now I'm going to have to pay for shipping anyway to get these someplace else because Amazon apparently hasn't corrected the problem. (I returned my headphones and was refunded by Amazon already, so this shouldn't be news to them.) Caveat emptor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't recommend these...","review":"I just received these headphones. I plugged them into my MacBook Pro, listened to various music genres, and every song sounded very \\"tinny,\\" no bass to speak of at all. I tried the Dr. Dre Monster Beats Studio, the Bose QC-15, and these Senn's HD-280 Pro headphones. Comparing the quality of the sound, and comfort; the Bose QC-15 headphones are the winners. You may pay a little more for Bose, but you get what you pay for.

If only I could tolerate the way they feel on my head.The ear cups feel and fit just fine. The problem is the headband. As I hold it, it seems to be padded very well, but when I place the headphones on my head, it feels like a heavy piece of plastic resting on my bare skull. (*note to reader: between the plastic of the headband and my actual skull are the headband padding, my scalp, and a full head of hair.) I tried adjusting the headband, and shifting around the way they sat on my head, but I could never get comfortable.It's really too bad, because they are probably the greatest sounding set of headphones I've ever worn. I just can't stand to wear them."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Quality Sound, monster size cord","review":"I purchased this headset for my 17 year old son who wanted to jam to some great music.

Maybe not quite as clear as the Senns, but they are more dynamic. They feel less like the sound is in a tin can. The sound feels closer. They are very well made. Probably the best made of the bunch.

When you play games as well, the sound is crisp and clear, also you can hear details you didn't even know were there before. It does a great job of blocking out outside noise even though they are not noise canceling. The only thing I have aganist these headphones is that they can be a little to tight, even when full extended and that they are so big its almost embrassing to where them in public.

When I received these i quickly ripped everything open and put them on. i played some music from classical to rap. the rap was HORRIBLE. so horrible it was like ultra horrible. my 30 dollar portapros had better bass than them. i thought i just threw money down the drain. however, reading reviews of other dissappointed customers, they said to wait for a while. i had hope and what do you know? sounds great now. dont know i just got used to it or either it really \\"burns in.\\" its very clear and i hear things i never heard before in music. however i think a better alternative would be the Grado SR80 for the money (they are open headphones though).the reason why i gave it 4 stars and not 5 was because i would get something else for 70 bucks i paid (from amazon). i really would have gotten sr80s. for Sealed headphones i would probably get something cheap like the hd497s."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best things i've bought all year","review":"I use these all the time, the sound quality is great and it really cuts out any distractions"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Headphones I've Ever Owned","review":"These are seriously the best pair of cans I've ever gotten my hands on. They sound good, they were not incredibly expensive, they cancel noise without the \\"pressure\\" on the hears of active noise cancelling sets, and they are \\"over the ear\\" 'phones. If you wear glasses, I recommend the over-the-ear ones because they don't smash your ear against the arm of your glasses while in use.Pros: Great sound, noise cancelling, relatively inexpensive.Cons: Don't sound quite as good as my Logitech Z-2300 speakers, large."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good value, but bad bass and high notes","review":"For the first year or so I had the headphones, I noticed nothing wrong with them. I guess I was so thrilled to have a set of \\"pro\\" headphones that whatever happened I blamed on the computer. However, after noticing that especially high notes did not come out crisply but instead were just scratchy static, and very low bass made the same static-y sound, I sent them to Sennheiser to have them replaced, thinking I must have damaged them somehow. The new ones are just as bad... I don't know why, but they are a fine set if you aren't annoyed at a bit of static, or if you arne't that picky, but quite honestly I wouldn't recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOUNDS great, but FEELS awful","review":"I use these headphones for home recording and seriously I cannot wear them for more than 15 min, I get a huge headache, pain all around my ears from cut blood circulation and what not.VERY UNCONFORTABLE to a point where I want to get other ones, maybe the AKG's. And also don't think if you have a small head this will work for you, cause I have a small head and I am dying. If you plan on using these headphones regularly I suggest choosing another brand or I just say good luck!Having said that, the quality is great, but ergonomics and confort comes first, if I can't listen with them whats the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound but annoying","review":"Sounds great, hear all the noise. Ruins your MP3 collectoin like it should.Cord is too long and coiled too tightly, wraps around everything on set or in my office. Stuck in my office chair all the time. Bulky construction pulls itself down all the time and hurts my ears after a couple of hours, which I edit 9 hours a day on average so this kinds sucks. The jack is loose, all other headphones stay in my computers 1/4\\" jack, these pop out with the slightest twist. Even with a annoyingly long chord it still manages to wobble out and either go into mono or just disconnect, and then get wrapped in my chair so I can't put them on again.

I produce music at home, and I was hoping these would make for an awesome mixing headphone.That is not what they are, trebles are fragile, mid to high bass is lacking, the overall eq is not listenable.That said, these headphones have some amazing isolation for listening to detail. If your music wasn't produced by a professional, you'll quickly tell with these bad boys. After using a EQ program on Windows 7, I can listen to these comfortably, and am very satisfied with most music. If your using these in a DAW, make sure you EQ the main fader before mixing anything decent.So, more a tracking headphone, but can offer great isolation and mixing (with EQ)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice headphone","review":"Used this headphone for 5 years or so, and it is by far the most often used headphone for me at home. I still have a couple headphone around me, Sennheiser's MX680i and CX880i, but those are obviously bought for different \\"purposes\\". The long cord of this headphone is very good, and the sound insulation is very nice. The head band started its \\"decay\\" within a year or two of usage, though the cushion just started to break recently. I am not sure if I would get replacement cushions yet, as it is still \\"usable\\" right now.

The heavy-duty curly cord, is solid.Take it from me, you will be impressed. And I love the way they fold up, inside each other, likethe Amazon Flash Video Demo shows in the LAB.

They sound fine to me. I must comment on their durability. If you like taking your headphones with you to work, the library or to the backcountry you are going to have to treat them with respect. My pair of HD 280's had the top pad part fall off and cracked panel on the upper bridge part of the headphone exposing a wire.

I think these are very comfortable to wear, even for long periods of time. Some days i wear these for up to 4-5 hours at a time. I even spent 9 hours travelling wearing these and they were fine. Some people may think they are tighter, but this is because the tighter they are, the more noise they will isolate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent choice","review":"Having owned Sennheiser (HD477) previously, I had to search for a new set because the sound was lost on one channel. I traced it to the cable, but found it challenging to find a new cable. So after researching other headphones, I selected the HD280 pro. Now I really enjoyed my 477s, but the 280s surpassed them in every way except aesthetically. The 280s are quite stiff and I am sure will loosen up. But the sound is awesome. I enjoy all types of music, light jazz being my favorite. The sound from the headset is just excellent. I also like the noise elimination, far exceeding the 477s. I also like the way that they fold up for portability, moreso than the 477s. I am not easily impressed when it comes to sound, and I enjoy good sound. I am impressed with the 280s."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT HEADPHONES","review":"Great headphones i bought them for my home studio and after an extensive research i picked these.

For the money, they're superb headphones. I purchased them to eventually use in a home music recording situation, but I haven't gotten around to that application yet. I have used them quite a bit to listen to cd's. I've got to say the sound is incredible. They provide a full, rich range of frequencies and are able to produce subtle nuances often missed by lesser headphones. Also, they are better than most at noise cancellation, which is certainly a bonus. My only qualm would be that they may not be the most comfortable headphones on the market. However, I can wear them for hours without any discomfort.

Plastic build is strong but looks plastic. Pioneer or Technics looks a lot better and a lot more comfortable for DJ'ing, Cable is not detachable.So I'll keep this for my music production, because sound quality is amazing, but I ordered a Technics RP-DH1200 for DJ'ing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Best headphones for the price. Got them for work where I needed to drown out ambient noise, but didn't just want some noise-cancelling headphones.

For me, they sound small and deeply recessed, especially in the mid highs and mid bass ranges.You can get used to them and enjoy them by themselves, but as soon as you hear another pair of closed phones right before or after, you realize how small and tinny the sound quality is. Go to an audio store; many will have this pair along with a few others that are also closed; try them all and you'll hear what I mean.

In fact far from thickening, it sort of melts about a third of the way through, and trickles away in a real anticlimax.Anne Scott's writing style is dreamy and contemplative, not well suited for a thriller or whodunit, but that's okay -- I was expecting a gently unfolding and introspective sort of story, not a John Grisham novel. Any interesting leads Scott creates, though, seem to trail off in isolation from other plot elements, never connecting or impacting each other.Calpurnia is less a story than a collection of idle, non-urgent questions and answers about a family's life, and it never coheres into a whole that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nine West Tote","review":"The article I received had the fastener defective and was full of dust and ugly smelling; for the rest I cannot complain until now; for high costs on product return I keep it."},{"rating":"1","title":"it works....but","review":"The only thing positive I can say about this watch is that it keeps time.

The cord is very long (so you can use headphones with your computer or home stereo), and they come with wind-up belt clip in a package, to keep the cord more manageable. The plastic fills very sturdy and solid. These headphones do not fold (or collapse), so they may not be very useful for the traveling. They also are not noise-cancelling headphones, but they do block some of the noise.

However, not even a month after buying these headphones, the cord leading to the right earcup went dead.So I got maybe a month of use from them and had to trash them; It was money wasted. Will I ever buy from them again? Maybe, but next time I'll make sure that the cords are replaceable.Sennheiser HD 202 Dynamic Headphones"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sennheiser HD 202","review":"Broke in less than one year of occational use.

Perfect bass and treble... Anyone know if there are any ear buds/head phones out there that is compatible to this, and not over the $50 range?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good design, decent sound","review":"First: the good. These headphones are very confortable (to me) and have a convenient-for-home-use 3-meter cord. One of my favorite design elements is the three \\"braille\\" dots on the left side, since I often cannot tell which way these phones go.On the other hand, while I by no means consider myself a serious audiophile, the sound is pretty obviously unbalanced. Playing low notes on my electric piano sounded excellent, but the high treble notes lacked clarity. After ~40 hours of burn-in, the treble started to feel less muffled, but the sound quality is still unbalanced. This is good for rap and other music with a strong beat, but bad for jazz (bass is louder than the other instruments) and other instrumental music.But if you've never listened to anything beyond the earbuds that came with your CD player, these are be a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser headphones","review":"I am a medical transcription student and wanted a headset that fit over my ears and helped to block out some noise, but not all. I have children and needed to hear them! These work great! Yes, after long periods of time, the pressure does bother my ears a bit from pushing against my ears/head, but I just move them a little and it relieves it. I've never felt the need to take them off during coursework because of it. I had purchased Bose headphones before these for a lot more money, but wasn't that impressed and returned them. These are keepers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphone","review":"First the headphones look nice, but when I put them on they were a little tight then I notice the ear pads are adjustable.

For a 25 dollar set the sound quality is very good and the ear pieces cover the ears completely and very comfortably. They are also so light in weight that it is easy to forget you're wearing them . . . except for one thing. They clamp on rather tightly and there's no way to relax the grip. They are not so tight as to be really annoying to someone with a medium sized head like me (6.75 hat size) but I can imagine that a large headed person (7 or larger hat size) might be annoyed by their tightness and the inability to adjust the grip. Otherwise, these are a real bargain.Rick"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Product","review":"This is my 2nd pair of this particular set of headphones. Amazing Product. The only reason this is my second is because I slept with my first pair of headphones on every night for about a year and a half.

That said I found these to have decent sound for the audiophile though the ear cups are a bit small. I use them mainly for music montoring through my GNX4 or Tascam recorder. Bottom line is they are well worth the price ... do not waste your money on Skull Candy headphones, I've sent two different model pairs back because the music QUALITY suffered greatly."},{"rating":"2","title":"still not top drawer","review":"for the money these are very nice. my only complaint is that for someone with a large head they are a bit snug around the ears. i had bought a headphone set from the grocery outlet (a super discount grocery chain in the pacific northwest) for $10 and they worked fine for about a year, and were very comfortable but had 1960's am car radio sound- not to be unexpected. the difference was they had a large over the ear cup and were very very light. these new ones are tighter but the sound is much more hi fidelity. glad i bought them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable","review":"The Sennheiser HD202 headphones just aren't comfortable. The over-the-ear pads did not fit completely over my average sized ears. They also fit a bit too tight on my head. I could only wear them for short periods of time before feeling discomfort. It is a shame because the headphones do deliver good sound quality. I ended up replacing them with the JVC HARX500 headphones. These comfortably fit over my ears and don't give me a headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Stars for the Two Years They Lasted Before Dying","review":"These are really great sound-quality headphones!

Since my budget was very low, I went with these headphones and am very glad I did.Pros- Very Inexpensive, Descent Sound, Long cord with smart cord management.Cons- Eventually the pads will sweat, moderate pressure makes them uncomfortable for long use.One thing I found out, if I wear these for a few hours, my ears will really hurt. By repositioning the back of the pad on my ear lobe, and the front of the pad just in front of my ear, this issue has been solved. If you've got an enourmous head, you will likely need a bigger pair of headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too tight!","review":"Headphone squeezed my ear and head too much.

I should have saved my money and bought something that doesn't hurt after 30 minutes of use. I bought these before a long flight I had to watch movies and I couldn't make it half way through one movie before my ears started to ache. It took the next 8 hours until my ears no longer hurt. Besides the pain, they were a pain to even receive. It took me nearly a month and a half before I got my package. Would not recommend this product or company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not supraaural","review":"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive pair of headphones that were comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Let me first say that the sound quality IS all is cracked up to be. They sound awesome with great bass reproduction and a nice long cord for the price. My gripe is that I was looking for the comfort factor as well and it wasn't there. They weren't uncomfortable (if that makes sense) but although they look like a supraaural pair of headphones, in fact, they simply slip right around the ears themselves instead of having a nice big circle to press against the head. They barely fit over my ears and I don't think I have extraordinarily large ears. So, if you are looking for a great sounding pair cheap, the HD202's are the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but.....","review":"I actually purchased this for my son so he would be the one to critique it...however, he did say that it was everything he was looking for however, the cord was exceptionally long making the headphones hard to maneuver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good headphones, fairly priced","review":"I think these headphones are a great buy for the money.Pros - The sound quality is very good. The headphones are sensitive enough that I can hear music well even at lower volumes. The nuances come through well. The sound is not quite as bright as I tend to like, but for headphones firing directly into my ears, I find the slightly muted highs to be a plus.Cons - As for construction, they seem a hair cheesy. If they had spent a little more time on the injection mold, the headphones would have turned out looking nicer. The headphone height adjustment mechanism is a little stiff as well.Overall - Absolutely a good buy. In spite of the cons, I think these headphones are very easily worth what I paid for them. They are a vast improvement over my earbuds and give a wonderful listening experience both for music and for movies. They are not professional-grade headphones but they provider great sound and value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"I got these cans when they were available for less than $20 so I say they are wholeheartedly worth the cost. From various reviews I've read on lower end Sennheiser cans there seems to be a recurring problem of comfort, durability, and consistency in product design. My set has held up just fine, and I have to say that they were not comfortable and easy to wear immediately to the fact that the padding seems to be not quite big enough to fit completely around the here or comfortably rest on the ear.Over time I've gotten used to how they fit and the sound quality seems to be adequate for a pair of <$30 headphones. Good but not great sound, good but not great comfort. Easily portable but can sometimes feel a little fragile and cheap. Mine have held up for 3 or 4 months now, so I can't complain. Good for on the go Cans, just be sure to break them in before you take them for a long flight or car ride as they might not be the most comfortable or best quality right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphones, Great Price","review":"I've had these headphones since Dec 2008. I use them at work, when I'm on my lunch break. Awesome sound with my Ipod Touch, and the output is so good, I can use these headphones as a speaker when connected to the headphone jack on the computer, when I'm showing friends youtube videos, and I want them to listen in. Hi fidelity, good bass, and very long cord (which some might consider excessive). People tease me that I'm old school, but once they hear the sound quality, they are convinced. Only thing I don't like is because I wear glasses, the headphones press a little tight on my head, and then it feels somewhat sore around my ears after about 45 minutes. But other than that, this is the BEST deal going for headphones. Was surprised that these were made in China, since this is a respected German brand. Definitely worth the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful!","review":"The HD202 sound is more than adequate for my application (non-critical listening in an office environment), but comfort is not. They are MUCH too tight on my ears to wear for much more than 30 minutes. If you have a narrow head and/or smaller-than-average ears, you may well be pleased. But if you have had trouble with too-tight 'phones in the past, you might want to look further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Commuter Headphones","review":"I find the HD 202 to be a wonderful value, and very practical for my commute. Like all other Sennheisers I've ever tried, these provide both comfort and quality sound. For my bus ride, the sealed, around the ear style blocks out engine and road noise better than earbuds ever did. The fit is a bit snug, but for the approximately half hour ride that I take twice a day, I've never experienced discomfort (aside from realizing that headphones of this size look a bit dorky when wearing them in public).Listening to lossless digital files on my iPod through a portable headphone amplifier, these headphones complete the ensemble, delivering the music and cutting down drastically on outside noise.These are not the finest headphones I've ever heard, but they are far and away the best I've found for the combination of low price, durability, sound isolation, and very agreeable sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"I was a little disappointed because i could not turn the sound down as low as I like it. It was either loud or off. Overall they are a great set of headphones. Very comfortable for periods of long wear. If you need a cheap set of headphones with a decent quality then these are the sure bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value for quality","review":"Sennheiser does not hold back the comfort with the HD202. The padded earcups and headband are adjustable and place the drivers in a good position for monitoring. The closed back design will increase the bass response of the drivers and are great for small mp3 players and DIY opamp based headphone amplifiers. The drivers measure out at 34 ohms so most commercial mp3 or computer sound cards will be suffiecient to really enjoy a variaty of music. I use these at home at my computer to listen to music late at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones","review":"I bought these headphones to replace a pair just like them which I really liked, but had worn out.

I don't know about bass or any of that, but I know what sounds good and these sound good. The only drawback is that the cord is very, VERY long.

It has HD quality of sound. I am fully satisfied with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser Headphones Review","review":"The headset seems to be of quality material. I like the idea of a long cord. I have heard better reproduction of sound in a head phone and didn't expect any better for the $20 I paid for the head set. I didn't buy them to listen to good sound. They fit my need for them and am well satisfied so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here today, gone tomorrow","review":"I was really looking forward to getting these.

The foam earpieces also got warm very fast. So dissapointed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uncomfortable","review":"These are VERY tight-fitting, and would fit a small head well. These were tried on and put right back in the package, without even hearing how they sounded. The padding is also unusually stiff and uncomfortable. I returned them to Amazon and purchased a pair of JVC HA-X570 earphones. The JVC's are phenomenal and cost less--highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These are for Bass...NOTHING MORE","review":"When the box said \\"Strong Bass\\", they meant it. Don't pay mind to the marketing team's generic word replacements, like \\"strong stereo\\" and \\"dynamic\\" and all that other bull. What you gotta look for is \\"great base/treble balance\\".These phones, while very comfortable to wear, are a nightmare to listen to. Not that they're THAT bad, but they're JUST for bass. If you want to listen to nothing but bass beats, buy this now. If you listen to REAL music, don't give these a second thought. The bass is just overpowering and with the (still comfortable) seal it makes around the ear, the pressure sort of hurts if you're playing music too long. But that's just me. Maybe I'm a priss. I dunno. But I know classical, techno, jazz, and rock, and this made that music......simply put: sound bad.Pros: Comfortable, nice price for the size and materials used, LONG cordCon: Not music headphones--BASS headphones.

It features 22mm drivers that are strong in the high and low-level pitches, but especially strong in the mid-level sounds. The sound can be very immersive, but do not fool yourself into thinking that this product can be very comfortable for your ears; in fact, they can be quite hurtful.In terms of pricing, this product has been known to go on sale for $15-$25.In a nutshell:PROSGreat mid-level soundsVery mobileExtremely long cord with adjustment capabilitiesConsNot fit for people with large headsUncomfortable for the ears after one hour of use"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken in 3 month","review":"I bought this headphone 3 month ago and it is already broken.

When the cord pulled free of the headset, I figured I'd eventually get them repaired, but ordered these as a stopgap. Now I'm not sure I need to get around to repairing the Sony's... the sound from these is surprisingly clean and balanced for the price. The bass response is deep and clean, and mid-ranges are crisp. Great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very excited about this headphone. The sound is great even though it is not noise canceling able, it is great to close outside noise once you raise the volume. The bass and treble are strong and of good quality.Unfortunately after exactly 7 months, the right side speaker went out. Only the left speaker work...Very disappointed. I only use the headphone rarely, and kept it in my computer bag which is a safe place since my laptop is also there. Would I recommend the headphones...NO."},{"rating":"1","title":"So THAT'S why they were only $20","review":"I bought these headphones based on the 4 1/2 ratings on here. However, I'm not sure how these headphones got ratings this high based on my experience. The sound quality is horrible. When I'm listening to music on my phone the backround is constanly obscured by a static-type noise. At first I thought it was the phone, but I plugged in another pair of headphones and no noise. You have to turn up the volume to drown out the static noise. On especially soft parts of songs, you may not be able to hear at all.The comfort of the fit is the other terrible quality of this product. The earphones never fit quite right and I could never find a comfortable position for them. Also because you had to turn up the volume to hear parts of the songs over the static, it didn't take too long for your ears to be hurting and you need to take the headphones off.I knew I was taking a chance by buying $20 headphones, and on this occasion, I got burned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I Got A Bad Pair?","review":"Looking back at the rave reviews, I see why I made the purchase, but my experience is so different I'm wondering if the reviews are rigged! The noise cancellation is none existent when music is not playing. Honestly, I might as well not have anything on my ears! But what bothers me the most is that my music can be heard blasting out of the headphones when listening. I tried using these headphones for recording and the music leaking from the headphones is picked up very loudly in the mic. So, if you are looking for a set that doesn't allow everybody in the room to hear what you're listening to, then look elsewhere, because these are not it.The other thing that annoys me is that the wire, while very long, ALWAYS gets tangled. The sound is okay, but the constantly tangling cord and the noise leakage really ruins these for me. So, needless to say, I am on the hunt for a better pair of headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Headphones which just DON'T LAST","review":"I bought a pair of these last March and they lasted about 9 months, NEW.

I live with these things on my head 8-10 hours a day 5-6 days a week, so they get pretty heavily used. They were fantastic for the first few months. I bought them in Feb '07.They do fit nicely. I've got little ears & the cups fit right over my ears--very comfy. Until back in July/August that is. These are adjustable to fit over any size head & the grips/teeth inside that are supposed to hold the ear cups to a certain point keep slipping. And that eventually causes pain cuz they hold my ears pinched to the earpieces of my glasses. I was willing to live with that.As of Sept '07 I have to hold my head a certain way to be able to hear anything out of either ear. There's static if I move my head at all & I'll completely lose sound out of one or both ears.I will never buy these again. $30 for five months? I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wish I Could Have My Money Back","review":"In less than six months these headphones stopped working. It only plays out of the left side now. I take care of my headphones because my profession involves post-production audio, so I'm not just throwing these headphones in a bag somewhere.

But these are extremely tight. Now I would have been prepared to bear this pain, if the sound was great. But sadly, the sound quality is average. I have a pair of Takstar TS-411 headphones that I got for free with my guitar amp. They cost around $6-7 and so, seeing as these were $[...], I hoped for a big improvement in sound. But no matter how much I wanted to, I couldn't tell any difference. I had to return them and suffer a $[...] shipping cost. I say don't buy these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get any better for the price","review":"First you have to keep in mind that these headphones are only $20. But the sound is great. I've had them for about a year now and Sennheiser is the best. I have a pair of skullcandy's that cost $130 and these blow those out of the water. The bass, mids, and highs are all clear and sound great. Being an audiophile and having worked in designing home theater I think I understand music and I love these. Yes there aren't as good as a $1,500 pair ... these are $20 and like I said earlier, for the money you can't get any better.It is also important to realize the headphones simply play the signal they receive. Therefore the better the source the better the sound. Using them with your mp3 player or computer they sound good. But use the 3.5mm adapter and plug them into a high current amplifier and these things scream! I've been very impressed with the sound quality these headphones produce. They are also good at noise canceling. Can't praise these things enough. Great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"good value headphone","review":"These Headphones are great!!! For the price they rock. I was tired of those cheaper phones and spent a lil extra- the purchase was totally worth it. Before I got them I honestly read every single review on Amazon.

At work I like to drown out the rest of my coworker conversations so like most normal folks I listen to music. My set of Grado's (which are exceptionally great in their own right) bleed way too much for a work environment. Since I already had experience with these cans a few years back I decided I couldn't go terribly wrong. I find them to be very comfortable to wear although, when I wear glasses I do notice a little tension around my ears. If you are a full time glasses wearer you may want to look for something a bit more accommodating. As a bonus they come with a handy cord collector so you don't have an enormously long wire dangling about.They may not have the worlds most accurate sound reproduction and a few minor flaws here and there but they sure are fantastic given the price point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound, but also lets plenty others in","review":"I knew upon purchasing that these weren't noise-blocking, per se, but they do let in lots of external noise for being surrounding headphones.

These are a lot sturdier and tend to stay in place on my head. They do make things a little bass heavy so if you listen to classical or things that do not have a large bass component, these may not be for you. Most users who listen to music with a good beat will not notice this and will typically prefer this effect. I find these to be pretty good headphones for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I bought this based on its reviews - wanted a cheap but decent sounding set of headphones to just leave at my desk so I wouldn't feel too bad if they got lost/stolen. I guess I shouldn't have expected much for $20, but the audio quality on these headphones is really poor. Not enough midrange, tinny trebles and severely boosted, boomy bass.

A little more money but I'm very happy with them.Brian"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphones for the Price","review":"You can't buy a better set of headphones for the price. While they might not be comfortable enough for long hours of continuous wear, these headphones sound great and have an extra long cord to allow freedom of movement.I've only had these for a month, but durability looks pretty good, simple slide mechanism to adjust to your head and cushioned ear cups don't appear cheap or fragile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser Headphones","review":"The unit works well and has a nice long cord and was a good value.

I am happy with this purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good quality proce rate + comfort","review":"Price quite low for this quality and comfortFirst, I have classic sized head and ears, they perfectly fit on me, really comfortable and not moving, even when I am walking in the street! The cord is very long, that may be usefull at home, for outside, you can always fold it in your pocket.I am using it with my iPod and the sound is really good, it may not be as good as in a $200 pair of headphones but it is still quite pleasant to be in a bubble when you are listening to your music! I am no audiophile but I do like music. I like to hear bass frequencies and good resolution in the music, and no weird noise when the sound is pushed louder.I tried them on my computer, but the sound card is not so good, so due to the computer, it's not really pleasant to listen to music this way.For a low budget, that's definitely worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than HD 201","review":"The Sennheiser HD 202 has better sound quality than the HD 201 and (at least when I bought them) costs about the same, so of these two it is in my opinion the better buy.

Avoid these, I gave these to my father who lives in a nursing home and has a roommate. with my last visit recently I noticed he wasn't wearinghis new headphones and then I found out why. The cord where it split was not allowing a constant feed of sound and was like listening to snap crackle and pop (just needed some milk) plus the ear cups just came apart and my father is not the type to do sit upsand push ups while listening to ZZ Top. Just sits in his lift chair and watches tv for most of the day. These are cheap and I suggest avoiding them. I've mailed them back to Amazon for credit.

They do not sound the best, but for twenty bucks, they will get by for now.These will be the last set I order without trying them on first. I do not have exceptionally large ears, but the padded cushion sits on part of my ear and after extended wearing it begins to hurt.

I plugged it in, pushed play, and sound only came out through the iPhone's speaker. I pushed the cord in as hard as I could and it started playing through the headphones, but I had to hold it in that position or it would come out. After inspection, I saw that it was just the black rubber that was preventing it from going all the way in. So, I took a pocket knife and shaved about 1/16 inch of the rubber off and now it works fine. Only do this if you have common sense with a knife, however. It's fairly dangerous. The sound is great. I'm just glad I don't have to send them back."},{"rating":"1","title":"sound great -- while they work","review":"This is the second set I've bought.

That is because I believe it takes atleast a month or more for the initial enthusiasm and excitement to fade away. I have been a great Sennheiser fan. I own three headphones. All three are sennheiser. One is for sport and gym; the other is for travel and this is the one for home. I bought these headphones four months back. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about its sound quality. It is definitely worth the price or probably more. But the chord is too long and does not have a proper protection at the end where it connects the ear piece. This makes it too vulnerable to break and consequent disconnection.While my last home headphones (also sennheisser) lasted for a year and two months, this one lasted for four months. This is frustrating.This review would help people who are fussy about durable heaphones.I give 0.5 /5 for its durability.Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"vivid mid-frequecy performance, weak on bass","review":"And I agree on other customers' reviews, this phone reallyflattens my ears.

I would definitely buy them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the price, nothing better","review":"I've paid twice as much on other headphones with half the sound quality. I gave it a 4 star rating overall because of one thing - they're a bit tight. I used to use them at work, but after wearing them for an hour your ears go numb. they don't fit around your ears, but rather push right on them. But, like I said, for enjoying music, nothing compares for this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good audio & cheap but uncomfortable","review":"Overall, I wouldn't recommend these headphones. The sound is great and they look pretty cool, but their too uncomfortable. It's not that the headphones are tight, it's that the cups aren't deep enough so extended listening can hurt a little. I've found if you don't constantly adjust the headphones you can't notice the discomfort.

I can wear these, but I'm in pain in a few minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Sound for the Price","review":"I became very frustrated in the attempt to find a pair of headphones that worked for me, and I have a drawer full of discarded headphones to prove it! In the ear types didn't fit right, and most over the ear sets let in too much outside sound. I was reluctant to get something as bulky as this set appeared to be, but figured it was worth one more try. After friends had recommended Sennheiser, I decided to try them myself. I didn't want to spend a lot since I had spent so much on other sets. Another review mentioned that this set is great for small head sizes, so the combination of listening to my friend's set, the low price and the fit persuaded me to try them. I am very happy that I did. The sound is fantastic and surprising at this price. The bass sounds are strong without being overpowering. The fit is great, and they are very light weight. They also cut out outside sound better than anything else I've tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance for the price","review":"Pros-Great sound-Cheap price-Extra-long cord-Cord wrapper for said long cord-Comfortable for ~2hrs listening time-Good sound block of outside noiseCons-plastic construction gives impression of lack of durability-even though ear pads go around the ear, extended listening can get (physically) tiring on the earsI use these headphones in the office @ work, and they do an excellent job of shutting out the constant noise of other office workers, & office equipment. I am often impressed at the sound quality & often prefer these to home audio, or car audio. They can make your head hurt if you listen for an extended period of time. But that usually means it's a good time to take a break anyway. Take care of these, and they should last you a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Noise Isolating headphones for the price","review":"I purchased these mainly to avoiding bothing anyone when i wanted to listen to music on my PC or if Im playing a game either on my consoles or PC. They block out sound quite nicely. the sound is pretty good. My only complaints is that the bas is a little boomy, though it can be adjusted and after prolonged use you ears start to get sweaty form the isolation form, though it can be taken off, which is a nice feature. For 20 some odd dollars however you'd be hard pressed to find a better deal with this level of quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser HD 202 Headphones","review":"So far I really like the Sennheiser HD 202 Headphones.

I wore them over earplugs with the volume on high to drown out my roommate, and there was very little distorion. I'd recommend them to anyone who wants to drown out bothersome noise without spending [$$$]+ on noise canceling headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the money, but audibly inferior to more expensive headphones","review":"My primary reason for buying these was I need an inexpensive headphone for my kids to use on long trips for listening to music and watching movies. The earbuds don't fit in their ears very well, and the over-ear headphones help block out airplane noise a bit. They have performed perfectly well in the purpose for which I bought them. The one reason for giving these four stars is that I also own a pair of Sennheiser HD 280 pro headphones, and the HD 280s are clearly superior in their sound quality. (There are a number of design features I like better, too, but I wouldn't expect those in a headphone at this price). The HD 202 is much more limited in both low and high frequency ranges, while the mid bass range sounds a bit too loud to my ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last 6 months","review":"I purchased these headphones in Dec. 2009. I use them EXCLUSIVELY at my desk at work. Each night when I'm done, I place the headphones in my desk, cord wrapped around the headphones (like you would with any other pair). Within 4 months, I lost sound in the right ear. Now, at the end of June, I'm beginning to lose sound in the other.I understand you get what you pay for. I wasn't expecting much. Durability would have been nice, though. Because they didn't last, I classify it as a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Head phones are extremely uncomfortable","review":"I looked at the product reviews and noticed that at least one reviewer said that the head phones squeezed his head but I had experience with this manufacturer and liked the price so I bought a pair. The one piece plastic head piece does not adjust and becomes very uncomfortable after 10 minutes and I don't have a big head. I put the head phones over the arm of my couch to stretch out the head piece which increases the comfort zone to 15 minutes but whatever plastic they use has a remarkable memory and starts to squeeze. I would not buy these head phones knowing what they are like even though I think the sound is first rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good external noise cancelling","review":"I got these earphones for using them through my Mexico city subway travels.

These headphones complied with my requirements. They have nice sound reproduction with great bass response from where I know (amateur music listener) and the price tag is very good. At the beggining, I had to get used to the earcup size, but now they feel great in my ears. The weight of the heaphones is optimal, making them already more comfortable. Also, they bring up a generous amount of cable so you will never get short if you are using them in situations where you have to be in some way separated to the jack plug, etc.I am happy with these headphones, I recommend them a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Good Comfort Bad","review":"I returned these headphones because they were uncomfortable to wear for even a short period of time.I bought another pair of Koss UR-40, because my first set were accidently broken.I was going to try another brand had heard Sennheiser were a good name, but wasn't happy with the fit over the ears or how tight they were on my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice headphones","review":"These are really nice headphones, the sound quality is good and they do cancel out a bit of the surrounding noise.

I'd recommend these to anyone looking for headphones and value."},{"rating":"1","title":"very uncomfortble","review":"I own this HD202 for year+, in term of built quality, I would say it's 4 stars, still functioning well, no failure yet.

I mostly use them when watching DVDs or listening to music late at night. However, I chose this particular model because a number of reviewers had commented that they were very comfortable. I beg to differ. I can barely wear them over 1 hour before my ears start to ache. The headband is not adjustable and the pads feel tight.

Upon receiving the headphones I found them to be extremely tight on my head, with no option for adjustment. The earcups are a little small and barely fit over my ears. Keep in mind, my ears are fairly small and my head isn't huge. I gave myself a week to get accustomed to them only to realize that the left side of the headphones volume was considerably lower than the right sides. This coupled with the tightness of the headphones led to headaches and an overall horrible listening experience. i have since returned the HD 202's and got a pair of the HD 201's, which are not only cheaper, but incredibly more comfortable. They fit perfect, like a pair of headphones should. They also have a more balanced sound, while the HD 202's where extremely bass heavy.HD 201's all the way!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price with one caveat","review":"I bought these as a last minute purchase before I got on a place and have loved them. It's a really good budget headphone. The sound is clear and it fits comfortably around the ear. The ear cups can even be detached to fit into a tight bag.The only problem is the cord. It is absurdly long. It comes with a little plastic dongle to wrap the cord around, but that was clearly an afterthought because the the cord does not stay wrapped in there and has a tendency to get tangled easily. Pulling one of these out of a bag feels like trying to unwrap a long string of christmas lights sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"These headphones rock! I don't think there is anything that compares for the price. Sound quality is excellent. My only complaint is that they do make your ears a little sore after extended wear. Other then that I would recommend these to everyone looking for a decent set of head phones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Head band is too tight.. puts pressure on ears","review":"The head band on these earphones was too tight for me. It is not adjustable, and my head feels squished whenever I use them. I will now only buy headphones with either ear pads that are not attached to a fixed size plastic headband, as these are, or those with an adjustable head band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser HD 202 feedback / review","review":"Absolutely excellent headphones for the price. Crystal clear highs / excellent low range response as well. Lightweight, comfortable and they stay comfortable after wearing for long periods of time. The only negative aspect that I could mention is that even thought the bass response is really prominent, the bass starts to deteriorate at higher levels (probably due to the fact my receiver is rated at 170 watts per channel). However, one must remember that hearing damage WILL occur at higher listening levels (hence, I really should not be listening at higher levels myself....do as I say, not as I do!!) However, my listening preference is full bass/treble. Would I recommend this set to a friend, most definitely!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like them!","review":"I love these headphones, the quality is very good for what you pay for.

I am especially impressed by the long cord that the headphones have as well as the minimized movement of the headphone frame. The sound quality is good but I cannot compare them to any high end headphones as I have not owned anything above $50.

They sound great. They are a little heavy on the bass, but most people like that. I can't detect any distortion, even at high volumes. In short, I haven't heard a better set of headphones even at four times the cost. This one is a no brainer. Buy them.UPDATE A YEAR AND A HALF LATER: The headphones continue to perform flawlessly. I really think these headphones are the best kept secret in electronics. After using them for the past year and a half, I am very pleased with both the sound and the durability of the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"very decent","review":"cord has no easy way to shorten. it is too long but that is better than 2 short. very excellent sound"},{"rating":"2","title":"great headphones to block out background noise","review":"i like these a lot. the price / quality ration is excellent.

The Sennheiser have surprised me with their sound quality. While not quite as good as my boses of last year, the sound quality is comparable and the Sennheisers are one fifth the price.If your a bass junkie, these are probably not right for you, but I found the sound quality to be more then adaquate and the ipod drove them to higher volumes then I can stand. They do an excellent job of reducing outside noice and are fairly comfortable on my head.If your looking for workout headphones, I would not recommend these. I don't think they will hold up to strenous activity. For around the house and walking, I find them to be a great value for the money. On my next purchase, which historically will be in 6 months... I don't know which headphones I will purchase, but they will be of the Sennheiser brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid if Your Ears Are Normal Size","review":"For a closed headphone the sound on these is solid, period.They do a good job of blocking outside noises.For me, they were a bit uncomfortable.

The Sennheiser 202 sounds fantastic! You wont be disappointed. I live in a dorm with some noisy neighbors and being that I am a poor student I needed something cheap that sounded good and this fit the bill. It blocks out a fair amount of noise and sounds great. I'm an audiophile on a budget and for the sound reason alone, I would say buy this again.My only complaint, which really isn't a problem, is that the cord is ridiculously long.

Full rich base that makes my Sony MDR-600s sound like Apple earbuds. Shipped and delivered on time by Amazon. My only con is size, since I have a HUGE head (yeah, it's a personal problem). These cans are not for fat heads like myself, and they hurt after a while. My normal sized head college age son is begging me for these, so I think I will give them to him and look for some larger cans. I just hope they sound as good as the HD 202s."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am pleased!","review":"I have been enjoying music of all types for the last 55 years! Finally bought an 80G iPod and began loading every album, 45, cassette and 8 track tape collected over that period onto the wonderful little device. I own a tree farm in Wyoming and spend the year running snowplows, tractors and mowers. These great earphones let me hear the music over the motors without blasting out my eardrums. Great Price! I like 'em."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, especially for the price!","review":"The sound quality is nearly unbeatable for this price. I've been playing The Beatles, Radiohead, and a few other bands through it and they sound amazing. When opening the headphones I felt they were built a little cheap, but it's definitely nothing too awful to deal with. They still seem built well enough to last quite a while. I also hooked them up to my Yamaha P60 digital piano and the sound quality is great, it picks up the lows especially well and gave a good sense of vibration. Definitely a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound Quality but..","review":"Well, I just got these headphones. First test was with Camels \\"a nod and a wink\\". Wow! they sound excellent, rich tight bass not muddy or boomy, smooth highs never shrill or distorted. Crystal clear vocals. Really exceptional sound for 27.00 and had I paid more, I would still be happy regarding sonic quality. Now the down side. I have a very small head and these still fit so snug that it hurts my ears. I cant imagine anyone with a medium to large head being able to wear them. Unless my ears are just out of wack somehow. Im hoping they will expand a little over time. If the comfort level increases for me...i'll come back and add a star. If they fit you well, please dont crucify me, this is just my own experience! *Update: Okay, now they have broken in a bit. More comfortable against the ear cartilage. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sennheiser HD 202 Dynamic Headphones","review":"LASTED ABOUT 4 MONTHS, ONE SIDE OF THE HEAD SET STILL WORKS, FOR $25 I EXPECTED A LITTLE MORE DURABILITY.

The headphones were shipped to me in two days, and I absolutely love them! the cord is long, its easy to use and the sound quality is fantastic! You couldn't find a better price for the same quality of headphones ANYWHERE! The only problem I have for these headphones is that the ear muffs are a little small and I find myself figiting with them until my ears fit properly. So if you have big ears and will have these on for a long periods of time, you may want to reconsider buying these. But other then that, these were probably the best thing I've bought on Amazon so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money","review":"They are pretty comfortable and the sound is excellent. I haven't had very expensive headphones though! so it's hard to tell how much better they could be. There are no annoying buzzes or background sounds. The basses are very deep and the insulation from surrounding noise is very good. The treble levels could be better though (compared to my iPhone/iPod's earphones, which sound a little better in high pitches). Overall, a great value for the money I believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser HD 202 Dynamic Headphones Sold by: Digital Media Source","review":"I thought I'd walked into a concert hall the first time I listened to music with this set.

If you don't use more than 45 min at a time, I can say that don't even think!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great value","review":"I bought these over the HD-280 Pros because I didn't want to spend $100 on something that might be unfomfortable (my previous pair of Sony's were just too tight and my head isn't even that large).The sound is quite good for the price. I use them mostly for mid-study music so the volume isn't very high. I can wear them for long periods of time without any pain and I just like the thought of the price that I paid and the value received.If you want something really bassy, these are not the headphones for the job. But if you want a great pair of headphones for a great price tag go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, while it lasted.","review":"It's been a year now since I bought this and finally the right ear stopped working. For few days, I got it to work by wiggling the cord just below the set but now, it just won't work. But while it lasted, it was good to me. The headset was comfortable enough to put on for hours, sound was crisp, and just enough bass to satisfy my ears. Although the price went up 10 bucks, I'll order one again. The warranty states 2 years but I doubt I know where I put them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome sound for the money, but those with large melons beware!","review":"My first set of cans, and I'm mostly satisfied with them. Of course they're not perfect, but for the pricepaid, I'm not complaining a whole lot. So here goes:PROSGreat soundThumping bassClear highsGreat value for the moneyCONSFeels like a vise clamping down after a whileYes, these are so tight on the head that I have to take them off after about an hour.

I've never needed close to this length of a cord (a good thing)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headphones","review":"These headphones are very responsive and fit well. I particularly like the long cord.They are comfortable to wear for extended periods since the materials are good and the phones are lightweight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sound Quality ! ! !","review":"I used these for the first time on an airplane. There was a one year old crying for the entire 4 hour fight and with the noise canceling design, I never heard him. My wife had standard headphones and she complained about having to hear this kid cry the whole flight. Great Headphones at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound for the price","review":"I just bought these phones to use at work while listening to my iPod. I found that they are a little snug on the head, but not so much that its uncomfortable like previous reviews have stated. The sound quality is very good for headphones below $50. The bass response is excellent without being too overwhelming, and the highs are distinct. The mid-range can lack a little which is the reason for 4 stars, but overall they deliver fantastic sound. Definitely worth $25 in my book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good office headphones, ok for my large head","review":"Pros: Good sound, cushy fit, long cord, little or no noise leakage, so even folks standing at my desk can hardly hear music even if I'm blasting it.Cons: As other reviewers have noted the fit is snug.I don't find it uncomfortable though. I have a large head and can wear these for 1-2 hours comfortably. I wear glasses as well and I think if your glasses have a thick temple (earpiece?) then you might be bothered as your ear is going to be pushed down on that rather forcefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm listening to Stan by Eminem","review":"Alright I know people tend to believe reviews are the best way to know about a product so I'm going to keep this short and honest. Great sound, great bass, decent noise cancellation (although people can hear the music from the outside if its more than half an Ipod's volume), NOT too comfortable. Overall, pretty good purchase for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Sealed Cans","review":"Decent smooth sound. Bass is a bit too boomy for my taste. Mid-range is bit honky like most sealed cans under $50. Treble is subdued and lacking clarity, compared with the cheaper Koss KSC75. But I've heard worse sound at higher price. Definitely better than those \\"free\\" headphones that come with music players. It feels too tight for my head. The pads quickly get too warm for comfort. There is no way to adjust tightness with the plastic head-band. One plus side I noticed after I bought it based on the recommendation here, it can get really loud without having to crank up the volume on small music players like iPod nano. I don't regret getting a pair of these, which are probably the best sealed cans in this price range. But I'd recommend getting PX100 or KSC75 for better sound when sound leakage/isolation is not an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality noise cancelling headphones","review":"I have enjoyed these phones for about a month now.

The headphones are not of amazing quality, but considering the price I thought it was a good deal. About 7 months after purchase one side of the headphones stopped working. It's been 8 months since I purchased these headphones and now they don't work at all. Maybe, it's a case of you get what you pay for and I shouldn't expect them to work for very long.

After a few months, the left ear phone stopped working. I had to wiggle the cable to start it back up, until it finally got wiggled out and quit working.

Too bad it was too late to return. =(Hope you guys have a better experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good quality sound, poor durability","review":"The earphones were very good while they lasted. The problem is durability which impacts big the overall value.I got them as a gift for Christmas 2010 from my son, I was very careful in the use and, still, after 5 months of regular -not heavy- use, I got no sound at all through the left earphone, which kills the whole product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"The sound quality and the price are fantastic.

Bass is really good and the mids are okay. In short if you are a very picky about listening to music and dont wanna compromise on the sound quality then i bet you wont like this, instead go for a expensive sennheiser which would give you better sound quality. I dont blame this product for coz at the price it comes you can get only that quality. I returned my headphones the next day i got em, was very dissapointed with it. I would now go with AKG or higher end sennheiser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not available in a reasonable time period....","review":"These may be great headphone and this may be a good price but I will never know because the vendor does not have any in stock.

With the rebate, it comes out to about 20 bucks. I wasn't sure about other people's reviews at first but I am now convinced that Sennheiser is far superior in the headphone-producing industry. The sound is awesome! My 80 dollar Boston speakers couldn't match. One thing to beware is that it does not have a volume control. This addition would make the headphones flawless for the price. Buy these if you are on a budget and looking for the best bang for your buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"You WONT believe your ears!","review":"Forget those earbuds and behind-the-head phones, this is where the quality is. IF you have a little extra to spend for headphones, then SPEND THEM ON THESE.I used to own some Sony headhones and I spent $19.99 for them. They were the behind-the-head model. At first I was content with them until they decided to die on me. After some suggestions, I was directed to the Sennheisers. I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE THE QUALITY THAT I WAS MISSING!Crisp bass, very crisp treble, midtones are VERY noticable now. IT makes you feel that the concert is inside of your head. And since these are closed ear models, it blocks out most of those annoying sounds that can ruin your listening pleasure.At the time I spent $19.99 for these also but I got WAY more quality than I was expecting at this price. So get the diamond in th ruff, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right Side failed after one week.","review":"Don't be a fool like me.

I use them at work and they do a pretty good job of blocking out most noise without totally blocking out all sound, which isn't what I wanted anyways. If you want noise-canceling, go buy noise-canceling. If you want really good headphones at a great price that can play loud music through a pretty broad range, then buy these and be happy that you're getting such a good deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Headphones sound great, great price too","review":"I ordered these after the fake leather on my old Aiwa headphones started flaking off when I used them.

After 3 months of use four of the headsets quit working at a rate of one per week. The company is good at honoring replacements but one must pay for the shipment there. If you buy these through Amazon the company will NOT refund the purchase price no matter what. They will just continue sending replacements. For us that means A LOT of down time as we have to wait for the replaced headsets to be shipped back. The problem with all of the headsets is that one side abruptly quits working. It appears to be a defect in the product and probably should be recalled (in my opinion).So...purchase at your own risk. You might not be using them after the one year warranty is up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right side has already failed","review":"I haven't even used these for a combined total of two hours and the right side is already dead. I get either complete silence or pure static. I didnt lay my head down while using them or anything. Even if these HAD worked as expected, they arent very confortable to wear, they mash up against the sides of my ears instead of truly fitting over them.Only buy these if you don't mind driving down to the post office to return them, AND your significant other is attracted to cauliflower ears.UPDATE:If one of your sides have failed, try BLASTING the volume for a moment. I normally keep my TV volue at about 50, but jamming it all the way to 99 forces the bad side of these headphones to start working. After it works, then turn volume down to your normal listening level. It still goes bad from time to time, but using this method has brought it back to working condition every time so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold up to wear","review":"Sure, the price is great and the sound is good, while they last! I've gone through two of these. One lasted 18 months, the next 6 months. In each case, the right side failed, I assume because of a bad connection. I don't mistreat them, they just don't wear well. I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not last","review":"The headphones sound OK, but mine (and others) fail at the plug--and you get low volume or one-channel or cutting out. Because of the way they are constructed, they cannot be easily repaired. The Sennheiser web site does not sell replacement plugs or cables for these units and in fact offers no guidance or comment on this probem at all---even though it is a common mode of failure. Once this failure happens, your investment is essentially lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable!","review":"The sound is good enough to live up to Sennheiser expectations, but the ear pad sits on the soft cartilage of your ears, rather than your scull bone, so it is uncomfortable and too warm.I have a lighter Sennheiser at work that I wear all day without problems because it has a very gentle and light ear piece that rests on only the middle of the ear. When I come home and put on this heavy, uncomfortable set, I am always disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST budget headphones!","review":"Sound engineer in Los Angeles. I LOVE these headphones and use them for everything - MIXING, airplanes, recreational listening, ect...Cons: Not too many. Tight on big heads. Cups may feel small on big ears.Pros: Rugged as heck - extremely durable construction. Silky smooth and pretty darn FLAT sound. Highs are rolled off just a tad. This is not ideal for mixing but it's GREAT for LOUD listening, as you can crank them UP without yielding a 'tinty' sound.WHAT A DEAL. As good or better than phones around $100. Buy these now, you will not be disappointed. My primary set that I take everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable, excellent sound","review":"Very good choice. I picked it up mainly after looking at recommendations in Amazon. I wanted something which was noise cancelling and not very expensive. These seemed to fit the bill and now when I have used them, I realise that I have made the correct choice. I use them in the office, to shut out sound and work without any interruptions- not the best reasons for a noise cancelling set of headphones, but they fit the bill for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I bit bulky, however the quality of sound with my iPod Nano is unbelievable!

First the cord is WAY too long, its made for people watching TV from 10 feet way. TOTAL PAIN when walking with the MP3 player. The sound is alright, but the bass is lacking. The cheap plastic connectors wear out so you speaker position won't stay in place if you use very much. They hurt after a hour of wearing. Can't hear outside noises, so thats good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable and Affordable","review":"These were the best headphones I could get for the money. They have a super long cable which I like to use for my television late at night when everyone else is asleep and I want to keep on watching a movie. After constant use, I started to notice a slight buzzing sound that occurs at certain pitches, but it doesn't bother me too much. Very comfortable---at least more than those in ear ones. After awhile, they start to pinch my ears and I notice it especially after I take them off. Overall, I'd say it's a good buy. They weren't expensive, so I wasn't expecting much. Definitely worth buying if you are looking for the best bang for the buck kind of deal. I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Phones, Great Price!","review":"If your tired of trying to find a pair of \\"inexpensive\\" headphones to break even with then stop right here! The Sennheiser HD 202 phones will serve you well. The sound they produce is good enough to make me smile. The highs are crisp and clear. Even the lows produced by these little wonders will make buying them worth your wild.This makes my second pair and I would only change to something else if Sennheiser quit making them. Just try to remember that everyboby \\"hears\\" differently. What sounds good to some folks may not sound \\"as good\\" to others. They also do a good job of blocking out unwanted noise while your listening to your favorite tunes and movies.All I know is that they work great for me and hopefully they'll work great for you too. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for price","review":"I wore these on my flight from FLL to BOS on Jetblue and they were great. Sound was terrific.

However, due to the uncomfortableness I would not recommend this product unless you want your ears to hurt!"},{"rating":"1","title":"makes my ears sore","review":"Okay for the money but I have a lighter Sennheiser at work that I wear all day without problems because it has a very gentle and light ear piece that rests on only the middle of the ear. When I come home and put on this heavy, uncomfortable set, I am always disappointed. The sound is good enough to live up to Sennheiser expectations, but the ear pad sits on the soft cartilage of your ears, rather than your scull bone, so it is uncomfortable and too warm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound, but tight fit","review":"I read some of the reviews that said the same thing: good sound, but small headphones. I figured: what the heck, I have small ears...I'm probably OK. Um...nope. The best way I can describe the size would be the circumference of a small cupcake paper elongated into an oval. Or, maybe the size of a large chicken egg, if it were a symmetrical oval. The good side of the size, though, is that they are smaller and lighter than other over-the-head donut headphones.If you can get over the snugness(it kind of irritates at first, but I don't mind after a half hour or so), the sound is great. Good bass, clean highs. It has a nice, long cord (probably too long if you're just going to listen to your iPod or computer), but also comes with a nice plastic thingy with a belt clip to wrap the excess cord around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressed","review":"I must admit I was very skeptical when I bought the HD202 due to the cheap price, but after traveling 4 hours on the plane I was very impressed with the quality of sound I received. Most of all I was impressed with the noise reduction...........It made a huge difference, especially weeding out the noise of the plane and people talking loud. Very good investment I must admit, especially during this economic crisis."},{"rating":"2","title":"They serve a perpose for the price.","review":"These headphone are okay. the sound it alright. after awhile you can tell day by day the sound quality get's fuzzy and the quality. starts to wear out. however, for under 30 bucks. I didn't get them here. I got them from musicians friend (under 25) the other downside. is they get way to warm for my ears also, after awhile there uncomptable. (sorry bad grammar)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal","review":"These headphones are terrific - exactly met my needs - just plain listening to music. Two things you might or might not like. First, the cord is WICKED long! I have to wind it up. Second, if you have a large head, these might be too snug for me - but they fit me just fine. Definately recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser HD 202 is the real deal","review":"This product is the first product I have bought online that has gone above and beyond my expectations. I use these headphones almost everyday. The quality of the bass is amazing and the long cord is a plus. It is very comfortable to wear and has the versatility to be used with an amp. The price of this item was a bargain and even S&H prices couldn't change that fact. The only negative thing I can say about the Sennheiser HD 202 is that their portability and design is lacking. This aren't headphones you can put in a purse or ordinary back without the possibility of it being damaged. But that is a very minor negative aspect if you look at everything else it has to offer. I was tired of cheap headphones so I did my homework and these are the best for the price. If you really want to hear EVERYTHING than the Sennheiser HD 202 is perfect for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"The Sennheiser HD 202 are very good for their original price of 40 but are even better for $25. The sound is mostly balanced. At times the treble can be a little harsh, but the bass performance is good, even though I prefer a little more bass in my music, I am perfectly happy with it. The HD 428 offer better highs and mids but lack in the bass area compared to these. The quality is good for the price and are very comfortable to wear even though since my ears are large, they don't fit in the somewhat modestly sized ear cups. The padding on the ear cups and headband is very soft. Overall, I very good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing headphones for the price!","review":"I reviewed these headphones in the following video.[...]As stated in the video, these headphones are excellent for anyone wanting some in the < $50 range. They may not be as good or cancel out as much sound at the > $100 phones, but they are definitely among the best for this price range. They are very comfortable, seem to have quite the sturdy design, and the sound quality is excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy. very tight on your ears","review":"I bought this head phones by looking at 300 plus positive reviews and ignoring negative reviews. But I am very disappointed with my decision. These are very tight on my ears. I cant wear them even for 30 minutes with out paining my ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Uncomfortable and Inaccurate Sound","review":"I am surprised by the high rating these headphones have received. I based my decision to buy these on the reviews. I don't know what shape heads you guys have but these cans just crushed the sides of my head. The fact that the cups don't fit completely around the ears did not help.Sound wise, there was almost no midrange at all. Instruments did not all come through the sound and while bass was fairly strong it was mainly thumping and not pleasant.I'm surprised Sennheiser would even want to tarnish their name with these inferior headphones. I most definitely recommend trying a different pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best","review":"I purchased this product because I wanted a headphone that didn't go inside my ears like the ones that come with most mp3 players. I have reason to believe that they cause hearing loss. Anyways, after reading several reviews on this product I decided to buy it and was happy to find them at such a bargain discount price. Now that I have them, I'm a bit dsappointed because the sound quality isn't as great as I expected and they're very cumbersome. I had a chance to listen to a friend's Bose headphone set not long ago (similar style but a bit smaller) and I was blown away by the difference in the sound quality as well as comfort of fit. This head set tends to feel uncomfortable after a short while, pressure that you can't adjust. I ofetn find myself digging out my $2 in-ear hheadphones that came with my ipod. Right now, I wish I would have saved that $20 I spent on this pair and put it towards a Bose headset, more expensive but well worth it in comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for, better products out there","review":"I have had this product for a little over two months and use it daily or every other day for my commute to work. The headphones become uncomfortable around my outer ears after 1-2 hours of use. After two months the covering for the wire where the wire connects to the earphones has peeled back and will probably snap within the next few weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great portability","review":"Even if this headphones are considered for home use , I've been wearing them everywhere for last 4 years. Thats how long they lasted for me. Best headphones you can get for this price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Twenty bucks worth. No more no less.","review":"They are light weight and can be worn for a while, but the audio quality is about what one should expect from low-budget headphones.The bass has an inacurate presence.They have a cheap feel to them and the foam will probably start flaking some day.Sennheiser has some great headphones, but these aren't one of those models."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my first order on Amazon","review":"I didn't expect this headphone to be that good, and with the price, you can't go wrong with the hd202! this is my first order from Amazon and this won't be the last! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound","review":"Apparently this is the old version now, well, that's alright. This has been a very good purchase, and high-end Bose headphones were never a necessity for me - these do the trick just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are fantastic.","review":"These sound better than the other headphones by sennheiser until you get in the 200+ range. The sound better than dr dre beats. And they sound better than skullcandys. So you can't go wrong with these for the money. I think every body in the world should have a pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"These sound like crap","review":"These headphones are very comfy and feel nicely made, but they just don't sound good. They are very muffled and sound like they are in a box. I will be sending mine back soon..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to get something for nothing !!!","review":"I think these headphones are a joke and happily I bought another pair for 150 that are good. I hate digital music and prefer vinyl. I have been an audiophile for 30 years. Digital music has no depth or warmth. The worse thing about these headphones is the comfort. They hurt and feel cheap. Do yourself a favor and spend at least 150 on a good pair of headphones. It helps the sound of digital."},{"rating":"1","title":"They hurt you'r ears","review":"The sound quality is OK, but these things are extremely uncomfortable. My ears ache within 2 minutes of putting these on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sennheiser HD 202 Headphones","review":"I gave a set of the headphones to my daughter and when she opened them and put them on there was only sound coming out of one side. She said she looked and it looked like one of the sides had been pulled out, not making a connection. What can I do to return them and get a new pair? Thanks for your response. I will let anyone who is interested know how Amazon handled my problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am at the point of not trusting these reviews anymore","review":"I do not believe around 1300 out of 1500 buyers gave a 4 or a 5 rating to these headphones !!!I am not trusting these reviews anymore period . These headphones have horrible sound , poorly made , are uncomfortable to the extreme , they are a piece of junk. Sennheiser should be ashamed of offering such a piece of junk , haven't you guys from Sennheiser learned anything from Steve Jobs yet ?No more $20 junk , geet the Bose or Sony or Yamaha.This is the end for me , I will NOT read the misleading reviews anymore, if you want to buy a product test it first at a local store , then order thru Amazon , that generally has very competitive pricing and excellent delivery .No further comments ."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!","review":"When I bought these headphones, I chose to ignore all the negative reviews about the right side of the headphones. DO NOT buy these headphones, those reviews are correct. After just a few months, the right side of my headphone completely stopped working. I do not abuse my headphones nor use it that often, maybe once a week.Also, please think hard about comfort before buying these headphones, like many reviews have pointed out. THEY WILL HURT YOUR EARS just after 10 minutes. I'm asian and my head is not big at all, these headphones are REALLY TIGHT on your head and they will give you headache. My little brother experiences the same thing.The two years warranty is not that good, why? because I just checked out USPS today and it will cost $10 to ship with confirmation number. I tried USPS and they told me it will cost $16 to ship, almost the cost of the headphones. I live in california and the shipping is to Connecticut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mudd.","review":"I was curious as to the low cost. If you like Bass, I mean head submerged in 3' of pudding Bass then these are for you. If you need these to mix, learn parts (other than Bass) or listen to symphony you will be very sad. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound is not bad, but my ears hurt","review":"This is my second Sennheiser and they both are not compatible with my ears. As all other reviewers have stated, the sound is good. After an hour of use, I need to take it off. Simply too much pressure. So I hardly use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cheap headphones","review":"Works very well with my MP3 player. Amazing bass, very long cord, surround the ear cups could be a little bit bigger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of treble","review":"The overal sound isnt bad but the high end is a little raspy and a little louder than the mid and bass. But for the price its great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Time","review":"All I can say is that this was an outstanding purchase and it was delivered bang on time. Cheers and Fairplay to yous!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, but ouch!","review":"These are some really nice sounding headphones, especially for such a low price. Unfortunately, I can't wear them for more than 30 minutes because they *hurt*. A lot. I don't have a large head as some of the other people with similar problems noted; in fact, the average person's hat is about three or four sizes too big for me. Since I wear glasses, they're even worse. I've tried stretching these and bending the band to the point of worrying about breaking them, but they're still very tight, which means my duct-taped Koss headphones are going to be getting some more use after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Heads need not apply","review":"Well, I was optimistic when I ordered these. They were comfortable after the simple adjustment to fit my head. They fit tight around my ears and the sound was really great. Nice bass, and the mids didn't drift to the high end like some others.However, after wearing these for a half hour, I found that the tension squeezing these on my head gave me a headache. They're too tight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound. Good price.","review":"These headphones are very good. The sound is phenominal and they effectively block out most backround noise. The bass and treble are very well balanced. The chord is a bit long but that's not an issue as it can be wound up. The headphones also came with a jack which allows me to plug them into my guitar amp etc. I would highly recommend buying these headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for people who wear glasses (spectacles)","review":"I purchased this one from Walmart after seeing reviews on Amazon.com. I searched reviews on Amazon especially from people who wear glasses I couldn't find them so I gave it a try and here is my verdict.They are horrible and it hurts bad and are not suitable for long hour listeners. After wearing them, the initial 10 mins I have to struggle to keep them in a position that will be a bit comfortable but I cant wear them for more than 1 hour.But I agree that the sound quality is far superior compared to other headphones.If you are really looking for comfort and you wear glasses you can consider buying Bose over the ear headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upgraded from iPod earbuds","review":"Given what these cost, this is incredible value for the money. I expected them to sound better than the cheesey earbuds, but man I didn't expect them to sound *so* much better. I'm hearing tons of bass that I wasn't before, and the mids and highs are clearer. (Disclaimer: I'm no audiophile, I've never owned anything fancier than fifty-dollar Sony headphones.) The over-the-ear design (as expected) blocks out tons of sound, so it'll be great for the noise during my bus and train commute.I understand what people mean when they say these headphones can be uncomfortable. They are perhaps a tad too tight and too small around the ears. However, I find them to be much more comfortable than something lodged in my ear canel, like the earbuds. And there's lots of padding on these. Honestly, it's not bad at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising headphones for the moolah.","review":"I bought these very inexpensive 'phones because I was sick of clients killing the $250 sets in my commercial recording studio. Much to my surprise, I've received a few positive comments (and no negative ones) about the sound and feel of them.I'm very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Headphones","review":"I like the fact that these headphones block out the surrounding noise a bit. They are not huge so you can actually commute with them and it drowns out the sound of the train. The only thing that I don't like is that these headphones are pretty tight. I have to adjust them every so often just to let my ears/head breathe from the 'squeeze'. Just be aware that these fit tightly before you order them.
