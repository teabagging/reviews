It provides great insight into US foreign policy, particularly in South America up to 1982. You can almost begin to identify with the 'retail terrorist' but then it's the 'state terrorist' that emerges as the real problem. It also makes you realize the enormous extent to which the 'american people' have been duped by the covert operations of Presidents veiled in Hollywood style PR.When I see this kind of well researched content in the New York Times or the Economist, I'll believe we are on the right track!By accident, I read the \\"Marcos Dynasty\\" after this.

Also, the basis on which the WM3 guys protest their innocence is that they're \\"mis-understood\\". Aaaaaaaa... bless. They were involved in a Satanistic cult and it's rumoured that the 3 kids they killed were killed for part of some sort of ritual. Granted, It's not proven, but how do you prove something like that.

This live set includes many of their best tunes, including \\"Ginette,\\" which seems to have become their signiture song. The group seems to grow and shrink, depending on who knows what? Included in this lineup is Jean Corti, a legendary accordionist in France, but whose own recordings are shamefully rare and hard to find.

It was sealed, new, works just fine and I enjoyed it for the holidays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reflections","review":"I loved reading this book. I was able to relate many of my childhood situations with this author. It was very amusing. I found it refreshing to hear some truths about the school system. This book should be read by anyone from Junior High School age through adulthood. I enjoyed how the time frames jumped from present to past and vice-verse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack substance","review":"I found the book to be so easy to read that it borders on boring. The level of expressions are childish and the sentences are too short considering it is written by someone who claims academia.The story was somewhat interesting but it would have been better told as an oral account. If the author was a success it would have added legitimacy to his story. The school in which Bernard is a principal has received \\"F\\" ratings for two consecutive years. It is best to purchase books by authors who have completed their journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great but for a fatal flaw","review":"So I bought my pair of Bronx shoes from a shoe store, not Amazon, but they are the same model. I really like the style, and they are very comfortable. I liked everything about the shoes until one of the eyelets came apart and scratched a hole through the shoe tongue about five months after I bought them. No problem, I thought, Bronx is supposed to be great about repairing or replacing shoes. Well, that is not the case. I emailed Bronx, and they were not helpful at all. So, this is a great shoe, but it seems to have a manufacturing defect wherein the holes that the laces go through come undone and a little metal wire will poke through. I didn't use these as football shoes or anything, just light to normal use. Well, it was all too bad, because I wanted to love them. Would not recommend for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"Despite a promising story by Moore, the art is terrible. The coloring is not bad but the drawings are really, really amatuer and ruin the story. I've been a fan of alternative comics for over 10 yrs and was really looking forward to an adult meditation on sexuality by Moore but the art renders this book almost unreadable. Check it out at your local shop if possible before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alan Moore's laziest work","review":"I know I will get negative votes for this review but I have to be honest. I thought that the name Alan Moore in the cover of anything was the guarantee of a good story, but this magazine proved me wrong. I call it a magazine and not a book or graphic novel because the story is only 24 pages long and consists of three much shorter independent stories, merely snapshots. The stories are lazy (Mr. Moore didnt try hard enough this time), they are supposed to be erotica, but I found them nearer to drama than anything else, and now to the worst part: the art, very childish, very amateurish, hardly evoking any emotion at all. I will read The League of Extraoduinary Gentlemen tonight because I need to forgive Alan Moore."},{"rating":"1","title":"CNPS7000 cannot cool Core 2 Quad","review":"I have a quad core Intel chip, and the CNPS7000 fan just can't keep up with the processor.

I am using the promptings of the spirit to let you know how I felt at the time and to encourage you to not read this book. You don't need to read the book and feel as I did. Learn from my mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Christianity deserves a thoughtful review","review":"This book is thoughtful in its refutation of Mormonism, but for anybody to say they know the 'real' Christ is utter self congratulation. Any Bible scholar can tell you that there is a minimum of one Christ per author of the Bible. Mormons made up a new religion (constantly evolving, even), yes, probably akin to something L Ron Hubbard would create. But do you all really believe that your brand of Xtianity is more true than anybody else's? Why? There are different versions of the Bible, even more interpretations of it, and a plethora of fanatical jerks who will force their own beliefs on the rest of the world. Religion should be about getting closer to god and a deeper understanding of yourself and your place in this life, not about being a part of the mighty majority, bent on the terestrial damnation of those less 'insightful' (or vain, maybe) than yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religous Libel","review":"I received a copy of this as a missionary in Texas in 1996. I skimmed through it and found many errors and what appeared to be intentional misrepresentations of the Mormon church, its doctrines, and its members.If you receive a copy of this book, I suggest you take an honest look at it, write a complaint letter (this is what I did), and mail the book and the letter back to the publisher. They need to be reminded they are making money off of making a mockery of an extraordinary religious faith, and that is unethical, if not immoral. It is absolutely NOT what Jesus would do. It is what Jesus had done to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geer's work is crucial for witnessing to mormans.","review":"this book is a welcome addition to the libraries of those who defend the christian faith. the manner in which the book is writen is charming and quite eloquent. mrs. geer uses facts and personal experience to convey to her \\"beloved morman people\\" that the jesus christ they worship, is not the jesus christ of the bible. every morman woman should have the opportunity to read this book. it will change the way they view the after-life and open up many promising doors to a better hope for eternity. i enjoyed every line of mrs. geer's work and i am a man. therfore; without hesitation, i urge mormans and christians alike to read \\"mormanism, mama and me\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hard to Handle","review":"Found this used. I had a bit of a hard time with the writing style of the book, and so many of the misrepresented ideas in it. I know several LDS people (as they prefer to be called) very well, and this book does not sound like them. They are most definitely Christian, and more so than some others I have met. I just didn't like the style or the false/ exaggerated info in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just consider the author","review":"I read some of the book. I understand where she's coming from, a disenchanted mormon (who are traditionally quite passionate about their old faith). Just consider that, and that she has cherry-picked some of the admittedly weirdest quotes from some of the most controversial of mormon figures to craft an attack against the mormon church. I wasn't impressed by her story or her writing style, but she did write in an engaging way.To say though that mormons aren't Christian though is simply stupid, no matter where you stand. First you have to ask by whose definition of Christian are we considering them? And then you should see that it is circular logic. I am liberal with my definition so all who rely on Christ for salvation are Christians. But if you believe that only your faith practices \\"true\\" Christianity then you will be quite lonely with your Christian friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"If looking for another Mormon bashing book, this is for you.","review":"I have read this book. I decided to read because I was interested in the authors beliefs and wanted to learn of her journey. Though there are moments of this they are far too few. In my oppinion it is mostly full of a extremely slanted view of the LDS church. There are many points that are stated as fact that are false. I do not wish to go point to point on all of the inaccuries. They are countless. Those points have been argued countlessly and have no reason to start another.I felt like it was another Mormon bash. I would loved to have read her story of her mighty change of heart. Of her story. Her love of the Savior. Not the confusing, contradicting, false information she squeezed it in with.I know my Savior lives and loves me. I thought this book was going to share another journey of hope. But I found myself kind of feeling sad at the missed opportunty instead of uplifted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great offer from Thelma","review":"The wonderful maze that mormonism has pulled off since it's inception is amazing. Thelma has outlined the blatant lies that are constantly withdrawn from potential converts. I recently ran into a missionary who denied the fact of blacks holding priesthood roles until 1978. I, like Thelma gently explained that the coverups are on going to this day. He didn't think the Mormons had anything to do with the the Olympic bribe scandal. Naivity is a great characteristic to have if you are looking for a converts as a missionary. I look forward to a follow up on any one who accepts her challenge. Morman-a word used to imply that Joseph Smith was a man-made religion based on his own inspiration. For the reviewer who denies his own ignorance of what is Christian doctrine and what is plagurized replicas. But that is just one more truth that Thelma explains, the lies and deceit of the mormon church. Good people will enjoy this book. People in denial won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disorganized explanation of Mormonism","review":"Grandmother recollects growing up in the Mormon church.I could not get into this at all.

I gave up quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"The theology didn't bother me, but the writing!","review":"I am not Mormon and was interested in reading this to better learn the differences between what most Chrisrians believe and what Mormons believe. I did learn that, but yikes - Ms. Geer seems like a nice person, but she is just *not* a good writer. There was something about the tone all the way through that just bothered me. Oh well, at least the price was right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what's its cracked up to be","review":"I have read both Neuromancer by Gibson and Snow Crash by Stephenson and others novels by both authors and this book is not in the same league as either. I will admit to not finishing it yet but thus far Ms. Ore has managed to make it very confusing. I don't mind books I have to stay with to enjoy but this reader prefers something a little less confusing. Is our heroine in the present? The past? The future? If she's in the past, why is she using modern syntax? Wait! Is it really a \\"she\\" in the first place? I can't figure out squat and as I read for enjoyment, I don't have time to screw around with it which is why it's on the very back burner for the time being.Read it if you have nothing else better to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Verismo","review":"Absolutely no recording for the hi-fi purist. Even for a 38 year old recording the sound is badly congested to the point of being painful to listen to. The music, Giordano's last opera, is definitely not up to the standards of most of his earlier work. The performers, especially the soprano, are overparted. Plenty of off pitch singing especially when \\"can-belto\\" gets really competative. In short, a second rate provincial Italian cast.

I tried them out and noticed the following. No or very little low frequency response (Base). With the volume up there is a hissing in the background. Since the frequency response of these earbuds is mostly high end, that hiss could quickly get annoying. By lowering the volume on the inline volume control and turning up the volume on the device it was plugged into, I was able to reduce the background hiss.I have another set Plane quiet noise canceling headphones which are substantially better than the Coby earbuds. However the Plane Quiet headphones sell for about $70.00 so there is a significant difference in the price.These are OK but I think you might consider spending a little more money getting something better. If, on the otherhand, you are looking for a cheap pair of disposable noise canceling earbuds and have low expectations then you might consider the Coby eabuds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor design","review":"The plastic tips for the ear buds come off ridiculously easy - I haven't lost one yet but I've come close so many times I know its just a matter of time.

My children grew up listening to this music every Xmas as it was one of our favorites to play during the season. I eagerly awaited the CD version of the LP and am very happy to have the CD. Almost every song on the CD is a real performance classic by this great organization. The best carol, for me, is the Arise, Shine, Thy Light Has Come. Taken from Saint-Saens Christmas Oratorio, the beautiful melody was redone to new verses; the result is one of most beautiful Christmas carols and I hope that it will become better known. I think there is just something about this arrangement, melody and words that are almost heavenly."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their Best","review":"This is one of our favorite Christmas albums.

So, in other words, I reccomend the game your young kids, and warn any teenagers that are interested in this game- this is a game you play when you are bored and have nothing better to do, and even then, it won't entertain you much.

Billie sings (on the studio version) 'Oh well, It happened again/She walked away with her boyfriend'. And if you've seen the live home video recording from 7/16/90, Billie changed those lyrics to 'Oh well, It happened again/She walked away with MY boyfriend', and was totally serious about it!

I wasn't around when they made the four albums that make-up this one, and I only first heard Green Day in the car with their hit Basket Case, from their album: Dookie.As in other reviews, I first got into Green Day when Warning came out in 2000. And now with this release of the old treasure of Sweet Children, along with Kerplunk, I finally get to hear Green Day as they used to be.This is a nice CD to add to your Green Day collection.

Other bands I've been a fan of have re-released old stuff, but took the time to make the music 100 times better....redid guitar tracks, vocals, etc., made it more polished. The actual music from the album sounds exactly like it did in 1991. A great album, don't get me wrong, but don't expect a wall of guitar sound now. It's the same as it was. If a couple of songs off a concert video interest you or a handful of songs from an old radio show interest you...spend the money. If you're a fan and have never purchased this album...spend the money. If you're old like me and bought this in 1991, save your money....it's been there, done that.

My favourites are 1,000 hours and paper lanterns.

I liked them so much, though, that it caused me to look into their first two albums, this one and _Kerplunk_. Amazingly enough, their first effort actually turned out to be pretty darn good. The songs are very catchy, and many are actually punk love songs, if that sounds weird enough for you. Anyway, this is totally unlike Green Day's later style, so that word of caution is in order. Otherwise, give it a try. My main complaint is that the recording quality isn't always perfect since the album wasn't released by a major studio. (Perhaps the new remastering fixes that problem a little; I have the original CD.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Day's Great Beginning!!","review":"I thought this was a great cd from my longtime and all time favorite band of 10 years. This cd was a great start in Green Day's career, because it wasn't chart topping, and it wasn't a bomb. My favorite songs on this album are At the Library,Going to Pasalacqua,16,The Judge's Daughter,409 in Your Coffee maker, Dry Ice, and I Want to Be Alone. That may seem like all of the songs, but to tell you the truth, i loved all of the songs! Those were just the ones that stood out to me most. I have the original recordings of 39/Smooth and the rest of the EP's and LP's, and the first recording of 1039/Smoothed out slappy hours, but this one was enhanced with extra footage, and the recording was enhanced as well, so i HAD to go get this as well.

After reading it, I'm now following the diet. It's an easy read that explains all of the aspects of the diet very clearly. I was very sceptical about \\"protein\\" diets, however Penny has made it all clear to me. She teaches you a very simple two stage plan on how to lose weight gently and safely, and in a healthy and organic way. You are not deprived of foods the way other diets have been known to do. After you have safely lost the desired weight, you then easily maintain, reintroducing some of the foods that got you onto a diet in the first place. But, this time using a much smarter and healthier approach. And all this time you've become a much healthier person because the diet also cleans and detoxifies your system.

I would recommend that you do not buy this product.Also the consistency of this product during the chewing process is dangerous as it becomes very thick and sticky in your mouth and may cause a blockage in your throat rendering you unable to either spit it out or swallow it. Somewhat like a thick, fast drying epoxy/glue.I will never purchase this product from anywhere again.My favorite protein bar is called \\"Power Crunch\\" bar, but due to the fact that I was looking for a lower price by the case and was also looking for a smaller bar, which had more protein packed into it.

I usually go for a plain vanilla yogurt one but thought I would try these as they seemed to be a good brand. Unfortunately, my first choice was strawberry cheesecake flavor. I can put up with some flavor discrepancies but the strawberry is just plain gross. It has a terrible after taste that hits you about 10 seconds after each bite.

I would highly recommend the Chocolate....but definitely not the S'mores!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty!","review":"I'm pretty picky about protein bars - they have to have plenty of protein, be large enough to satisfy my hunger between meals and above all, taste good. The Pure Protein chocolate peanut butter flavor scores on all three counts and has become part of my regular rotation (I like variety). At 2.75 oz, they're substantial and remind me of a Snickers bar, minus the nuts, dense in texture and sweet without being too cloying. If like many, you're tired of bars that remind you of sawdust, this (and my other favorite, Pure Protein's Revolution) will change your opinion. There's only 3gm of sugar and it's low in fat, but at 350 calories, you might want to keep it down to one per day, or work it off at the gym.You can save some money be setting up a subscription for monthly deliveries, a welcome convenience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great protein content, bad taste","review":"I got these bars for snacking during the day to maintain high protein intake.

The top layer is always the flavoring. For s'mores, its like this sweet, creamy (almost oily) filling. It doesnt really taste like s'mores, just sugar. The bottom layer is where all the protein and sugar alcohol is, and that part by itself is disgusting to chew.Now the idea is these 2 layers will mix in your mouth and you'll get an ok taste... but that never happens. The top layer dissolves almost instantly, while you're stuck chewing the bottom layer for far too long. The first few bites are extremely sweet, but as you try to chew down the bottom layer, you start tasting that bitter sugar alcohol. People who claim these taste \\"good\\" either have damaged taste buds, or they swallow the bottom layer.They would be better off just mixing the whole thing together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fresh","review":"I bought the strawberry shortcake flavor and would not recommend buying it from Amazon. The top layer of strawberry flavor is ok, but there's only a little hint of strawberry. The 'cake' part is just nasty (unfortunately that's 80% of the bar). The only description I have for it is inedible. The package I received has an expiration date of Sept 2011 so technically it should be fresh. But there is no way these bars are suppose to taste like this. No would ever buy them. I'm going to get some from the local store to see.

What distinguishes this 2001 collection is how effectively Toibin sells the work of each figure essayed. I was never interested in James Baldwin before, but after reading Toibin's take, I ran out and enjoyed two Baldwin books. In the piece on Thomas Mann, we see how many of his male infatuations Mann turned into art--which infatuations into which stories--a subject being studied in detail only now by his biographers. And in the profile of Pedro Almodovar, we meet the Spanish torch singer Chavela Vargas, whom Almodovar rescued from obscurity because her confessional art mirrored so closely the values of his own cinema of women. A wonderful collection of essays that illuminate, indeed sell, each subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing collection of essays","review":"In this series of essays, Colm T��ib��n explores the lives of nine artists whose homosexuality greatly influenced their art, and whose art greatly influenced their lives.

I live in the Basin and Range and wanted to know about the geology of my new home, so I tried again. After a few pages of the second chapter, I quartered it, ten pages at a time. Ripping is good exercise for the fingers. McPhee just doesn't know where to stop, using 10 examples where a good author would have used 2 or 3, and a great author would have used one.I'd appreciate pointers to other books on the basin and range, specially ones by authors who are not so full of themselves.A bit of irony: I noticed as I was piling the quarters of the book a blurb on the back in which Steven Jay Gould called McPhee succinct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chrome plateing fades fast and tie downs don't hold much weight.","review":"I have tried three other brands of tie downs on different trucks that I have owned and purchased these because they looked great.

This is the third Razor scooter we bought for our kids and the 2nd A3. The A3 Razors are more stable to ride for all sizes. This one did not steer as silky smooth as the first two, so I contacted Razor instead of returning it. They promptly sent me a full set of bearings, which took only a couple minutes to replace. Now it is as smooth as the others and my daughter is quite pleased to move up to an A3 over her smaller A model. Great customer service from Razor and a really solid product. I just happen to have one with a minor defect out of the box. if you're wondering which Razor to get, the A3 has the larger wheels (125mm vs 98mm) and really makes a big difference in terms of a more stable ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good looking and strong","review":"This Razor A3 scooter is a great step up from the inexpensive, less robust scooters you'll find in many stores.

I feel like the 125mm wheels are the bare minimum for real world use and comfort requirementCons:1) Heavier than the A1. Not by a lot and not enough to be unwieldy, but enough to just be noticeable when collapsed and being carried around.2) Larger than the A1 when collapsed. The stepboard is larger and can't be \\"compacted\\" further, so no surprises here. It's just large enough to wish it was smaller, but not annoyingly large.3) \\"Only\\" more comfortable than the A1 by.....if I had to put a number on it, maybe 30%?

Some information and videos from her childhood and TLC life are inserted where appropriate to provide background information to the stories she tells to her friends and to the camera. This creates a quite informative picture about her career and some of her roots, but more importantly, it makes me feel like I can participate in one small piece of her very private life. It lets me have a very close look at her own, off-stage personality with all the twists, chaos, brilliance and these incredibly good energies inside... It's quite some time now that Lisa has left this planet, but I keep missing her a lot.

It is overloaded with archealogical references, and sice it is written in order of topic and not region, it is very disjointed. It is hard to follow the history, myths, and beliefs when they are spread out over several chapters.

Davidson gives well -documented explanations of such things as holy places, feasting and sacrifice, rites of battle, land-spirits and ancestors, foreknowledge and destiny. As a historical fiction writer, writing about Viking times, this book is a valuable resource for me.

Her works are generally scholarly- footnotes and references are plentiful- but are written in an easy to read manner.Myths and Symbols deals with the similarities found when comparing pre-conversion Germanic and Celtic religious beliefs and the possible explanations for these similarities.The book consists of several sections:Holy places, Feasting and sacrifice, The rites of battle, Land-spirits and ancestors, Foreknowledge and destiny, The Other World, and The ruling powers.The first sections are headed by verses from the Christian Bible that, while apt, seemed a bit out of place. In several instances the reasoning was vague, but my reservations were adequately dealt with in her \`conclusions'.Mostly Scandinavian and Celtic lore are examined but a few tidbits from continental and Anglo-Saxon beliefs round out the comparisons drawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"The standard by which others are judged?","review":"This work is typical of H.R.

And the demigod Gutierrez would likely be (probably is) extremely disappointed to learn that an awful translation makes this book entirely unbearable to read. The translator of Tropical Animal, whoever he is, brutalizes Gutierrez's work. It plods, stumbles, and staggers along with no clear appreciation for either English or the book's original Spanish.

Told in the street-wise yet literary voice of Pedro Juan, we are taken from his life in Havana all the way to Sweden and by the end back to Cuba. The story revolves around Pedro Juan's relationships with Gloria (Cuba) and Agneta (Sweden). One relationship is stormy while the other is somewhat bland. A well-told story with some good universal insights about art, love and compianship.I've read other reviewers slight this book because it was 'dirty' or 'shocking' which is ridiculous since the book's literary value is obvious from the first page. You may not always agree with Pedro Juan or his choices, however the story is as truthful as any country's literature and the reader walks away with a deep insight (a touch depressing) into the darker side of Modern Havana."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a sad and empty life","review":"Growing up I read through Henry Miller's trilogy Sexus, Nexus and Plexus and Tropic of Cancer/Capricon and finally The Rosy Crucifixion. So I am inured to this kind of narrative: debauchery, drinking and ramblings on just about any topic.The difference between Gutierrez and Miller is that the latter had a deeply philosophical bent that at some level gave the books heart, whereas stripped of that, as in Gutierrez's case, leaves you with a life devoid of anything other than sex and drinking. And we all get past that stage once we get into our adulthood.I guess that Mr Gutierrez is still stuck in his 20's. For a man in his sixties to be behaving in this manner is not exciting and interesting but empty and pathetic.If this was my life I wouldn't make it past 25."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glucose Test Strips","review":"Ordered these when we were very low and my husband tests 2x a day.

It conveys the ideas of post modernism in lucid everyday english rather then having its messeges veiled in the recondite jargon of academia. It is a distillation of the rudimentary ideas that run through all strands of post modern thought. As a neophyte to the subject, I found this book far more useful then any other cultural theorist's longwinded and wordy treatise. Other vital introductory texts on this subject are Anderson's \\"The Truth about the Truth\\" as well as \\"Teach Yourself Postmodernism\\" by Glenn Ward.

Gallagher did a great job making them like the Buffy characters from the show.I do wish the characters had shown a little more emotion, but in 3rd person it's always harder to do. Great book for any fan.If you haven't seen the second season then you can still read the book. I am not sure if you could if you've never seen the show.

She arouses him in his sleep and has sex with him while he's still semi-conscious and doesn't realize what's happening until it's too late. Sick!

Both characters seem to be struggling with their problems in what makes a very long plot.I would have expected both Serena and Francis to be stronger, strong-willed characters, with more sense of the world and more cleverness.Overall, I didn't enjoy this book because it probably lacked what the books from the \\"Malloren World\\" have: wit, adventure, passion, strong-willed characters, tension and fun.

She is running away from her 2 brothers who want to sell her again in marriage to a man just like her 1st. husband. If she didn't marry they would sell her to a brothel. Mathew Riverton was notorious. He used Serena who he married when she was 15 as a sex-slave. When Francis rescued her she gave him the only thing she could, her body. Well she had been trained to by her husband. Serena soon discovered she was pregnant after being told before she was barren.A fantastic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Rogue!","review":"I have read most of the rogue series and not necessarily in the sequential order. Most of the books have been spot on and engaging. But here is the exception. I found the premise contrived! The book caught my interest in the beginning but lost me half way thru the story. The lead female character Serena was strong enough to survive a previous humiliating and tortuous marriage yet becomes a whining victim when she meets the man of her dreams. Why? I felt that the writer had a terrible editor who failed to edit the book properly. The story becomes too long and monotonous. Also the love scenes were ridiculous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real stories about police work","review":"I loved reading this book because I always wondered what being a police officer was like. The stories in Cop Tales 2000 made me feel as though I was right there on the street with the cops. If you want to read about what real cops do, this is the book! I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blues Masters","review":"I was very disappointed by the mistreatment of these great masters by the producers of the DVD. Why people constantly feel they have to be interjected into history electronically is beyond me. The idea of this DVD is that a production company got a hold of what I believe to be some of the finest quality footage of such greats as Sonny Terry, Otis Span & Muddy Waters, and my problem is the amateurish treatment given to them in the presentation. The host Collin James is interspersed in between the clips sometimes talking over the musical intos and physically inters cutting his flat singing self into a \\"Crazy For My Baby\\" segment with Willie Dixon. To own some of the clips die-hard blues fans my want to drop the funds to buy this keep this review in mind and you wont be as disappointed as I was. Next time just put the clips on a DVD and put it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"How naive are some men","review":"The first two parts of the book are great, the story of Amanda and Maggie, but the last part is boring and boring, everybody who read this book have to know that Robin will never do anything with Judith.How Judith's husband never knew anything? If you are the president of any big company the first thing that you have to do is to have your eyes open, with your wife and with anybody, here JS put Judith's husband as a stupid naive, and that kind of persons can't be the president of anything.I can't tell you that this could be real or not, but how many times a man can deceive a woman and at the end that woman (Maggie)will return to him (Robin), the same end was in the Valley of Dolls and I didn't like it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, but not as addictive as VALLEY OF THE DOLLS","review":"If you are considering buyig this book, you are probably looking for the same addictive trashy fun that you found in Valley of the Dolls. Well, it's addictive, though it may not be great literature (come on, it's not supposed to be), but it definitely doesn't supersede its infamous predecessor.First of all, it is NOT a sequel, though it is also about the moguls of show business. The characters in Valley of the Dolls were far more intriguing-- I felt like I really knew them. In The Love Machine, you learn a lot about a certain character, and then all of a sudden they disappear from the book. Nevertheless, I'd recommend this book to anyone who couldn't put down Valley of the Dolls-- it'll keep you coming back for more, just don't expect the same thrill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the love machine, baby","review":"Douglas Sirk once said of his film\\"Imitation of Life\\" that he would have made it for the title alone. \\"Love Machine\\" gives me that same vibe, as the title alone is the perfect Susann pitch. It's so perfect that the novel itself doesn't quite live up to the visceral wallop delivered by the title alone. But never fear- there's booze and pills and cheap sex in expensive hotels, and a young woman falls from grace as the glitterati whispers behind Champagne glasses; in short it has every ingredient measured in the correct (over) proportions. The book required of me death defying feats of page turning and near fatal soap operatic character identification. I'm still reeling, and my brain is still recovering from the abuse... The Love Machine is a love machine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BULL'S -EYE ! by M. Boucher","review":"First there was Neely O'Hara in VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, then there was Robin Stone, another wonderful character in Jacqueline Susann's second novel THE LOVE MACHINE. You'll have a ball in reading about this man's trouble life, as well as the people surrounding him (Ethel Evans, Christie Lane, Judith Austin, just to name a few). Susann dishes up a tasty read with this sizzling, whirlwind pacing saga of the rise and fall of a TV mogul. You won't be able to put it down !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody does it like Jackie!","review":"So it's not Shakespeare, but it's just as dramatic! Grittier than J.S.'s others, The Love Machine glides thru Robin Stone's relationships with three women in the TV industry: the beautiful and tragic Amanda, the beautiful and gutsy Maggie, and the once-beautiful and desperate Judith with microwave-boiling scandal and intrigue. I can only ditto everyone else's praise, but will add that it should be re-read for its treasury of campy wit, i.e. when Christy Lane says, \\"I don't want a beauty queen, I want a **cker! Get me Ethel!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"no 1 intimidating","review":"i just loved the way jacqeline tells her stories it is quite touching and true to life while reading her novels like you are watching amovie"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate writing reviews like this, but it was disappointing.","review":"Thankfully, I bought this at a used bookstore and did not pay full price for it. I read Valley of the Dolls the first time a few months ago and was absolutely thrilled with it. Now upon reading this one, I wasn't expecting Valley of the Dolls revisted, but it really wasn't up to par. Valley of the Dolls is a trashy, compelling romp. I found Robin Stone one dimensional and solipsistic, with a bunch of silly, boring females fawning over him.If you are a die-hard Jacqueline Susann fan, you might want to borrow it from the library before purchasing it. Otherwise, don't bother. I'm half-way through Once is Never Enough, and it is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well...","review":"Got this as a stress reliever for my girlfriend.

It features 9 remixes of songs on Shaggy's \\"HotShot\\" plus 3 new songs \\"Too Hot To Handle\\", \\"Why You Mad At Me\\", \\"Special Request\\". It also has a live version of Shaggy's #1 Hit \\"Angel\\". The standout remixes on the album are: \\"Freaky Girl (Strip Mix)\\", \\"Chica Bonita (Players Mix)\\" which is 10x better than the original, and \\"Hope (Dukes Mix)\\". The 3 new songs are HOT!!!

And that's exactly what it is. Set in a vividly drawn landscape of Scotland, White Male Heart follows two young men who don't fit in with the rest of their neighbors in their small village. They hunt together, and make friends with a local poacher who everyone else is afraid of. When a young woman moves to town, one of the men falls in love, and the other goes off the rails. This is dark and stylish novel in the tradition of Cormac McCarthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despicable","review":"Sickening acts of cruelty (mostly aimed at animals), shock for shock's sake, and plenty of drizzle don't amount to a story worth reading. Mr. Nicoll has a fine, workable writing style, but his protagonists-- one a sadist and psychopath-in-training, the other confused and morally ambivalent about the vicious doings of his so-called friend-- are worthless. The book's grim details are less realistic than simply disheartening. All in all, a coming-of-age story to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hart Framer does not live on as Dead On F21s","review":"I was trying to find replacments for my favorite hammer. I have been a builder for thirty years and have used many brands. I like many of my friends spend alot of time behind these tools and usually become very fond of certain tools for a reason. The hart 21 smooth face hammer was a beautiful,well finished, well balanced,framing hammer . I was very specific about finding the same hammer and was led to beleive that Dead on's product was a match. It wasn't. What I received didn't even match their own product picture. The balance is not there. The metal is not even the same so that the differance in metal weight creats a larger overall hammer head, bigger and cheaply milled.In short I feel that my time was wasted so that someone could make a quick buckSincerely Tim Price"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"After having watched \\"Heavenly Creatures\\" starring Kate Winslet which dramatically tells the story of this case, I searched for more information on what really did happen and this nicely rounds off what was presented in the film.The documentary asks pertinent questions on the nature of the relationship that led two teenage girls to commit a murder. The whole question of the nature of their relationship, were they lesbians or just teenagers experiencing their first emotional infatuation which can lead to sexual experimentation. Or were they friends imbedded in a fantasy world enabling them to feel free of all social, cultural and moral limits. What I feel the documentary misses is an investigation into Pauline's family. They don't really say to much about the life of the victim nor the man whom she raised their child with, more is focused on Juliet's parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite well done","review":"I ordered this as a 7-day rental, to see if I wanted to buy the DVD.I found it quite well done with good narrative and a masterful interspersing of interviews. I especially enjoyed the insights of women who had attended Girls' High at the same time as the Parker/Hulme case.Had the DVD been priced at $20.00, it would have been an instant buy but I doubt if I'd re-watch it enough to make me feel happy about the extra $10.In other words, it was a \\"glad I rented it\\" instead of a \\"gotta have it\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN UTTER WASTE OF TIME","review":"First, this is not a movie...it's just a bunch of different people (mostly gay/lesbians) talking about an old case where 2 high school girls committed a planned murder of one of their mothers (because as they saw it, she stood in the way of their being able to stay together instead of one of them moving away to another continent).The only good thing about this in my opinion, are the few landscape shots of the area. The rest is simply a 5-10 minute not so noteworthy story dragged out for FAR too long! It really was a total waste of time and even if you might think you'd be interested in it from morbid curiosity or from some gay/lesbian angle...there's nothing there. Speculation they might be lesbian but then again, possibly just very close schoolgirls.

They were collected from a MAV conference hosted at Notre Dame in 2001. Therefore, the papers are all 10+yrs old, the topics are all over the map, and most can now be downloaded for free. I was disappointed to find this as a collection of AIAA papers, most of which I currently already have printed out in a research binder I keep for my PhD research work.

I feel that if you want to hear Green Day's earlier work buy this instead of 1039 because its easier to swallow and catchier than 1039, even though if you listen to 1039 enough you will get to the point where you love it. My favorite song on this album has to be 2000 Light Years Away, but I also One One For the Razorbacks, Welcome to Paradise, Private Ale, Dominated Love Slave, Srangeland, and Christie Road. For the most part every song on this CD qualifies as at least decent, if not above average. If you are a punk rock fan and want to hear what Green Day sounded like in the early 90's, pick this one up, and also choose it if you have the choice between this and 1039."},{"rating":"2","title":"The album that got them noticed with Reprise","review":"The album that got Green Day on the billboard charts for 2 weeks.

Ms. Nugent has bridged the two genres in a wonderful way. Though the story flows like a novel there is never any question as to which characters and events are fact and which are used just to facilitate the telling of the story. She accomplishes this by adding chapter notes to the end of the book. In these notes she clearly and scrupulously separates know facts from fiction.Well done!

In all fairness I write formal courseware so perhaps I am prejudiced. I found the book full of anecdotes and quotes and little else. For example if Moore's Law and the same phenomenon occurring elsewhere is new to you then the first chapter will be enlightening.I know that informal learning is effective in the proper context. I ride motorcycles and learn a great deal around the motorcycle groups and sites. But if I needed a structural engineer then I want to see some paper showing experience backed up be a degree where they had to take formal classes and tests.One point he makes I have found to be accurate in that much training is wasted.

Trouble is you don't know which is the waste until you do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The United States Constitution Study Guide","review":"I found this guide very informative and thought provoking.

This book is very helpful as a reference and saves you a lot of time. Best part is, you don't have to read it in sequence. You need a certain amount of C programming experience, but you probably already have that if you're using this processor. It has a good coverage of Code Composer and it has what you need to get you up and running quick. Definitely worth it in terms of sheer time saved in optimizing programs. When you're through with this book, you have a better understanding of the processor and an overall better picture on implementing those algos you use so often. Good buy. Maybe not the best, but for the cost - excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never had trouble burning cds until this arrived.-","review":"I used to think all cds were the same because I bought fuji, verbatim, and even LG brand... but when I found 50 CDs for just US$10, I ordered right away.

The cover is bright and colorful but there is not one color photo in the entire book! The entire book looks like it was copied on an old copy machine and then thrown together. The original photographs of current cabinets that have been redone are equally disappointing. They are out of focus and of poor quality. They look like someone forgot to use a flash in poor lighting.

The first portion was recorded during the same studio period of \\"Change Of The Century\\" and the rest was done shortly after \\"This Is Our Music\\" recordings. The titles themselves were only given by Coleman just before the record was released.But all this info. can be discovered in the sleeve notes.

I took it out to a lake on a boat and it works very well. It gives the depth of the location and under water structure if it exists, or weed bed when it is present. When the fish swims by, it can let you know the depth of the fish just swimming by. After I observed the pattern of the fish depth, I set the hook/worm at the right depth and immediately we caught 1 striped bass and 2 rainbow trouts within 20 minutes, each worm caught a fish. The device really helps a lot, more than I can image. In the past when we went fishing in a lake (w/o this device) without knowing where the fish is and just relying on \\"guessing\\", we would not have such a luck.

I just dangle the transducer over the side of the kayak. When I paddle along the water movement near the kayak interupts the signal. If I am sitting still or drifting or paddeling slow it works fine. I have one lake near me that is over forty feet deep. The fish finder seems to have trouble with water over that depth.

I gave this one star because I could not give it less than that. This is exactly the kind of movie the non-discerning masses have come to expect: a plot and dialogue written by a first grader, atrocious acting (so bad you can tell even Anna Faris wants out of this mess), and every bad message you can think of to impart upon our children. Even the one scene you'd expect to be fun, the makeover scene, winds up with egg on its face. The only funny moment was the thing Shelly does with her voice when she meets people, for which no explanation is given, and that got old fast. I've seen many bad movies in my life and, well, add this one to the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"HB","review":"Came brand new in packaging, workd great. Great buy for the price. Very funny movie.

I picked up this movie with the hopes it would be a guilty plesure type of bad. I was disappointed. First this rips off SNYDEY WHITE and REVENGE OF THE NERDS in plot. It tries to have a lesson or moral to the story and it does. However,the script is not smooth. Things seem to move in a jerky manner. The movie never really decides on what it wants to be, either raunchy or sweet. The lead actress is quite good, but she is let down by the script. the other girls in Zeta house are not all developed and are short changed in screen time,i.e. the short girl. The villians aren't that bad and the big climax at the meeting is not exciting. The love relationship between the bunny and the man is not... well no chemistry at all. This movie sounds cute when you read the back cover of the DVD case but it never lives up to hope of a great \\"bad movie.\\" I know this sounds rather disjoined but that is the way the movie is."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Lightweight as a Playboy Pictorial","review":"While Anna Faris is a treat as always, \\"The House Bunny\\" is an unfunny, cliched picture that fails on almost every level.

And I really wanted to give them more stars, but I just can't because they are so difficult to close properly that I haven't been able to wear them! The thing about titanium is that it's super hard and after you open them enough to get them into the hole, it's impossible to close them properly again. I actually tore the hole in one ear trying to close them. So sadly, though they look fabulous, I won't be wearing them anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do they cheap out on the clasp?","review":"These would be 5-star earrings if they only gave a few more millimeters of length to the prong part of the clasp.

They became bent and lost the round look and never did properly close again.I keep them around to use at night when I am having some irritation problems ( and practically everything gives my earlobes irritation).I was hoping by now they would have made some improvemnt with the ease of handling. I am not convinced that this has happened. I am still sitting on the fence about buying the 14mm and giving it another try. But please believe me when I tell you the 10 mm are very SMALL.

We got it for my 1 year old little girl last year for Christmas, and she loved it from the start. (she is now almost 2) We have kept it outside the entire time, and it does not seem to have sun-faded or suffered any ill weather effects. She loves running inside and closing the door. At first she only backed down the slide, but now she goes down it in every directions. She climbs all over the entire thing, and jumps up and down on the inside platform with excitement. It has shown no sign of wear and tear despite the beating she puts it through. We even use it as a water slide in the summer when I spray the sliding board with water and she goes down it very happy. My only problem is it sometimes comes apart a bit when I move it mowe the lawn, and I have a hard time lining it back up. All in all, it is a great value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS CLIMBER!!!!!!","review":"Naturally Playful Kangaroo ClimberMy daughter loves this climber!

I was concerned when I put it together because the platform does not go all the way back and it isn't very big - I was afraid he would fall off backwards when standing on the platform. I had to stand over holding on to him to keep that from happening. He had a hard time climbing onto the platform, also. Now he is 2 he doesn't have any trouble but is getting a little bored with it now. He mainly pushes his cars up the slide. I would recommend a bigger play gym because this one isn't that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but toddler must be adult supervised!","review":"My son received this toy for his first birthday. We have had it inside on the carpet with an additional pad under it. He loves crawling through the holes, opening and closing the gate and crawling up the slide to turn around and slide down. He stands on the platform and plays in it as a fort. He is not afraid of it all. However, he should be! I know that he is still to young to be playing unsupervised on this toy so his father or I am always with him when he is on it. Still he has fallen off the platform at least 5 times. The last time he busted his lip and his Dad put the toy away for now. We feel that we definitely need to wait until he is more steady (18 mos.) before a serious injury happens. Beware of the platform - no parent is fast enough to catch their toddler falling off. But I still give it 4 stars for FUN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice addition to the yard, but...","review":"We have two issues with the one we have...<br />We got this for our daughter when she was about 20 months. Her legs were too short to climb up on the platform inside, so we had to put a step inside for her to get on. Also, once she had a growth spurt around 2, we removed the step, but then the doorway was too low, and she hit her head going in. It is very sturdy, she loves the slide, but sometimes gets frustrated with the doorway. We used it outside all summer, and plan to move it indoors once we have a playroom built in our basement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't put it together","review":"After reading the reviews for this and several items like it, I decided to buy the Kangaroo Climber for my 1-year old. When my husband tried to put it together, it was literally impossible. The sides were not manufacured correctly so we could not get each wall into its appropriate slot. Even if we had used a drill like some of the other parents did, the slide would not sit level. We returned it and purchased the Castle Climb 'N Slide instead. Much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious Design Flaw - Dangerous for little ones","review":"Beware! This slide has a serious design flaw and is a danger to little ones. The platform is not deep enough and on a number of occasions my daugther has sat down to slide down the slide and fallen off the back of the platform and hit her head/neck on the door. While my daughter loved the thrill of this slide when we first bought it (at 18 months), she has quickly outgrown the slide and finds the toy rather boring (and this is less than a year after purchase). Needless to say, given the number of accidents we've had using the slide and the short amount of time my daugher found this toy amusing, it was not worth the investment at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the timid. Amazingly easy to assemble.","review":"My daughter is sometimes timid about climbing on things. The Kangaroo climber gives her the option of learning incrementally. She can start by crawling through some holes. Then, she can climb up one step, then back down. The slide is low enough that she can climb up to the platform and slide down without assistance. It's rewarding to see her explore on her own and gradually try more challenging skills.I was amazed at how easy it was to put together. No tools required !"},{"rating":"2","title":"He can grow into it!","review":"Our son is only 12 months and we have been searching for a climber that is appropriate for this age and one that will also entertain him months from now. This seems to fit into our category. We put it together without the platform and slide because we were worried he would fall off of the platform a lot while learning to climb up and down. He has been playing with the toy happily crawling through the holes and climbing in and out of the front. This is working great and we thought it would be a great tip for other parents. Not to mention the fact that just as he is getting bored - we'll put the slide up and it will be a brand new toy again. Hope you enjoy this as much as we do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside or out--","review":"This climber is great! I originally had it in a playroom when my son was a little younger (he's almost 2 now) and now it's in the backyard....He loves opening and closing the door and the height of the slide makes it \\"easy\\" for them to climb up and let's us parents not get too nervous watching.. :-) I HIGHLY recommend this product!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Careful 'til they're old enough","review":"We got this climber when our daughter was 15 months old, which is a little early. We had trouble putting it together -- the holes where it pops together were too small, but called the manufacturer and they had us use a potato peeler (!) to widen them -- now it's fine! But we took it down after a month or two because she had fallen way too many times, though she's a great climber. She would just STEP right off the platform into thin air! We're looking forward to setting it up again, though, as I'm sure she's ready now (at 22 months)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best toy for little starters","review":"This slide is the best! We started with it in the house, it took minutes to put together. It is very durable and safe. The little door is neat because they can learn the open and close concept. And it has little holes underneath so he or she can climb through. I've looked at a lot of slides, and I liked this one the most for a first slide. Some slides are too high, or getting up to the platform is \\"unsafe\\". But I have no problem sitting back and watching my son play on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING!","review":"We have had this climber since my son was about 9 months old. He is now almost five, and STILL loves to play on it. Probably not in the ways the manufacturer intended, but he shows me daily how durable this thing is. It is in tip top condition even after four years of hard play. We kept it around for our daughter (almost one), and I'm sure she'll get just as much joy out of it.I highly recommend this toy, however, you might check a local consignment store for purchase. The shipping must be outrageous, and unless it's been outside, the color does NOT fade. And surely a consignment price would be much better than the [$$$] they charge in the store. NOT THAT IT'S NOT WORTH IT...OR MORE - it's just the bargain shopper in me rearing its ugly head.Anyway, enjoy it - I KNOW your kids will!"},{"rating":"1","title":"much smaller than expected","review":"We bought this for our son's second birthday for him to play on outside. It was much smaller than we thought being that it was designed for kids up to 4 years. There were two 4 year olds at his party that were WAY too big for it. This would be a great inside toy, but I would opt for paying a little more and getting something bigger that would last as the child got older for outside play. My son does play on it but it just has a very restricted area of play and it needs a step to get up onto the platform."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"My son is 15 months old, and he is already too big for this climber. He needs to duck his head to enter the door and is almost too long for the slide. He had fun putting it together with me, though, but then never played in it. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"keep researching","review":"After researching myself and all the good reviews this slide had gotten, I decided to purchase one for my 1 1/2 year old daughter. First of all, like some of the reviews said, this was a hassle to put together. What I didn't consider, until owning one, the grooves on the platform always have water in them from being outside, whether rain or sprinklers. So if outdoors be prepared to be wiping or tilting before each use. Another thing to keep in mind... I was concerned with the height of the slide, so I choose to go with the short one, only now my daughter's weeeeeeee,s, are more like we. I wish I opted for a longer slide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You Kangaroo!!","review":"We bought the climber when my twins were 10 months old and I was 7 months pregnant. I told my husband he couldn't come home from work unless he brought something safe for the girls to climb on! At first we added pillows all around to help protect their falls. Now it serves as the coffee table in the family room. All three play on it all day. They hang upside down and watch Sesame Street, go underneath and put together puzzles, hang a blanket over the top for a fort.... We put it outside for a while and they started climbing on the furniture again. The climber gives them a safe outlet inside the house. I don't know what I'd do without it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately my daughters favorite toy","review":"My daughter got this for her first birthday and oh what a hit. Although she was not yet big enough to climb up on the ledge, she had endless hours of fun openning and closing the door ( who would have known?) and crawling through the holes in the sides. She also figured out how to climb up the slide so she could slide back down. It is light weight enough that I can bring it into the livingroom and back outside by myself, yet study enough for a 7 yo to climb on . Now at 15 months, my daughter is able to climb up on the ledge and is venturing into climbing off via the side steps. it just seems to have so many ways for her to use it and shows no signs of fading yet. A definate must have toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"toddler fell out headfirst","review":"I don't think this toy is safe. It is fun, but the steps on the side leave a large hole and our toddler looked over it and fell over in a 360 flip. It was terrifying and I got rid of the toy. If it didn't have the odd lack of wall at the top of it, it would be a fun toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complicated Assembly/Won't Stay Together","review":"I would NEVER buy this product again. It took FOREVER to put it together, even with the directions and working on a level surface, and it NEVER goes together right. It never STAYS together. Sure it's supposed to just snap together, but putting the slide platform in is like pulling teeth. The left step wall WILL NOT stay on, no matter how you adjust it or assemble it or pound on it with a rubber mallet. My son loves to play on it when I do manage to get it together, but when he and his friends get together, it FALLS APART.I would buy something ALREADY ASSEMBLED or something that actually has things that HOLDS IT TOGETHER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for a climber","review":"I bought this for my grandson who is fourteen months old and a real climber. Luckily he was not home when I put it together, or he would have been frustrated by the wait. It took MUCH longer than advertised to put together due to one of the punched pieces of plastic not being punched out enough. Once I figured out the problem and learned how to hold up one part while inserting the other, it went together easily. As soon as my grandson spied it, he ran right over and began climbing and sliding. It has been over a month, and he still plays with little else. It is absolutely his favorite toy ever and well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch those Boo-boos!","review":"I have to say that I thought this would be a wonderful toy for my 21 month old daughter. We bought it and I tried to put it together right away. It was not as easy as advertised. I had to practically slamm the pieces together with my feet. Well, Maddy woke up from her nap and we brought her outside to play on her new toy. She was delighted. She was able to pull herself up on the platform and sit on her bottom and go down the slide. We did this about two or three times and then the last time she fell backwards off the platform. And both me and her dad were standing right there. We think this toy should have a step up to the platform. She didn't want to go back on the toy for fear of falling again. She also is tall and had a hard time understanding she had to duck her head to sit down for the slide. I think this toy still needs design work. I doubt a 4 year old would fit on this toy either. At any rate, we took it back the next day and bought the Little Tykes slide. Much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sized right for age group","review":"My son (14 months) couldn't get in the door without bumping his head. The platform for the slide is too tall for him to climb on and yet too short for him to crawl under. The holes to climb through are just right for him now and will soon be too small. The overall size is great for indoor play but poor for my son to play in! Sadly, I returned it the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now that we've owned the toy longer ......","review":"I love it even MORE! (We've had it now for well over a month) I wrote a previous review and wanted to add that after they fell off that 1 or 2 times .. that was it. They NEVER fall off it now. They are constantly on it. My son 16 mo and my gs has now turned 14 months. At 14 months he just learned to climb the outside \\"stepper wall\\" and up onto the platform through the porthole! I can't believe that, LOL My son isn't that adventurous yet. If you have a monkey climber on your hands don't hesitate to buy this product. I am happy he has an appropriate outlet for his climbing instead of the other things he manages to climb onto :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toy Lover from Burke,VA","review":"I bought this for my 1 yr old son and 3 yr old daughter for Christmas- they both love it and play with it often- we've thrown a blanket over the top and turned it into a Fort- my kids like to use the bench to sit on and play with other toys as well as they use it for a table for their pretend food from their kitchen set- we've had this toy 6 months now and I recommend this climber to all of my friends. It will last for many years to come-"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY ME","review":"This toy was horrible. We used it for about a month before taking it back and getting the climb and slide castle. The way that the floor is made, toddlers can fall off. My son fell three really good times and I got sick of sitting right next to him being all scared for him to fall. I would not recommend this to anyone. Stay very far away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the wrench","review":"My grandson, Liam, really enjoyed this toy. As with all climbers, gyms, etc. there is a possibility of getting hurt. What you need to watch out for is when they get on the platform to go down the slide. It is a very wide platform, but they can still fall. It would be best to put a cushion under it. The one we got must have been a return, because it did not have the instructions, nor the special wrench tool to tighten the pieces together. ... Quality Control is lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Know what you're getting","review":"This is a very sturdy toy and we had no problem putting it together. What you may not be able to tell from the pictures, though, is that there is literally no way for your child to access the slide other than by climbing over the sides of the toy. There are no stairs/ladder to the slide. The child has to climb over the sides and then stand on the platform. You just need to know that your child has to be old enough to do this, otherwise you'll have to pick him up and put him at the top of the slide over and over again. The slide itself is very fast, though short. The door is neat, and there are plenty of opportunities for climbing and crawling. It's an odd mix -- once your child is old enough to climb up to the slide, it may be too short and boring for him. Our 16 month old likes it, though we have to pick her up and put her on the slide."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Granddaughter Loves this Climber","review":"I purchased this climber for my 17 month old granddaughter to use in the house. The cube-shaped climber has been very popular with her. She likes to open and close the hinged door. She likes to climb back up the slide which is just the right height for her to slide down on her tummy. The platform inside which is used to access the slide is low enough that there is no danger of her flipping over the side when she stands on it. She uses the platform as her \\"house\\" for her favorite toys. The cutouts in the sides of the cube are great \\"windows\\" for watching her play and for her to see out. My daughter has placed the climber on a thick piece of carpet in case of any falls which by the way, have not occurred . Overall, I would say that this climber is sturdy, easy to clean, and well thought out for toddler use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Only Used For 3 Months","review":"My 21-month-old son did not get much use of it. We wanted an outdoor structure where he could play on and we didn't have to constantly stand guard so he wouldn't fall. We thought this was the ideal toy for him because of it's size, but we were wrong. My son has fallen down a few times from the small platform and has hit his head numerous times on the top of the plastic walls. The doorway arch is too low, as well the archway for the slide. The platform itself is too low, so children cannot really crawl underneath to play in it. After a few months of this toy outside all by it's lonesome, we decided to sell and it get something bigger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Toddlers","review":"I intended on purchasing the Woodland Climber which is larger then the Kangaroo climber, when I got to the store, they did not have the woodland in stock so I purchased this one for my 18 month old daughter who is VERY active. She loves to climb, run, etc. After the simple assembly, I thought that this would be too small for her to get much use out of, but she LOVES it.

When we saw the Kangaroo CLimber we had high hopes. They have been fulfilled. It is small enough to sit in the corner of his bedroom. He climbs and slides and goes through holes from dawn till dusk. Even our two cats can't get enough of it. He's only fallen once, when he was trying to stand in the half block on the yellow side, but landed on carpet, and was up again in a moment. It went together easy, and we have moved it up and down the stairs (taking it apart) more than once. THANK YOU STEP 2!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the active and agile toddler.","review":"My 22 month old loves the Kangaroo Climber. It's great indoors or out although I like it indoors for a rainy day. Best on a carpeted or grassy area, this mini gym provides an outlet for the active and agile toddler. Easy to put together, snaps right into place. super sturdy and easy to clean, if outside it can be hosed down. Keeps my toddler from climbing on the furniture and makes a great fort when you throw a blanket over it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fun for Little Ones","review":"Just bought this for my 13 month old. Easy to assemble, no tools required, just snaps together (took about 10 minutes). My daughter loves it! I agree with another reviewer, it seems to need another platform (step) to assist in climbing up to main platform (but, then again this toy is recommended for 1 1/2 years and up - and my daughter is 13 mos.). I would recommend this toy and it is also compact enough to use indoors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Go For the Hype","review":"If the alt.country genre is going this way - count me out. This CD is filled with cliched lyrics, over production, unexciting playing and overall comes across as bland schlock. Think late 70's Poco. I've seen Shurman written up as the next Son Volt - how anyone would make the comparison is beyond me.

Even the vocals from Keisha Shontelle dont mix with the 2 tracks she sings on. I dont know. Lyrically Buckshot is mediore. He doesnt seem any better or worst than he was years ago. Despite my negative review, this album is pretty good, if not only for the production."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare Classic","review":"This game was by far one of my favorite RPGs. The action in the game is quite fun. And even though the leveling system is completely linear it actually tends to make the game more fun. There's no one hit kill on the final boss because you spent 30 hours leveling your character up. The storyline, though basic, is fun and endearing. I played this game all the way through once on the dreamcast years ago, the game has stuck with me ever since.

Don't buy this book.Having removed from his system all that makes Aikido a unique, flowing, graceful and effective martial art, Bennett succeeds only in reducing Aikido to \\"McDojo\\" trash.Don't buy this book.If you want to learn Aikido, this certainly isn't the book for you. To those already studying Aikido, a warning: looking at the garbage shown in this book and practising it could seriously damage your credibility as a martial artist.Don't buy this book.If I could give it zero stars, I would.Don't buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal","review":"I know of this book and as an aikido instructor and practitioner, I can tell you that the techniques and movements demonstrated in this book are not original to the author. The names of the techniques used by the author are taken from a legitimate aikido style called Yoseikan Aikido. While the book says that the author has rank in the Yoseikan style, he is in no way associated with the Yoseikan organization and has never received any blackbelt ranking from the organization. I would be suspect of any claims made by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing is totally worthless, you can always be ...","review":"...a bad example. Read these reviews. The ones that are negative are that way for a reason. The photos in this book display poor form. In one, you can't tell which person is actually doing the technique, it could go either way. I, too, would give it negative stars if possible. I would almost put it in my collection if only to serve as a perfect example of what not to do. As for the positive reviews, I can only offer a few explanations,1) somebody paid them to do it2) the author trying to fool you3) someone who has no idea of what they are talking aboutI've only been in the art for 7 years and am only ranked shodan but it is clear how bad this is."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as a book can get","review":"If you even consider this book you are making a mistake. The techniques taught in this book are simply dumb and dangerous. You would be safer jumping in front of cars on the highway that to try most of this inefficient style of Aikido (made up by the author by the way).The author should be sued for misrepresenting Aikido. I gave it one star, because there was no ratings that gave zero stars...A very dumb and inefficient book... stay clear!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inept","review":"First let me qualify my opinion of this book by saying that I am a forth dan student of Saito Morihiro Sensei. Upon seeing this book I was disappointed that any publisher had touched it. It is yet another of those books, produced by someone of limited skill, doing little more than depleting the World's forests. The techniques illustrated are ineffectual and clumsy, as is the explaination of them. It tires me to say more than please do not reward the author's self promotion and pretention by giving him your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideous book. Not recommended.","review":"One of the _worst_ books on aikido I have ever seen. Books like this make aikido seem like a joke.The author \\"Grandmaster\\" Gary Bennet supposedly holds a \\"10th degree black belt,\\" one that I can say was _not_ commisioned by the International Aikido Federation in Japan -- most likely given to himself (or by some random person off the street) to inflate his otherwise apparent inexperience in the martial arts.The techniques shown in the book are shoddy, sloppy, ineffectual, and plainly wrong. The author, supposedly a grandmaster, only shows us how to lift weights and punch and block, leaving the bulk of the \\"aikido\\" techniques to his white belts (beginners) to demonstrate. Strange.I wouldn't recommend this book to _anyone_ who is interested in aikido, even if I were paid $10 per book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to class, do NOT read this book","review":"I concur w/ Alan Roberts of NZ. I looked over this volume in a bookstore. Although only 1st dan under Toyoda Sensei, I know enough to recognize poor quality, self-aggrandizement (10th dan, please) and a disservice to a wonderful, dynamic and compassionate art. If you want to learn aikido, go to a proper dojo, with a properly certified instructor and do it right, don't just read about it and feel you have learned the art. After all, mind AND body go together. If you simply must have a technical manual, \\"Aikido and the Dynamic Sphere\\" is a much, much better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, a very terrible book on aikido.","review":"The stiff, ineffectual techniques shown in this book, only faintly resemble aikido and miss the entire art of real aikido: fluidity.

This book is garbage, plain and simple. It isn't even good self defense.If you want a good intro to Aikido, I would recommend Shioda's Dynamic Aikido or Westbrook & Ratti's Aikido and the Dynamic Sphere.might not be such a waste of paper if it were in a format more easily hung in a bathroom to use as, well, you get the idea....If I could give a negative star rating I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you hate someone, give them this book!","review":"This is the worst book on Aikido I have seen to date. Most of the techniques are plain dumb and dangerous. They author is supposedly a 10th degree master (of his own style) yet looking at the techniques he shows, I must say that most 4th Kyus could better than him.The author also claims to be a 3rd degree black belt in Yoseikan Aikido. Oddly enough, nobody at the International Yoseikan Budo Federation has heard of him and he hasn't been seen at the Yoseikan dojo in Japan either.I bought this book as it showed (apparently) some Yoseikan Aikido techniques. I should have checked it out first, as this is a complete misconception of Yoseikan Aikido. This book is not Yoseikan Aikido or any other Aikido for that matter (other than BAD aikido). Plese don't judge Yoseikan Aikido on the basis of this book, it is entirely different! Tejitsu Aikido (this is what the author's style is called) is very dangerous, for the person using it!The Grand master is a fake."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible book that completely misrepresents aikido.","review":"The founder of aikido said, \\"The true secret of aikido is to cultivate a spirit of loving protection for all things.\\" This book shows none of this and is merely a manual for those who wish to learn how to break arms and apply painful locks. If it was a book on jiu-jitsu or some such art where these were the aims then it would be acceptable enough. It is, however, very unfortunate that the authors have sought to misrepresent this macho rubbish as aikido."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's all wrong!","review":"This book \\"which deals strictly with situations where footwork and large sweeping movements are impossible.\\" also makes aikido impossible.

Better yet go to a dojo and have some fun learning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it possible?","review":"This is simply the worst book I have ever seen, about aikido.

If you practiced the techniques in this book, you would injure your friends or get throw in jail. Page 115 shows a guy smashing his fist on another's extended elbow to break the arm. That's the opposite of Aikido. How would you even practice that? Aikido is awesome, but this is the worst book on martial arts I have seen in a long time. The only authentic Aikido is the cover picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"i'm the grand master of this style i just made up.","review":"wow! i quickly became suspicious, and then thought this looks terrible. \\"no, no,\\" i told myself, \\"don't be too quick to judge.\\" then i turned to the -about the author- page where i learned that the author is a 10th degree black belt and grand master in the style he founded in 1989. he looks to be about 35 years old. if you know anything about martial arts nothing else needs to be said"},{"rating":"2","title":"definately worthwhile","review":"this book has a major strong point in that it is really self defense oriented, so it discusses many ways in which aikido techniques can be modified to make them more brutal and effective. I'd definately recommend this book, not as a way to learn aikido, but as a way to help see how to apply aikido in a real fight."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH BUYING.","review":"I FIRST HEARD FROM OTHER AIKIDOKA ABOUT THIS BOOK.

After reading the so-called grand-master book, I practiced the techniques on my friend. They seemed to work(on him). Later that week at a concert, a few loud mouth drunks started harassing my wife. Having the confidence to physicaly stop them, I atempted a simple wrist-lock. I was stiffed by the larger assilant and thrown to the groud. Soon I was pounded upon by him and his buddies while my wife ran for security. Needless to say I spent the rest of the concert in the back of an ambulence.

Trotsky outlines the economic and military basis of U.S. dominance and the deceitful stratagems it was able to employ in the early years of its world role-and still does.

Completely oversaturated to the point where much detail is lost. It is so bright that it is distracting. Yes, the Grinch is green - an unpleasant, over-the-top shade of green. They have also tried to justify the \\"50th Birthday Deluxe\\" title by creating some weird panning effects that are not on the original version. I was so distracted by the color and 'effects' that I found myself cringing rather than smiling nostalgically. I would not recommend this for those of us who grew up loving the original TV version. Cleaned up of dust etc. is one thing, but a reinterpretation is another. That is what you are buying here. A kindler, gentler, less heavy-handed approach to remastering is what I was expecting and sadly did not get. Now I have to find a different version. This one is going in the dustbin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete","review":"They cut out portions of the songs! I bought the DVD when my VHS tape wore out, and I'm very disappointed. The tampering was done with surgical precision, so anyone unfamiliar with the original wouldn't know the difference.

I'm fixing my VCR so I can watch the VHS version I just bought to replace the DVD. I sure hope it's intact!!This review is for the Deluxe Edition of this DVD, UPC #883929042258.

The set has been a durable one for me. I have used it extensively to maintain two trucks, a car, a van, a motorcycle, lawn mowers, and an entire household. For me, the lifetime warranty, and the price of this set made it money very well spent. One of the tabs on the case has failed after years of use.

It wasn't as good as the show, but still kept my attention and during the day when i wasn't reading the book i kept wondering what was to happen next just like watching episode to episode on the series. I dont knw if i read it to fast or what, but it could've been longer, all in all it was very action packed and it was cool to have some of the characters that you see on TV come back int he book. You'll notice some of the characters are dead but since this book goes back to before the first season of \\"24\\" obviously they are alive, its kind of weird but cool.

In the Op. 118, for example, Backhaus may segue from piece to piece, lending an organic quality to the set as a whole that many other readings lack. The contemplative stillness that performers such as Lupu and Gould found in these works are for the most part missing, however at times (in the Op.117, #1, for example) Backhaus reveals extraordinary beauty in turns of phrase that stand out in their sensitivity and gentleness. For those who want only one recording of these works, this may not be it, but for those who already love the music on this recording and are thirsty for a fresh and singular interpretation of this magical music, this comes very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best biogarphies of Kutuzov","review":"Although Parkinson wrote this book in a very young age back in 1976, he presented the real General Michail Illarionovich Kutuzov overturning many myths that were built about him.

In a similar vein, I question whether Samuel Adams believed, as the story indicates, that the \\"brains\\" of the revolution were too valuable to serve as \\"soldiers\\" of the revolution.

Looking around online I see a lot of people complaining of the exact same problem... touch the wand extension while the vacuum is running and it shorts out requiring warranty service. This is a major flaw and inconvenience for a $300 vacuum. Do not buy unless you want to be constantly dropping it off and picking it up for service.

Big mistake. Within the first couple of weeks, it only worked when it felt like it. After 3 trips to the Electrolux warranty center (45 minutes away), *I* finally figured out that it was a connection issue where the hose meets the canister and where the powerhead attaches to the hose. Yes, both places. The warranty center told me nothing was wrong because it worked for them perfectly on cue. I contacted Electrolux and demanded that they send me to a new powerhead and hose. Then it worked well for a few months. Now the connection issues are starting again, and the retractable cord no longer works. I'm ready to throw it in the garbage.

We had to empty it several times going over the same area as the Dyson.The machine is a pleasure to use. It is as advertised - not like the old Dyson which was so poorly designed you almost can't use the wand. The engineers at Dyson took the day off when the wand was designed! And for the high cost of the Dyson - no head light - guess they did not want us to see how badly it was doing cleaning the carpet.I highly recommend the Electrolux for it's ability to Clean, manuver, use the wand with accesories."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't see the differrence with a new!

I called the authorized service center here in Dallas, where Electrolux is located, and they told me this is common with this machine and cannot be repaired. So that cordless is now useless to us. Today I removed the dust bin on the canister to empty it and when I tried to put it back on, a small plastic clip broke under almost negligible force and now that part will leak air and thus reduce vacuum.

Until about six months ago when it began shutting off when the carpet attachment was on. Then it would work if I kept the button pressed, then it would work on its own. Then it wouldn't. Now it shuts off even when I'm just using the wand. There are other reviews that say if you leave it plugged in overnight, which I very well may have done, it shorts out. Really?

The cushy grip had a weird sticky film all over it that did come off - thankfully! Since the ink didn't work for very long I haven't had much of a chance to use the pen for any length of time, but it was enough to feel that the pen is a little heavy on the clip end. Not very well balanced in the hand. I'd just return the pen if I felt like making a trip to the Post Office and spending more money on postage. I have some extra Parker refills that will work in this pen, so I might as well keep it.

I may not agree with the conservative view they offer, but I think this study Bible is a valuable resource and a good place to start discussions. It offers monthly calendars (not year-specific) which encourage readers to have an active faith life including worship, praying for persons of influence, visiting the sick and elderly, writing letters, and volunteering with poverty-relief agencies.I hope they come out with a similar resource for teen guys. I applaud this production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well thought up!","review":"I first saw not Revolve, but Refuel, the New Testament for Guys when my good friend got it.

It is very encouraging, and good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revolve * * * around what?","review":"This so called Bible in magazine format is full of inaccurate wording. Even false teaching. This is a shameful attempt of turning Gods word into other meanings. Not totally rewrote but full of areas with wrongful meanings. I strongly recommend not buying this.

Though I cannot speak for my classmates I agree 100% with the review posted by Jan Chapman.This \\"Bible,\\" though it appears to be updating the New Testament and presenting it in an appealing fashion for young women, I belive, in actuallity that it will prove to do more harm than good. Through out there are quotes and quizes and top ten lists that if taken seriously will send young women back into a previous life. Young women can do anything they set their minds on and don't need the help of a man unlike the opinions of the aformentioned side bars.There are very few people of color and all of the young women are stick thin. What message is this sending especially to pre-teen girls?This \\"Bible\\" needs to be used with EXTREME caution, if used at all.

So now the kids have something they like to read and are still reading the word and are happy about it. I love it and can't wait to see how the boys react."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange and Disturbing","review":"I went through this book from front to back and I am amazed that this is seriously being sold at major bookstores in this country. It is in my opinion the equivelent of the Taliban for the Christian religion for teens. I found it to be sexist and demeaning to women. Girls are being advised to be quiet, cover up, that they are sinners with sinful thoughts. The boys version does not seem to have the same harsh moral standards and judgement, merely requesting them to act like gentlemen. This is supposedly the new testiment, yet it has 2 versions, telling 2 different stories, the male version and the female version. I think you can find \\"gods\\" version in the religious studies section within the bible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be not deceived","review":"If you want to know what the Bible says, read it for yourself.

It is supposed to be the \\"complete new testament\\". Says so right on the cover. So...If a Bible is so closely mimicking the very magazines that help contribute to the self-esteem issues of young woman, should it be endorsed?

Any Bible (even the revered KJV) with study notes included, presents a particular publisher's point of view. Parents should read Revolve with their daughters to balance those views. I am a student of reformed feminist theology and will simply discuss with my daughters the points of the sidebars with which I have a difference of opinion. The young girls I shared this magazine with (ages 14-16)received it with great interest - and they sat down to READ IT! How often does that happen?

This book, however, can apparently do nothing but serious mental harm, and the fact that it is being marketed to clueless girls is utterly repulsive. This is much more like the Devil's bible then anything else. Why would God create girls in the first place if he was just going to control them with this mindless filth? This book is the type of thing that simply lowers your intelligence just to look at. Girls should be thinking for themselves, not doing what God apparently tells them to do. I will tell you though, if God exists he surely wouldn't want his creations reading this garbage...in fact I wouldn't go around recommending this book to anyone, for that seems like a sure ticket to Hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please take religion seriously","review":"This book simply cheapens religion and brings it to the level of another \\"how to\\" book aimed at insecure young women.

There are many articles and advice columns throughout the book that stress the importance of being a modest young woman, such as dressing conservatively and not calling boys (which I don't really agree with). But the models on the pages of the book are not dressed conservatively at all. Some are in spaghetti strap tanks, halters, and there is even a pic of a girl laying in a guys lap, which is clearly a contradiction of the advice given throughout the book. If I was affected by the pics (and I'm 21) think of how they might affect a 12-16 year old girl who's not yet fully comfortable with her own style?

That is, unless you are reading Revolve. It's sad this sort of stuff is even sold in Christian bookstores, let alone endorsed by the Christian media.Things like this destroy young girls. It's more destructive, I would venture, than even YM or Teen People.

I think this toy is well made and very lovable.

Of all the songs on this album, this song stands out as a song I can listen to again and again. The message is beautiful and expresses a writer's true desires.\\"Live your life with arms wide open...\\"~The Rebecca Review"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Cd!","review":"I didnt expect too much from Natasha at first, but when i bought this cd and listened to all the songs, i was so amazed!

That's great, except I don't think the rest of the cd matches the fun, catchy mood of \\"These Words (I Love, I Love You).\\" I found the lyrics trying too hard to be trendy or catchy.

I hope that she grows in her writing because she does have some strong vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Album","review":"I love the song \\"These Words\\" and was looking forward to this album release. I also love the album put out by Natasha's brother, Daniel. Unfortunately, this album turned out to be a big disappointment. \\"These Words\\" is the only song on this album to stand out or really maintain my interest. The writing on the songs is unimpressive and many of them sound alike. Perhaps it's unfair to compare this album to her brother's, but it lacks the creativity of Daniel's and is bland in comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh, Terrible, She Ripped Off West Indian Music","review":"I have nothing more to say, her song \\"These Words\\", among others, are clearly ripped off from West Indians who live in England, and her talent is horrible.

So after reading a great nod in Entertainment weekly I decided to purchase it. I ended up sending it to her. I felt the CD moved into such a hyped hip hop mess that it lost what was enjoyable as it began; the artist seemed to be trying to race into this hip hop melange of a mess of music which didn't suit her obvious talents. For GREAT pop music try the import \\"TALLER ON MORE WAYS\\" by \\"THE SUGABABES\\".

After his first song Can't Let Go, you feel \\"eh, alright this guy's got some potential.\\" But, after \\"Last Stop\\", you start to feel that something's missing. That's what takes place over the rest of the album. He's a 3 trick pony. Open the mind of any young twenties single guy, give him a flair for John Mayer and a falsetto emulating Fran Healy of Travis and you end up with Landon Pigg. The musical ideas are there, but he lacks the soul of the artist. It's quite evident in the song writing. After those first two listenable tracks, I found myself skipping after 30 seconds of each song. Tinman's the only exception. That's a well written song, but he also doesn't even write his songs. He gets help from pop industry wizards. Do yourself a favor and pick up Travis's Boy with no Name or Death Cab for Cutie's Plans. Those are two albums with a similar vernacular but are far superior efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new musician!","review":"I thought Landon sounded like a young John Lennon too! and told him so at a recent show. Its just something about how his voice moves! I met Landon and his bass player, and they are both so sweet! I am a middle-aged grandmother, but I have found a new favorite, and so has my daughter! And I agree, that you will not be disappointed with this music; just really down to earth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure, pleasing pop.","review":"I really enjoy this album. Landon has a wonderful voice and is a very good songwriter. His songs are quirky and sweet without being weird.

Latouche was an extremely important figure in the theatre, not just because of his accomplishments, but also because of the influence he exerted on the artistic demi-monde of New York at the time.The cast is superb, and there is a wealth of fascinating material here. Erik Haagensen, who put the show together, is especially to be commended for giving us an opportunity to rediscover an interesting, and at times bedeviling figure in the history of musical theatre.If for nothing else, get this CD for the performance of LAZY AFTERNOON, which both in the theatre, and on the record is startling."},{"rating":"2","title":"know how to use it","review":"Recently, we had a power outage here in Seattle. At the sametime our ground was completely saturated with water. These conditions pose a big problem for us because our furnace is located in the crawl space.

I have two sump pumps because I have experienced needing more than one to keep from being flooded.My remedy was to use the Coleman Power Inverter 1200 to run one sump pump and alternate that with the furnace to keep the house warm. Yes, there is a bit a technical reading to set it up. If you don't understand the the technical reasons for a secure connection to the battery, you may be in over your head.

And coleman's web site offers no information whatsover, and their customer service is open from a convenient (for them) nine to five. bah humbug.

My husband and I (we have no kids) had talked for years about \\"foregoing\\" Christmas...but never did because we knew our parents and siblings would protest too much. So, the book was an appealing story to us since it expressed our own thoughts and feelings about Christmas. As soon as the movie was out, we rushed to see it. Granted, it's no \\"Christmas Vacation\\" with Chevy Chase (but no movie is or ever will be); yet this movie is quite hysterical and entertaining. It truly brought the book to life, giving the characters dimension and bringing the Christmas spirit into full view. Without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it, the movie does leave you thinking about what you believe Christmas should be in your own life. I (we) highly recommend buying this movie and making it a 'regular' part of your holiday season year after year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I thought this movie was so bad it prompted me to write my first amazon review. I was very disappointed. I love Tim Allen, and I love Christmas, and I wanted to like this movie but I couldn't. It was dull. It felt as though it had been cut and pasted together. Each scene lacked substance. The characters remained throughout cardboard figures. And Tim allen and Jamie Lee Curtis seemed to be reading their lines. I have to admit I didn't think the book was that great either but I thought (hoped) the movie would be better. It was worse.

The movie begin with Jamie Lee Curtis and Tim Allen taking their daughter who has just joined the Peach Corps to the airport. Since she won't be home with them at Xmas, they decide to go on a cruise. They tell everyone in the town (which seemed silly, why does everyone need to know?) and all the people they tell get mad!! The neighbors threaten them if they don't put up decorations, their friends pout because there will be no party and they are solicited over and over again to give moeny. I didn't see what the big deal was. So they were going on a cruise, who cares? It just didn't seem realistic.

You'll get more enjoyment from this movie, just by seeing the snow scenes and Xmas lights and decorations, etc...but then you don't really need a movie for that, ay? Suffice it to say, a few minutes into this movie, and you realize how God awful this is, from Jamie Lee Curtis dreadful overacting to the complete farce of an idea that your neighbors are gonna stiff arm you into celebrating Christmas!

Although I haven't felt that extreme about Christmas yet, I do feel that about some holidays and can relate to many of the humorous aspects of their need to avoid it altogether (if only for one year). Of course, everyone comes together at the end to celebrate Christmas as a family and to extend a generous gift to a needy neighbor to give you that warm and fuzzy feeling.It was a nice suprise to see the some chemistry between Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis that reminded me of my own parents and how they handle situations. Looking forward to watching it again this year.

The last 20 minutes or so were acceptable, including the Christmas wonderland of the street, snow, houses with lights, etc...outside of that visual effect, definitely lacking.

And, while I can usually stand him pretty well, and I usually like her -- they just did not work in this movie. Her acting is especially poor. While I'd say that is the film's first flaw -- it is only one of many. The movie is just not good. I love movies. It's very rare that I will say this about a movie -- but I hated it.

I can understand Tim Allen thinking this was a good script, the producer probably mailed the script to him as a coloring book with pictures...but I had higher expectations from Jamie Lee Curtis. I have to say I usually love her. But she was awful in this film. She is reduced to whining and crying. She does little else besides agreeing to everything her caveman husband tells her.

You laugh when you are supposed to laugh and you go 'awwwwww' when you are supposed to right? This is the perfect profit oriented film - it aims to please and forgets about actual plot.

In watching this, I realized only one thing: Jamie Lee Curtis is getting old. She has gray hair. When did this happen?! This is a great example of a movie straining too hard to be funny. I felt like the Botox scene dragged on too long, and it was in the trailer so if you've seen the trailer you've seen basically that whole scene. Just don't waste your time or money, it's not worth it at all! If you're looking for a good Christmas movie for your family, try A Christmas Carol, A Christmas Story, (catch it anytime of the day you like Christmas day) or It's a Wonderful Life.

Thanks!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Story Line Sinks Movie","review":"There are some funny moments in the movie, like when Mrs. Krank chases her holiday ham across the parking lot, or when Tim Allen's ill advised botox treatment affects his eating ability.But this film is sunk by a silly premise. The point of the movie is that the Krank's want to skip Christmas completely when they learn that their daughter will not be home for the holiday (they also want to save money and take a cruise). The neighbors rebel because the Kranks always have the best Christmas party and they are the only ones on the street who have not properly decorated their home in line with the way the others have.But this is stupid and unrealistic. Who has the right to complain and kvetch over how a person does or does not want to celebrate a holiday? Who cares, anyway?

We usually just wait for it to come out on DVD to see a repeat.Go and see this one...you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A frenzy of tragically bad slapstick","review":"This film pretends to be all about the warm glow of love for humanity we're all supposed to feel over the holidays, but ends up reaffirming that the trappings and superficialities of the holiday season are what really matter. Apparently the makers of this film were not aware that bullying people into conforming to neighborhood standards of Christmas celebration does not represent goodwill to all. A few of the situations might have presented good comic opportunities in more careful hands, but this film ends up feeling superficial and forced throughout, with a completely patronizing \\"moral\\" at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NO \\"CHRISTMAS VACATION\\"","review":"I rented this movie because with my wife we like to watch Christmas-themed movies during the holidays.

Tim and Jamie where at their annoying best. So where Dan and the rest of the neighbors. I just wanted to smack them around. Very irritating. The only good thing about this movie is the last 30 or so minutes, with the Christmas spirit that involves everybody, including the obnoxious Tim and an old lady with cancer. Isn't that sweet?

I was really excited when I heard they were making it into a movie. All I can say is, I hope somebody from the movie apologized to John Grisham. Other than the fact that in both the movie and the book, the couple decided to skip Christmas until they found out their daughter was coming home after all, there was nothing in common. The personalities of the couple in the book were completely different than the zany (translate: painfully tiresome and completely obnoxious) Kranks in the movie. READ THE BOOK!

Then he too becomes a miserable person...Finally once the Kranks decide to conform and hold Christmas after all, the neighbors are helpful and sweet!

Tim Allen is always enjoyable, and he always puts out a feel good movie. Although Allen was excellent, and this movie did make me feel good, Allen could not cover for all the characters, including Dan Akyroyd, Jamie Lee Curtis and Jake Busey. Beside's Cheech Marin, there were NO other funny or good characters. The somewhat creepy music just got irritating, and all of the funny parts were in the commercial. Just because a movie delves in a few gut chuckles, that doesn't mean it's funny. This is a disgraceful, barely passable Christmas comedy, that just didn't do it for me. Do me a favor, get some popcorn, go to your local video store, And just rent Elf, with Will Ferrell. NOW THAT IS A CHRISTMAS MOVIE!

As someone who already knew about life in the Army when I bought it, I was braindead after a couple chapters. The author makes no attempts at interesting-ness and there is not the slightest bit of humor. BORING. You could get this info from any recruiter.

This is not a good book for someone trying to learn this on their own. The right hand techniques of flamenco are syncopated and require the right form from day one.Only if someone has the correct technique can they ever dream of achieving the speed needed to play a flamenco soleas.Flamenco guitar is the most demanding of all acoustic guitar techniques for the right hand, I would recommend Juan Martin or Herrera's videos to learn flamenco. You need to see the techniques to really understand how to execute them"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed to find that this book doesn't include any significant instruction or commentry from the author.

At the time I was impressed. As I look back on the experience now, however, I feel emotionally manipulated. Must everything be as melodramatic as a Hollywood movie?The relation of his climactic moment with the snuff film reminds me of a bow on a neatly-wrapped package. Too convenient, in my opinion. The implication that watching children murdered is the ultimate extension of an interest in Nationalism is ridiculous.He just chose to pursue the most twisted people he could find, without giving any objective information on the vast majority of moderate Nationalists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing For Serious Readers","review":"This is not a serious expose of the Neo-Nazi movement in Germany, it's simply a play by play of Savoray's adventures within the movement, and it doesn't even do that very well.It's easy reading, I'll give it that, in fact it reads like a dime store spy novel. Nothing wrong with that, I suppose, and maybe it's even based on real events, although the word for word exchanges stretch credibility pretty far.

While a gullible world gawped with credulity, professional magicians snickered behind their hands at his lies-- and Randi wrote this book, explaining all his \\"miraculous\\" feats in simple, no-nonsense terms.

It is very user friendly and easy to understand. The quality of pictures that this thing produces are just great.

Me, I just snap pictures of my 2 year old son outdoors in the day and in the house under regular and dim lighting conditions and the pictures are always about 90% acceptable.

As far as I can tell so far (I have had the camera just over a month) the only draw back is that it does not come with a rechargeable battery pack.

I bought this camera to replace a Canon S500 because it focused too slowly.The A700 focuses and shoots quickly- but only if you are NOT using the flash. If you use the flash you have to wait a very long time between shots- and that's with brand new batteries. It was unbelievably slow- slower than the camera I bought it to replace.I ended up returning the A700 and buying an A620. The A620 is slightly larger than the A700, has a smaller viewing screen, and has less zoom. Other than that it's a better camera. I don't mind the slightly larger size and smaller screen- the only thing I miss is the longer zoom. Even so- the A620 has a 4X zoom (equivalent of a 35-140mm lense on an slr)and that's not bad for a camera that will fit in your pocket"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want something that's unreliable","review":"Camera has been nothing but problems. I've owned it about 3 months. It was sent to Canon for about 2-3 weeks over a month ago and it's going back tomorrow. Same problem. The problem is the LCD does not always come on when you turn the camera on. When that happens you can't take a picture (you'll get a blank picture). Problem doesn't happen all the time, very annoying. Canon repaired it once and I'm getting the same problem. They offer no recourse other than to repair again at their service center in the midwest (free shipping this time, big deal!!). Camera is turning out to be an annoying piece of junk that their own service department can't repair. Camera, service, and warranty all very poor.

At one point in the book, she states that rabies is an illusion. ! When she does finally get to the pharmaceutical - health insurance power coalition, she starts to really explain the title of her book. However, she doesn't quite cover it in depth. The second half of the book is the best part, maybe the only part worth reading. Yes, she is right when she states that doctors practice defensive medicine.

Having seen Martin be consistently astonishing in one live show after another, I was really looking forward to the new live CD. The reality turned out to be a real disappointment -- totally missing Martin's intensity, his wild-man stage energy, and not really doing justice to his awe-inspiring voice. I found the whole set rather flat and dull, and it most definitely feels padded -- the second double CD of the year (after Michelle Shocked's latest) that should have been a single disc. Martin is fantastic, but if you want a glimpse of his true genius and you can't catch a live show, check out BLACK SHEEP or WONDER BAR instead of this pale substitute.

It reflects some of the \\"air power won the war!\\" attitude of the immediate post-war decades, but it is also fairly balanced and despite being funded by the Air Force it does not disregard the Navy. It suffers, as all air power documentaries seem to, from some historically inaccurate editing (e.g., VIII Bomber Command Liberators seemingly bombing Rabaul), but much of the footage is true to the locations and/or events that are being described, making it a must-have for the WWII or Aviation enthusiast. This is predominantly a history of US air power, but footage includes aircraft from all the major combatants, including some great German and Japanese clips (most likely taken from wartime propaganda reels). Don't let the age of these episodes delude you...in my opinion a finer series has yet to be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Scene","review":"With great excitement I sat down to view this DVD, one of my all-time favorite documentaries.

The beautiful footage of two flights of Thunderbolts, criss-crossing above the Arch de Triomphe was missing! These documentaries are works of art. You can't cut the last scene of one anymore than you could with Gone With The Wind. What were these guys thinking? I'm returning my set.

It would have been nice to have known prior to ordering that the product is not a DVD release of even a portion of the complete episodes of the television series, but rather a set of very heavily edited episodes with a dubious (though unknown) set of editing criteria. On the bright side, however, the transfer of the episode fragments to DVD technology was done quite well and the picture quality was better than I had expected it could be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Series butchered","review":"The other reviewers are, unfortunately, correct - some of the most dramatic parts are cut or misplaced. For me, in particular, is the final portion of the Ploesti segment. If my fading memory serves me, the original ended with an ominous comment by Cronkite that now (rather than using and losing so many crew, planes and bombs) \\"one plane , one pilot and one bomb\\" would do the job and eliminate the target.

In fact, I had my own home movie theatre where I showed 16mm films in a 15 seat setting. I owned original prints of Victory at Sea, Battle Line, Biography (with a young Mike Wallace narrating), World at War and others. However, I found it very difficult to find one of my favorite series aired in 1956, AIR POWER. What I remembered the most was the beautiful opening and the music by the CBS Orchestra. I love seeing the complete film of any series, including opening and closings and the related credits. Unfortunately, the edited films available now (either on tape or DVD) have rearranged the original series and only at the beginning of each tape or DVD does it show the opening shots of the planes and the original theme music. That is what I miss, but otherwise, it was one of the finest docs ever produced on the WW2 planes and their effect on the outcome of the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding DVD","review":"With this series and a copy of Victory at Sea you will have every foot of 16mm film of WWII aviation that you could ever possibly want.Also, the bonus video on the P-47, P51, B-17, B-24 and RAF and Luftwaffe is tremendous. A wonderful compilation of WWII Aviation History."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, listless models","review":"Graphic novels, like comics, have to stand on the three legs of story, writing, and art. If any leg fails, the book fails. I found the story to be great and the writing to be above average. I found the photography to be lacking, though. It is not for a lack of technique, as one look at the cover image demonstrates (it is actually what drew me to the book--stunning). What bothered me about many of the pictures is the posing of the models. The models come off, well, posed. So much so that they look like mannequins when they should be expressing movement or emotion. Whether this is the fault of the models or the photographer I can't say but the responsibility ultimately lies with the photographer.

On the bright side the fax and copy is simple, but that's about it. I suggest you spend more money on a better model or try a brand like HP or Epson.

It is nearly impossible to read the panel display unless either you or the MFC-210C are situated at an unusual angle (and I am NOT exaggerating), the fax machine AND the scanner are ridiculously complicated to use and instead of having an easily accessible owner's manual, you're stuck with the cheaper to distribute CD. And when you do access the owner's manual/user's guide it's so darn complicated and hard to understand that you'll wish you'd bought a book on pathology instead.

The ink sensing capability often indicated a cartridge was empty when it was not but then would not accept anything but a new cartridge (nice for Brother cartridge sales). The paper feed was less than consistent. I am a one person business with moderate to low printing requirements and this machine created more chaos than efficiency. My HP all in one is on order. It cost about 2.5 times what this machine does but I know I will get what I paid for. Would love to give this machine (and several cartridges) back to Brother but they do not seem interested. Not sure I could even give this thing to an enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this printer","review":"Don't buy this printer unless you want to spend all your money buying ink.

Print quality is not the best, so don't plan on using this for photos, etc. According to Consumer Reports, this is on the higher end for cost per page, that is, the $ for cartridges. On the plus side, this is small. I like my desk space, and both the output and input printer trays are contained inside the printer. I've had zero problems with the scanner, and the 5-in-1 card reader is great. A LOT in a compact package.

I was happy with it but now I just want to throw it out the window but I believe in recycling. I think I'll just stick to the Partner Stores at rieseninternationdotcom.

Thus, run out of one color cartridge and you can no longer print black and white text documents. Very annoying, very expensive. I will do all I can to avoid every buying another Brother printer.

The characters are bland (as we have come to expect from Gibson), but in his previous work, this was offset by a wealth of action and background information on the world. In All Tomorrow's Parties, the action is lackluster, and the only extra information about the world (which was fleshed out better in Virtual Light and Idoru, the previous books in the \\"series\\") are Gibson's insights in the colors of computer-cases, and his passion for old watches. In some passages, his prose is snappy as before, but overall, this book lacks any taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gibson still has what it takes","review":"Brilliant characterization (the person who said Gibson's characters are 'bland' is out of his mind), writing that is excellent without being showy, a future that is both weird and believable, and a plot with plenty of action, characterize this book. In my opinion ATP returns to the humor and excitement of Virtual Light, and is notably better than Idoru. The book's major flaw is that the impending \\"end of the world\\" is never clearly described, and seems to fizzle at the end -- on some level, the plot lacks seriousness. Still, I enjoyed it tremendously."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book doesn't have a lame ending...","review":"...or a flacid plot. This one drives all the way through purposefully while politely handling repeated encounters with old characters like a dream party. The plot gives us the author's message or hope for technology's application to our lives in the coming era despite the intentions of the puppet masters behind it all. Characters, infinitely deep by science fiction standards, are thin, but his snippets of language and snapshots of culture are really enjoyable, as good as ever. And then there's the filter of civilization's products through the lens of a marketing VP or economist, Italian this, Russian that; it annoys me like a commercial does; I feel I haven't discovered yet why he does this, what he's trying to achieve. It's cheap stereotype. It gets in the way of life there in his books.

However, the new book, while not terrible, is really devoid of anything exciting and the characters aren't developed any further than they already were. In particular, Laney's representation in the book is extremely one-dimensional and meaningless. The others aren't a lot better either.All in all, when I finished ATP, I couldn't shake the impression that this book was written to fulfill contractual obligations that Gibson had to the publisher. At least I'd like to hope so, because the alternative is that his originality is beginning to dry up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gibson must have owed someone a quick book...","review":"I read Virtual Light and loved it. I have read All Tomorrow's Parties and did not.

A fully imagined world, completely credibly in texture, even if some of the technological leaps were hard to swallow.The ending, while seemingly ambiguous, is satisfying because you have a sense of the change ahead.

A great vacation read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well paced and energetic, another coup for Gibson","review":"To describe William Gibson's writing style in one word, it would probably be \\"energetic.\\" Using a sharp staccato like pen, Gibson manages to construct unique and interesting scenarios. This book has all the characteristic Gibsonian qualities: distributed plot progression, characters covering both ends of the scale from cold and detached to drug crazed frenzy... it also manages to pull in a large number of characters from previous works (Virtual Light, Idoru).. Gibson's last trilogy (the Sprawl) was unique in that one never realized it was that much of a trilogy till the very end...One annoying fact of this book is that it has a classic Gibson ending.. without giving anything away let's just say it required many readings of the ending before one felt satisfied. It seems the information density per sentence increases exponentially as one reaches the last few pages.Still, the book is interesting and well worth the read.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read.","review":"As always Gibson does not disappoint.

The pace was fast (but not too fast), and the characters were all pretty solid. However, the plot was somewhat thin. When i finished the book, i had a sense that i hadn't really gained anything from reading it. It wasn't wasted time, but the book didn't have the 'oomph' that i expect of Gibson at this point. A lot of stuff happened, but it didn't seem quite important, really. Most Gibson novels are so intense you can't put the book down until you finish it, but i can't say that about this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing retread of old Gibson ideas","review":"All Tomorrow's Parties reads like a poor amalgam of Virtual Light and Idoru. Several scenes of Parties mirror similar scenes from Gibson's previous work, and it's possible to imagine Gibson sitting down with discarded notes from Virtual Light and Idoru to crank out Parties. Worse yet, Gibson seems bored with the characters he reprises. It shows in his inability to have them do anything interesting other than act confused and make references back to the better books in which they first appeared. While the confusion of his characters worked in other novels, here it merely highlights the lack of cohesiveness in characterization, plot, theme, and even tone. Nothing is very smooth in Parties, and I must wonder if Gibson's finally out of magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than you ever wanted to know about wristwatches","review":"I desperately wanted to like William Gibson's All Tomorrow's Parties, but I just couldn't enjoy it even a little. Once upon a time, Gibson's tales of net-running were surreal glimpses into the fertile imagination of a master computer geek. With this book, we get a look into the imagination of a wristwatch fanatic.The book is loosely about the end of the world. Unfortunately, this world ends not with a bang but a fizzle of river water on burning bridges. At times, Gibson tries to add a bit of comic relief to lighten the tedium, but the jokes tend to flop like a half-dead trout.If you're looking for interesting technologically-based fiction, try something by Neal Stephenson."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Tomorrow's Parties","review":"As a new reader to Gibson's work, I found \\"All tomorrow's parties\\" to be quite intriguing. It portrays possible future developements in a soceity that is constantly changing due to advances in technology. Having to read this as a school assignment for my AP Literature class, I deeply enjoyed this book. Gibson is vivid in his visceral detail and coherent in his plot. This novel explores all the possibilites that we as United States citizens face everyday in a technologically dominated world. The only two downsides to this novel was its complexity to readers who haven't read any of his work, and that soon this novel may become a reality and be left in the past and be surpased by other advances. Overall this novel was great and I would encourage anyone to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book of the late '90s","review":"William Gibson has proven himself to be a master of style over substance, but in this book he seems to have run out of even that. Majority of the characters are brought in from Idoru, poorly, he adds nothing that hasn't been seen in other cyberpunk books, even that he himself hasn't already written. There are less ideas in this whole book than in two pages of Stephenson's Diamond Age. The action, what little there is of it, is frazzled, has no rhyme let alone reason, and comes to no conclusion grand or otherwise.This the worst book I have read in many years. I can only hope that Gibson put out this piece of drivel as a conscious way to make a quick buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Party","review":"I was disappointed in Tomorrow's Parties. Very little happened. Most of the characters, endearing as they are, are recycled from previous stories. Some new ones -- Silencio, Bomzilla, anonymous killer -- were excellent. Some of the actions seemed pointless: why was the bridge burned? Is Gibson as burned out as some of his characters? His futuristic hardware and software seems little beyond today's realities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure to heed the demands of an intricate protocol","review":"As a Gibson fanatic, I was dissapointed. All his other books have satisfied, but this one lacked story and resolution of what little confusing story line there was. Sorry guys and gals, poetry is for poets. Novelists should know better that the story comes first. Gibson has failed to heed the demands of an intricate protocol (a nice, poetic line from his first novel), namely thatthe story comes first. This novel seems unfinished to me. In reading all these reviews however, I was very happy to learn about Neal Stephenson. Went out, bought \\"Snow Crash,\\" and was instantly hooked. Dissapointed fans, treat yourself to someone new who can really write!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of Gibson's books","review":"I'm a big Gibson fan. I even liked Mona Lisa Overdrive.

No action, no point, no resolution. The wrong bridge on the cover. Blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad book.","review":"I can only assume that all the good reviews here were writen by Gibson's family and friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yesterday's FanFic","review":"I'm a big fan of Gibson from Burning Chrome forward. But this one was dreck. Gibson explains it clearly enough in a note at the end of the book when he attributes the book (or a chapter--it's not clear) to fans in Mexico City. The story has the feeling of fan fiction--take the parts from previous works and mix them together. The story is flat; the characters are flat; the novel reads like a story proposal for the publisher. sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating and dense--and not in the good way","review":"I found this book to be incredibly frustrating to read and ultimately unsatisfying. Gibson's writing style, hallmarked by inserting long paragraphs in the middle of a character's spoken dialogue, kept me from connecting to the characters. The plot, such as it is, is so thin and pointless that the book would be a pamphlet but for the long descriptions about the mundanity of Gibson's futuristic world.As a fan of science fiction, and particularly this genre of books, I cannot recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The One Gibson Book to Skip","review":"As a true Gibson fan I was disappointed. The author feels compelled to introduce most characters from previous (good) books, make them meet in San Francisco, where they then save the world without knowing that they just saved the world from a unknown and unexplained danger. To spice it up, the author throws in a lot of guns, several hit men, a multitude of near escapes for the old characters. There is also a super villain in the background, a kind of a Bill Gates guy - just as boring - who actually figures out that seeing and adapting to change produces wealth and power.I felt there was no story, no new cool ideas and what was truly annoying to me was the author's urge to explain what the characters did in previous books. Read Gibson's earlier books. This book was probably not even written by him, half the stuff is repeat from his older books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not This Time","review":"I'm sorry to slash this because I'm a big fan of Gibson; I gaveseveral copies of Idoru away as gifts (a five star effort). But thislacks all the ingredients we've come to expect. There is really very little action in the book--too many folks sitting around in rooms waiting for things to happen. The bad guys are plastic characters and are so easily removed they hardly matter. Worse yet is the bland cyberspace hunt where Laney does nothing and all doors simply open for him. No intrigue whatsoever. The story's intent is to build to a great dramatic change, but it never delivers. The ending is lethargic with yet another bad guy just walking off stage. There are a few nice moments, of course, but I was left really disappointed. I'm sorry, William, since I'm a fan and look forward to your next effort to take us deeper into human character and futuristic technology's involvement with our lives..."},{"rating":"1","title":"staggeringly pointless","review":"William Gibson is one of my favorite visionary authors, I love his style and concepts----and every other book he's written! This book , however, never really gets off of the ground,and just dances around with itself in search of both plot tension and a satisfying conclusion. i was going to give it one star, but he has enough of his city descriptions to make it barely tolerable. Gibson really fails on this one-i wouldn't waste my time....pains me to say that. All of his other stories have an actual payoff, this one just goes round and round."},{"rating":"2","title":"gibson interviewed at crankydog.com","review":"William Gibson is one of the most Literary (with a capital L)authors working in the genre... but without being overly \\"artistic\\", self-indulgent or hermetic like a Sam Delaney (which is really just self-congratulatory i'm-a-better-artist-than-you-can-understand spew). This is the kind of writing that can cross-over if given a chance ... every bit as good as Pete Dexter or Martha Grimes. The book does suffer from a lack of tidy resolution, but the narrative really isn't about resolution. Certainly should be acquainted with Gibson's universe to be at ease this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to be kidding...","review":"I'm a William Gibson fan, but it's incomprehensible how anyone could describe this book as even remotely readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad story. Bad style. Bad characterization. Bad book.","review":"The story goes nowehere. The characters are all one-dimensional, and we're inexplicably supposed to feel sympathetic to a character who is a professional assassin (and also kills people without pay whenever they bother him). Gibson also overlays the assassin's actions with a patina of Taoist pop-psych worthy of the worst Hollywood scripts; any self-respecting Taoist ought to be insulted. The climax is insufferably lame -- as if a fight and a disaster somehow brought resolution. I also can't stand Gibson's style, which is like a mix of bad Hemingway and Discover magazine. Why's he so allergic to the verb \\"to be\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you Mr Gibson!","review":"This book was apparently assembled from globs of text that were left over from Virtual Light and Idoru. It builds towards a climax that fails to happen, as if Gibson couldn't figure where to take the story, or was simply too lazy to invent a decent ending. Gibson should have more respect for his own body of work, not to mention his readers, than to publish a half-... effort like this. I give it two stars only because it's still better than 90 percent of the ... on the shelves at ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mature, humane, different.","review":"The new Gibson novel, All Tomorrow's Parties revolves around data surfer/cowboy Colin Laney in a postworld San Francisco. Laney's orphic talent for sussing out nodal points is in full flow, anticipating a seachange in the world, the widespread dissemination of reproductive nanotechnology.(Oops) Laney's talent is the result of his exposure to a psychic drug in an orphanage. Halfway through the book I finally grasped the larger theme and the book builds well from page 132 on. This is one of his best novels, bringing his sci fi noir style to another pinnacle, and his'life goes on even after the deluge' messae comes across sharper than before.

First thing she does is close the shutters saying \\"See ya later!\\" She loves it. While we were assembling it, there was room for her, daddy, and a standard size poodle. (the Poodle looked adorable with his head sticking out the window by the way). Very well constructed and VERY easy to assemble. I think she'll have a lot of fun in her house for years to come. I looked at a lot of houses before choosing this one - this one is a little more expensive that some others I looked at, but well worth it.

I believe this publication to be the best reference book for the workplace.O'Reilly books are definitely well written; however, I find myself ALWAYS going to this book first, even though it was published in 2004. The Apache Directives, topics, and examples covered are timeless. It puts side-by-side code base 1.3 and 2.0, with strength of focus on the 2.0 code base. If you use the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) online documentation along with this book, then you will be able to perform in the workplace. Nearly everything covered in this book is relevant today and even translates to the 2.2 code base.I can't wait for the next revision to cover the 2.2 code base in depth. Unfortunately, publications can't keep up with ASF releases and the new and re-factored modules.

His preference for utilizing less-regularly cited primary documents is a marvelous gift, and he readily references other, more 'mainstream' works, which enables a scholar to follow his research trail in a logical and clear fashion. He avoids over-theorization in favor of summation and presentation, both needed and appreciated steps taken while he is writing formational texts in a growing field of study. Any student or scholar working on or interested in the formulation of medieval visions and attitudes towards Islam will be indebted to Tolan's careful scholarship.

As somebody who is 5'9\\" and 130 pounds, the handlebars are a great height, and the scooter definitely feels sturdy enough to support my weight. It now takes me 4.5 minutes to get to work instead of 15.The only downside that I've noticed about the scooter is that when on the sidewalk (which is most of the time for me), the wheels are loud when going across the cracks. In retrospect, I should have bought the Razor model with the larger wheels to reduce the shock and noise created when on the sidewalk. The noise is greatly minimized on smooth asphalt, but unfortunately, since I live in an urban area I can't really ride this on the street."},{"rating":"2","title":"Razor Pro Scooter","review":"My son is 13.

(Well, how would you consider yourself pro if there's almost no sponsers out there :P)It's a pretty good scooter, just not that strong. I had to replace the fork about once every month because it's very thin. I've only broken two forks before these, so I don't know. I've also had to buy new handlebars because the top piece of the bars broke off.Besides these two complaints, this is a very solid model. I've never ridden a FID Muffin, but I hear those are good, too. I would recommend trying both this and the Muffin out to see which you like better.

The graphics are great, you are truely emmersed in the enviorment, but still some things are missing: the multiplayer organization is poor, leaving you not always knowing what's going on, the buddy AI is poor, and they sometimes get stuck on objects like mounds and buildings, and the enemy AI also can be either very poor, or too good.

Every game is played in the pitch black, with only crappy nightgoggles to give you a green view of the surroundings. Enemies hardly repond to your presence and every gun looks like a wooden stick.

The reason I purchased it anyway was to get superior copies of the toons listed. Boy what a disappointment! The sound has been totally screwed up! In an attempt to enhance the the sound, Fox Lorber added sound effects that don't fit very well with the cartoons. (In other words the sounds they added are louder than the rest of the sound track and more clear... making them a serious distraction) The most obnoxious addition is on \\"Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur\\".At the end, when the Caveman goes to stab the giant inflatable duck, the morons who worked on the restoration added sounds from the \\"Psyco\\" shower scene. What a waste of money. I'll be watching my old VHS tapes instead.

Highly do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not a suitable introduction to Complex","review":"As a math major at the University of Connecticut this book was assigned to me as assigned reading for Math 252 (Complex Variables) by my instructor. Since I can not understand a word my professor says because of his accent, I was forced to learn completely from the book. However, having not been exposed to complex variables before, this proved to be quite difficult with this book. I was forced to buy other books on complex variables in order to understand some of the basics of the subject. I assure you it was not due to a lack of intelligence or effort on my part. I found this book dry and far too difficult to understand despite the fact that I have an excellent academic record. There are better (and cheaper) books out there, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"circular logic","review":"In the beginning chapters of the book, I found circular logic, which casts suspicion on the rest of the book. First, the text proved that exp(A)exp(B) = exp(A+B) because to the trig identities sin(A+B) = sinAcosB+cosAsinB and cos(A+B) = cosAcosB-sinAsinB. Then it proves the trig identities with the fact that exp(A)exp(B)=exp(A+B). Circular logic.While taking the class, I thought the text was okay because it was easy to follow and had good examples. Now I'm am more advanced and use my texts to understand the subtleties of the theory and found this at the very beginning of the text. Are there more errors in logic? If so, is this book really worth using?I gave the book two stars because of its ease of use and examples, but cannot give it more due to the bad logic. If I find any more errors in logic I will change my review to one star.I've heard many people recommend Newman and Bok, so go with that one for an introductory book on complex analysis or Ahlfors for an advanced book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great text, great problems, great all around book","review":"This text is for use in an undergrad course or an early grad course. It is written very clearly and has LOTS of problems.

I am very pleased with this text and its clear setup, and I have been using it for self-study. I hardly miss the teacher!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Math Book","review":"This book does not deserve even two stars. The \\"examples\\" they give are just explanations and not real EXAMPLES in question and answer format, therefore it is never clear what the problem is actually asking.

Compared to every other math book I have used, this one was was the least understandable. First of all, not enough examples. Second, the examples do not show how to apply the principles.

Seriously, it's lame techno beats over her saying drunk(haha ok maybe not to that extreme but that's what it felt like to me). After hearing Cowboy style I expected this album to be really good,but was disappointed. I will say one thing, she did do any intersting job of fusing techno along with scottish/british rhythmns on her last few tracks. Other then that some of this album is like a bad kelly clarkson cd(even thought this did come out way before), and the other half a lame techno party.

Although I usually devour books cover to cover in one to two sittings, I kept putting this book down, and when I picked it up again, I couldn't remember the forgettable characters. Perhaps there are too many characters. When more than two people are speaking, you have to count backwards to attribute the sentences to somebody as the author certainly doesn't. And the female characters all wear gray slacks or skirts. The story starts out fluid and gripping but deteriorates into a big yawn. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slapdash and condescending","review":"Good grief. Mr. Kay should have simply written a screenplay rather than a novel, since that's obviously his intention with this book. Stereotypical characters and plot, stock situations, condescending to his audience. His original premise had merit, but he obviously lost interest, decided it wouldn't sell to Hollywood, and wrote a predictable murder story. I would have liked to read the book he didn't write. This novel doesn't even deserve one star, and Mr. Kay should be ashamed of himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful page turner with intriguing characters","review":"Since ..WHITE DOG I've been a Terry Kay fan, and I wasn't disappointed this time either. I believe Mr. Kay is a highly underrated author. Barnes and Noble doesn't even have this book in stock. John Grisham could learn a thing or two from the ending in this book. At the end you felt as if you'd gotten your moneys worth, that the author has respected his readers intelligence and stayed true to his story...didn't cop out with a cheesy ending.

Trippy, minimalist techno grooves that move both minds and booties. I think I must have 3 or 4 copies of \\"Loop,\\" his collaboration with LFO (Low Frequency Oscillation), on various comps, but hey, it does stand up to repeated listening.

It provides a tremendous convenience by giving you a place for your child to nap as well as a place to change their diaper without having to go up and down the stairs all day. (And for someone who delivered via c-section that convenience was priceless when I first came home) It is also relatively easy to dismantle and take with you on trips.

We love the sound box, it was a lifesaver for our little one who needs white noise to sleep and the little nightlight was really handy to check on her with. The changing table was nice but not totally necessary. This P&P is really very easy to pack up and transport. I would buy this brand over any other all over again.

When I used it on my dogs it would turn their nails sideways because of the shape of the nail which caused them pain. Even when I tried clipping their nails sideways to compensate it still turned their nails.

Today - one month before the 2004 Olympics - I found the story just as plausible and terrifying now as it was 20 years ago. I think the most disturbing part of the book is how successfully a single (yet well-financed) terrorist could disrupt, distract and divert the focus of law enforcement by knowing how they think and using it against them. Perhaps the greatest feat in Balefire is not the physical action (there's plenty - it's not all psychological), but the ability of the protagonists to think outside the box they let themselves get herded into.

Unfortunately, while the performances had character, they lacked vocal technique. She has two voices - one low, belter's voice and one high soprano voice, and never did the twain meet. This album is valuable, however, in that it introduces the privileged listener to music he or she might otherwise not get to hear.

The authors also paint the vast majority of sperm banks as homophobic, which I simply don't think is the case.Additionally, I find it disturbing that the authors promote a variety of alternative parenting arrangements (co-parenting with 3 or 4 adults involved, for instance) without discussing the many different ways it affects the child.

My furniture moved across the carpet and hardwood floors with the greatest of ease. With this product you will need help pushing your furniture or at least put more muscle into it to moving it. I should have purchased from previous distributor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too flimsy for moving heavy furniture on carpeting","review":"This is not made of heavy, non-bendable plastic, so using the large ones for heavy furniture over carpeting is a pain, as they bend and cause friction with the carpet. Best to use these on non-scratchable, hard surfaces. If you want to move heavy furniture over carpeting easily, fork over the few extra dollars for the better ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't but it, buy the super sliders from WAXMAN instead","review":"I had used Super sliders. Thought I would try a different kind. Bad move!! These are the worse imposters. Did not work at all, my table kept sliding off the disc and the disc did not move at all!? At first I thought that may be the carpet in my basement was not the kind that a slider would work. But then I bought a set of Super Sliders and it worked like a charm.These are very thin sliders compared to Waxman's. But came with a ridiculous huge box.

And the sliders just don't slide well at all.I also purchased EZ Sliders at my local Bed Bath and Beyond, they work great.

The box says right on it, great for floors, tile and carpet. There are even two big pictures on the back of the box showing people using them on hardware floors. DO NOT USE on hardwood floors. I made the mistake of trying to move a dresser across a hardwood floor with these sliders. Despite the floor being recently washed and waxed and cleaned with a vacuum prior to moving the dresser, some grit (maybe from the bottom of my shoes) was on the floor and stuck to the bottom of these plastic disks (that's all they basically are) and put several scuffs and scratches in the floor. I purchased another type that has a soft covers for the bottom of the disks made of a fleece like material and they work very well.

Our very large computer cabinet was placed near our wall air conditioner...fully loaded the cabinet weighs about 900 pounds. However, during the hottest weather last summer, the ac unit \\"died\\" and had to be replaced. The new ac unit was two inches deeper than the old one, something we had not anticipated! Four sliders placed under the corners of the cabinet made easy work of moving it...the ac unit was installed and cool heads prevailed! Carpet cleaning is so much easier with sliders under two oversized couches, too. Last week, the sliders were again called into service moving a fully loaded china cabinet so a new digital thermostat could be installed.

The foam rubber is supposed to keep whatever you are moving from slipping off the disc, but we found moving some basic office furniture that the plastic disc was too thin, and would warp, bend and snag on the carpet.

However, overall this compilation is not even close to the standard set by some of Tyson's earlier work. Perhaps, that is due to the fact that I am one of those who listens to the western/folk ballad's who doesn't find much satisfaction in the more raucous country style that was used on several of the songs on this release. The insertion of a marginal female vocalist to sing Range Delivery just added insult to injury. There was no indication that this release would be such a departure from the usual."},{"rating":"1","title":"not quite there","review":"Listening to this cd made me think of when I went to his dance in Elko and he couldn't keep a beat going with his band so they had to get Shelley and Kelly to finish the dance. 2 years before this dance was just great.

Lost Herd it is NOT. Soemthing is missing...The shameful issue is he is capable of better, and his previous albums reflect it. Sadly, this CD relects a tad bit of Canadian Anti-American zest. Too bad, he should use his time and energy to his advantage - by producing a better album. I always looked forward to his music for what it was - unopinionated, true cowboy - not political...all thing change I guess.Buy it if you must...if for nothing else to have an anchor or bottom of your CD collection. Guaranteed to gather dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"GAVE IT A CHANCE - STILL LACKING","review":"I've listened to this cd a bunch. If you want to have one of every Tyson cd (as I did), buy it. If you thought Ol' Eon was a sparkling gem, buy it. If you like Barry Manilow and disco music, buy it. If you like mushy gazillion track recording where Ian's voice, delivery and pacing get lost in the production, buy it. What's gone here (whether intentionally or through fatigue) is the crispness, the voice, the delivery, the picturesque imagery, and the pacing that makes Ian Tyson unique in ANY music, let alone western or folk music. If you've heard of Ian and want to get acquainted with what made him great, try any album but this one and Ol'Eon. Ian Tyson songs elsewhere have lyrics that command attention and prompted Wally McRae to write \\"Give Us a Song, Ian Tyson\\". To others this may be an example of \\"artist's growth\\" but to me it's a wart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to have some New Ian in the CD player","review":"Lots of mixed reviews on this one, but all I know is some of these songs hit me in the same way songs from other Tyson disc do. Maybe not his best, but some damn fine songs there just the same. Can really picture the action taking place in Silver Bells, the lonliness of the girl away from home at Christmas. Land of Shinnig Mountains has me imagining an old Ford pickup kicking up prarie dust with the Rockies starting to get bigger on the horizon. Road to Las Cruces and the Ambler Saddle also tell good stories. Hell, edit out the ones you don't like, but these songs work for me.

In one or two of the later chapters, the pages are all mixed up. I don't mind because I used to have the paperback copy, but to those who have not had this cookbook before, it mightbe very confusing.

This book really helped us go from store mixes to home mixes and we didn't skip a beat on keeping dinner time on time.Our mix making events come about on weekends when everyone can pitch in and help.

His story is as kick-ass as it is poignant and honestly makes me like him more than I liked the main characters from Hardwired (who were also pretty awesome).

I know that film needs to take liberties with stories, but this was an assassination of what is considered one of the first mystery novels. It does not follow either the spirit or the story of the original for which I can find no possible excuse. Two hours is plenty of time to bring out the best Collins has to offer.

The earlier version was produced in five 55 minute segments and was an oustanding piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst adaptation of this great novel","review":"If you know absolutely nothing about Wilkie Collins's novel, you might like this movie--although even so, you would likely be irritated by the late 20th-century suspense movies cliches forced back on this tale of the 19th century. (...)If you do know Collins's great, complex novel, this movie will break your heart, because the plot is so reduced and simplified and altered that you get only the barest glimmer of it.I wish the 1970s BBC miniseries, which aired on Masterpiece Theatre in 1982, would be released on video or DVD. That miniseries had 5 hour-long episodes and was really excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, as a minimalist synopsis of the novel","review":"This is an excellent former Masterpiece Theatre presentation. At only two hours it takes on only the main plot thread of the lengthy original novel, which has been called the first English mystery novel. This two-hour version is fast-paced, suspenseful, atmospheric, and engrossing, but it is the \\"Cliffs Notes\\" version at best.The performances are convincing, the production seems high-budget, with many outdoor scenes and lovely costumes and sets. Go to the original novel for wonderful subplots and fascinating, intricate, pungent, detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUTCHERED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"If you have read the book don't even think about getting this DVD. Other than the title and SOME of the names the story isn't even close. You would think that the British would have more respect for their own authors. The movie doesn't even get the relationships right between the book's characters.Granted some will say \\"How can you make a two hour movie out of a six hundred some odd page book? Two choices: One, you make it a mini-series of multiple 2 hour movies. Two, you don't even try! But to try and pass this DVD off as Wilkie Collin's classic is an insult. The man most likely turned over in his grave MULTIPLE times.My regret is that I had to give it 1 star just to get this review to go through.Now if you haven't read the book, enjoy the film. But if you really want to see greatness, read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"pietrp 2","review":"A low rate because of the lack of the subtitles who helps to undestand foreign people not so accustomed with spoken english"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a movie!!","review":"Being a big fan of Wilkie Collins's work especially The Woman in White, this mini-series was a big disappointment. The story line failed to show the cunningness of Count Fosco & brutality of Glyde. The movie does not account for Count Fosco's interest in Laura death which is a very important part of the book. I did not understand the need to change the circumstance under which Mr. Hartright leaves Limmeridge in the beginning. Over all the mini-series failed to capture the sprit of the book. I rather stick with the book instead of watching this adaptation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"This is truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. After loving the book I was greatly disappointed to find that they had done little else to keep the spirit of the book other than the title and character names. Practically every character's personality was completely changed, along with the fact of there being nothing to show that there was an attempt to even try to include the same or similar scenes in the transition from book to movie.Some of this would be forgiveable if the plot and characters they introduced in it's stead were somewhat interesting. Please do yourself a favor and read the book which is far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT like the book","review":"If you are buying this as \\"a movie,\\" it will be OK, not more. But if you are considering getting this because you think the book is extraordinarily amazing (as I do) and would like to \\"see\\" the book, well, think again. This \\"adaptation\\" is hardly that--the entire story line is totally different from the book, making it unique and not worthy to have been called \\"The Woman in White.\\" I would call it \\"vaguely based on the book.\\" Mr. Collins is cringing in his grave."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful Masterpiece Theater Thriller","review":"I was shocked by the comments of the last reveiwer - I loved this film.

A beautiful film - worth having in your private video library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Joy","review":"I saw this version of The Woman in White on Masterpiece Theater and I, as well as my friends, enjoyed it immensely.

It is difficult to condense such a story to a 2 hour film and the film is a story in itself, but the characters and depth ot the original story are lost in the film.

It is funny, but in the darkest of ways. I notice that others have used the words \\"gruesome\\" and \\"mordant\\" which are certainly appropriate. \\"Sick\\" would be another word. Children commit suicide, or are sexually molested or beaten. A cat's eye is torn out by a rat. A woman kills the cat to spite her husband.Some of the humor comes from characters talking to each other with exaggerated formality.

The carefully detailed imagery and character profiles took me way beyond the personal connection, however.

The replacement does the same thing on the space bar ocassionally. I would not buy this item again. It is a clean design and looks nice. But I would prefer one that actually worked 100% of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"good keyboard but insert/delete keys not placed in standard way","review":"I like the keyboard, the keys feel nice and there seem to be no apparent problems with the wireless connection. The only thing I really hate is that the delete key spans across two keys and when I want to hit insert I hit delete instead. I type fast and I don't look at the kayboard when typing, and this causes lot of trouble. I think that Logitech should offer one of these with standard key placement. And when I get used to the different layout, then I get into trouble with standard PC keyboards I must use elsewhere because I then hit wrong keys again for the same reason. Anyway, I don't see why this was done and I am against these \\"innovations\\".Regarding the mouse---the mouse is crappy, the cursor movement is not too smooth and the mouse is too small for a normal hand. But I didnt get this for the mouse, it's just unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slim, Stylish keyboard","review":"This keyboard resembles that of a laptop, except full size. I bought it because of its slim size and I wanted a quiet keyboard.

Great key touch, the mouse and number pad have power switches to conserve battery life. Be sure to have the latest BIOS on your PC or the keyboard won't be recognized at boot. large, accessible reset buttons. The batteries on the mouse load from the top of the unit so you don't have to endure the red light during installation. The keypad has date, time, and temperture readings. The mouse is small in my hand, but perfect for my wife and daughter.It's a real leap in design and execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first....poor quality over time","review":"The mouse is fine and the calculator is also fine (thus 2 stars instead of 1). I'll keep using those. The keyboard was great at first, then the space bar started getting finicky (after 3-4 months of daily use) and I'd have to hit it a couple of times to get it to work. Around the same time, keys started popping off under normal use and carrying the thing around in a knapsack. After reattaching the X key a few times with the help of a paperclip and lots of patience, I thought I had the hang of it. All seemed well. Then the R key came off today. A half hour of trying to put it back on knocked the E key off, and now the keyboard is in the garbage. Good riddance."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it","review":"This keyboard is decent, but the spacebar sticks really bad. It is really annoying when you are typing really fast and the space bar doesn't register. I wouldn't care if another key stuck that was less used, but the space bar is one of the most important keys on a keyboard, and if it doesn't work properly then the keyboard is useless. I would go with the Logitech S510 instead, that keyboard has the best tactile feel of all of the keyboards I have used, and I have used a lot. Good luck in your keyboard search."},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful but.........","review":"Keep your old keyboard and mouse handy. The diNovo works about 80% of the time.

The least they could do is include a wire interface that you could plug in if the wireless configuration fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opposing Exaggerations of the Worst Kind","review":"Gung Ho depicts the worst exaggerations of traits supposedly attributable to both Japanese corporate culture and American unionized labor and puts Michael Keaton in the middle of it -- I was not amused.What makes the film mildly interesting is the sympathy Keaton's character elicits from his predicament as he desperately tries to play cultural mediator; it might strike a chord with whomever has found himself in a similar position. George Wendt's character, however, is an insult to the American autoworker. Most of the premises are \\"manufactured\\" for conflict and cheap laughs, while the movie's culmination doesn't ring true in the least.With a smarter and more insightful script this could have been a comedy for the ages. As it is, it's ultimately an abject embarrassment."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE! PLEASE don't see this movie!","review":"TOO BAD MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!

It is tauted as a spine-tingling work of historical non-fiction, but the prose is unbareably juvenile and the story has numerous holes. You can tell this book was written by a first time author with no formal training, and that is a shame because the story had all the elements to make a great book--but the story was lost in meaningless details. There are too many characters and virtually no character development - aside from the rave reviews Syndney gives herself and her sister on everything from their hair to their education. She acts as if she and her sister are the only two college educated people in Texas. Even if that were true, you would never be able to tell it by her snore-worthy style. Do not waste your time or your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"deception is the key word........","review":"If you are looking for a book a long the lines of \\"Blood and Money\\" You won't find it in this book!

This was the best thing I've read in 10 years. It kept my interest from the beginning to the end. The author did a wonderful job of telling her story as a dramatic autobiography. It reads like a novel, and reads very quickly.Why read fiction when you can read a true life story like this? I give this book 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My #1 favorite","review":"This book should be read by anyone who has lost someone they love.

Filled with actually readings (discernments) he has done.... I have read all of the books involving George Anderson now, and have to say the best by far is LESSONS FROM THE LIGHT.

They are all good books."},{"rating":"2","title":"To get the full effect of reading George Anderson......","review":"My suggestion to anyone interested in this area is to read all of the books on George Anderson.

A lot of the songs are pretty monotonous too and consist of the same guitar riff being repeated throughout.

I found the movie tedious and many times annoying. The pacing was a little slow for me, and it took me 3 tries to get past the first 15 minutes. I didn't like the faux documentary aspect. Some of the dialogue was hard to follow. On the plus side, I did find it had a kind of charming sense of humor at times, but those moments were too few to offset the negatives. I had to force myself to watch the whole thing and can't imagine trying to watch is again"},{"rating":"2","title":"TOUCHING IN CERTAIN PARTS","review":"A faux documentary about a girl who doesn't think she can fall in love so she goes on a road trip with her film crew to ask regular Americans how they fell in love.

If you're interested in various themes of love it's worth a look.

Does that mean... there are hybrid documentaries everywhere! I guess the other marketing agents decided not to try and mislead the viewers though.It's not even that good. Cera is alright considering how the movie plays out but I found Yi to be somewhat annoying, the story lacking a certain something that makes it really stick in your mind, and in general found the humor in it to be empty and just generally hollow."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this? Zero Stars","review":"This movie was certainly not what I was expecting. The budget of this film probably would have been a record low if there weren't any overpaid semi-stars hidding throughout it to keep it up. The movie was super boring and personally I found it annoying. I wanted to give it a chance, but when my girlfriend even asks me to turn it off you know it's bad. I think I was able to watch a total of about 15 - 20 mins of it, I'm not sure though - I think watching paint dry might have held my attention better (and maybe longer!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT I THOUGHT","review":"I was so sorry I rented this movie not at all what I expected.

Some find it originality and cute, some find it boring.Personally, I find the movie to be boring. My con about the movie: Poor acting (overall). I get the point of the movie, but I feel that it is a bit silly to make a movie to understand why you \\"cannot fall in love.\\" My opinion? Don't awaken love until it so desires (it did happen in the movie!). Pro: it's good to learn and ask question from people about love and how they come to it. Although the movie is more like interviewing people and their idea of love, it's the acting within the interview that is boring (and everything between it).P.S. the girl is cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"This \\"movie\\" should have NEVER been made!","review":"I love Michael Cera, but barely made it through the first half hour of this \\"mockumentary\\"...I don't really know if that term is appropriate because there is no humor...and for that matter, no point in this film. The fake love-life story of Charlyne is crazy boring and awkward in the uncomfortable way, not the entertaining way. I rented from red Box and am seriously upset about the one dollar that I wasted on it...it is that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...and I'm a fan of the genre and Cera","review":"The faux doc style can be done well and be quite enjoyable. I am also a big fan of Michael Cera and find him so funny in fact that I can enjoy not very good films like Year One just because I find his delivery and persona so comical. I had such high hopes I almost bought this on blu ray site unseen. This film however lacks on so many levels that it simply didn't work for me. You may be able to enjoy a film with no coheret story line. Maybe you can enjoy one with stiff and wooden acting by it's lead. Movie don't have to be a laugh a minute funny, nor do they have to touch you with drama you can relate to. There can be a weak or uninteresting arc. Still, *some* degree of *some* of this would help it be entertaining. I found nothing to like here. I wacthed the film with my teen daugthers and they too were equally disappointed. I found myself just waiting for it to be over and thought seriously of shutting it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mockumentary or not: It's dull.","review":"Folks are getting really bent out of shape about the \\"classification\\" of this film. Personally, \\"hybrid documentary\\" to me, means: mockumentary. The story can be based on real events or have a bunch of ad-libbed lines all it wants, but once you see professional actors playing roles in the film: it's not a documentary!That aside, the movie is dull. The plot is a decent idea, but the set-up takes far too long. And then once we get to the \\"juicy\\" part of the story, it's really not all that juicy after all: these two socially awkward characters never stop being awkward. For me, the characters simply came off as shallow and annoying.If you're looking for a good Michael Cera flick, watch \\"Nick & Nora's Infinite Playlist.\\" Looking for a good mockumentary; try \\"Waiting for Guffman.\\" Looking for a reason to demand 1.5 hours of your life back; this is your movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Bloody Awful","review":"First off, the writer/star of this mess, is she a comedian? Really?! I'm missing something here. I must not be on the same planet as those who highly rated this movie. Her \\"act\\" is truly abysmal. My two teenage kids are funnier than her (and they're not that funny!). How does she have such cool friends who are willing to make this movie with her?? Her expressions throughout are painful to watch! I haven't seen anything that grated on my nerves this much since \\"License to Wed\\". Apparently others see more beneath the surface of this smug, unfunny \\"mock-doc\\". I'm here to warn you...there's nothing profound here. Just some self-involved movie makers with a camera. If you find this one to your taste, please explain it to me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I lost another 85 minutes of my life","review":"What's the point of this film? A girl trying to find out the meaning of love and pretending it's a documentary. So what. I think Charlyne Yi is the only thing decent about Paper Heart. She is funny in an adorable kind of way, but even her \\"performance\\" wears thin over 85 minutes. The movie description didn't really interest me, so I knew I was taking a chance going in. I was hoping for a nice surprise and I ended up just waiting for it to be over. It's not all bad, but the good moments are few and very far between. Oh, Michael Cera in real life acts the same as M.C. in every movie he does. What a range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. Worst movie ever. Don't even bother.","review":"I love Michael Cera, and thought I would love this movie based on the summary and reviews, but it's just awful.

It's not charming, it's contrived and stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good book- but confirm with native speakers before use","review":"The books in this series are all very good, and amusing- however, slang changes. I remember hearing a Russian say something was \\"the cat's pajamas\\". He learned that slang in school. It was slang- of the 1940's. Be aware of such changes in any book on slang. Words have seriation- that is, they rise and fall in usage, but seriation with slang words is much shorter. Having said that, this is at least fun. For some reason, words like these are much easier to remember. I wouldn't recommend using them around Germans you don't know very well, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun.","review":"My husband is a German Major and loved this book.

I doubt many would say some of the words in the book, but it's fun to read through and read literal translations. You also see a culture connection. For example, when we say \\"That's none of my business,\\" they say, \\"That's not my beer.\\" How about that beer! I have to agree that maybe some phrases are archaic or not used much, but it's like that in English too. Some words seem almost too perfectly translated too. Also, what's up with the author's name? Isn't Besserwisser a \\"know it all?\\" Another good joke there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun and educational","review":"I found this book ages ago in a book shop and sadly, didn't buy it then. I was very excited to get it at Amazon, and it was as funny as I remembered it. It is a great gift for anyone who has learned or is learning German and can be enjoyed at any level of German comprehension. The descriptions and vocabulary give you a sense of the culture, and the book is written with humor. Very fun book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The word Scheisse says it all","review":"This is not the sort of book you should buy if you are serious about learning German.

Ran it at about 50% load for about 10 hours a day. Gas tank does not seem to be 4 gallons, rather around 3. Had some small issues while running; one of the wires on the start switch broke, I had to solder it. The choke spring also broke, I had some extra springs laying around and was able to repair.

When I called buffalo tools about it the technician suggested beating it back into shape with a hammer. He was serious. Apparently this is a common problem because he told me where it was bent! When I indicated this might cause further damage I was told to take it to a local repair shop. Well I ordered it around thanksgiving and we are getting close to Christmas and its still in the shop.

Contacted Buffalo Tools, a few days later, they told me that they had not been able to secure a service center in my area willing to deal with this Chinese engine. Needless is to say that I returned it. The quality and service is not there. At Buffalo Tools they appear to be helpful and knowledgeable, but the product is inferior.

Neither of them detected the power correctly - both would turn on and off. So I gave up on that and just decided to use it for my refrigerator/freezer which is an LG that is just a few years old. It did work with that, but boy did the refrigerator sound 'off' running on this generator. If you want power that's anywhere near clean, look elsewhere.

It can also write in 4 colors; black, blue, red and green. Even though I owned some very expensive pen sets at home I always kept at least 6 or 7 of these in my desk. The fine point is much better than the medium point. The four colors means carrying less pens. You don't mind lending one of these wheras when you lend a better pen it's sometimes a chore to get it returned right away.

Never dropped this watch, always took care of it. Wore it for 3 months when communting on my bike to work and class and needed a dependable timepiece to manage my active schedule. This watch mysteriously stopped and started again unpredictably and unnoticably several times per day. I was constantly resetting the watch and running late to boot. I sent it back for a repair and the movement was replaced for free, but I had to buy a Timex in the interim and waited 4 months until it was returned. Wore the watch for 8 more months during which the lumibrite material denoting the markers and numbers started to flake off and bounce around atop the watch face. At the 15th month, the start/stop problem with the movement returned...unexpectedly of course. I decided it wasn't worth the trouble as the 1-yr warranty had expired.

Since I'm fascinated by that whole period--of Joe McCarthy, Alger Hiss, the shocking presence of real-life commnists in American government back in the 30s and 40s--I found this book very readable. You might also enjoy related books, especially Ann Coulter's best-selling, \\"Treason,\\" which really delivers the goods about how the Communist scare of the 40s and 50s was not the imaginary fear of paranoid Americans.

And Yo-Yo Ma is undoubtedly an accomplished cellist. But their styles just don't blend.Yo-Yo Ma puts something of a 'classical sheen' on the music, and effectively it brings out the worst in Morricone. Of course his compositions and arrangements have always been meticulous, but they also had a quirky, ramshackle quality that is lacking on this recording.I'd say try John Zorn's 'The Big Gundown' for a more interesting and adventurous take on Morricone, or Triology 'Plays Ennio Morricone' for a string trio interpretation, similar in theory to Yo-Yo Ma's but with so much more life.Or better still, go for the Morricone originals - 'A Fistful Of Film Music' is a great start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Distortion Yo-Yo Ma Plays Ennio Morricone","review":"The first CD I ordered exhibited some audio distortion.

This celebrity collaboration fails at every level and is the most boring, wandering CD I have ever heard with only the first cut being only briefly half way OK. This is so beneath the talent of both these accomplished artists that it is a wonder how it EVER got produced.....all these glowing 5 start tributes mean ZIP.....don't buy it.

As a matter of fact, the last 50 seconds of the first piece Gabriel's Oboe is actually the begining of the second piece The Falls. So The Fall has an abrupt start. In addition to these two pieces, #4, #9 and #15 also have sudden cut-offs in their endings. #18 and #19 are similar to #1 and #2. It seems to me they are divided into two pieces from a continues play. This is supposed to be a great album. But with so many defects in MP3, I don't think it is worth $9.99 to download. One thing I need to mention is Amazon customer service. Once I called them and described the problems, they immediately agreed to issue a full refund and claim that they will fixed the defects.

While the idea is promising and the first minutes intriguing, it soon turns into a pretensious, lifeless, slow and unfinishable picture. What could have been an interesting piece about love, guilt, dysfunction and desire becomes a sucession of empty dialogs, wooden monologues and tepid flashbacks that fail to engage. Director Robert Altman sure wasted a good opportunity with this snoozer. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE GUYS AND DOLLS","review":"Maybe it is not some much the film, but it just the whole show. I cannot begin to describe how much I hate the music from this show. It is awful! If you could only see how bad it really is from a critical standpoint. Marlon Brando is AWFUL...Dredful to watch! Frank Sinatra is not Nathan Lane...I think Nathan Lane gave a pleasant Broadway performance. As for Jean Simmons...she was okay...not much else I could say. Vivian Blaine was pretty good. Considering is like...THE ORIGINAL ADELAIDE. But this show just falls short of being a completely crapy movie. DON'T BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Curtain Call","review":"I already own a DVD of Guys and Dolls, but this edition is how it ought to be done; not an extra disc of irrelevancies but a booklet of pics and posters and some \\"making of\\" tie-ins. Those are the sort of touches that befit and enhance a collector's edition of a widescreen film.Also, unlike the double disc Criterion Collection, this keeps the set somewhat affordable. If any film ever merited this sort of red carpet treatment, it's Guys and Dolls. There are so many things going for this film and so many reasons to like it, from the stellar cast to Damon Runyon's Big Apple slang to the Broadway play sets to the unforgettable songs. Along with A Hole in the Head it's probably one of Sinatra's best roles. This play is still put on often, but the film's sparkling cast make this the definitive version. All singing, all dancing, all Guys and Dolls."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't play","review":"same as the other dvd, it ought to state on the web site that custom duty has to be paid and it doesn't play in uk"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu-Ray worth getting","review":"The blu-ray transfer is stunning.

As far as musicals I found Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Meet me in St Louis and even White Christmas ++ completely charming. I own most of these and re-watch them.With that being said I just saw this movie Guys and Dolls at an outdoor venue and the dialogue was dreadful, the dance scenes were so cheesy, the story line was so unbelievably boring and the characters mostly unlikable. I found myself praying that this would be over soon so I could get my ride home so I could go to sleep. No coolness factor, not sweet lovable charm, slow on the scenes and unlikable characters.. This movie just grated on my nerves. What more can I say but don't buy this.

Sinatra is OK but doesn't really have the acting/comedic chops to pull this off.What the hell were they thinking? If you've ever seen even an amateur stage production of this incredibly wonderful musical, you'll HATE this movie. Even \\"Adelaide's Lament\\" is poorly filmed/directed even though the actress is the original B'way Adelaide. Sad... very sad. I haven't purchased this movie from Amazon; I've cringed thru several showings of this bomb on TV and in movie theatres. This is not a comment on the reproduction qualities of the film, it's a comment on the original crappy casting and direction of what should could have been a timeless and cherished musical classic gem (imagine 'West Side Story' if starring Donny Osmond as Tony, Miley Cyrus as Maria and directed by whoever directed 'Caddy Shack'). Oh... the horror!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun","review":"I rented this with my girlfriend and it was a wonderful time. Great couple movie.

The opening musical sequence where the camera follows people around the city, for example, seemed to take longer than on the DVD and the scene in Cuba was not as upbeat. Other than that, though, it was the same in every respect. Brando and Simmons had a palpable chemistry that some people can only wish to experience. Sinatra and Blaine lit up the screen with their musical and comical portrayals of Nathan and Adelaide. A definate classic that musical lovers should see. As a musical lover myself, it is my favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not necessary but good","review":"I bought this book with the original textbook.

It was one of the very first books that really engaged me in questioning the origins of life. The book is so full of flaws and poor argument that a ten year-old can pull it to pieces. As others have reviewed; it confuses evolution with abiogenisis, misrepresents the definition of theory and is embarrassing in its nude bias towards creationism and the church's particular doctrinal spin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A history of transcendence...cool!","review":"What a great book. It's the human evolution of consciousness. Ken has shown in his other books how we progress through several, well defined, stages of congnitive growth.

He also keeps track of the highest achievers of each period."},{"rating":"2","title":"MC Solaar is also brilliant live","review":"The live versions on this album really differ from the studio albums.

This album is in the middle low part. I purchased this CD because it was a reduced CD ($4.99), and on top of that, because of the LUAKA BOP name on it: David Byrne is a genius and i know most of his label groups such as \\"Los Amigos Invisibles\\", \\"Si-s��\\", \\"Los de Abajo\\" and many more, furthermore, I recognize that David Bimself (thru Luaka Bop) got a talent that lead him to discover and sign emerging bands, unfortunately, not all things that come from Luaka Bop are that good.Half of the tracks on this CD doesn't worth the pay, but I can rescue a couple, the chillin \\"Bruja\\" from los Amigos invisbles, folky bossa sound of \\"afro blue\\" (susana baca) and the upbeat \\"The Rain\\" (from the Latin band Si-s��).A CD for Collectors only, despite that, I will keep it just becuase of the tunes I mentioned above."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great label, great artists, great remiixes","review":"A label by Mr David Byrne that keeps exploring world music.

Robert Goulet's \\"Always You\\" was his first, and recorded within 6 months of his Camelot debut. It has a very serious feel, and there is no doubt that he sounds terrific. The man can sing. Now the live \\"In Person\\" album shows his vocal talents off very well and I believe that this was actually recorded in 8/62 not 8/61 as the liner notes on the CD indicate. I don't think this live version is quite as good as the \\"On Tour\\" album released in 1966. But it captures a young performer not yet totally at ease in the patter between songs, but nailing every song he sings. If you are a fan, it is a must buy. Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodbye, Robert -- you were my adolescence","review":"I saw Robert Goulet in CAMELOT on Broadway when I was 14.

Why do I say that? Well, because nothing seemed to hard-boiled about this particular book. I mean it had crime and some lust, but was not that too hard boiled. Anyway, the book was a good waste of some time, as it was pleasurable to read. It was never slow never boring, and only a little bit dated. All in all, it contained a great deal of action and very visual images. I would suggest the book to anyone wanting to get into the crime book scene. Overall, a good but not great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Average Crime Novel","review":"The Vengeful Virgin is a rather drab, typical noir story without a lot of action or mystery behind it. Shirley Angela is an 18 year old trapped taking care of an ailing, mostly bed-ridden step father and she just wants out of the trap. Plus her step-father is rich and she'll be set for life when he finally kicks off. Enter Jack, a TV repair and salesman whom she's called to install an intercom system and a TV. Shirley manipulates him to help her do away with the old guy, a rather easy task since she is sexy and Jack is allured not only by what she offers in the way of prurient pleasures, but even more so the money.The story revolves around Jack and his ineptitude at getting away with what he does, and frankly is rather tedious. It is, thankfully, a quick read and mildly entertaining, if not anything beyond an average crime novel at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"hate it hate it hate it hate it","review":"Here it is: my absolute least favorite song in all of history.

For those who listened to this album on vinyl (and I'm one of those people), it was an experience that can never be forgotten.I know I shouldn't be amazed by the sound quality of this CD, but I am, anyway. To hear these excellent songs without the background crackling of my old LP (which has mysteriously disappeared) is to hear true sonic beauty at its finest! I'm not sure if this was remastered or not, but it sounds as if it was.The only song I come close to disliking is It's a Small World. Somehow, I find myself wondering what Disney was thinking here! Plain disco would have been enough, but, no, someone decided that funk was the way to go. It's an interesting arrangement, though, and, as far as I'm concerned, the only blemish on this album.If you remember this album fondly, as I do, do whatever it takes to find it!

I couldn't find any replacement blades for my shaver so I decided to buy another Remington, assuming the quality would be as good as the one I had. Wrong, this shaver is so crummy I had to do a double take to make sure it was actually a Remington. It needs a charge every other day and even fully charged it runs like the battery is completed discharged. Into the trash it goes.

The battery is too weak, the rpms are too slow and it tugs on your whiskers causing irritation and pain (even the beard trimmer does this)I cannot do much about this as it was a present, and I no longer have the package it came in. So I'll just look around for better, I imagine it won't be too hard to find better than this.no offense Remington or China for that matter, but if you'd quit building garbage you'd find it easier to attract and maintain customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor choice","review":"Amazon wouldn't print my first review. Have no idea why. This was not a lemon folks. I foolishly exchanged this item 3 times to prove it. The exchanges were done without problem.The razor is powered by a single AA battery. The battery's life decays quickly in the first thirty days making it mandatory to recharge almost daily. It will not work corded. You best bring your charger unit with you even on short trips.The exterior design is good. The weight and feel are good as well. The shave is excellent for the first few weeks but after that, it's all downhill. The country of origin may be a factor.It wouldn't cost much to correct the problems and make this a great razor.

I loved the show when it was on the air and was extremely angry at NBC for taking it off. However, at least with this DVD set you can re-watch all the existing episodes. I was surprised at how many episodes I had missed. All in all, great DVD set. And like someone else had said, it'll leave you wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prized Possession","review":"It's seems like I'd waited an eternity to finally own this treasure. Freeks and Geeks was certainly the best high school drama to ever grace a television, and it was perhaps the best drama of all time. I've still not forgiven NBC for taking it away, but finally having these stories in my DVD collection has definitely helped the healing process. All 18 episodes are here in their entirity, sans commercials, and plus hours upon hours of very cool extras. Two different commentary tracks for each episode means 54 different episode viewing experiences. But more than the bonus features and original music, it's the true-to-life characters and their relationships that make this collection so compelling. Hurricane Frances had me trapped in my house for three straight days, and this recent birthday present was a great survival tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Show To Hit Television, Big Fan of Martin Starr","review":"I was only 13 when this show aired. I recall having trouble finding out when it was on, because of the hiatus and what not. I fact, having seen the entire series now, I realize that I had only seen a few episodes, but in that showt time became a huge fan.THe entire show was great. The writers captured high school life incredibly. All of the characters were real, with there own quirkiness and various problems. And I loved the comedy. Most T.V. dramas are terrible at injecting comedy into the work, most don't even bother trying anymore. Freaks and Geeks were amazing at putting a humrous spin on situations.I really loved the baseball episode. Seeing the geeks attempt sports, and Bill sticking up for himself (butt patter), made him my hero. I haven't seen any of his work since and would love to know what he's been up to.Everyone I've introduced Freaks and Geeks to has loved. There's nothing unlikable about it. It's too hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pearl of TV","review":"There are so few good things on TV anymore. This is one of the best shows ever to grace the airwaves. Its funny, poignent, clever, smart, serious...it's got everything that makes TV good.I remember Freaks and Geeks when it originally aired and couldn't believe then that so few people knew of it. Those who did know of it, however, loved it. You will love it too, especially if you are in your 30s.

The extras are great and makes the episodes even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a comedy...","review":"I had never seen the show when it originally aired but decided to buy it based on reviews online and from the reccomendation of friends. Boy am I glad I did.The show succeeds in blending comedy and drama and showing what it is like growing up in High School. Not sugarcoated like most teen films and not dumbed down like in \\"That 70's show,\\" it portrays characters as real people; flawed and not always likeable; while trying to find oneself. I think anyone who has been to High School can identify with someone in this and even if you don't it's still a fun view.This reminds me how smart Television can be and how quick quality is disposed of on Network Television. In this day and age of Television that is saturdated with reality shows,it's nice to have an alternative to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Series","review":"I can't believe this show was cancelled! If you were in High School in the 80's this show will really hit home. Beware though, this is not a \\"feel good\\", \\"Wonder Years\\" sort of show. TV Guide calls it \\"funny, tender, and achingly real!\\" That says it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad this is gone","review":"I used to love watching this. I can't believe they stoped this in it's first season. That certainly doesn't reflect how good it was. It was funny and entertaining. There are all 18 episodes on here and as a true fan, I loved watching the extra features on the discs. Linda Cardellini now stars on ER and James Franco has been nominated for various awards. It shows that from the beginning there were talented actors on here that did great jobs but unfortunately were totally unappreciated by the networks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"This has to be the best DVD package I have seen in years. You can tell that everyone involved with the show who put this together put their heart and soul into it! This set should be on every year-end \\"Best of\\" list for packaging alone.

Hopefully, enough people buy this set to boost support for getting this show on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Shows Ever made.","review":"I recommend it highly. It is a very realistic and funny comedy/ drama about high school set in 1980-81.I loved the way the characters were handled. There was a dynamic growth in the brief story arc.

I would have to consider it my favorite show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Wait - Worth the Price","review":"I was one of the unlucky who didn't discover this show until it was in syndication, otherwise I would have added my voice to those who tried to keep it alive.This set is for all rabid fans but not exclusively. If you never caught this series before but have only heard from everyone else how good it is, spend the money. It is well worth it.After watching every episode once, you can go back through and watch with your geek friends Judd Apatow and Paul Feig yammering away on the commentary track along with assorted cast members, writers and directors. Although sometimes the commentaries are a bit of a confused babble, it is like watching with friends. And of course, the music (the reason for the priciness) is stellar."},{"rating":"2","title":"FREEKS AND GEEKS ***** YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS","review":"I missed this series when it was on TV. I don't know how! It is life as it was in the 80's. I know, I was there. I enjoy watching each episode over and over again, appreciating each character and their growth over the year. I love the way the writers handled all of those little traumas like teenage drinking, sex, family relationships, drugs, and all those other things that happen to us as we grow up. And the music? Well, I am now officially a DEAD HEAD! Listen to the director/cast narrations! You'll be amazed!

It's one of my all-time favorite shows. Hilarious, heartbreaking, sweet, touching, and cringe-inducing. I love it all.Finally, a show about the kind of people I hung out with in high school. It makes me wince with embarassment to watch it sometimes, which is just a testament to how real it is, and how GREAT the actors are. It's perfect to own on DVD because it's something you'll want to watch over and over again. Judd Apatow is a genius, and the entire cast is hilarious and talented (even though I do save most all my fangirl love for Seth Rogen).Also - the music ROCKS. It just ROCKS!I don't know how many times I've loaned it out to people, and so far everyone I've loaned it to has loved it. It's definitely worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am Sam Weir","review":"I was Sam Weir growing up, and I felt I was watching an edited version of my HS trauma...this show is uncanny in how authentic the portrayals are! I also wouldn't have minded a knockout like Lindsey as my sister! the fact that John Francis Daley was actually 13 during filming, made this even more real. My favorite scene is in episode#5 when love's theme plays as Sam is in the office. Judd and Paul, put out the soundtrack! This show also proves that no good comedy needs a laugh track.This is really one of the best shows of all time, enjoy, freaks and geeks of the world (myself included!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"strange magic","review":"as you know, i have many dvd sets of tv shows. but i have to say, this is my most valuable. every episode of this show is perfect. the characters are intriguing and this show has a real feeling to it. it will actually make you sad, it will make you cheer. the meanie character kim kelly in this show is great and i want her to babysit me and yell at me and watch vh1. you should appreciate that you live in a world where you can order a complete series of a great show off the internet and it comes right to your house/apartment in a clean, boxed set. buy this cause you can. we're lucky this got released and even luckier that it's a high quality release and not thrown together (willandgracewhat?). it's full of extra features that are interesting and funny. i truly, truly love this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I'm not going to say anything different than what other reviewers said.

Because of this,the 30 days has passed and it stil does not show.I think the service stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving and not interesting.","review":"After hearing rave reviews about this series, I managed to get my hands on the first disc. What started out as semi-interesting just turned into a very boring story with bad writing, bad jokes, and bad actors. It just seemed uninspired. The characters were unlikeable and there wasn't anything deep in character development throughout the first disc. I just kept thinking to myself, \\"What are they doing. What is the point of any of this? How can the story be so boring?\\"This very well may be a great series, but it failed to capture my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slapstick and Stereotypes","review":"Based on an intrinsically interesting concept--the trials and tribulations of high school. However the execution is mediocre. Yes, the cast is physically attractive. But the characters and storylines border on stereotypes and there is a strong emphasis on physical humor (i.e. slapstick) Do not recommend for mature viewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaks And Geeks","review":"Wow I was really excited for this series to come to dvd,seeing as how I remember watching a few episodes when the show actually aired. This is my first time being able to see how the whole season progressed. It was just a really wonderful show that went way before it's time. It's just sad how such a great show could get the ax...but anyways you'll fall in love with the characters and everything about the show. It would have been lovely to see how the freaks and geeks made their way through high school and just life in general, but sadly the show ended before we could. I would say to anyone considering buying this series just to buy it because you wont regret it...Now on to the shipping...i was really pleased with the shipping I received my dvd in two days, and i will definetly do business again...Thanks amazon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great TV","review":"Pilot and first episode are not as strong, but overall this show left me wanting more. You can tell there's a lot of heart put into the making of all this. Characters are fun to watch (especially the geeks).

When this came out on DVD, I bought it because Freaks and Geeks was a show that got rave reviews from magazines. But I never saw it. I bought the complete series here and I gotta say - it's horrible. This is so cliche and unfunny that it is unwatchable. Oh, Sam broke up with a cheerleader - so what? It wasn't worth getting up to that point. If you are thinking about getting this because you are curious but never saw it - rent it first....It's a drama not a comedy. If you like comedy check out good shows like The Office or Mr. Show."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Work of Genius","review":"There's never been a more accurate depiction of high school life in the '70s and '80s.

Therefore, my comments here are not about the series, but the DVD.I have a hearing problem, and instead of turning the TV volume up, I just use closed captioning. Most DVDs do not contain closed captions files, and so they will usually use English subtitles. This DVD set does not have any features to accommodate the hearing impaired. The sound fluctuates significantly on these discs and so it was difficult to enjoy. I guess if you are deaf, you cannot watch this series at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"ITAM GOOD,SERVICE NOT","review":"I ordered this product,it was sent twice within weeks of each other.

Delivery nearly doubles the price of the danish, which was troubling to me. My Kringle was supposed to be delivered on a Wednesday - I couldn't wait! Notice came that it had been shipped on Monday. Wednesday came and went - no Kringle. Thursday no Kringle, Friday, no Kringle. On Saturday morning, I went out on my back porch to dispose of trash, and laying on my back patio was a damaged Kringle box. UPS threw it over my locked 10 foot fence on to my back patio with no notice and with disregard to the 2 stickers on the box \\"Fragile\\" and \\"Perishable\\". I wrote O & H to complain, but received no response. Despite the fact the danish was tasty, I will not order again from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feminists don't have a sense of humour","review":"When Aunt Beatrice forbids her niece Priscilla to marry, she tells her loverboy Jeffrey that if her aunt could only see how brave and manly he is, she'd surely change her mind. A staged robbery, prevented by Jeffrey, should do the trick. A pair of bungling Irish day laborers are hired to accost Aunt Bea, and then-- Jeffrey to the rescue! It seemed like a good idea at the time.Things don't go as planned. Jeffrey is late for his date with heroism, and as a consequence poor Auntie ends up a hostage in a brothel. Little does she know, things happen for a reason: she'd soon be meeting the man who could awaken her long-buried passions.I found Krahn to be a funny, intelligent storyteller, immensely readable. Her mastery of plot is to be admired, as is her historical knowledge. Her romantic leads had sensational chemistry, and her love scenes were erotic but tasteful--neither too purple or too vulgar. I closed the book with a smile on my face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not user friendly","review":"The Boss Br1600 is a outstanding recorder. Lots of Tech built into this unit. If your a person who has a hard time understanding Tec imformation step by step than you need to get something more simple. The manual is hard to read. But if you have had experience with other recorders than iam sure you will find this unit outstanding. Maybe you should download the manual first before buying the unit.Amazon should put more Tec imformation when they try to sell the BR1600 16 track recorder. Make sure that the power adapter which is a roland comes with the unit if not thats $44.85cents more out of your pocket. I first bought this in 2005 and have had no problems and no tec support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old, but good","review":"I know, this game is years old. It combines the empire building aspects of Age of Empires games plus the character building aspects of many RPGs. Of course, lots of fighting, raiding, resource hoarding, etc... Many different races and occupations for your hero and your troops. It has both single and multi-user modes, but I haven't played against anyone yet. Not many players are out there. The music is fairly boring, but you can turn it down, but keep the game sounds up on full volume. You don't need the fastest PC in the world to play this game either. There are still updates available from various websites."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst RTS game ever made in history!!!!","review":"This game is complete garbage. All the grachics they use in this game are recycled from the last game. Not even the old 8-bit Sega Genesis games would dare use the exact same graphics as the last game. And they did this 3 times. Some of the units in this game were used in the first game which was released almost 4 years ago!!! I have more money on my Ebgames Card than the budget they had to make this game; and it shows! Graphics that are below Playstation 1; poor sound; stupid gameplay; worthless new races. The biggest thing though is that all the concept ideas for this game were stolen from the Warhammer games. Go to www.gamesworkshop.com and you'll see what I mean. But the Brits thought this game sucked so bad they didn't even waste time sueing this guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic cabinet organizer","review":"I used two of these in a home built kitchen pantry cabinet for the two upper shelves.

It's a good book as an introduction to Semiconductors, especially if you need to understand the concepts before you go into the deeper stuff. It also provides the mathematics on deriving some of the equations without expecting the reader to already to know how the equations came about. Good for undergraduates & graduates who are starting to take stuff in this field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Phone","review":"Yes, I went with this phone 'cause of the TV feature. It is very hard to hear the TV if you're like in the mall, in a store, or outside with moderate to little traffic. It's best to have a headset if you're going to listen to TV. The speaker phone is just horrible. You have to turn it way down or you will get feedback and if you put the phone down, you will get feedback. Both you and the other person get the feed back. It maybe just me but I hate how I have to flip the screen up just to make a call.I have a LG C500 I believe is the model with Cingular and I liked how very easy it was to use. This phone is a little annoying to me. I only had it for 2 days and already am taking it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"After using this phone for only 1 1/2 days my display screen broke-not on the outside but inside. Wireless carrier only offered to fix it for a $50 fee and manufacturer was of no help at all. I was told it was due to some sort of pressure impact and would be considered physical abuse. I can't believe they make such high dollar phones that have screens that will break by breathing on them. This phone was not dropped in any way, or banged on anything, yet I am the one paying to replace it after spending $200 on it to begin with. The sales clerk told me just bumping into something with it in your pocket or purse could break the screen. Maybe they should have encased it in rubber. I am VERY disappointed in this product and wish I could return it for a refund and get a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"My family loves this book","review":"We love this book. We just checked it out of the library, but it is clear that we will have to buy a copy to keep on the shelf with \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\".

The story and pictures work wonderfully as a whole, and I often pick it up just to enjoy the design and illustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, pages not in order -- now 5 STARS","review":"Like the book but the pages were bound wrong so that they were mixed up inside. So what good is the book then?I want to compliment Amazon for their fast customer service. I was very disappointed about this and within a day, I got a new book that was stitched right. And my son just loves it now!Thanks to Amazon and it's a good book too."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was misled by all these glowing reviews.","review":"Let me qualify something. I have a two year old. This book is not good for a two year old. Pictures: Poorly done, with some artistic watercolors that are really to dark. Not a bright happy and pleasing in the illustration department. The pictures are really elementary in skill level. Story: This book is really just a huge social message about the loss of habitat for certain animals. I dont think that little kids really can conceptialize this let alone care. The message also offers no solution to the problem. Leaves you hanging at the end as you wonder if you missed something. Text: Not a rhyming book. Actually, just did not have good flow. I hate to be the odd man out here, but for MY purposes - not a book that I would recommend you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works.","review":"This is one of our family's favorite bedtime books. The illustrations are fabulous, but the increasing drowsiness of the text, paced very much like a lullaby, carries the day (or night). It is guaranteed to have me yawning by about page 4, and catches my son's attention even on nights when his toy trains and trucks have far more appeal than the prospect of bedtime. There are some wonderful lines in the text, like the parenthetical notation \\"(She was a very strong mother.)\\" that have a way of making you feel good about the Battle for Bedtime. It's a book that's meant to be read out loud. I've bought several extra copies to give as gifts to other parents, and recommend it without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The entire CD is worth listening to...","review":"I love this CD. My daughter gave me a copy for Christmas and I have become a big Kelly Clarkson fan.

All songs blew me away. My favorites include:1. Breakaway, this is a music classic.2. Since you been gone, this song is rocking hot.3. Behind these hazel eyes, I saw the music video, and it is smoking hot.4. Because of you, this song is very nice and smooth.

So why 4 stars instead of 5? Well, unlike other pop CDs that I have bought, this one had very few songs that were really of the stand-out, stick-in-your-head, can't-wait-to-hear-it-again type. The fast, catchy \\"Since U Been Gone\\" and \\"Just Walk Away\\" come close, but most of the other songs are ballads. They're nice to listen to; they just don't stick in your head long after they're over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed","review":"Kelly Clarkson's previous \\"Thankful\\" album didn't impress me, but \\"Breakaway\\" was awesome!

While her debut CD was full of standard pop musings, Breakaway is a more mature focused effort mapping out her musical direction and setting the course as a legitimate rock songstress.

Kelly Clarkson is not believable as a rock singer. She sold out and is acting like a phony little poser like Avril Lavigne. She thinks she's a true punk, but she's just another fake from Texas. This is not Kelly Clarkson. What a loser. All my respect for her is gone and the music sucks too. The only good song on here is the live version of Beautiful Disaster. Other than that, Kelly has sold out and is just another fake pop/punk poser."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUX","review":"I was never a fan of Kelly Clarkson. Her voice is okay. i thought Tamyra Gray deserved to win the first season. I don't like the way Kelly carries herself. I did not purchase this cd, but listening to the samples I can tell u this cd sux- big time. She is trying to be like Avril Lavinge and she can't pull it off. This is not her type of music and she is trying to be someone she's not. She should stick with what she started with. There are only 2 songs I liked on this cd: Walk Away and You Found Me. That Beautiful Disaster Song sounds like an Evanessance song, but it sux. She can't sing period. Listen to this- it'll do you good."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Idol","review":"American Idol was never a good show to me. Kelly Clarkson shouldnt of been picked though I am sorry but I heard some of her music and I didnt like her voice but then again I am not big on all the pop stars these days. Most of them try to make kids be like them when they get older. Kelly Clarkson isnt very pretty either not like I care what people look like. Shes not all that talented, atleast she has guts to do what shes doing but still. I respect girl musicans but shes one of them I dont...but then again I am not big on many pop stars but maybe Amy Lee...American idol yes seems like a way to pick singers but William Hung and Clay Akin?..thats over board"},{"rating":"1","title":"What an irratating racket!","review":"This really must be a sign of the times. It seems that musical talent completely vanished from this world circa 2000. The idiotic television program \\"American Idol\\" searched the entire United States for talented singers, and all they could find was this whiney, noisemaking nitwit. Kelly Clarkson is in close competition with Alanis Morisette and Avril Lavigne for the \\"Screechiest Voice\\" award. From the first strains of the awful \\"Since U Been Gone\\" until the final noises of the unspeakably bad last track, Kelly Clarkson wails at the top of her lungs. She sounds like a cat with its balls caught in a vice! The ability to sing extremely high notes does not make anybody a good singer. A large vocal range is useless when your voice is screechy enough to break glass! This is not even music, its just a bunch of angry yelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did Kelly go?","review":"I loved Kelly's first album, but Breakaway sounds like a bad Avril Lavigne imitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CD EVER!","review":"This is the best CD ever! When I heard \\"Breakaway\\" I knew this was going to be a good record. i was a little worried if the public would like her as pop/rock, but judging by the fact that she has gone platinum, I say that they did like her. Every song on this cd could be played on the radio. Kelly's voice shines on all the songs and this album showcases her song writing abilities. Highlights: \\"Breakaway\\", \\"Since U Been Gone\\"\\"Because of you\\" and \\"Addicted\\". This is defiantely a more mature album. I can't wait for CD #3. There is no sophmore slump here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"......what genre?","review":"Is Kelly Clarkson going to be a pop idol or r&b singer?

I had heard her say recently that this CD would be a more rock direction and show the real her. I was expecting songs like LOW from Thankful. Well the \\"real her\\" is apparently a copy of the latest Avril, Hilary, or Ashlee. She actually sounds like she is trying to sound like Avril on some songs, Amy Lee on others, and frankly her \\"copy\\" falls short. I'll take the real Avril and Amy Lee. This CD is way too imitative of every other pop girl out there trying to pose as rock. I guess Kelly saw the success of Ashlee Simpson (another HUGE joke) and thought she'd give it a try. What a joke. Definitely my last Kelly Clarkson CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"This is one of the many reasons why I hate TV. MTV, reality shows and most of all American Idol. That damn show spawned this crap by Kelly Clarkson and now her stupid album is in every music aisle in every store. This chick cant sing and her singles are played 1,293,402 times a day on the radio.

One Avril is enough for this world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome to the Suck","review":"Kelly Clarkson is probably the most important female artist in the history of music. Her music will continue to inspire musicians for generations to come. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that the first 10 million buyers get a free lobotomy with purchase, what a great deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad for an above average kareoke singer","review":"She doens't write any of her own songs (a few lyrical lines don't count). She sings well enough but not that distinctively. She hasn't a clue how to move or generate any kind of excitement when playing live. I'm judging from her SNL appearance. She's a manufactured pop star whose fame is due to a TV reality show. She'll be forgotten as soon as her audience hits their twenties and gets tired of her or discovers real music. Kelly Clarkson's \\"career\\" is artificial. Her artless and prefabricated music was written only to make a buck and is completely disingenuous mind candy for teenagers. For people who actually play or like music and not just \\"singing\\" she is as important and entertaining as an average car commercial."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Okay and That's About It","review":"I've never been a fan of Kelly's, but she has some pretty good songs on \\"Breakaway\\" that all happen to be played on radio. You're just better off recording or dowloading, whichever is convenient for you. Other than that, I wouldn't pay any money for this CD at all. It's not that original and it's quite boring at times, which I find insulting. Since Kelly likes to \\"rock,\\" she should learn to play an instrument as well as get into some weight training and sit-ups, which she deseperately needs to do if she's going to be showing off her stomach like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad","review":"Not too good though. Kelly sings good but the songs on Breakaway all sound the same. NO soul, no depth, no passion. If you want good pop/rock music, try another Idol."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Breakaway', by Kelly Clarkson","review":"The song was just as I had expected. In fact, the whole album was super great. I have listened to it over and over.The song seems so approprate to what is happening in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Top 10 of 2004 for sure!","review":"When I heard Breakaway on the radio a while ago, I hoped that it'd be on her new album. And when I found out it was and was the title, I was hyped. Then came \\"Since U Been Gone,\\" and Kelly proved that she could really really sing. And that she could pull of the rock sound. I bought the CD, and I am really REALLY impressed. This is much better than her first, \\"Thankful\\" because it has a lot more depth, soul and power behind it.My favorite songs on the album are \\"Breakaway,\\" \\"Since U Been Gone,\\" \\"Behind These Hazel Eyes,\\" \\"Gone,\\" \\"Addicted (my absolute favorite)\\" and \\"Walk Away.\\" The entire CD is awesome. The live performance of \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" is a major improvement over the album version.This deserves to be in the Top 10 of 2004. She did a wonderful job."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest CDs ever!","review":"I like alot of female singers and Kelly is definatley one of them. She has alot going for her and her voice is awesome! Every song on this album is wonderful. You will not be disapointed, in my opinion even if she wasent on American Idol, I think she would have gotten a record deal with no problem. She will be around for a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CD, the only good person to come out of AI","review":"I love this album, i wasn't dissapointed at all. I like \\"Behind these hazel eyes\\" \\"Breakaway\\" \\"Where is Your Heart\\" \\"Beautiful Disaster(Live\\" It's just simply an awesome CD, you won't be able to put it down. Also check out Kelly's first album, Thankful.

Didn't buy it, didn't really care much. This CD, however is VERY different. I heard \\"Breakaway\\" and decided to listen to the online previews for the rest of the songs.....and proceeded to listen again and again for over and hour. Bought this CD the next day. I like most of the songs on this CD, which is incredibly rare for me. I'm especially a fan of \\"Gone\\" (one other reviewed gave it a 7/10, however I give it an 11/10....it hit very close to home for me) as well as \\"Breakaway\\" and \\"Behind these Hazel Eyes.\\" I love the sort of rock sounds that she adopts in this album. I would whole-heartedly recommend this CD to anyone and am incredibly glad I bought it. I'm hoping Kelly Clarkson puts out more like this...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Hope To Hear More Of Kelly In The Future","review":"\\"Breakaway\\" is Kelly Clarkson's sophomore album, having released\\"Thankful\\" the year before.

Sultry tones and hook-laden, this is quantum leap up from 'Thankful'. But her ambition is a big one, and she's not sure where she's going - from pop punk fury [Gone] to ersatz rocker chick [Behind These Hazel Eyes] to Top 40 turgid schlock [Because Of You] to dance-pop diva [Walk Away], the girl is all over the place. Her declamation at hipster relevance remains a teen-rock classic [Since U Been Gone], and when was the last time you hummed along to the only great waltz on the radio [Breakaway]? But I can only trust her aesthetics forgo her rock star objective or she might wind up in rehab with Courtney Love. By the way, where IS Courtney Love?

It should either be broken or thown away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, who kidnapped Kelly?","review":"Fess up. Those of us who voted for Kelly on the first season of American Idol are on to you. This isn't Kelly. Matter of fact, Kelly Clarkson has been missing for a very long time. This is an Avril/Amy Lee clone wanna-be and most definitely is not Kelly.Before this CD came out, I read an interview where \\"Kelly\\" (the clone she's been replaced with) said that this CD was going to be \\"Janis Joplin without the drugs\\". Dear clone, I have two words for you: Melissa Ethridge. Now THAT is Janis without the drugs. I'm sure the \\"real Kelly\\" knows that. Bring her back and put this clone away, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review for \\"Breakaway\\" by Kelly Clarkson","review":"What happened to Kelly Clarkson? I never watched the first season of \\"American Idol\\" but as soon as I heard her amazing ballad \\"A Moment Like This\\", I ran out to buy the single and later bought the entire album \\"Thankful\\". Those were back in the days when Kelly Clarkson was classy, sophisticated, and showed off her amazing voice and range with a variety of music styles. But I guess today's punk culture got the better of her, and she trashed herself up to try and fit in with the wrong crowd. \\"Breakaway\\" is nothing but rock. Which is probably why 75% of the Caucasian pre-teen community fell in love with Kelly Clarkson after her song \\"Breakaway\\" was released. If you're a punk, go out and buy the CD as soon as possible. If you want to hear some real music, buy Ruben or Fantasia's CD instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is a hit...anyway","review":"I just don't get it. What's so good about this album? Alright, the first three songs were really good. Her best song is Behind These Hazel Eyes, I think. But what's happened to her voice at the rest of the album? Because of You sounds like the best of Mariah Carey meets Evanescence, actually more like the worst. Everything just starts going downhill from then on. Where's the Kelly who impressed me with her ballads during her 'Miss Independant' days. I think she's just trying to hard to revive her (almost) flagging career. (Did you know that she was nearly dropped by her record company?) Riding high on the pop-rock genre that has been shot to fame because of Avril Lavigne, Kelly proves that she's just a sell-out who will use absolutely anything to be heard on the radio, including changing her image into...a vamp! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Talent and no gimmicks","review":"I originally bought this CD for my daughter who liked her songs,\\"Since U Been Gone\\" & \\"Behind These Hazel Eyes\\". We listened to it together and it quickly became one of my favorites. She is incredibly talented with an amazing range and ability to convey emotion through her singing. As far as I'm concerned, she the only one with real talent to come out of \\"American Idol\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly rocks and this album proves it","review":"Kelly Clarkson is the singer of our generation. She can hit high notes like crazy, and her songs she wrote are very catchy.Also, Kelly Clarkson didn't flop like Britney Spears. Wait? Britney flopped.

Highly recommend this album!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not feeling anything...","review":"I am not feeling anything from this album, just a bunch of songs that make me feel blah and this is deffinately not an album which you can play over and over again because halfway through any song it just becomes annoying and her voice in the chorus sound the same and whiney.

Elvis didn't write any of his songs, is he untalented too? Give me a break.This is a much better album than her first release. My guess is that she had more input on choosing which songs she wanted on the album, or maybe she just has better people working for her on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"My guilty pleasure...","review":"The music I mostly listen to is rock. Soundgarden, Led Zeppelin, STP, Foo Fighters...etc. However, I have to admit I like this album. I bought it solely for Since U Been Gone (the U instead of You makes me cringe.) It was catchy. I couldn't help it. But after actually listening through the entire disc...I must say it's pretty good...for pop-tart tunes. Sometimes ya just need something to carelessly sing along with in your car. This is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A star!!!!!!!","review":"Kelly Clarkson is a star.

I never get tired of hearing it.Every song is a hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superstar","review":"Kelly is the best thing to come out of American Idol! She takes a big brave career step with this album. She shows a new rock style and she really shines as a performer. She changed her style from the big ballads and this is the true Kelly Clarkson. We can expect great things from her in the future!Some of the great songs are 'Since U Been Gone,' 'Breakaway,' 'Behind These Hazel Eyes,' 'Because of You' and 'You Found Me.' This CD will launch her into superstardom...Kelly Rocks!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definite Winner","review":"If you didn't believe that Kelly Clarkson should have won American Idol - this album should change your mind. The songs that were on the radio - Breakaway and Since U Been Gone - are good but so are all the others. I would recommend this CD to any pop or semi-rock fan. She's got a good voice and songs with an edge. I've listened to it on repeat three times now."},{"rating":"2","title":"True American Idol","review":"Kelly Clarkson, The 1st winner of American Idol.With her superb voice, this album was amazing. All the songs in this album were great. The first time I saw the cover of this CD, I tought it was a Christmas Album but it wasn't. Just the cover like Christmas Album. 'Since U Been Gone' was no 1 on the chart in Malaysia and I think this is one of the best album for 2004. Well done.1. Breakaway 5/52. Since U Been Gone 5/53. Behind These Hazel Eyes 4/54.

Beautiful Disaster [Live] 4/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Angry? Yes! But still a great CD","review":"I have to admit that I am a huge Kelly Clarkson fan. I bought this CD out of loyalty and the pretense that it had to be fabulous. When I listened to it the first time, I was a little disappointed that Kelly had nothing to sing about but the anguish of life's disappointments. (I am hopeful that she isn't as crushed and angry as her vocals tell us.)Upon the second time through, I found her to be expressive and assertive. This is a great CD if you can look past the anger and enjoy someone who is finding her way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good job Kelly","review":"Breakaway is a pretty nice mixture of a popish/rockish sord of sound with Kelly's unique voice. I think that she does a great job of making the songs her own. Outline songs are \\"Where is your heart\\", \\"Breakaway\\", \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" and \\"Since U been gone\\". The songs don't really stick with you that's my only criticism, but it's definately a winning album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!!","review":"I knew before I bought it that this album went in a different direction than Kelly's first one. Knowing how great she sings, I was sure that I would like it anyway. Well, I was wrong. I love it!!!I hope Kelly gains new fans with this album. There are already about 4 or 5 songs on it that I love to listen to over and over. \\"Because of You\\" is my favorite, followed closely by \\"You Found Me\\".This is a really different sound for Kelly, but she sounds great and the songs are really good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"A real good album. I can see that Kelly has grown up and has good people around her, helping her lose the pop music tag. She can actually rock out! I am impressed with this. If you are looking for something to sing in the car with, this is it. Not offensive, not bound to win awards, but good music you will be humming to."},{"rating":"2","title":"More enjoyable than I'd like to admit","review":"It wasn't easy for me to admit to enjoying this CD, since I always thought only female fans would admit to being Kelly Clarkson fans. But, she has enough good tunes on this CD for me to actually listen to it without feeling embarassed. \\"Breakaway\\" and \\"Since You've Been Gone\\" are popular hits that all Kelly fans enjoy, and \\"Behind Those Hazel Eyes\\" is another popular hit that you would have heard if you've turned on a radio within the past decade. But, surprisingly, I found her ballad, \\"Because Of You\\" my favorite on this CD. Her hit, \\"A Moment Like This\\", from her previous album seemed too commercialized and overplayed, so I was quite surprised at how often I chose to listen to \\"Because Of You\\". I'm not quite into the other songs on this album, but I find that if you can enjoy at least 4 songs on a CD, it's worth buying to keep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.. an amazing CD","review":"I absolutely love this CD. I was a big fan of Kelly's from the first time I watched her on AI, and I really loved \\"Thankful\\", but this CD blows her debut out of the water. Every song is immensely listenable without being poppy or cheesy. My personal favorite is Track 6, \\"Addicted\\". I'm hoping she releases this one as a single. I would definitely reccomend anyone who is a fan of hers to buy the CD, and anyone who is wary that it will be a typical pop CD, give it a try because I'm sure you'll be pleased"},{"rating":"2","title":"KELLY IS A LEGEND IN THE MAKING!","review":"You will definitely not be disappointed when you hear this edgy, hardrock album. She has changed since her debut album, but it was definitely a good change.The best three songs in my opinion are:Behind These Hazel Eyes, Because Of You, and Addicted.If you want an album that everyone can relate to lyrically. This is the album for you.YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED! GET IT TODAY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Solid","review":"This is a very solid effort. First of all, to the person who said Avril Lavigne is a superior musician, are you joking? Avril Lavigne doesn't have half the voice and can barely strum a guitar. I'm in fact a fan of hers, but there's no comparing the two. Kelly's voice on this album is as good as ever and you find her personality shining through much more often. I wouldn't say all the songs are great, but you'd be hard pressed to find too many albums recently without a little filler. Overall the CD is great. Also, the live version of \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" is excellent and a smart addition to the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Before I bought this CD, I heard that it was a lot more rock than anything from her before. I was worried that the stunning ballads that she is famous for would be missing from this album. However, I was definitely not disappointed. The song \\"Because of You\\" has to be the saddest and most poignant song I've ever heard. \\"Where is Your Heart\\" is another stand-out ballad from this album, and the live version of \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" is nothing short of incredible.Kelly's vocals on this album are amazing. Her voice has definitely grown a lot since \\"Thankful.\\" Her range is just exquisite, and she sings with such passion that the mood of the song conforms under her voice.Buy this CD, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly rocks the biz","review":"The original American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson's debut album Thankful was a mix of happy-sounding light pop/rock, but her sophomore effort Breakaway is a tremendous step forward from that. Her belty chops are still clear as a bell and she lets them roar on tunes like the shouter \\"Since U Been Gone\\" and \\"Gone,\\" both possible chart-toppers in their own right (first hit and title track has already hit No. 1 on several charts). Miss Clarkson isn't just another artist in the music business pool, she's swimming laps and taking her stand in today's market. Good job, Kelly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the good voice","review":"If you liked her voice in the past, you won't really find much of it in this CD. If you like loud, screaming, yelling, rock wannebe, you will enjoy it. If you want to hear good singing, a pretty voice, good control and music, you won't find too much of it here. An occasional song is OK, but most sound the same, low, high scream, low, high, yell."},{"rating":"2","title":"very listenable CD","review":"Living in Europe the past six years, I've only had brief exposure to American Idol during visits back to my home in Ann Arbor. I first heard Kelly Clarkson on the radio and decided to look her up online. I bought her CD online. Its found its way into my rotation. I like just about every song on the CD. Unlike many CDs where you occassionally feel compelled to skip a track or two, Breakaway doesn't have any such songs.So what if she's 'manufactured' as some critics claim. Just because she didn't write the songs or play all the instruments, doesn't mean that she has no talent. Someone still has to sing the songs! She obviously has a lot of talent or she wouldn't have won Idol."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CD","review":"THIS IS THE BEST CD of Kelly's in my opinion!!!! she ROX!!! i <3 her song Since You Been Gone!!! it's SO good!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"From The Moment I Heard.....","review":"Breakaway the first song on the CD. I knew that i was in for an experience with this CD. Kelly comes full circle on her 2nd CD. I loved her first one also. But this one is more edgy into the Pop-Rock genre. I like the feeling in her songs. She has so much confidence and talent (obviously). Its also great to see her writing songs on this CD as well.I'm so glad that i picked up this CD. I'm looking forward to hearing a lot more from Kelly. She is totally Independent and doing her own thing on this CD.Much respect Kelly you've earned.

She is so sexy and has an amazing voice! I went to her concert and she sounded even better then off the record! Every song she delivers crisp, clear, smooth and sexy! I won't bother rating this album because all the songs are ten out of tens!!! If you think Kelly Clarkson's voice sucks then you don't know talent! I mean \\"Breakaway\\" is a multi-platinum 2 time Grammy Winner with 6 radio hit singles! So whoever hasn't bough this CD and loves music, I highly recommend this one!!! And for the record she wrote six of the songs off this record!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed.","review":"The only good song on this CD is Breakaway. The rest of it is yuck.

The ballads and the new guitar stuff is just incredibly the best that I've heard in a long time! This really proves that AI works for those singers.

GREAT JOB KC!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poser!!","review":"I just want to start by saying I wish I could give this album no stars, because that's what it deserves. All the reviews saying she's going to be a genuine music star... well so was britney spears. This has NOTHING to do with talent in today's music industry. Kelly Clarkson is not a rocker, her music cannot be called rock/pop, and it cannot be differentiated from \\"bubblegum pop.\\" She is actually the definition of manufactured pop. Kelly Clarkson is not artisitcally credible, as many people in their reviews are claiming. If you want real rock and roll, try Kings of Leon, Kasabian, Sam Roberts, or basically anything not from American Idol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did Kelly go?","review":"I absolutely loved Kelly's first CD Thankful but Breakaway sounds just like Avril.

In fact, I've started referring to Kelly Clarkson as \\"Baggy McBags\\" or \\"bags,\\" for short.Maybe this album should've been entitled, \\"I'm a bag lady that lives under the highway overpass.\\" If that was too long, how about just \\"baglady.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"avril wrote the lyrics","review":"How can you compare avril lavigne to k*lly cl*rkson. avril can play the guitar,piano drums and writes her owbn lyrics. and she even wrote this song,the lyrics are even coming from avril lavigne. how sad people can bep.s i gave it two stars for avril lavignes lyricsgreenday rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ARE YOU All INSANE!","review":"This is a horrible album. kelly clarkson is totally unbelieveable as a rock star. she makes avril lavigne look credible! she is very chubby and not very attractive yet i see all these glowing reviws! shame on you all! dont recommend this terrible album to others, its just not right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is simply the worst ever !!!!!!!","review":"Looks like another one bites the dust.

Every song is \\"radio worthy\\". I think you will love to hear the songs you have heard over played on the radio, but \\"Addicted\\", \\"Gone\\", and \\"Walk Away\\" are just as good. Buy this album, Kelly Clarkson fan or not and it will be money well spent. You will listen to this great album over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly's Best Hits","review":"A few days ago, my parents, my sister and I went on a trip to our Beach House in Delaware. Being from Maryland, it takes about 2 hours to get there, and I decided to listen to my new CD that I recieved on Christmas, \\"Breakaway.\\" At first I was very dissapointed and realized that \\"Breakaway\\" was the only hit. I agree with past reviwers, she does sound much like Avril on this CD. As I was coming home from the beach, I realized there was nothing to do but listen to the CD again. I started hearing the beats of \\"Because of You\\", \\"Behind these Hazel Eyes\\", \\"Addicted\\", \\"Gone\\", \\"Where is your heart\\", \\"Since U Been Gone\\", \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" and more. The more I listened, the more the music started to grow on me. I started to LOVE it! My favorite songs are \\"Where is your heart\\" and \\"Beautiful Disaster\\", 2 beautiful songs that Kelly really does a good job on. All songs are wonderful, though! 5 STARS FOR THIS CD! Pick up a copy immediatly...you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best solo albums for a year!!","review":"When you like the combination pop and rock this is the album you need!!

What I appreciated so much about Kelly Clarkson was her distinct sound that set her apart from the average singer on the radio. She had her own style. What she' done on this album is try to sound like Avril Lavigne, yuk! In my opinion, Kelly went from attracting a 20-30 something audience, with her awesome, strong voice, to strictly teeny-boppers, who are the only ones who could possibly enjoy this cd. Even my husband hated most of it, and asked \\"is she trying to be Britney Spears\\"? on one of the tracks. I kinda like \\"Breakaway\\", but find the power-ballad after power-ballad annoying. And most of the time, the music drowns her out anyway. The highlight, and best song on the cd is the live version of \\"Beautiful Disaster\\", from her previous album. I hope this is just a phase. Bring back the soulful, songbird we all love."},{"rating":"1","title":"overplayed","review":"one word for this album: overplayed...if you still like these songs after the billionth time on the radio than download it!!

The only song worth listening to on this album is Beautiful Disaster...showcases her talent. The rest sounds like the same song..different title. No originality. Sounds like she just threw some songs together. She is losing direction with her career. Use your beautiful voice and you will remain on top...continue with this venue and you will be a talent of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Kelly I voted for!","review":"I love Kelly's voice but there are problems with this CD. She sold out! Just to get some stupid airplay! The radio stopped pushing her new releases such as Low and The Trouble with Love Is so Kelly made an album that Avril or Ashlee or Britney could do. I don't care for Since You Been Gone or the video! Pure trashy Kelly! I believed Kelly when she said she wouldn't wear clothes like that! Lies just to try to fit in. Well she lost me as a fan unless she goes back to better material. Please, Kelly, go back to your sweet self, not trash. I am devastated."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a drugged out tramp","review":"Blue Racer: Kelly Clarkson is a redneck who can't sing. Japanese Beetle: Serpent son, American Idols are all terrible.

They're barely fast or let the guitarist show what they got! But this album has got to be the worst pop album in the world! It's completely boring, she doesn'y have the hype and the media only shows the good songs! (Not that i like those songs) And when she ever gonna make a new album?! This album is like 3 years ago! She hasn't even started! DON'T GET THIS!! Consider this your warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I leave a \\"minus\\" star rating????","review":"To put it kindly, Kelly Clarkson sucks!

She (Clarkson) should go back to McDonald's, or KFC, or anywhere there ISN'T a microphone!!!! SHE STINKS!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So satisfying to the soul","review":"This album just rocks! Kelly's voice is unbeatable, and the lyrics and melodies on this album are such raw emotion, you listen to them over and over again. She embraces the pain and pushes through it on every track. Just fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I just can't...Breakaway","review":"To everyone who says that this album is rubbish and crap i would like to ask you a simple question. Can you do it better? In her genre (Pop/Rock) Kelly Clarkson is one of the best. In a Genre filled with whiney boys with guitars(Ryan Cabrera, Jason Mraz, ect.) Kelly stands out with lyrics that almost everyone can relate to and a voice that no one can deny is stronger than many of the girl singers out the today. Now, while some of the songs on the album are very forgettable many are suburb like..BreakawaySince You Been GoneBehind These Hazel EyesBecause of YouGoneYou Found MeI Hate Myself for Losing YouBeautiful Disaster (Live)P.S. to those who dissed on Kelly for her VMA Preformance, If it sucked soo badly why did you watch it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Idol Star To Date","review":"This album is simply the best! It showcases the great depth, range, and versatility of Kelly's voice within a very diverse menu of songs!! She is a shining star with a velvet voice. Kerry Underwood may eventually out-sell Kelly in total record sales and she is a wonderful talent as well, but Kelly is the bomb! Kerry should probably stick with country, where as Kelly can sing virtually every form of music out there! I'd love to see her record an R&B album and sing it live on tour!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great CD","review":"I strongly recommend this CD. Kelly's voice is better than ever. I agree that certain songs sound similar to those from Avril Lavigne, but the big difference is Kelly's voice. I don't think Avril Lavigne can pull \\"Because of you\\" off. Do you?. Only Kelly with her voice. Don't get me wrong, I think Avril Lavigne and Alanis Morissette are really talented and I like many of their songs, but I think Kelly, with her powerful voice surpassed them both. And as many of you pointed out before, this is one of those CDs where you don't skip any track. Amazing, amazing, amazing vocals. Love \\"Behind these hazel eyes\\", \\"since you were gone\\", \\"where is your heart\\", \\"beautiful disaster\\", but my favorite, the one I listen to over and over is \\"Because of you\\". If you have $14.00 to spend in music, spend them in this CD. You won't regret it. Love y'all"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"On her sophmore album, Kelly proves that the first idol is still the best. It's hard not to love this album. The live version of Beautiful Disaster is amazing. The best songs are definately Since U Been Gone, Behind These Hazel Eyes, and Walk Away. The only bad song is \\"I hate myself for losing you\\", in which she tries a bit too hard to sound angry. But trust me, everyone should own this CD. I highly recomend this, and Kelly's first album Thankful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely recommend!","review":"I was never a Kelly fan but when I heard the songs in this album, I liked it! I like almost all of the songs which is really good because usually when I buy an album of some singer, I end up liking only like 2-3 songs in it. >.< This one though is totally the opposite. I like all the songs except for maybe 1 or 2. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular Voice","review":"I'm not an American Idol fan. I had heard the bland \\"A Moment Like This\\" single, as well as the vaguely fiesty \\"Miss Independent\\", and thought Ms. Clarkson was a talented singer being given uninspired material.So when I heard \\"Since You've Been Gone\\", I was surprised to find myself intrigued, and then shocked when I found myself absolutely smitten with the rest of the \\"Breakaway\\" album. The songs on \\"Breakaway\\" are catchy and surprisingly captivating, and the production is rock-oriented and fairly sparse, making sure the focus on every song is Kelly's spectacular voice. Damn, can this girl sing.There's nothing wrong with pop music if it's well written, well produced and well performed, which is definitely the case here. Kelly has one of the best voices I've ever heard, and as long as her material continues to live up to it, I'll be happy to keep listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job Kelly!!!!","review":"Kelly Clarkson's new cd Breakaway is a breakaway from her first cd. It is a wonderful cd to listen to. It is in my cd player in my vehicle and has not come out since I got it. I just can't get enough of it. I love Behind These Hazel Eyes and Gone. Hope these become singles. Walk Away is a fun song to listen to. Makes you want to get up and dance. Love the new stuff Kelly.Thanks, Blaine"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good vocals, good cd","review":"Kelly is a good singer, it's nice to actually see a female singer who can actually sing and don't have to worry about stripping in order to make it. Ppl are praising Kelly for writing which is great but her hits are done by the same guy who writes for THE BACKSTREET BOYs, but that doesn't matter it's not important to me wether or not a SINGER writes if they have a good voice... which Kelly definitly has...I can't wait to see what she does with her next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Grammy panel is inconsiderate--this CD rocks","review":"No matter what the ignorant Grammy nomination panel says or doesn't say (I own Mariah's new record too and it's quite boring save for a couple tracks--I honestly didn't see how \\"We Belong Together\\" stayed at No. 1 for so many weeks), Kelly Clarkson is a rare talent and on the sterling Breakaway she proved her musical prowerness. Every single from this album has topped No. 1 and save for what I consider tepid \\"Because of You\\" they're all been irresistible, especially \\"Since U Been Gone\\" which should've grabbed a Grammy nod for Record of the Year (Breakaway also should've been garnered the Album of the Year nod--honestly, Gwen Stefani??? C'mon folks). This album is perfect, folks...sure, \\"Because of You\\" is mediocre and \\"Where Is Your Heart\\" sounds too much like something Elton John'd write, but the remaining songs make the album worth gettting. This is terrific, period, no matter how ignorant Grammy folks can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"ADDICTING","review":"BREAKAWAY is quite possibly one of the best Pop albums ever made. A good album is one that contains a couple of awesome tracks you heard on the radio. A GREAT album is one that you want to listen to from start to finish. BREAKAWAY definitely qualifies as the latter. Every song on this album could potentially be a hit single. Every song on this album has an edge to it. There is a reason why Kelly Clarkson is the one AMERICAN IDOL contestant that will see longevity in her career: She has the talent AND the star quality to back it up. Highlights include: SINCE U BEEN GONE, BEHIND THESE HAZEL EYES, BECAUSE OF YOU, ADDICTED, and HEAR ME."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly is oh-so-awesome!","review":"I was blown away the minute I pop this CD in my car. I couldn't believe how her voice just got better and better everytime she has a CD out! I watched her on American Idol 1 and was sure that she was going to win. I love Clarkson's debut CD. This is a great follow up. For those of you who like the mellow songs on her first CD, you might find it hard at first to listen to her 'new' style. But the more you listen to it, you'll love it more. I can guarantee this! That's what happened to me! :)Kelly Clarkson's voice is great for any genre of music, even rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breakaway from the Old.... Embrace the New....","review":"Having purchased her last album, I had no idea whatsoever as to what to expect from her sophomore album. Her last cd was very pop... and, sadly, it had but a few good songs. I was cautious to buy this album, but after hearing \\"Breakaway\\" and \\"Since U Been Gone\\", I knew there had to be something different. I was right... this album is just as the title suggests. She broke away from her old style and its restrictions and has directed her music to a more rock, hard-driven pop style. I am so pleased with this cd that it almost seems necessary to leave it in my cd player. If any listener liked her first two singles, he/she will love what remains on this album.The memorable, the great, and the masterpieces...1. Breakaway2. Since U Been Gone3. Behind These Hazel Eyes4. Because of You5. Gone6. Addicted7. Where Is Your Heart8. Walk Away9. You Found Me10.

Almost the entire album are songs about her lost loves, and it gets extremely boring, very quickly. She's not bringing anything new and edgy to the table. This will probably be the end of her career."},{"rating":"1","title":"........","review":"Kelly Clarkson is not rock. Don't let anyone tell you different. Just because her brand of pop features the occasional guitar riff doesn't make it rock. Shame on all you who said she sang rock. You make it sound like you think Avril Lavign is punk or something. I'm giving you all the benefit of the doubt there, even though there's a good chance that her hardcore lyrics (Sk8r boi? I'm sorry, but the punk music I listen to can spell), grinding guitars, and awesomely punk fashion attire may have tricked you. Now, back to the idol in point...Kelly Clarkson loses major points for not writing her own music, as well as major points for singing terribly boring, unoriginal music. In fact, she has no points at all. If you're looking for good, actual rock fronted by a female, check out Tsunami Bomb or the Soviettes..."},{"rating":"1","title":"DeanoDeano is NOT from 'Manchester'","review":"Just to point out that DeanoDeano has nothing to do with 'Manchester' (a grimy city in the Midlands of England) but is in actual fact a writer/producer who hails from Hilversum in the Netherlands.DeanoDeano of course attracts immitators - BE WARNED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It must be easy being Kelly Clarkson.","review":"Kelly Clarkson wrote just four songs on this CD. It is apparent to me that she has little or no musical talent whatsoever, and is therefore forced to rely on other people to write her songs for her. If Kelly Clarkson wants to sing other peoples' songs, she should stay in a karaoke bar, instead of taking credit for the songs and making money off it. I remember when artists were encouraged to write their own music, but unfortunately that memory is fading too rapidly. Ms. Clarkson should stop masquerading as a musician and step aside for real ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clarkson truly shows her Superstar status","review":"Over the past two and a half years Kelly Clarkson has grown into one of the most talented, recognizable stars of the music industry. Her newest effort, Breakway, continues to prove to even the harshest of critics that she is the real deal. Tracks such as Addicted and Behind These Hazel Eyes show her versitality as an artist while safer songs such as Breakaway and You Found me, showcase the beautiful voice that got here in the first place. If you're not convinced already that Clarkson is here to stay, buy this sophomore effort and you'll be converted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly Clarkson is hear to stay!","review":"In 2002 Kelly Clarkson became the first American Idol. Then in 2003, she released her debut \\"Thankful\\" which was a good debut album but, now Kelly is back with her new album \\"Breakaway\\" which is one of the best albums of the year. This album has many great songs such as \\"Since U Been Gone\\", \\"Behind These Hazel Eyes\\", and \\"Addicted\\". Overall definetly worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a Claymate, but I love Kelly too!","review":"This is a great cd! I love almost every song on here. It fits with today's music that's currently being played on the radio. Breakaway and Since You Been Gone are already big hits. I think every song on here should be a hit for her. Kelly shows her rockier side on this one and she's great at it. I had the pleasure of seeing her perform live in Davenport, IA, and I was so impressed. She was awesome. She's got a great voice. This cd is so worth it. If Clay's 3rd cd is anything like this, it too would be a hit. Go Kelly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most incredilbe album everrrrr","review":"Go Kelly!

While there is an influence of Avril Lavign and Pink in this CD, it's still a great performance. The inspiring title Track, Breakaway is fun and fanciful, yet has a great message. There are at least 4 songs I love on this CD (which is a must if I am going to purchase it). Kelly's voice is strong and raspy with a lot of emotion behind it. Not overdone. Fresh and beautiful. The only song I thought was a little campy and seemed like it was only done to get airplay was \\"Because of You.\\" Not my favorite and it not only sounded, but looked in the video release like a bad rendition of Pink. Other than that, she deserved the Grammy's she received and this is well worth the listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOO GOOD!","review":"I GOT THIS FOR MY THREE YEAR OLD SINCE SHE GETS HER LUNGS GOING EVERY TIME SHE HEARS \\"SINCE YOU BEEN GONE\\" ON THE RADIO.THIS ALBUM IS ENJOYABLE ALL THE WAY TO THE END ,WE LOVE IT, THERE IS NOT A DULL MOMENT OR A JUST 'OK' SONG IN THIS CD.GET IT NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can listen to it over and over","review":"This album is awesome.

You'll love almost every song on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly breaks loose!","review":"I am a big fan of american idol, however there are few contestants on the show who have what it takes to be in the business for years to come and Kelly is one of those people. Break away is an album where kelly took a few more risks to break the TV idol away from her. She wanted to become her own singer and not the winner of a TV talent show and boy does she do that with this album. The highlights of this album are \\"Breakaway, since you've been gone, Behind these Hazel eyes, Because of you and the live version of Disaster\\" from her first album. This album is more rock oriented, but still has its pop elements and should still please the fans from AI. There are a few spots in the CD where she strains her voice a little, but the cd overall is still a big success and she will be around for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ratings for Breakaway C.d.","review":"Here are my ratings:Breakaway 8/10Since you been gone 10/10Behind these hazel eyes 9/10Because of you 7/10gone 10/10 addicted 8/10where is your heart 7/10walk away 10/10you found me 10/10i hate myself for losing you 9/10hear me 8/10beautiful disaster 6/10Buy this C.D.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Wow, that is my first reaction to this album...Kelly really breaks out of the American Idol mold, she truly does \\"Breakaway.\\" Her first singles \\"Breakaway\\" and \\"Since U Been Gone\\" really showcase her amazing voice. \\"Since U Been Gone\\" is lightyears ahead of her first single, \\"Miss Independent.\\"Unlike her first album, \\"Thankful\\", \\"Breakaway\\" is strong from beginning to end. The only minor let down is \\"Addicted\\". Her vocals are slightly strained, the song is average, but the strength of the album truly makes up for it.Absolutely superb. Because of the statement that \\"Breakaway\\" makes, Kelly should have a long career ahead of her."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"i am not the biggest kelly fan but even i have to admit that this cd is pretty good. i like songs 1-7 and usually cut the cd off after that b/c the last few are not my favorites. its a fun cd that has some great dance tracks but also some really good ballads. and more than anything it shows that this girl can really sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious. Kelly is a rare talent among today's stars.","review":"For fans of American Idol and Kelly alike, this is definatly a great achievement. It's packed with songs by great producers, great songwriters and lead by Kelly's gorgeous and husky voice.I love how the album feels like a young woman's diary, filled with pain, pleasure and touch of cynicism that feels just right. \\"Breakaway\\" is one of the best pop songs I have heard in awhile; it's inpsiring and lovely without being too cliche or sappy. The album procedes with powerful ballads and catchy Rock-sounding songs.\\"Because Of You\\" is probably the best number and a truly great song, and everything else is pretty fantastic as well, like the classy girl-empowerment hit \\"Walk Away\\".The best thing about the CD is that Kelly is such a purely talented, respectable artist, that you end up liking her as well as the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"How sad can our generation be?","review":"This is studio manufactured crap that streams over the comercial radio air waves on a day to day basis, the artist is just a name and face on the record nothing more.

Avril is pathetic... you need NOT follow her footsteps. I still love you no matter what, but stick with a formula that would work for you.

I was disappointed with her 1rst cd but this is even worse. This music is so awful it gets on my nerves. It's such a shame to waste a voice as great as hers on this material. I hope her career does not continue in this direction. I hope she will soon record music that is worth listening to. With her great voice there is so much she could record. Maybe a blues cd or a cd of remakes or even a gospel cd. I would love to hear her voice on gospel music. Almost anything would be better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what?","review":"Alright, I think that kelly Clarkson is just turning- or trying - to turn into Avril Lavenge which she will never acomplish because Avril is an awesome musician who actually plays along while she sings.

Yeah, If you are a super pop fan then go ahead but I think its a rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Future elevator music","review":"This bottom fed garbage will be the MUZAK you listen to when you're in your 30's and go to the grocery store."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAY BETTER THAN THE DEBUT!!!!!!

If you haven't heard of Kelly Clarkson, then that's a different story. BREAKAWAY, her follow up 12-track studio album is reminiscent to the unique Avril sounds. Kelly Clarkson blows you away with sungs such as Behind These hazel Eyes, Addicted, Where Is Your Heart, Walk Away, and Hear Me. There is also a live track of Beautiful Disaster, which was a song on THANKFUL. This CD is exceptionaly good and I highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...Just...Wow!","review":"I wonder how we all went so long without hearing music like Kelly Clarkson sings it. I have never heard another artist sing with so much emotion. Plus, the girl wrote half of the CD. I actually own 3 copies of this CD...one for my house, Car, and Job. If you have never heard it...why? Kelly has amazing range, she's very soulful and, at the same time, pure pop-rock.:) Every song is a hit. My personal favs. are Addicted; Hear Me; and Because of You. Since U Been Gone and Breakaway are also great. And to top it all off, she has a live version of Beautiful Disaster that just kicks [...] on the original. If you really like this album, check out the Breakaway Limited Edition album with the SUBG and BTHE remixes, plus all the live songs. BUY THIS ALBUM, IT's A MUST!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing","review":"Kelly Clarkson has one of the most powerful vocals you will ever get to here.

Certainly the best CD I've heard this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy Breakaway, ignore shallow reviews!","review":"I find that people who compare Kelly to Avril are extremely shallow. Although at first glance Kelly appears to have sold out and taken the punk, angst-filled \\"So much for my happy ending\\" route, a second look at Breakaway shows that it caters to a much different audience. The lyrics are stronger, more mature, and Kelly's emotion is relly felt throughout all her songs, while Avril simply belts out her songs in the same \\"I love you, you hate me\\" monotone.To truly appreciate Kelly's sophmore album, one really has to listen to Breakaway with an open mind. Kelly is a true superstar, as she constantly reinvents herself as a singer, trying different styles of music, with a status that Avril will never reach with her teenage, angsty songs that people will soon tire of.On a final note, I can't wait for Kelly's next album. If it's as good as Breakaway, then Kelly is headed straight for the stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly just keeps getting better and better!","review":"I am a huge Kelly fan and love her first cd Thankful but Breakaway is just amazing! I bought it the morning it was released and haven't stopped listening to it since. The cd completely blows me away. I was affraid that her new cd wouldn't have any ballads on it. I was wrong she delivers with"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice surprise","review":"Lets get this straight first up, I don't normally listen to top 40 pop music, my faves include Bloc Party, The Smiths and Radiohead, but I was pleasantly surprised by this album.The first thing you notice is Kelly's powerful voice, by far and away the best idol singer anywhere and it's a wonder it took this long to sign her through a talent show !!On to the songs, standouts here are the pretty because of you and the big since you've been gone, which Kelly puts a lot of sex into and turns into a great song.Lots of radio friendly stuff here will ensure this is a big hit but those with the will to try something out of the alternative square box they live in will be pleasantly surprised"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...It's just there...","review":"Kelly Clarkson's first CD was definately much better then this one. This one sounds as if she's trying to copy Avril Lavigne. And I personally don't think her voice is suited for this style of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good!!!!! I love her voice","review":"She has anice low, and comforting voice, she is a very good singer.. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The one true american idol.","review":"The first season of american idol was definetly classic T.V. and when Kelly won it was very moving, unfortunatly the following season delivered a bunch of poor quality idols Reuben and Fantasia, talented but without spark and Clay, words can not describe how lame and bland he is. Kelly on the other hand has it all, talent, charm and beauty. Breakaway is a step in the right direction for Kelly. A pleasant mix of radio friendly pop/rock that is accesible to listeners of all ages. EP"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vocals are amazing while music may lack","review":"After listening to a few tracks, I got the feeling of \\"mainstream pop artist\\", with a combination of \\"child pop star\\". But what the music itself lacks, her vocals more than make up for. Her vocals have come a long way and improved greatly even though the choice of song styles have taken a backseat. So while the songs may not grab your attention, her impressive vocals are what makes this sophomore album work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only bought this because she won Idol","review":"I had to buy the CD after she won American Idol. I've never really become a very big fan. She's basically a pretty face, but not that talented afterall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Surprising!","review":"CD: BreakawayArtist: Kelly ClarksonComments: This CD is very well recorded, all the songs are very catchy, and lyrically well put together. I gave this project 4 stars only because a lot of the songs sound kind of similar, and with her amazing talent, I wanted to see her try lots of new things. Her vocals, though, are outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top shelf please.....","review":"I am so glad she decided to do her own thing with this album. This cd is original, refreshing, and will become a favorite very quickly. Since she wrote most of the music, you can tell that it really fits her personality and voice much better then Thankful did. The music has more of a rock edge to it that I love. I can't wait to see what she comes out with next."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is pretty good!","review":"I totally took a gamble on this one, I didn't really like 'Breakaway' but I heard \\"Since U been gone\\" on TRL and decided I wanted the album.For those of you who, like me, were totally turned off by 'Miss Independent', this CD has nothing like that on it. It's not bubble gummy, so sticky you just don't like it.These songs are rocker chick, definitely like Avril Lavinge's style, but with Kelly's voice, which makes for a cool combination. Something to play when the boyfriend has made you mad, AGAIN. It's great. My favorites are \\"Since U been gone\\" a real rock out song about all the things one CAN do without a bf lol, and \\"Behind these Hazel Eyes\\" another not-so-soft tune about having pride in not letting him see you cry.This CD is great and I recommend it or any girl who wants a little \\"Girl Power\\" in her collection! :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Many Great Releases","review":"This album, is a masterpiece. I can't stress that enough. It ranks with one of the best releases. It ranks #2 on my list, as number one goes to the King of Pop himself, Michael Jackson, for his new amazing boxset- Michael Jackson The Ultimate Collection.However, this deserves some attention. Since You've Been Gone, is the second single, which dislays Kelly's amazing, and wide vocal range and talent. Breakaway, is so catchy, and I can't name anyone who doesn't like it.Buy it, its worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is a great CD. She has one of the best voices in the industry at the current time, and I would not be surprised if Miss. Clarkson got nominated for a couple Grammy's at the 2006 ceremony. The highlights include: Because of You, Addicted, Gone, Breakaway, Since U Been Gone, Behind These Hazel Eyes, and Hear Me. An impressive sophomore album from this rising star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly Does It Again - OUTSTANDING!!!","review":"What else is there to say but AWESOME!! This CD is just outstanding.

Way to go Kelly, you should get a Grammy for this album!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love this Cd it is so great! Kelly Clarkson totally rocks! She sounds a little like Avril Lavigne sometimes, but I like Avril Lavigne too. I think it was a good idea to put a Live Song on the Cd, so now people can hear that she can really sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly Clarkson Has Done It Yet Again","review":"This time Kelly has out done herself. With her great slow songs that really get you thinking about your surronding to her up beat rock songs that make you think of how life has been without that guy in your life. Kelly Clarkson is still number one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She breaks the way !!","review":"This is one of the greatest cd I've ever buied !! Kelly has this amazing voice ! This cd cant annoyed you! I listen to it over and over !! Everysong will be a huge hits and it will beat record chart ! So good ! Its a must have for everyone !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly's NEW Album is no joke...","review":"Hey What's Up Everyone Kelly's NEW Album is no joke... It has to be one of the best albums ever by either any Idol contestants or an pop artist... the album is great from the awesome ballad \\"Because of You\\" to the catchy and very rock \\" Behind The Hazel Eyes\\". Every single song is great, this is actually one of those albums that you wouldn't want to skip any songs but just here every song from 1 to 12... So If I have any suggestions for you is to buy this album go to her shows, watch her on TV and support Our girl and one of the best singers ever .....MS KELLY CLARKSON ! ! !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fabulous Follow-Up.","review":"This is the best album by any american idol contestant by a mile. Though I'm not a fan of rock music (I personally can't stand Avirl Lavigne), I have to give Kelly her props when they're due. Breakaway is an absolutely fantastic album.Kelly gets to sing about whatever she wants this time around, and the material is definitely more mature now. The powerhouse vocals are still there ; but she chooses to sing rock inspired songs instead of the cheesy teen pop she sang on the first album.There really are no flaws on this CD. You can listen to it from beginning to end, non-stop (i choose not to). IMO, the best tracks are: \\"Since U Been Gone\\" ; \\"Addicted\\" ; \\"Walk Away\\" ; and \\"Hear Me\\". Personally, I think \\"Breakaway\\" is one of the weaker songs on the CD - and I would have bought the album much sooner had one of the other songs been a first single.All in All ; Kelly does a great job. This will be a tough act to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly Clarkson Rocks My Sox","review":"Man MAn MAN! Kelly Clarkson is the BBBEEESSSTTT Singer in the WORLD no UNIVERSE no WHATEVER IS BIGGER THAN THE UNIVERSE, THE BIGGEST THING IN THE WHOLE WIDE UNIVERSE!

Breakaway is what you've done!Kelly if you read this, have you considered a duet with Michael Buble? You two would make beautiful music. Like you he has taken it to the next level. Breakaway is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breakway Better Than I Thought","review":"I would not have foreseen this album to be good, but it is.The lyrics pull Clarkson well outside the teenie boppie realm and her voice is perhaps the only one in the industry today that could land the notes demanded by the songs.Tracks to take notice of: Because of You, Breakaway, and Hear Me. The live version of Beautiful Disaster is worth at least one listen. I liked Behind These Hazel Eyes when it first received air play, but by the time I got this album, I had already tired of it.My only bone to pick is the simulated rock beats. Pop music diverges into two roads: lukewarm imitations of hip hop or brazen mockeries of rock and roll. If the singer can dance, then hip hop it is. If the singer cannot, then rock. A few of the tracks have the propensity of sending out a synthetic vibe. Listen to this album from beginning to end and you'll know right away what I mean.All in all, bravo."},{"rating":"1","title":"unremarkable album","review":"There is nothing to make this album stand out from the other \\"female rocker wannabees\\". Her voice is pleasant enough but the lyrics are very lame at times and she lacks the emotion and rawness of true rock artists. I am rather stunned with the glowing reviews as I see her voice more suited for other styles of music. I love rock but I find this album very \\"unremarkable\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"kelly sucks as an avril wannabe","review":"OMG! i hate this new album. all this pop rock crap! don't we have enough avrils,ashlees, and hillary's funking up the radio airwaves. i thought kelly was gonna stick to the manufactured yet enjoyabe pop/r&b stuff on her first album instead now she's pretending to be a rock star and she is horrible at it. if this idol wants to have a #1 album again she better drop the rock crap and get back to doing the pop we know and love!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good singles, the rest? not so much","review":"All i can say is that i'm glad i listened to the album BEFORE i bought. Since U been gone, behind these hazel eyes and breakaway are all great pop songs. The rest of the album seems to go downhill from there. it just isn't as catchy as those three songs. I'm such a sucker for pop-rock music, but mz. clarkson really misses the mark on this one. Download: Since u been gone and behind these hazel eyes if you want the TWO best tracks on this CD. The rest are pretty interchangeable (omit breakaway, which isn't pop-rock, but more pop-ballad). Hopefully kelly will be able to give us a more solid release on album # 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 good song that's all!!","review":"Because of U is pretty good, rest is pitiful.

This is really good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have Album!!","review":"This is such an amazing album! All you people who think she sounds like Avril need to get a hearing check. No offense to Avril fans, but Kelly has a much better voice. This cd is musically, vocally, and lyrically intense and passionate. Kelly wrote half the album and she wrote Because of You when she was 16. By the way Avril only wrote ONE song on this album. It is one of the only cds that I own that I can actually listen through the whole cd and never skip over a song, thats how good it is. I think the three best songs on this album are either Where is Your Heart?, Hear Me, or Because of You. This is a fabulous album that I think everyone can enjoy. Kelly really showcases her voice beautifully on this album. Thankful, Kelly's first album, was light and airy. Breakaway, on the other hand, is more powerful and deep. Everyone needs to buy this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This album is sensational!! It portrays Kelly's powerhouse vocals with such purity, strength and intimacy. Give her a few years and Kelly will be a legend in her own time. Her talent will outlast the popularity of this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Soundtrack to Your Next Dentist Appoinment","review":"If you need further proof of that the end of western civilization is at hand, look no further than America's obsession over \\"American Idol\\" and the third rate hacks that it promotes. What we have here is more generic, bland, and utterly unoriginal pop with not vision. It is simply disposable product. Destined for dentist office and elevators everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointed","review":"I loved the first album by this singer but am very disappointed in this one. I feel this CD is very derivative and other than one song (Beautiful Disaster), doesn't highlight her voice to it's best. I really hate that someone with a unique talent feels it necessary to become an Avril/Amy Lee/Jessica clone instead of herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Awesome Cuts...","review":"The pop hit \\"Breakaway\\" is just such a happy upbeat tune, and the hauntingly stunning live version of \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" is such a gem, and the flat out rock-on \\"Since You've Been Gone\\" is a sure hit, but the rest of the disk was unimpressive. It's not due to Kelly's voice which is awesome, it's due to some overproduction. Frankly, it's a bit of a let down. Kelly is worthier of much better studio work. The 3 songs I like just don't take the whole CD to even a three star level."},{"rating":"1","title":"rubbish fake rocker","review":"she thinks she is all ROCK when she is sooooooooooo fake and rubbish DO NOT BUY THIS CD IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY she has only written like 3 of the songs on this album and she does not even play any instrument DO NOT BUY!!!

This CD is such a cliche...monotone vocals that explode into raging screams, \\"chunk-a-chunk-chunk\\" guitars, and whiney lyrics about how miserable life is. Don't worry though, pop culture trends die out quick.

Now about a year later a realize that I was mistaken. Kelly Clarkson doesn't suffer from asthma. She just has a horrible, unmusical voice. Kelly Clarkson is a lousy singer, if I can even call her that. Its questionable to even call what Ms Clarkson does singing--Kelly can't sing. All she can do is sigh and wisper into the microphone. She sounds winded and out of breath, as if she has just finished the Boston Marathon. Either that or maybe she has the flu or asthma. She can't even sing one note without asphixiating herself. Pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"usually there are 2 or 3 good songs on a CD, but this one has 5 or 6 and the rest are well worth listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised !!!","review":"Didn't think I would like this...quite surprised.

I was really pleasantly surprised at how awesome this album is. Kelly's incredible voice really shines through, and I think the material also suits her better. The first two singles (Breakaway and Since You Been Gone) are not even the best songs on the album, and that's saying a lot.The lyrics are meaningful and exceptionally well-written. There is no filler on this one. I wouldn't be surprised if she wins a Grammy for this effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good,but not definitive","review":"You have to admit on the excellente tecniqui this pianist has.

How do I know? My school review was accepted then chopped up to feature exclusively tongue-and-cheek (and simply smart ass) sound bites that represent only a small portion of my opinion of the college.

The Media Source Organizer that comes with the player is somewhat confusing at first, and there is no real real-time syncronisation between selected files/folders and the player (at least none that I could find). This gave me trouble at first because most of my songs are sorted into directories by album, but their mp3-tags weren't set up properly for all of them.

Now it'll be March tomorrow and he can touch the floor, but not enough to get it moving - he just ends up made and crying.

My son was not in the walker for more than 5 min. when he had turned the key in such a way that when he reached foward to press the musical buttons, his arm became solidly wedged between the key and steering wheel.

This is highly worrisome to me!

I guess it's the timelessness of it themes--violence (unfortunately) and love--because though the book was published in 1983 and the story itself, from hints in the book, I think is set about ten years before that, it obviously still resonates with readers in 1999.

Mr. Jovanovic succeeds where others have failed.Sure Malkmus is still aloof, but the other band members make up for his enigmatic behavior.

It showed a logical progression of Pavement's history from early influences, band members meeting, creating amazing albums, and the problems that unfortunately broke them up. It's very convenient and resourceful to have all the information, such as EP reviews from obscure music magazines, in one place at least.

It's a real shame she couldn't do a music video on Arabian Nights, not just little clips after videos. I really like how she talks about her songs between songs. It make me feel like she is talking to you. One sidenote: Kadim al Sahir can't really perform in front of the camera. He's not as graceful and elegant as Sarah always is.

It is worthing your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"with a few reservations","review":"I found the DVD to be very sensual---and if that's what you enjoy you will like this. It is a lot of belly dancing, and often Sarah shows way too much of herself.She waves her arms throughout the entire DVD.Those are the two negatives. The positives are the beautiful music and her beautiful face. I went to see her Harem program and it was the best thing I have ever seen or heard, in the way of concerts.Sarah sets up each music video, so you get to hear her speak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work","review":"When compared to her other musical works, this CD does not show her true range, or ability. Usually when I buy one of her CDs. I listen to it for days on end. I listened to this CD several times, trying to like it, and found none of the incredible sounds and beauty that normally abound in one of her CD. The songs that were chosen for this CD did nothing for her voice and her voice was not befitting the songs. All in all it was a very disapointing CD which is now gathering dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harem Concert","review":"My wife and I were at the Harem Concert Jan, 24th here in Ct. at the Mohegan Sun Arena.

She just out does herself each time.Tears in my eyes and goose bumps on my back I enjoyed every second of her show.I guess my review is basically about the tour not the DVD because I haven't seen it yet. But I am expecting a wonderful DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good visuals, banal music","review":"I saw the TV special and I am ordering the DVD, but it's for the fantastic settings, landscapes, and costuming. Basically art reference. To be frank, Sarah's voice is lovely, but a lot of her musical selections for Harem left me cold. And since she is a singer, not a dancer, her on-screen posturing actually provoked laughter on several occasions. Especially when compared to the background dancers who are VERY good.

It matched my kitchen perfectly. But, I have also found it to be incredibly useful too. The \\"cup\\" is generously sized allowing me to measure all sorts of things. I've also found it wonderful to use for baking as measuring by weight is far more accurate. When not is use, it's great as a fruit / veggie holder.

If this scale is correct, weighing objects has gone from being standardized to completely arbitrary. Seeing as how this idea goes against my pragmatic nature, I have come to realize that the laws of physics haven't changed -- the only thing that changes is the result of any measurements taken from this scale.If you put a 12oz soft drink on the scale it may read 12oz. Lift the soft drink from the scale and put it back on the scale and it may read 8oz. or 18oz. There is no way to zero this scale... every time it is zeroed, and then something is weighed, then removed, the scale is no longer zeroed -- as if it is on a mission to unhinge me.I do not recommend this scale to anyone except for model home decorators, art majors, or people who are on an open-ended quest for answers but don't necessarily care what those answers are."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality construction","review":"I can't say whether the scale measures well or not, because I was never able to assemble it.

The lights are good, but you can't point them in a different direction, say if you are sitting next to the kid and are trying to read. But, they are still pretty nice to have.It doesn't get attached to the car seat, it's the belt that is holding it in place, so yes, it moves around if the child is not in it. In my car (Honda Civic) it works best on either side, but not in the middle: if it's in the middle, then it leans if my son leans over."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"We've had this seat for about four months and my daughter loves it thus far.

This was originally meant as a demo but was released on vinyl in 1985. Not bad indeed for a demo!

I have to clip off that plastic thing to install it. However, when I hook up the cables, the motor didn't work at all, while my original mirror's motor still works except the glass on it was chipped.

In the case of Beulah, whose latter albums are a true musical joy, this first release from the band proved to be a challenge to find at a price that was anywhere close to matching my desire to hear it. Once I did secure a copy, I have to admit I was a tad disappointed at the band's lo-fi, garage band sound. Simply put, while there are some brilliant songs here by Kurosky and Swan, they never achieve the opulence that comes with expanded instrumentation, improved musicianship, and enhanced production that emerges on their later albums. Yet as I gave this CD continued listens, the initial appeal of this band became more clear -- superb songcraft, provocative lyrics, and excellent song structures. I would love to have seen the band rerecord some of these songs later, but they were too busy creating new pop gems."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Hike Maps","review":"I'm planning to visit Utah for the first time and wanted to use this book to scout hikes.If you aren't planning to hike or prefer only written descriptions you might find this book more valuable than I did.The book has a plethora of written information, but NO MAPS of the short hikes.

Instead of buying this book, I would just have soon spent the money on some beers with friends--which I consider a much more effective way of dealing with stress, rather than reading what some guy with a collection of stories from his buddies thinks is the path to mental wellbeing.If you're someone who is not very emotionally-minded (like me), I think you will probably agree with my bottom line assessment of the book: \\"meh\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Greatest Good","review":"My Dad grew up in Northern Idaho and the Pacific NW and was in the CCC's and worked for the Forest Service as a young man and then went on to become a Marine and served in the Pacific during WW-2.

There's a tight, nervous intensity in the Schubert (though balmy and itchy in comparison to Carl Schuricht's metaphysical pyrotechnics!).The Beethoven, though, is bloated and flat and this is one score which needs a lean, athletic approach and one where I'd thought Toscanini would have excelled.

He maintains that our society has lost focus on anything beyond itself, beyond the media-made images of itself, and is wholly preoccupied with the appearance of things and, ultimately, the processes of creating appearances-- a kind of national and cultural schizophrenia. He concludes that this national narcissism--like the Greek namesake--can only result in languishment and demise.At first blush, the work seems readable and straightforward, but this is not light reading. It demands careful attention and reflection. The payoff is a rewarding experience which should stand as a classic of its kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful critique of the nature of American society","review":"Never have I read a more honest and insightful evaluation of the weaknesses as well as strengths of American society.

An album which is the peak of this group and was reference to many artists who liked to explore in new ways of making music.Shadowfax was the first new age group, as soloists were mostly common like Ackermann, Winston, and all the people at Windham Hill (oh, what would have been music without this label?). They were even more remembered a few years after the releasing of their first recordings as their style was becoming too eclectic.Nowadays, it is very pleasant to listen to Shadowdance, but it has been losing some charm. It sounds a little bit old, but it has freshness. It sounds a little bit nave, but it has strength. It's a recording to take in mind and to discover.

This book (and all the books by Ernle Bradford for that matter) provides those that are intersted in the history, but not in being bogged down in details, with an enjoyable and (in my opinion) quite accurate picture of what took place. Furthermore, Ernle Bradford knew the mediterranean better than most library historians for he spent 30 years of his life sailing in this sea.

I called immediately to complain, talked to a guy named Saul, who said the unit must be defective, DUH! and he would send me a new unit and a return authorization. I have gotten neither, I am just out the money. I have called back, faxed, mailed, waited on hold, and finally decided that Ronco products are CRAP. I will never give him or his company another cent. Buyers please research your purchases, I see from other reviews that I am not the only one with a complaint. Buy a different machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed by what arrived...","review":"I was in the market for a dehydrator to make fruit leathers for my kids who are sensitive to red dye 40. This is an ingredient found in all of the fruit snacks in our grocery store. I ordered this one and when it arrived I was seriously disappointed. Construction was subpar and the fact it is a passive dehydrator meant it required an extraordinary amount of time to process the foods we wanted dried. It also required rotation of the trays, something I did not like. I immediately returned it and ordered the Nesco American Harvest FD75PR with the fan in the lid and the powerful 700 watt heating system. I highly recommend passing on the Ronco unit and spend a little more on the Nesco. I wish I had (could have saved on shipping)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Ronco Junk","review":"As with any Ronco product, it is very cheaply made, with seemingly nothing more than mass-production and profit margins as the basis. Fruit on the bottom tray will be brittle by the time fruit on the top trays are ready. If you like rotating trays and waiting a very long for dried fruit and jerky, then buy this dehydrator, and plan on buying it a few times. If not, then buy one by Nesco American Harvest. I have learned twice to stay away from Ronco products. Once with this and once with the Showtime Rotisserie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Made","review":"I've used this product about a dozen or so times and I guess it did what it was supposed to do. But the element clips have broken of the bottom and burned a hole in the unit. It does take a long time to dry food, due to the passive heat operation.

I received this unit as a gift, and it did help me determine if i would use it enough to buy a better unit though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget About It....","review":"If you do not mind running up your electric bill and waiting forever on food to dry then go right ahead and by this dehydrator...

We used it a couple times when the heating element went out. We figured that this was because it was old so I attempted to order a new one. I ordered the 5 tray dehydrator with the accessory pack which has the extra trays and fruit roll up things directly from Ronco. Read the fine print - 4 to 6 weeks delivery time! After waiting 2 months I called them to find out why I hadn't received it only to be informed that the accessory pack was on back order but if I would like my dehydrator and accessory pack WITHOUT the extra trays then they could go ahead and ship it to me and I should receive it in 15 to 20 business days. The lady was very unhelpful and didn't understand why I didn't want the accessory pack without the extra trays. I told her that I didn't place the order to wait 3 months or more for my order to be incomplete but cost me full price. I am ordering a different one from Amazon.

My first thoughts were it seemed to be made cheaply. Dehydrators that I've seen in the past have all had fans that allow for equal drying and no need to rotate the trays. The way it works is just a coil at the bottom of the unit.The first time i used it I dried apples and things seemed to work fine. I had to rotate the trays every couple of hours. The second time I used it I tried pineapple. I got stuck at work and came home to the bottom tray of pineapple burned a little.

After 5 calls to Ronco's customer service, they finally told me that I could \\"replace\\" the trays but I had to purchase them. I was not about to do that as I felt the product was defective and should be replaced by Ronco.I turned to Amazon, explained the situation and Amazon graciously replaced the product, paid s&h; back to Amazon and I thought I had gotten rid of a bum dehydrator. Wrong!!!! The replacement melted with the first use. I returned it to Amazon and was issued a credit. Do NOT purchase this product - it is a potential fire hazard and the customer service at Ronco stinks!I will purchase another dehydrator from Amazon but it will not be Ronco's."},{"rating":"2","title":"food dehydrator","review":"I bought this as a Mother's Day gift for my daughter.

Most expensive jerky I ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF JUNK!!! DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"This is my second Ronco Food Dehydrator. The first worked fine for 20 years. This one melted and cracked after two uses. This is a piece of JUNK now. If you call to complain, you have to pay tons of shipping and handling charges to get replacement parts. They charge $14 for the base, $6 for the top, and $2 per each tray. Basically, you have to re-purchase their piece-of-junk product if it breaks under warranty. Nice warranty, huh? DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Nesco makes a much better one for a little bit more money.Oh, and it doesn't even dehydrate well anymore. Now that I have the Nesco and Ronco and have dehydrated simultaneously, I can unequivocally say that NESCO is the best!

I had an old Ronco that I used for more than a decade and loved it. It wore out, so I got a new one (model FD1005WHGEN) for Christmas. This one is a cheap substitute.

It has worked perfectly. Obviously, Amazon has gotten a defective shipment from the manufacturer. The woman I talked to, at Amazon, told me this item would be listed as unavailable until such time as they found out what the problem was.I received notification, this morning, that my Visa account has been credited for the full amount charged.

I am satisfied with it given the price of $29.95. Yes, it is the lowest end of the dehydrator world but I have been satisfied with all but one thing. The resulting goo from wetter fruits and tomatos gets stuck in the tray's open webbing and is a pain to wash since the trays don't easily fit into my sink. Also, I do a lot of herbs and the smaller leaves often slip through the holes and end up in the bottom.I think this item works as a beginning to dehydrating.

Notice I use the past tense.Left the unit on last night to dry some cayennes, but it was cold when I woke up. I wasn't able to get the coil to heat up again, double-checked the plug, etc. When I took a very close look at the heating element, I could see that it was broken...the ceramic around the connection between wire and coil was shattered.

That is what happened to her. She ended up with melted trays. I'm surprised she still uses it (she might have gotten a replacement).I bought a K Tel dehyrator 17 years ago and I still use it. I don't mind rotating the trays and low wattage. There's less chance of the food over drying (like when I tried using the oven) and since I mainly use it for jerky these days, the slow dry time allows the marinade to cook right in and gives the meat a nice succulent sheen.I remember the various Ronco and Popeil products dating back to the 70's and they have always been subpar, substandard and subhuman. That is why I refuse to ever buy any Ronco products.

The experience upset us both.. Not only did the clippers RIP off my youngest cat's nail and SHRED the little bit that was left, but the metal clipper part chipped and folded over from using it on one nail! I do not recommend this product to anyone who cares about the well-being of his/her cat! I will certainly be returning this product ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't subject your cat to this product","review":"This clipper was dull after only a few clippings of our cat's nails. Since then, it's constantly jammed while using it. It finally jammed on our cat's nail and I had to rip the outer layer of the nail off in order to remove the clipper. It immediately went in the garbage.I care too much about my cats to use this product on them.Don't waste your money and don't make your cat suffer by using this product on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I myself prefer the guillotine style of clippers, but my fiance is more comfortable with the scissor style clippers.

Its so cute. The first time I saw it I just wanted to take it right out of the screen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Manipulation","review":"So basically I can sum this flick up in one word, manipulation. Instead of being 'jerks' these two guys are tugging at this girls heartstrings playing the other side of the 'jerk' mentality. Giving her what she wants, using her desires against her to get her with themselves. As far as I can tell she isn't doing any better with the two guys trying to get in her pants. The only difference is these guys are desperate enough to stay!The movie isn't what I would call a romantic or a comedy, it's more depressing really and drags on and on with pointless directions that really don't add much to the story at all. I'm not sure why the movie had to go the additional mile after she decided who she wanted to be with."},{"rating":"1","title":"its not bad, but not good either","review":"Ok I watched this movie and Ill give it 2 stars. the story line is somewhat interesting, realistic, but kind of dragged on after 2/3 of the film. the ending was there tho so you should watch the whole thing.sadly not alot to say about the characters cuz they never really gave any impression at all that would contribute to the movie. even right now i dont even remember anybody's names.. friends family whos who. thats how much I was paying attention to this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope Marguerite Moreau is VERY EASY in real life! If you know what I mean!","review":"Much better than previous reviews would suggest. Charming and quirky rather than insubstantial. Characters not terribly deep but there is enough good dialouge and plot-twists to keep you entertained. Not meant as a deep treatise on relationships but grows on you as it progresses with aspects of the relationships amusingly reminiscent of reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a comedy","review":"The box cover makes this look like a comedy. It's not. Only get this movie if you aren't expecting laughs.It's a drama about a woman who decides that she sleeps around too much, and so she's going to be celibate for the next 90 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Empty","review":"I rented this movie because Marguerite Moreau looked hot on the box. But she didn't look nearly as good in the movie. Her character was a smoking (gross), bed-hopping slob who looked like she harbored every STD known to man. And she thinks she has to sleep with every guy she meets in order to find love (silly). Really no focus in this movie, not enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chick Flick all the way","review":"There's really not much to this movie. There's no comedy, no action, no suspense, no thrills of any kind. Some women may find a little bit of drama in it, I'm not really sure. I'm a guy, so it's definately not for me. What's advertised on the cover, you get very little of in the film. The girl pictured on the cover hardly reflects the one in the film, so if you are going based on that, then be prepared to be disappointed, just a fair warning. And if you are looking for any sexual content, then look elsewhere. There's really not much at all. A very lame film for men, but it MIGHT be ok for women, I've sat through much better chick flicks though, forcibly at that. Two stars, probably only deserved one. But I don't hate it. I just don't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good fun movie","review":"A descent couples movie for a relaxing time and good entertainment. we enjoy a good date night flick.

The playing itself is okay it's the bidding that drives me crazy. Occasionally my partner will open with a 3-card major! Also, whoever wrote the program did not include the Blackwood, Gerber or Stayman conventions so if you are entertaining the thought of a slam bid, you are basically on your own to guess what your partner has in the way of HCP's. If I forget this fact and bid Blackwood, my partner will always pass at 4 NT. Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Game!!!","review":"this is a TERRIBLE program! here are several things that are wrong with the programming:1) the software is buggy - when you undo the bids to redo the bidding, the program often doesn't show you the bidding box, leaving you no choice but to deal a new hand.2) the program doesn't show you everyone's hand at the end, so you can't analyze what should have happened3) the 'tutor' plays like a beginner - it takes all the tricks off the top - doesn't know how to set up tricks or set up transportation.4) the online portion doesn't appear to let you simply watch games, in order to learn, as other online programs do (you know, the ones that only support windows...)5) the bidding box is cumbersome - it takes 2 clicks to make a bid, rather than just one, and God forbid you make a mistake! especially on-line, there doesn't appear to be a way to alert you opponents and ask to correct the bid."},{"rating":"1","title":"only if you want your partner to be playing against you","review":"I have had this for years. My son bought it for me. When I got it, I had to pay for it again and the game still wouldn't let me change the 'dummies' from playing stupid. If you were taking the trick with an ace, you partner played a king. Very frustrating. I emailed the game and they couldn't help me. Very expensive for all that frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad review","review":"I guess I misjudged what this product was about. I wanted some honest to goodness bridge practice. From the goofy characters to the off the wall bidding and rank beginner play, this bridge game is a flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"3D Bridge Deluxe is OK","review":"I purchased Bridge Baron 22 along with 3D Bridge Deluxe. The first represents an excellent vehicle for entertainment and practice, as it provides for user replay as well as computer replay. My wife won't bother with Bridge Baron, preferring 3D Bridge because of the characters who play in the game. We both have found the 3D opponents' bidding to be somewhat haphazard, and there is no way to review the hand other than via screenshot. Since I have a hard time digging up bridge buddies, 3D Bridge at least provides an outlet for play. It also took several emails to Freeverse to iron out the expired key code for registration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not running =((","review":"I purchased your game because it said it would run on Mac OS X.

The concert was pretty good and the music had a lot of energy and even some melody. This CD is not like the concert - the beats are not great for dancing and the melodies are just not there. For the fans of Boban Markovic, I'm sure this is a great CD but for others it might be an acquired taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thorough account of one of the most studied battles in history","review":"Sears presents a fascinating account of one of the world's most-studied battles. Superbly researched and ably written, Sears presents the Chancellorsville campaign through the eyes of its participants, frequently providing superior insight into \\"why\\" the military leaders did what they did. Sears posits that the reason Hooker and the Army of the Potomac failed to defeat Lee was more of a function of breakdown in telegraph communications and the failure of one or two Corps commanders, rather than exclusively the result of Hooker's indecisiveness at the critical moment"},{"rating":"2","title":"A stellar telling of a brutal battle.","review":"Stephen Sears once again shows his great skill in recounting civil war battles. Chancellorsville was indeed a very bloody battle. It was a battle that Union General Hooker was blamed for not winning. Sears research clearly shows that the blame rightly belongs on the shoulders of his subordinates-who did not follow his orders. Besides providing a just defense of Hooker Sears also demonstrates the devastating loss to the south. The accidental shoot of General Stonewall Jackson by his own men. This was the most important event of the battle-the loss of Jackson was described by General Lee as similar to losing an arm. The book reads like a fictional novel and was difficult to put down. If you want a good, fast and factual read of this battle then grab this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book","review":"Sears is perhaps one of the best authors of this epic chapter in American History. This book was outstanding from beginning to end. I particularly enjoyed his description of Hooker and his successful plans, despite having a change of heart at a crucial point of the battle. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Civil War battles. I look forward to reading all of Sears' titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great account of a major Civil War battle","review":"I have read two other books of Stephen Sears, \`Landscapeturned Red' & \`To the Gates of Richmond'. His latest book,\`Chancellorsville' was very informative and easy to read.Being an Australian I was not aware of how important thisBattle was and his book, I believe, fills in a gap in theHistory of the American Civil War. I recommend it to anyonewho has a love for history, a great read.Rick McQualter (id4259@ozemail.com.au)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed account with many maps","review":"I highly recommend this book.

The game also has good graphics. The battles are very fun because you can't always move far enough to attack your enemies. I liked the turn part too. It makes it so you can't build a lot of troops to rush or something because you only can build one building per turn and you can't build unlimited troops because you can only build so many each week.

I am a devout fan of her other series, The Alpine books. But time and again I keep shaking my head at the lead character, Judith's, actions. Why in the world would she want her foul mouthed, disagreeable, insulting mother any where near her? Any normal person would be dancing a jig to get some distance between them! And this worrying about what Joe thinks....it's her house, and if he didn't like anything, I'd tell him to take a hike!! Please!The end to this mystery is so convuluted one would need a chart to try to figure it out. I've read all the previous novels in this series, and keep hoping that they will live up to their sister series, the Alpine novels. Not yet.I've read much worse books, but this one is certainly no mystery classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute and clever","review":"As an opera buff, I love whodunits set in the opera world, and this is a good one. A fat opera tenor is murdered during the first act of La Traviata, and it's up to the woman who runs the bread-and-breakfast that he and his entourage are staying at to solve his murder. There are lots of interesting supporting characters. The unmasking of the murderer is sufficiently complex and plausible. A lot of the dialogue is crisp and tangy. The relationships are complex. The bickering is amusing. I can fully recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album this year, period.","review":"If you liked Black Diamond, you'll LOVE this one.

Cop Mahogany Soul and stop sleeping on Stone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Awakening","review":"In this soul searching new release by Angie Stone can be found the essense of a woman. Never condescending, and always inspiring, Angie does it again. \\"Easier Said Than Done\\" reminds us that for every woman with that natural sparkle of wonder in her eye, is another that has lost it by dealing with the oh too common boy masquerading as a man. Life's lessons are so gracefully etched in wax, that the overall vibe of this album will make you say \\"Remember When?\\" Angie has displayed her unadulterated spiritual self for all who dare to listen. Please Believe. For the daring, check out track 2,4,7,9,14, and ooh my god 15. With a twist of love, passion, disappointment and defeat, Angie Stone rises as a shadow of what is yet to come in all of us! Peace"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even duller than the debut...","review":"The only cuts on the album that really stand out are \\"Brotha\\" and \\"Make Love\\", a duet with Musiq Soulchild (that stands out because of the obvious influence of Musiq's talent). Her songwriting is tight as usual, however the beats seem to drown in a dull sameness one could only describe as lame. This a very overrated sophmore follow-up. She could certainly improve her production roster by inlisting fellow neo-soul peers like the Soulquarians or Touch of Jazz. Please do not expect an album balanced around the current single \\"Brotha\\". If you are looking to satisfy your neo-soul desires, pass this album and get Red Star Sounds Vol. 1- Soul Searching and Hidden Beach Unwrapped Vol. 1, you'll thank me later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan in MD","review":"I have had this cd in my player since it arrived two months ago. I can't get enough of it.

I've loved her from the very first time I heard her voice. I love how she reincarnates the music and messages of the 60s and 70s into her own without it sounding \\"sampled.\\" Through her voice and music, Angie embodies everything that was soul music and helps us remember and recapture a period of time when Black people were truly proud and dignified and weren't taking any more (...) of afros and tight bellbottoms and platforms and miniskirts and incense and reefer and wine and 8-tracks and orange pleather living room suits; of Huey and Angela and Assata and Martin and Malcolm and all the warriors against inequality; the good times and the bad times.

This review is more a commenetary on today's popular soul music than a crtique of the album. Where are the bass plyers, Stax guitar licks, and for Pete's sake, where are the drummers.Electronic drums are so lame and there absence leaves a huge hole in the music. Any kind of music.

ANYBODY who gives props to todays black man has a special spot in my CD collection. I'm tired of being bashed on the radio by female artist for the sole purpose of record sales.

I need more music like this in my collection......Angie is great start.reggy-reg"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful CD!","review":"When everybody thought that neo-soul was dead, Angie Stone comes along with \\"Mahogany Soul\\" and proves the world wrong! She shines especially on the track \\"Brotha\\". I haven't heard her much on the radio, but she more than deserves that recognition because of her talent. This album proves that she will be around for a long time to come!This album will make you wish this was the year 1973."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another One Of The Year's Best Releases","review":"I bought Angie Stone's first solo album back in 99' and I thought it was pretty good, but I think that the new one is a must have. Angie Stone deals with a lot of issues on this album and she addresses them in such a way that you cannot help but relate to. My favorites are Brotha( A much needed ode to Black men.), More Than A Woman(Probably my favorite track on the album.), What U Dyin' For(Remember \\"Bone 2 Pic\\" from the last album? Well, this is another example of the dopeness you get when you link Ali Shaheed Muhammad with Stone.), Time Of The Month and the remix of Brotha featuring Alicia Keys and Eve. On the first listen, I knew that this would be an album that I would keep in heavy rotation for a while. This album ranks among my top five favorites of the year, so far. Mahogany Soul is like a breath of fresh air, in the polluted industry of generic music posing as \\"soul\\". I recommend this album, as well as Stone's previous album, Black Diamond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angie is telling it like it is","review":"Angie has always said what was on her mind and she continues to do that so well on this one too. She is the only singer I know that can talk about being \\"Pissed Off\\" or \\"That Time of the Month\\" and make it sound like she is singing a love song. Its a must have for women, and men you could learn a few things about yourself on this one. She also does justice to some of the old songs she borrows the music from and makes a new fresh groove that takes you back to the old days. Overall, think this is a must buy for the RnB lovers out there, male or female."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mahogany Soul","review":"I like this album, and it is obvious that Ms. Stone had alot to do with it's development. Angie Stone seems to be on a quest to revive the sound of the seventies and out a twist of today in there as well. I would say that she is succeeding, with evidence on tracks like More than a Woman, Ingredents of Love, and the head bopper Brotha. If you liked Black Diamond, you'll love Mahogany Soul.Peace Hedz & Keep The Music Alive"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD for all...","review":"I must admit that I really did not feel Angie's first CD and was hesitant to purchase her sophomore album...but I'm glad that I did.

Angie, IMHO, ranks up there with them. Her debut was lackluster but this is a soul classic. Just some of my fave tracks are:1) Makings Of You (It's just an interlude but she delivers it so beautifully, I love her because of it!)2) If It Wasn't (She delivers it with such attitude, and the lyrics are soo real, you can definately relate)3) Pissed Off (Sounds like an old 70's tune)4) Time Of The Month (I was surprised she didn't bring in a gospel chorus....lol. Very good track that women can relate to)5) Life Goes On (I love life!!!)6) Snowflakes (U can just envision it......)And that's not the end of the list. Angie definately puts it down. Best soul album I have heard in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONLY GAVE 5 STARS BECAUSE ***10 STARS*** is not an option!!","review":"THIS is the BEST R&B/NEO album... definitely the best released of the year... but it's one of the best in History... Angie Stone is a REMARKABLE talent with an AMAZING voice... I do not think this album received the level of recognition it deserved.

If I ever order another set, I will find a set that fits in the window channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marie Antoinette Paper Dolls Review","review":"This paper doll book is beautifully rendered (like all of Tom Tierney's work), but it disappoints with it's lack of historical accuracy. Firstly, the doll itself bears no resemblance to the extant portraits of Marie Antoinette. In fact, the doll and a gown(plate 4) look as if they were based on a portrait of Madame de Pompadour. Marie Antoinette would not have been amused!There are also a few costumes which would have been more at home in a Jeanette MacDonald musical than in the eighteenth century (most notably plates 4 & 15).Having been a fan of Tom Tierney's work for many years, as well as someone who is fascinated with the eighteenth century, I expected more from this publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Deal!! Very happy with purchase","review":"I found this same paper doll book at Barnes and Noble and it was pricey. I decided to check on Amazon and saved about 11$!! This was used, and not a scratch.

Works withour problems with my Windows XP Professional and Windows 2003 Server. It shows up as an removable HD and that's perfect for me: no music software needed.While the rounded shape is very practical, I wished it had a scroll wheel or the joystick found on the other iRiver players at the center. The jog dials are better than the ones found on the Nomad players (thicker and not flimsy) but require some learning curve.The battery life is great, the radio is terrific and the large LCD is a big plus. Oh and the sound with SRS turned on is amazing.Overall, a great device for the features and price, highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"purchase with caution","review":"I recently purchased this player and was excited about its cute design and ability to interface with .wma files. I have had no problems with the radio or the ability of this device to play MP3 audio files--the sound is very good. However, none of the .wma files (files burned from my own CD's) will play on the player. Perhaps this is a mistake that I am making in attempting to download these files, however noone seems to be willing to help me with this problem. I have been extremely frustrated with customer support--I have sent 3 emails to their customer support center and received no replies in over 2 weeks. In addition, no one answers their customer support line--I've stayed on hold in excess of 30 minutes multiple times. Because of this, I am left with returning the player and not recommending it to those who may require any sort of technical support."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!","review":"This product does not communicate with computers running Windows 2000 or Windows XP Home, therefore it is a waste of money. It is definitely not plug and play. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice set-up, but quality control is an issue","review":"When I got this is Jan 04, I had to replace it once a month for 4 months various electronic reasons. Hard drive crash, electronic issues, etc. Customer service is a bit of a nightmare. They are a small company here (bigger in Japan), and it shows.I think one of the issues is the player has some conflicts with Macs. While they say they are compatible, sometimes it has issues moving file, and that resulted in two of the four crashed with my system.That said, once you figure out the menu (and I still have some issues there - why does it default into changing the viewing properties instead of changing song menus? You would think that would be the more used option.), it is a nice player. Good for exercising, etc. I mean, do you really need 5 Gig to exercise? Are you running an Ironman?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a Mac!!","review":"Have had this for 3 frustrating days. Two tech support people said it is FULLY compatible with my OS 9.2.2, BUT they offer no drivers, no encoder info or software, and the word Mac is not shown ONCE in their manual. Latest email not answered, and spent 22 minutes on support line with no answer. Would give it zero stars if possible. Will be sending it back to Amazon and look for a reliable company.Will change my review to 2 stars as I had to purchase outside software to get it working. But still no answer to my email and unable to delete any files in the unit even though I deleted them out of the folder on my computer. No instructions in the manual om using the Trash folder. This manual is sad as is the support site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this one!!!","review":"Poor reliability. Poor interface and menu design. Poor button action.

It was very much stricter and classes were fuller is what memory tells me from other reading, however I enjoyed the DVD very much. It arrived safely, obviously!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too old and tedious","review":"Some of the footage here might be earlier than 1977, it's Soviet Russia, eons before the place opened up. What we see in the footage is much too old to describe the school in the 21st Century. Grace Kelly drones on and on, and at one point quietly informs us that Nureyev, Makarova, and Baryshnikov are never mentioned because they defected. Well, they were rehabilitated years ago, and Grace herself is long gone. It's a humorless, dated documentary, and should be retired to the dust bin. Ignore any recent dates for the video's release, it has nothing to do with 2004. It's 35+ years old, and does not follow up on students who built careers.Although different in purpose, Born To Be Wild, featuring 4 top male dancers from American Ballet Theatre a few years ago is highly entertaining, and I ended up buying some ballet DVD's featuring those guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Still Available","review":"First, let's correct an error. The 3rd edition was published in 1982 by John Wiley & Sons so the date of \\"February 1993\\" is not when the edition came out (maybe its when Krieger Publ. took over).This is a classic text dealing with all aspects of forest measurements - from individual trees to rather sophisticated forest inventory techniques.

I ended up reading her review and agreed with everything she wrote, and now have nothing further to add. Weird! But this is indeed a page-turner as well as an introduction to and brief history of eugenics, told with grace and humor. I really loved the book! It was the kind of book that I couldn't wait to quote to my husband when he got home. It was fascinating on many levels, and sent me on a search for other books dealing with the whole sperm-donor issue, and there are very few, and none like this. So thank you to Slate for encouraging David Plotz to write this book ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"I found this book fascinating. This slice of American History was something that you don't find very often. A true and honest portrait of where we were in the 1950s through the 1980s and how that is still affecting lives today. The people who made this story human and current were very engaging. Even the author took on the role of a character instead of an omniscient third person. I chose this book for my book club selection and everyone in my book club (ages 65 to 29) loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sensationalized Account without Merit","review":"My husband is one of the children Mr. Plotz writes about in his book and in his articles on Slate. Unfortunately, Mr. Plotz is much more concerned with creating a sensational story than with fairly or accurately presenting the lives of the people involved in the Repository.My husband's experience with Mr. Plotz demonstrated to us that Mr. Plotz's sole interest is in dramatizing and sensationalizing, even to the point of distortion, the experiences of those he interviews in order to benefit from their stories himself. Please read all his writings with a critical eye - he was neither \\"sensitive\\" to the \\"emotional consequences\\" of his journalism in our encounters with him, nor was he respectful of the youth and vulnerability of his subjects in our experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smartly written","review":"Well researched and written snapshot of the lives touched by this history-making bank. The author keeps you intrigued and drawn into the personal stories featured. The book also goes beyond the actual history to highlight the people and psychologies behind the story, not to mention the very real possibility in a not-so-distant future of elitist baby shopping. Very touching, and interesting.

Lovely pictures and tremendous amount of info.","review":"Art of Dress is essential in its information about the evolution of men's and women's clothing from 1750 to 1820. I bought this book in helping me to research the empire style dress of 1790s and early 1800s. It has helped me in my researching and placing me within the world of fashion during the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries. The fashion trends of underdress and overdress as well as hairstyles and clothing are shown in excess in this fabulous book. There are marvelous pictures of royalty of France (Empress Josephine Bonaparte) and her sisters. It is a definite 10 in my book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Visual Feast","review":"The Art of Dress uses paintings from the period 1750 to 1820 to place period examples of clothing before the reader's eyes. Fashions from Rocco splendor through the Directorate's simple classicism are paraded before our eyes in exquisite reproductions of numerous paintings. The text of the book provides an informed overview of the period with enough detail to bring the time alive. My only complaint is that a very little more detail would have better conveyed the changes and vogues in fashion during this exciting and varied period in fashion history. This is an excellent book that narrowly misses setting a benchmark."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree...","review":"I agree with the first reveiw - this was one of my favorites growing up and now it's completely tattered in a ziplock bag -- I'm getting a new one too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very flimsy!","review":"Very Disappointed!!! $25 down the drain1 This set is rediculously flimsy!

No problem, though, it's not that hard to just put it back together.The real problem was when the handle snapped within the first week during normal use. This might be because it got bounced around during shipping since it was packed in too large of a box with no padding to speak of. Of course, it could also be because the handle is made out of the cheapest, lightest wood mankind has ever known. More likely, it is a combination of the two.Save yourself the hassle and don't buy this product. I did give 2 stars because, after we went to the hardware store and bought a new handle, the rake and scoop work just fine. Nothing to write home about, but gets the job done. This was less of a hassle for us than returning it and finding/ordering a different one, but then again we're at the hardware store quite often so your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this book is fantastic.","review":"This book has very interesting stories and poems.

Definitely worth getting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact And Strong","review":"This is a great sized flashlight to have in a pocket.

I do not recommend the purchase of this unless you want to change the color of the LED bulb which I don't know if it's possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red lights are to protect your night vision","review":"I have the Gerber Red as well as another noname brand red. I use them for their intended purpose - astronomical observations. Red preserves your night visioon so that when time comes to focus the telescope or cameraa in total darkness you are not blinded by a maxabeam white light. The factors that are important are even illumination, which is not easy with red, controlled direction so you do not bother other observers in your party, and then the common things like battery life, etc. I would give it 5 stars if it were designed with a RED LUXEON bulb (just the 1W size) and had a frosted glass lens, perhaps with an orfice that could narrow the beam. That would make the perfect night observation light - but I have not found one yet. Time to fire up the old bridgeport and make one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Note that this is a twist on, not press on","review":"This is a well-built, compact red LED flashlight. The only thing that didn't occur to me before buying was that it is difficult to operate with one hand because it is a twist on. So if you're looking for a small flashlight to quickly glance down at a star chart, you might want to look for a flashlight that is more easily operable with one hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must have\\" for all parents and babies!!!","review":"We love this CD.

The songs are beautiful and very gentle.

As a psychologist, I was excited to purchase this and begin teaching my toddlers about emotions. This book is colorful and attractive; for this the author gets 2 stars. I was expecting a book full of emotions with an accompanying picture. However, this book illustrates a few emotions but then confuses thoughts with feelings. If I am teaching my kids about feelings, I should not see statements that begin with \\"I feel like...\\" (e.g., I feel like playing in the sand\\")---that is a thought and not an emotion. There are plenty of emotions to pick from to illustrate in such a book so I don't understand why the author chose to include so many thoughts rather than emotions. Very disappointing...and aggravating. I'll have to find another book to teach my children about emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not normal feelings","review":"I was hoping for a book that covered normal feelings like happy, sad, proud, etc. Instead this book is about off beat feelings like \\"I feel like camping with my dog.\\" I am sure this is an appealing story for little children with all of the bright colors and pictures.

The SleepRight Adjustable Low-Profile Night Guard didn't fit at all. I took it to my dentist to show her. She changed the adjustment, too, just as I had done, and she saw it didn't fit either. It was way too big, and the band that goes across the lower front teeth made my lower lip stick way out! She took an impression of my lower teeth and ordered a custom mouth guard which came in 2 days. I used it last night. It fits perfectly, and as my insurance didn't cover this cost ($286) I was only charged $99."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stays in my freaking mouth","review":"Holy moly.

I've tried the \\"full-mouth\\" ones that cover both upper and lower teeth, but they always choked me in the middle of the night since I tend to breath through my mouth.

Other full mouth night guards didn't work well for me since I continued to bite down hard on the mouth guard and my front teeth contacted the guard before the molars so then my front teeth started feeling all of the clenching forces. This mouth guard simply keeps the back teeth from clenching on eachother which is all I needed. Its easy to keep clean and doesn't fill up my mouth like other full upper bite guards."},{"rating":"1","title":"SleepRight","review":"I returned this product a few weeks after receiving it. It moved around in my mouth too much during the night, it just didn't stay in place. It is very flexible and has a nice mint taste to it.

My last ditch effort was a night guard. I checked with the local dentist and he told me the guard can be very effective but if he made one it would be around $800-$1500. I could not afford this so I thought I would try an online product instead.

I assumed it meant that it tasted like cinnamon, but I wondered how (with daily washing & wear) it could retain the surely artificial flavor. . . It's actually very lightly cinnamon *scented*, and you don't really notice it at all when you're wearing it (taste or smell). It's pretty comfortable to wear.Fast forward to a couple years later:This guard would sometimes wind up out of place at night. Sometimes, I'd wake up to find myself reflexively chewing on it. I wound up getting a bite plate made at my dentist's office, and it's 1000 times better--the fit conforms perfectly, and it's comfortable & easy to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genuine LAMY ballpoint refill.","review":"MyLamy Noto Orange Ballpoint Pen - L282OEhas become my favorite pen, but the refill died after only limited use.

I did finally get mine successfully installed, but it took 3 days and lots of problem solving when the steps in the instructions were either unclear or physically impossible.

(Aren't all bullies?) But it's more than that. It's a story about sharing secrets. The daughter has a secret she SHOULD tell her mother. The mother has a secret she SHOULD tell her daughter. But neither one of them likes to communicate to the other--until a third party threatens to reveal their secrets FOR them should unless they do it themselvss.Again, Amy Tan's books are about mothers and daughters, so the relationships of the men are put on the backburner. If stories about women and \\"woman power\\" just \\"isn't your thing\\", put it down and move on.Still an amazing book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking family story","review":"Just when you thought that nothing can match 'Lucky Joy Club's' powerful story plot, Amy Tam comes and suprises you with beautiful and sad story about woman with a lot of courage and determination.

The reader finds out what the mother and daughter have gone through in their lives and what has shaped their personalities. Amy Tan writes first person narratives that are exciting, poetical, and dramatic. The struggles the mother faced in her life are revealed one piece at a time and lead to the final resolution. The differences that once pulled the two women apart bring the mother and daughter together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saiho and Andrew's review from SFHS.","review":"I think that this book, The Kitchen God's Wife, gave a pretty accurate description of the life of an asian woman during WWII. I think that the main charachters were virtually the same as the ones in the Joy Luck Club, but the structure of the book was much more organized. One of things that I did not like was the fact that the family tree was so vast and disconnected. The author totally ignored informing the reader of the internal relationships between the charachters, and this was quite confusing for one without a chinese background. Overall, this book was well written and very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defiinitely just fiction.","review":"As I get older I find Amy Tan's works are really just fiction. I think it is sad that her books make up some of the curriculum of Asian American studies and also histories of immigrant experiences. Now we have a new generation of students who think this is what is normal in the Asian communities. So sad.... The depiction of Asian men is that they are all bad people or deadbeats. Asian women are just supposed to take it until they can't take anymore. There also seems to be this sense that the women all need a savior in their lives to make the pain go away. So not true... My grandmother was orphaned during WW2. Her two brothers were killed because they were bringing home sweet potatoes that they bought by selling some family furniture. I remember her as a lady that can and will face anything head on and tell it like it is. So not like the ladies in Amy Tan's novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"unrealistic books aren't moving in my opinion","review":"I bought this book to read for school because I had read all of the wonderful reviews and I thought I would like it. The problem with Tan's book is 1) it is unrealistic 2) it is a formula book. Tan writes as if she is planning for a movie- but its not a movie, its a book. The plot follows a mother and a daughter (Pearl and Winnie-Louie) and the feelings each has about particular secrets they are keeping from one another. Winnie decides to tell Pearl that her real father isn't who she thinks he is and blah, blah, blah..it goes on for pages! For maybe 250 pages or more she tells a much too detailed account of EVERY SINGLE THING that has ever happened to her and you never hear one remark from Pearl until she's completely finish. It was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tan shouldn't have paralleled her book to the Kitchen Gods.","review":"Because the Kitchen God King was not a misogynist. If you read the actual fairy tale there is no hint of abuse on the Kitchen God Queen. The Kitchen King never raped or beated the Kitchen Queen. If you see many illustrations of the Kitchen King and Kitchen Queen in Chinese literature, they are always together. And the Kitchen Queen is honored because she is the Kitchen King's wife. And the Kitchen King is honored because he is the Kitchen Queen's husband. So, Wen Fu doesn't even come close as a comparison to the Kitchen King! Other than that, the only good this novel can do is help strengthen feminist causes (although Tan does it in spite of Chinese culture). But, it won't help Asian causes at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling and true-spoken narration","review":"Though it's beginning isn't exactly engrossing - at least not to me, as the main character seemed a married, middle-aged woman with boring family problems - the story really picked up when the woman's mother tells her story of life in China during World War II. It is really a different perspective, for all you who read about wars, and those that don't even like to. It is a story most heartfelt and so very realistic. ...There's something about Amy Tan's style - she doesn't dress up her story, everything is plainly told, and yet the work is just full of details and I find myself reading word-for-word unconsciously.\\"The Kitchen God's Wife\\" refers to Winnie (the mother's) life being in the shadow of her corrupt and malicious husband, herself helpless and overlooked. In my opinion, this book is a much better plot than The Joy Luck Club, and has a more dramatic theme. And while it may be long and seemingly tedious, it is worth every word!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Bought New Copy","review":"This is by far one of my favorite books of all time.

She was a strong woman who had struggled a lot in her early life, but she didn't give up on her hopes. Finally, she got out from her terrible life to live in a new happy life.

Definitely worth reading, it will stay with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book!!!","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I have also read The Joy Luck Club, and was glad to see Amy Tan continue to explore the mother-daughter bond, which is so strong and complicated - no matter the race, creed or color.I have decided that I am a big fan of Amy Tan's; her stories are so well written that I sometimes feel like I'm eavesdropping on the characters conversations, and seeing what they are seeing. And what characters she creates!! While Wen Fu was one of the most despicable characters that I have read about in a while, Jimmie Louie was an absolutely great guy, and his love for Winnie was heartwarming (she SO deserved it!!!).Winnie was right, she was like the Kitchen God's wife; she was a very good wife to an evil man, who was loved and admired by people for all the wrong reasons.

I do not have one drop of Chinese blood in me, but I could relate because (and I am certain of this) I have in the past immersed myself in Pearl Buck's books about China and the Chinese mind. Of course, most of Buck's books are heart breaking; nevertheless, I became addicted to reading about China and the Chinese people because of Pearl Buck. So, when I picked up The Kitchen God's Wife, I was psychologically ready for Amy Tan. The book was touching, but at the same time so much of the dialogue was hilarious, and I laughed out loud. Amy Tan is a very gifted writer, and it is evident as one reads The Kitchen God's Wife that she loves and cherishes her Chinese ancestry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"I loved this book, it is one of my all-time favorites.

In Winnie Louie Amy Tan may have her most intriguing, and sympathetic, character; one who is forced to endure marital slavery and the depredations of the invading Japanese before finally finding happiness and a new life for her surviving child in the United States of America. I was intrigued with Tan's scenes of war-torn Nanking and Shanghai during World War II and the Chinese Communist Revolution.

When i was done listening to them to make sure they worked, i pulled them out (normally like you would pull out any regular headphones). I looked at them and noticed that the plug looked kind of small. I looked inside of my iPad and half of the plug was still in there. I tried to use a needle, toothpick, and even a magnet but nothing works. Called Apple and they said they'll fix it but they wanted around $100.

If you don't like this style, there are others to choose from. I make a lot of MP3's from audio and video that's playing on the computer. A splitter comes in very handy if you want to listen to what's being played as the MP3 is being created. A splitter allows you to send the sound both to the Line In jack as well as the speakers. I've never noticed any loss of volume, at least nothing that wasn't caused by a plug not being all the way in. If any of the plugs are not making a good connection, the audio will suffer. That's almost always the problem when audio is going through anything like a splitter and the sound quality is not good. I did have one other problem once. As it turned out, the audio jacks on the computer motherboard had failed. I installed a sound card to bypass the on-board audio, and everything was OK after that. The splitter had nothing to do with the problem. I can't remember one of these splitters ever failing.

(The other female end worked just fine, though.) I'm being generous with the second star because I can't imagine that a build quality issue is a universal problem with this thing. But really, when I was expecting a cheap, convenient adapter, I didn't expect it to be _that_ cheap on manufacturing quality. Given that other solutions for 3.5mm connection sharing are only a few dollars more, I think it's worth it for 90% of people out there to \\"splurge\\" with a different adapter.

Also I think the singing does not match the style of music. This album sounds a bit too \\"southern\\" and it does not mesh well with the musical arrangements given to the songs.

It held up.This summer I drove from ohio to the west coast with 2 of my friends. For our trip down the coast on the 101 and the 1 this album was our soundtrack.

The Thrills' first album sounds like an instant classic for a little while, pillaging California for musical ideas until the only clue that they're Irish is the cover photo-and even that's no giveaway. In many ways, songs like \\"Don't Steal Our Sun\\" sound like the Flaming Lips on Soft Bulletin, and the comparison makes instant classic designation a very real possibility. But, to quote the fourth track, \\"Deckchairs and Cigarettes,\\" the bottom falls out of this album as it goes on. It's tempting to take it out thirty minutes in-perhaps after the seventh song, \\"Say It Ain't So\\"-and call it a great EP. That would deny you the excellent bonus track, though, with its classic line, \\"I can't see you smiling pumping gas.\\" The slowest songs are the longest, and that kills the flow of the album. Nevertheless, it's still a good CD-it just misses too often to place any higher on the list than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilled","review":"It's a shame I had to go all the way to London to hear The Thrills for the first time.

If you're looking to escape all the punk/metal/pop one-hit-wonders that dominate the radio airwaves, this CD is for you.You can hear The Thrills' influences, but their music is still original...especially compared to today's MTV-manufactured [stuff]. Standouts include \\"One Horse Town\\" (should be a U.S. single), \\"Big Sur\\" (reminds me of early R.E.M.) \\"Don't Steal Our Sun\\" (Beatles-esque), \\"Armchairs and Cigarettes\\" and \\"Say It Ain't So\\" (great steel guitar).Bands like The Thrills (and especially Gomez) could be big over here if their record companies pushed for them like Radiohead's and Coldplay's do.

While often misunderstood, \\"Losing My Religion\\" is a fantastic love song. Nor do all R.E.M. fans despise \\"Shiny Happy People\\" as it was made to be a silly pop song. It defintely stands out though from the other songs in Out of Time. Low and Texarkana both have just incredible instrumental and vocal sounds. Take the album for what it is, an end of the 80's start of the 90's album. Also, look at the lyrics. It is totally classic R.E.M. style, but it's the first time that they strayed from being the political college band they were known to be. R.E.M. reinvents themselves with each album, and this is proof of it. Is it their best album? No. But it still is fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this first... you might want to skip it altogether","review":"Oddly enough, this is the last R.E.M. album I bought -- after buying every other album except their last release, \\"UP\\". Had I bought this first, it probably would have been my last. Yes, \\"Losing My Religion\\" is a good song. However, with eleven tracks, you might say that the CD has too many tracks...Only three songs (LMR, Texarkana, and Me In Honey) are worth listening to, \\"Near Wild Heaven\\" just missed, \\"Low\\" and \\"Belong\\" are ridiculous, and ... well, \\"Shiny Happy People\\"? Need I say more?Make no mistake, R.E.M. are probably the best band in recent memory, and are (by far) my favorite band -- I bought tickets for the current tour 1,200 miles from home.But this momentary side trip into artsy-craftsy, largely frivolous tunes was (thankfully) short.R.E.M.'s Best Music: AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE.

This is REM at their weakest. I am still stunned at how people can call this a masterpiece. After the so-so \\"Green\\" album , I was highly anticipating this release back in '91. I had heard \\"Losing my religion\\" beforehand on the radio which I think is a good (but not great) song. So I thought there was some promise there. How wrong was I? The first track on this cd \\"Radio song\\" is downright scary!! I almost felt embarrased for the band. The rest of this cd wonders down the road of mediocrety at best. If you're wanting to taste the \\"True\\" R.E.M., I suggest trying \\"Life's Rich pageant\\" and \\"Document\\". Those are good starters. If you want the best R.E.M. album, (in most people's opinion including mine) try out \\"Murmur\\". Luckly, after this \\"Out of time\\" disappointment, \\"Automatic for the people\\" came out and restored my faith in R.E.M. once again. Don't get this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"REM sells Out!","review":"This is by far my least favorite album by the boys.

What gets me is, if a band can construct a masterpiece like 'Religion' for an album, how can they bring themselves to compose really-oh-so-boring music...perhaps they saved the quality for \\"Automatic For The People\\" which is their best, and a superior, creation. Two stars for the jewel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shiny Happy Garbage","review":"For someone like me who had been onboard the REM Express since the early days, \\"Out of Time\\" served as my cue to now exit the train. As if enlisting the help of KRS-One on \\"Radio Song\\" wasn't bad enough (no disrespect to KRS, BDP were fantastic in their own right and you were simply helping REM put lipstick on a pig), Stipe and the boys dragged a B-52 onboard for \\"Shiny Happy People\\". What resulted was the band's most pathetic recording to date. If this album represents your first exposure to REM and you liked what you heard, then pay no attention to this review or any REM records prior to \\"Green\\". However if you cut your teeth on \\"Radio Free Europe\\" and \\"Seven Chinese Brothers\\", then don't be alarmed when blood pours out of your ears after listening to this album...the very definition of a \\"Traveshamockery\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"When I heard the brilliant \\"loosing my religion\\" single in 91' I was instantly hooked on REM.

But I was very disappointed with this album. I hate to say anything bad about them because I love their music so much, but I really hate this album. I own it, but in all honesty I never listen to it. That's why the rating is a little harsh. It's not that I haven't tried. Even the other day I gave it another listen, but I simply don't like it and don't see why everyone else does.

So thankfully they have made up for writing possibly the worst song in history \\"shiny happy people\\". \\"Near wild heaven\\" and \\"radio song\\" are not much better, those songs are so unlike REM and i'll never forgive them. The rap in \\"The outsiders\\" from \\"Around the sun\\" is sensible and fits in well with the song but on \\"radio song\\" the rapping is ridiculous and childish (it reminds me of Usher). This band is probably the greatest alternative rock band ever, they should never have made an album so happy and pop-orientated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Too bad Nirvana's Nevermind had to come out at the same time and overshadow this cuz this CD's truly a lot better. I love every track on this album. Even if it didn't have Losing My Religion (which is one of their worst songs - too poppy), this CD would be awesome. The second half of this album just flows. And there's guest vocals, and Michael doesn't do all the singing. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Big REM fan writes a small REM review.","review":"Ok. I loved this album. It was easy to listen to and fun to listen to, and it of course, (its an REM album man) wasn't shallow. Some people didnt like it, I loved it. It was reflective, playful, light-hearted, and had some brilliant sounds. And I really loved \\"Endgame\\". But- my favourite tracks? Radio Song, Losing My Religion, Near Wild Heaven, Endgame, Belong, Half a World Away and Texarkana."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First REM Album","review":"I bought this album in 1991, mainly because \\"Losing My Religion\\" was on the radio, and not only was it a radio hit, it was actually a great song! I liked the album from the first, although there were parts (like \\"Endgame\\",\\"Belong\\" and \\"Texarkana\\") where the vocals and/or strings seemed a bit overly sweet to me. But I like them now. But I've never really warmed much to \\"Me in Honey\\". Not that it's bad, but it's not very interesting, musically. But although \\"Shiny Happy People\\"'s lyrics may be off-putting to some, they're nice enough to me, and it sure is catchy. Better though are \\"Low\\", with its moody organ, and \\"Half a World Away\\" a harpsichord-driven number that is simply one of REM's best. I have also grown to love \\"Near Wild Heaven\\". \\"Country Feedback\\" is a great track too, with more moody organ and loud guitar making a fine backdrop to the exasperated lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of REMs Best","review":"I love this CD. The upbeat pop sound mixed with rap of \\"Radio Song\\", and the absolutely fun \\"Shiny Happy People\\", both are great songs to listen to.

I also enjoyed the vocals on \\"Low\\"- they are quite different and add variety to the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping the Faith","review":"\\"Losing My Religion,\\" is perhaps the best R.E.M. song to hit the singles chart, overplayed as it might have been on the radio. For an anedote, try the rap-flavored \\"Radio Song.\\" The rest of \\"Out of Time\\" is uneven, with great songs such as \\"Belong,\\" and \\"Me in Honey\\" interspersed with lesser tracks like the turgid \\"Low,\\" and \\"Country Feedback.\\" Whatever this album may lack in the pure rock energy from the band's early days, it at least makes up for with mature song craft. Overall, a good start to the 1990s for the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best REM cd to date!","review":"Best REM album to date. Not a bad song on the cd. REM has proven once again that they are the best band on this earth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A 'Pet Sounds' for the '90's and beyond","review":"People are free to disagree, but I think this is R.E.M.'s masterpiece and, more than anything else, it reminds me of the Beach Boys' 1966 tour-de-force 'Pet Sounds'. It shares many of the same qualities of that magnificent album. Clear, forceful, emotional vocals. Buoyant, memorable melodies. Songwriting that looks within with introspection and occasional weariness, but also celebrates something as simple as a good, sunshiny day surrounded by happy people. Graceful, string-laced arrangements. And at least four clear-cut classics: \\"Losing My Religion\\", \\"Near Wild Heaven\\", \\"Half a World Away\\", and \\"Country Feedback\\". This is a wonderful record, and the crown on R.E.M.'s career thus far.Many consider 1992's 'Automatic for the People' a stronger album, but even though there were some great songs on that record (\\"Everybody Hurts\\" and \\"Man on the Moon\\"), I found it uneven overall. THIS is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was my first REM CD...","review":"but after listening, certainly not my last. Though not as good as Automatic For the People, this album is a poetic masterpiece. Stipe and the rest of REM write mainly in metaphors, which I think is a really great way to listen to a song. The words I believe speak to the masses and directly to whomever may be listening...songs like Country Feedback that describe an old relationship, or songs like (I know, I know, everyones favorite or least favorite...) Losing My Religion that basically describes a crush. You feel like you know this band after giving this one or two listens straight thru...but I must admit...if you aer going to buy an REM album and it is your first one...don't even think about buying this one. It is slow, and turned me off from the band at first....but now...they are my new \\"adopted\\" band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a total bore","review":"this cd completely sucks. I was never a big R.E.M. fan in the first place, but I do like Monster and Automatic and most of Green and Murmur... but this album is terrible.

Out of Time came in the middle of the Gulf War, and it was exactly what America needed--peaceful, pastoral, and baroque. Songs like \\"Religion\\" and \\"Country Feedback\\" showed that the world had a dark side, but most of Out of Time is focused on the beauty to be found.R.E.M. accomplish their tasks by leaving electric guitars behind, deciding instead to focus on mandolins, acoustic guitars, and elaborate string arrangements. Bassist Mike Mills takes his first lead vocals since Lifes Rich Pageant on \\"Texarkana\\" and \\"Near Wild Heaven,\\" and his singing style is considerably less angsty than Michael Stipe's.Still, Out of Time is just a warm-up for the band's real acoustic masterpiece, 1992's Automatic for the People."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellant album from one of the all time great bands","review":"What can I say, evrysong on this album is distinct and orignal.

This is the one which broke them big commercially and deservedly so as it is a fine piece of work and perhaps their most accessible to date. Do not take this to mean that this album is a sell out, it is far from that. What REM did was change people's perception of commercial or mainstream, in other words they bought the mainstream to them, not the other way around. Punters were ready for something different but not totally left field and this album was it. It probably disappoints the fan that was with them from the beginning that now everyone else was listening to \\"their\\" band and it wasn't so exclusive anymore, but that's life.

Sure, it was popular and earned massive sales and airplay, but don't hold that against it.This is a Tour De Force from start to finish. No clunkers here. \\"Losing My Religion\\" was so popular that it is easy to ignore, but has there ever been a more compelling song ever made? \\"Shiny Happy People\\" is the most misunderstood, ironic R.E.M. song.

Classical instrumentation abounds to negative effect. and Kate Pearson reaffirms herself as a vocalist best seen and not heard on the tracks where she adds to the clutter.Only the hit \\"Losing My Religion\\" (which is a hands-down classic), the repetative \\"Low\\" and \\"Half A World Away\\" are up to the usual standard.Unfortunately, R.E.M. would never be the same again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faustian","review":"Never has a band taken so long to achieve superstardom, never has a band become irrelevant so quickly. This was their eagerly awaited breakthrough album but it came at too high a price. Desperate, it seems, to do the unexpected for their first Warner Bros release the group diluted the distinctive sound of Life's Rich Pageant, Document and Green, anxious not to be seen to cash in on a winning formula. The result is an album whose first side is unlistenable, its second requiring use of the programme button to select \`Half a World Away' (just), \`Country Feedback' and \`Me in Honey'. Oh, and for a band whose covers were always pretty ropey (think Fables of the Reconstruction), Out of Time plumbs new depths of banality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember when these guys were good?","review":"So R.E.M.'s breakthrough turns out to be completely inconsequential after all, with a couple exceptions: the massively catchy \\"Radio Song\\", folk-rocker \\"Me in Honey\\" (though I don't like the droning backup vocals), \\"Near Wild Heaven\\", sung by Mike Mills, and especially the inescapable hit \\"Losing My Religion\\", with an infinite number of hooks. But this album is equally inclined to wallow in miserable lite folk-rock like \\"Half a World Away\\", \\"Low\\" or \\"Belong\\".

Ironically, it's not that the songs are too bad, they just don't gel AT ALL. There are some great songs here - Me In Honey, Country Feedback, Texarkana, Belong, Half A World Away, but REM should never be forgiven for three of the most annoying songs of the nineites: Radio Song, Losing My Religion and Shiny Happy People. Four if you include Near Wild Heaven (Da da da da da da da da da yeah, yeah). This was the first REM album I ever bought, and it took me 2 years before I dared touch another.

It has one of the most famous and most played REM downbeat singles \\"Losing My Religion\\" which is a good song. \\"Low\\" the other kind of downbeat song goes well with the single. It has cool congas, organ, and dreary vocals from Stipe. These are two good downbeat gems from REM...ONe of the best parts of this album.\\"Near Wild Heaven\\" and \\"Shiny Happy People\\" are my two other favorite songs. \\"Near Wild Heaven\\" features some great contributions on extra high vocals from Mike and Bill backing up Stipe which really give the song great pop edge. It almost seems like a 50's pop song or just maybe a Big Star song...both I guess. Shiny Happy People has strings and just is ultra catchy. With female backing vocals to add to Stipes and Buck still does the jangly thing on this track...it's great.Other Highlights=Radio Song, Me in Honey, Half a World Away."},{"rating":"1","title":"REM's worst record? Sure!","review":"I'm a huge REM fan, but if it were somehow up to me I'd end this business about \\"Out of Time\\" being REM's best album. If you listen to REM's early records (namely, the first three) what you get is a group full of originality, with lyrical ambiguity, guitars that jangle, melodies that are timeless, and so forth.With \\"Out of Time\\" ironically, you get a record that is very much *not* timeless. In fact it's basically your typical radio pop ...! If REM could ever be accused of selling-out artistically, this is the one that did it. \\"Green\\", for me, was a hint of trouble to come, but \\"Out of Time\\" embodies everything that I don't like about REM.

Most of REM's tunes are sentimental to a certain degree, but this weepfest is downright whiny.

He spends excessive amounts of time fantasizing about David's treasure and engaging in gross speculation. This is a Bible centered work that cannot see any options outside the confines of the Bible.

So, we try to be culturally sensitive to different views of what makes a happy ending. However, both my daughter and I found it disturbing that the adorable rice cake which had been anthropomorphized for several pages was eaten. My daughter and I discussed how the gingerbread gets eaten in some versions too, and that this reflects different views of storytelling. However, this did little to make her feel better for the cute eaten rice cake. She couldn't sleep--definitely not a bedtime story. Beware if you are used to sanitized fairy tales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs Up!","review":"The Runaway Rice Cake was a delight to my 6-year-old daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it to her. Since the main story line is a familiar one it was fun for her to draw comparisons to the gingerbread man and the shortbread girl, both tales she has enjoyed in the past. This version of the tale also brings with it a message about sharing. (Makes Mom happy!) At the end of the book there is a page long description of how Chinese New Year is celebrated which was interesting to us both. My daughter was particularly excited about the bonus of two recipes for Nian-Gao. She loves to help in the kitchen and the recipes appear to be simple enough that she can do the measuring and mixing on her own and my contribution should be minor. I give this book a hearty 'Thumbs Up'!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You thought Settlers was already perfect? Wrong.","review":"Settlers of Catan is one of the best games to come out in a long time so expansions were inevitable. But believe it or not, this expansion actually makes Settlers of Catan even more fun. It adds a little complexity (but not much which is good because part of Settler's charm is its simplicity) and even more variability. In addition to the known starting board, there are unknown hexes that get flipped over as you explore them. This expansion doesn't even make the game take much longer. I highly recommend this expansion for long-time Settlers fans and for people who are just discovering the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Families Favorite Game","review":"The Catan Games are worth the money that you put into them. It is an exciting game that changes every time you set it up, both by plan and by chance. Our 9 year old plays at times by herself and at times with her dad to learn better strategy. This is THE game we play whenever we have time to play.Catan, itself, is a great game with the strategy of planning and building. Adding the ships and islands through Seafarers only bumps up the strategy of the game which adds more excitement and opportunities. The best part...no matter the game, it generally takes about 2 hours to finish. Not like Civilizations which is an all day game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new dimension for Settlers of Catan","review":"This is an expansion for the Settlers Of Catan game and offers some new dimensions to the fascinating game.With Seafarers, players have the ability to travel by sea to other islands instead of just being confined to the main island of Catan.As with the original game, the actual board changes with each game played. Unlike the original, there are different island setups. With the additional islands, there are scenarios where players not only need a power base, but also a certain presence among the islands.Seafarers adds new dimensions to Settlers of Catan, and thus it also adds a little to the length of the game (although some scenarios are faster than others), but the fun remains the same as in the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr Missasouga IceDogs, Rockin' Em & Sock' Em into the 21st Century...","review":"Congrats on ten great years of tapes,Don.

Also the whole anxious plan for promoting books 1 and 2 and 3 seems not adequate for someone who has some talented and spiritual words to say.

He talks about important issues, issues that I think all Americans should be aware of, however I think there are better books out there that discuss these issues in a much more objective (though nothing is ever entirely objective) and informed manner. If I ever would have believed that this phenom was for real, that possibility was blown out of the water when Walsh turned his book trilogy into a money making franchise that includes CD's, journals, companion books, a book for teens, and countless other pieces of merchandise.

He points out the fact there there are two previous books so many times in his conversation that he is obviously trying to get readers to buy them all. If these books are so good you would want to buy them all and he wouldn't need to advertise that there are other books on the way or already written. I couldn't read past the point where he started talking about the seven chakra levels and so much other drug induced ideas.

This book is equally as good and is definitely a must read for all those who have read the first two books from this series.There is of course not much that I can write about this book since those who have read the first two, just cant stop themselves of buying this third one form the series.So enjoy reading and all the bestHappy Reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter the Matrix...","review":"I started with \\"A Course in Miracles\\".

I had to tell the truth of it though. This book is different only in that it got published and was recieved by the secular world, but I can point you to some that are given away, and look just like it. Check out spirit writing folks.

I can't help but feel the author is just giving the reader his own inner feelings. I'm concerned that the author was so concerned with his finances .Think about it this is a great way to make money , writing a book from God. This author was also had a radio show under a different name of course. In which he expressed some of the same views on radio before he wrote these books.

Here is a man purportedly 'channeling' God - A God made in his own image and likeness.This God is politically correct, ecologically correct, sexually correct etc etc.The book contains all the shibbloeths of the new age and I'm sure has set up the author to be the 'guru' of a new movement.If you want a God that is a moron, then these books are for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"enlightening","review":"allow yourself to doubt, that's okay. On the other hand being closed with a defense attack already in place doesn't accomplish even a reason to open the books.

Neale Walsch's books teach us at least one thing...forget what is written and ask God for a one on one conversation!

I believe that the author is just looking for a poor excuse to do anything he wants and get away with it in a very discreet way, which would hopefully be acceptable to society. Obviously not!

Now my friend is in a Heavy Metal band and his reaction while he got all three books caused him to give me a huge hug and even a bit teary eyed for several minutes. I am not entirely sure what exactly caused this reaction. It is possible that he understood that when I spoke of these books to him weeks prior that he asked to borrow them sometime. I did one better and bought them all again. I gift wrapped it and gave it in person as said before. Now to the book part, it is not only that touching and incredibly idealistic for a better life for all humanity but it can cause a reaction from someone who is not big on \\"G-D\\" to get such great feelings.

I think there is much of God in the words.Unfortunately, as Walsch has continued writing, each of his books has more of Neale and less of God in them. Book one was very clearly inspired by spirit, book two was somewhat spirit inspired and book three is mostly Neale Donald Walsch's ego pretending to write inspired words. Tis a pity. Success can be challenging.However Mr Walsch did inadvertently provide a massive amount of entertainment in the form of the Amazon reviews that Christians have written. They can all be summed up as \\"The Book Wars\\".Basically. \\"My special book is the word of God and your book was written by the devil.\\"Jews, Mormons, Christians, Muslims, Scientologists, etc, etc, all have their special book. Each says that God wrote one book and one book only and that all the other books are blasphemous.Silly but entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning, life changing, humourous, breathtaking, revealing.","review":"God's humour is what delights me most about book 3.

We are told of where we currently are on the evolutionary scale. We can all look back on past lives and we are given the simple tools as to how this is done.A warning is presented to us and we are asked to seriously consider the ramifications of not changing our world consciousness.

You don't have to believe everything you read, because you'll know when you read it if it rings true in your heart and soul.

However, if you have some grass-challenged sections of your yard, this is not a good product for you. It works so well because it glides through the grass and under the poop for a nice scoop.

It doesn't take up a lot of space, scoops the poo out of the grass & weathers the outdoors, all at a very reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ultimate way to pick up poo (not with this scooper)","review":"Here's my way. My intent in sharing is nothing less than to make the world a cleaner place, wherein dog poo never makes contact with the ground (until it enters a landfill). I'm not kidding. In short, never let the sh!t touch the ground - put your hand in the bag and use it like a mitt to catch the turds as they emerge from your pooch's bottom. Use a bag without holes (blown up and pressure-tested), and have the mitt at the ready. If your dog pops a squat as quickly as mine does, then you'll be too late if you have to fish the bag out of your pocket first. In my opinion, this technique is less gross than using a bag or scooper to fish poop out of the grass, which often leaves fecal matter behind. Moreover, it inarguably leaves less trace on the ground, zero actually, than the pick-it-up-after-it's-down method."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wire Pooper Scooper for Grass","review":"Just received the pooper scooper today. Used it right away and it was awesome. So easy to clean up poop with this rake. Slide the rake right under the poop, lift up out of the grass, dispose of poop, and hose off. Easy as 1-2-3. We have a medium size dog, so I don't know how it would work with \\"little\\" poops, but the wires seem pretty close together. However, it definitely works better when poop is not \\"fresh\\". I would recommend this rake to anyone who needs to clean up after their dog--it makes \\"Poop Patrol\\" a little less disgusting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the Best!","review":"Received this today, just in time to use before I mowed. Wow! It took me 1/2 the time of the other typical \\"pooper scoopers\\", & no mess! I got up all the poop from 2 large dogs, even the looser kind, from tall grass without hurting the grass. The angle of the scoop makes it easy to pick up the poop & dump it into a bag lined bucket with one hand, too, which is something I wondered about. I have purchased 3 or 4 of the typical \\"jaw\\" type of scoops within the last couple of years; each smeared the poop, didn't pick it all up, & broke in a short period of time. Also, each cost more than this simple & effective scoop! This product has nothing to break, will not rust, cleans easily, & hangs in the shed when not in use. It will last a lifetime! I am sooooo glad I tried this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"My husband and I were skeptical at first because the simplicity of design though when we actually scooped the poop it lifted out of the grass without a dropping lost.

It's not that expensive, and maybe it will work for you, but with St. Augustine grass, I found it difficult to use..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked it at first...","review":"So, I liked this scooper a lot at first. However, after a few uses the wire teeth would get caught on the grass making them bend. Then I'd have to use the fence or something to straighten them. It got to the point where they wouldn't straighten anymore, making it nearly impossible to scoop. Yesterday, it finally snapped after trying to straighten it so much. I had it about a month.

First it seems to always get caught in the grass and its like I'm having a tug of war with the grass over the poop, the worst part is when I pull to hard and rip up grass and it flings at me. Secondly one of the wires bent on it nothing worse than having to re bend the wire on the pooper scooper. Will be looking for a new pooper scooper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for grass","review":"I've always used spring loaded claw type scoopers, but this is way better. Simple, easy, and works awesome on grass. It's not good on other surfaces (i.e. gravel/pavement). Also, if your dog has tiny poop it will fall between the spaces."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Pooper Scooper!","review":"I ordered one of these back in January of 2012, after we had brought our first puppy home. It is one of the best dog-related items that we have purchased this year! Now that our dog weighs well over 70 lbs., and his messes have gotten much larger, it is even more appreciated. It makes cleaning up our yard so quick and easy - and we never have to touch any of the dog's messes. I just ordered another one, after watching my Dad pick up after his dog with a shovel and hoe, and a plastic bag in hand. It looked so difficult, and I immediately thought of this item for him as well. I plan on giving it to him for Christmas - and I am sure that he is going to think it is one of the best presents he will have received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for small poop & tines broke","review":"I thought this one would work really well, however, it's not very good for small dog poop (falls through) and you have to balance the poop on it until you reach your final dumping ground, otherwise, it just slides off. I only had mine a couple of months when one of the tines broke off. Once that happens, forget trying to pick up anything. I'll be looking for a more sturdy, functional one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best poop scooper to use on grass.","review":"this is the best scooper I've ever used.

I could not find it in any retail store. it's easy to use with one hand, unlike others available at retail stores which are two pieces and work like an awkward broom and dustpan. This scooper is also much more inexpensive than the ones at the retail stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but falls short","review":"Good concept overall but it isn't quite doing the job for me. Unless you have perfect/short grass then this won't work all that great. The metal isn't very thick and if one of the rake 'fingers' gets caught up on grass it bends. The fingers are a bit spaced out so it is better suited for larger dogs probably. The thing overall is a bit short so requires bending over a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one you want to buy","review":"It was difficult for me to believe that a small rake could make my life better. We have a large Labradoodle who does more than his fair share to our yard. This makes the job manageable. I really don't think you need to spring for some gizmo that has bags on it. Just use this to scoop it up and toss it in a bag. It does its job well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Awesome!","review":"This scooper works great!

The tines are too far apart to pick up all the poop, pieces just fall right through. My large dogs are fed raw so even the 90lb dog has really small poop, it's almost impossible to pick all of it up.

What good is it if I have to shove it with my foot? Plus, as others have mentioned, the tines bend relatively easily, making the scooper very difficult to use. Even with my foot I have a hard time getting the turd up and over bent tines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this pooper scooper.

Its a pain in the butt to get the poop off the ground, and even worse if you are trying to empty poop from the scooper into a bag.

Now, the last problem is the structure has come apart, (unglued) from the vertical handle. Useless now. (check out the photo I uploaded to illustrate the cheap material and poor construction).2. The system is absurd, let's the poop slide, so it takes me 3 times longer to grab and hold the turds to take them to the disposal location. Its me chasing turds around the grass, for 30 minutes.

If you think you are ever going to get the little poop your WRONG.. it is just going to fall right through. And then to get the poop off the rack and into the bag you have to bang it just to get it off.. It sticks to the rack..

This is the first German class I have taken in college and I feel like the examples used are irrelevant to words/phrases that I will ever use.

The most frustrating thing about it is the fact that there is no way to reference anything. When you are trying to use it in conjunction with the workbook it becomes very apparent. You end up paging through each chapter individually to try to find the information that you need, and the chapters themselves are arranged chaotically. When you do find the information you need, expect to find it sprinkled with words you haven't learned yet and, again, have no way to reference. I am not excited to hold on to this book for future levels of German, but unfortunately, at my school, the curriculum and textbook is set by the department so it's not changing. Unless of course between now and next semester they come out with a new edition, rendering mine useless and void of any resale value.

I was not impressed with this author's writing style mainly because of the many inconsistencies throughout the book. I wish she could have spent more time developing her characters. The use of profanity was overbearing and was a real turn-off.

So I spent the better part of a morning cruising shelves at a couple of bookstores, until I came across GRAMMAR POWER by Jane Schwartz. It fits the bill perfectly. No, it's not an ESL reference, but what my student needs is a handy reference for things he needs to be reminded of, and it's as necessary for him as it is for my students for whom English is a first language!This little book is concise, topical, and energetic, and for anyone who needs to be reminded of--or freshly informed about-- the underpinnings of writing and speaking in English, this is it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let The Buyer Beware","review":"I bought this book after hearing an NPR interview with the author. My mistake. Blyth sounds better than she reads. While some of the issues she discusses may be relevant, her writing style is repetitive & bludgeoning & her continual whine that the business she profited from is exploitive & manipulative is not a new concept. Authors much more articulate & eloquent have been discussing it for years & any woman with basic common sense can see through the industry's ploys without Blyth's finger-pointing. Women are already thinking for themselves & have been for generations so spare us your self-serving instruction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gossipy and gloomy","review":"Myrna Blyth claims that women's magazines conspire against women to make them victims. Well, they might, but her book does exactly the same thing: it tells women that they are victims of a conspiracy to make them victims!I do not accept that women are victims. Women are able to think for themselves. I trust in women's ability to think; the majority of women will not accept (let alone buy!) something that if they are unhappy with it. There is the possibility that there are large numbers of magazines giving women similar messages BECAUSE women want those messages.'Spin Sisters' is not a good book. Blyth aims to be scholarly, but her arguments are illogical, contradictory and incomplete. She tells some amusing anecdotes, and that is is the main virtue of her book. But it seems rather sad that she can only reinforce the \\"You are a victim!\\" message, instead of giving women something positive to consider - wouldn't that be far more valuable?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive","review":"There is no need to read past the first chapter -- she just says the same thing over and over.

Myrna's got a brand new bag!","review":"This shrill, silly, thinly argued book obviously is intended to launch Myrna Blyth's career change from women's magazine editor to the newest conservative pundette. She finds conspiracy and victimhood behind each service piece, insisting the ladies' mags are selling \\"unhappiness\\" with what she sees as its inseparable twin, \\"liberalism.\\"Blyth spent more twenty years (which must have been the sheerest hell for her, suppressing all those opinions) at the helm of Ladies Home Journal. This is a magazine I respect quite a bit, so the undiluted spleenishness of \\"Spin Sisters\\" surprised me. However, she probably will be around for awhile, sharing the banquette-and-microphone circuit with Ann Coulter, so we'll just have to get used to her, alas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about selling women short!","review":"This author certainly does, as if women haven't read these magazines and laughed over 80% of content for decades!

After years of selling women a bill of goods about their looks, age, and health, she now further divides us with partisan politics. She falls back on the old liberal media myth, conveniently forgetting things like Reagan speech-writer Peggy Noonan's long-running commentary page in Good Housekeeping or the fawning profiles of Barbara Bush, Nancy Reagan, Laura Bush, et al. in every mainstream glossy women's magazine. We deserved better then and now."},{"rating":"1","title":"guilty pleasure","review":"I have always considered women's magazines to be the perfect antidote to the cumulative effects of shrieking feminists. KatieMac says all heterosexual sex is rape? Redbook tells about \\"The sex skill men adore, and how to do it well.\\" There is something about squabbles between women that men just can't resist. Maybe it is the notion that they are fighting over us; that for all their lofty demands, what they really want is our attention.Anyway, I think women get along just fine. They want what they want and publishers are smart enough to give it to them. The only real stress in women's lives (qua women) is trying to convince themselves they want something more than a high-status male and lots of children to secure her place in his cozy household.This book has entertainment value but not much else. Blythe offers no insight as to what message the women's media industry SHOULD be offering women but she does dish delightfully on her former covenmates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opener For Naive Conservative","review":"Wow. And I thought I could trust Glamour to guide my political views. Well, not really, but this book gave me a new perspective on all forms of media. I can't even read women's magazines anymore, and that doesn't really upset me. Blyth gives poignant examples of blatant bias and fear tactics used by the media. It's opened my eyes to how the media treats and thinks of women: weak, stressed, and afraid. And they want to keep us that way. Read this book (which is very well written, and for me, a couldn't-put-it-down read) and you will never look at Katie Couric the same way again. And really, is that such a loss either?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable and interesting","review":"Let me start by saying that I am very much a liberal Democrat, and the right-wing slant of this book did bother me a bit. (Especially the relentless Hillary-bashing!) And I agree with a lot of the reviewers that Ms. Blyth seems unnecessarily catty and vicious about a lot of her colleagues, as well as about a lot of famous people (e.g., Susan Sarandon). Frankly I'm surprised that she's burning so many bridges! However, I still found it an excellent read. Sure, an educated woman may already know that the women's mags are full of crap, but I'm not sure that teenagers do. I certainly was very influenced by those mags when I was a kid -- in fact, I'm sure that Seventeen had a lot to do with my becoming anorexic and then bulimic.

If the author had provided a true account of Lincoln's life, the title would have been \\"With Malice Toward Many.\\" Lincoln basically made America safe for centralized government and big government spenders who delight in the squandering of taxpayer money. The present regime would be the utopia Lincoln yearned for. To this day, Lincoln remains the only president in American history to raise an army to attack his own people.

I await a thorough discussion of the Dahlgren Raid and its implications, I await a real assessment of the Lincoln/Seward relationship, and I await a real judgement on Lincoln's lack of religious belief.

Manchester Metropolitan University."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely amazing book!","review":"I sure wish I had read this book when I had to take American History in high school. This makes the civil war in general, and Abraham Lincoln in particular, come so alive. The novel format is perfect, with it's short sections and chapters. You learn history without feeling like you need to memorize dates and battlefield movements.It brings home the point that we were very fortunate that Lincoln was our President at that time.Strongly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"With Malice Towards None","review":"This is one of the best books, fiction or non-fiction, that I have ever read. Oates' writing style is most enjoyable and his analysis most insightful. As a history student I have found no better biography of Pres. Lincoln and doubt I ever will. I cannot recommend it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had no idea Lincoln's life was so hard!","review":"Very enlightening biography. Shows the man behind the myth as a maybe-better-than-average man in a very difficult time very different from our own"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures Lincoln's mythological \\"essence\\" and humor","review":"Not as detailed as other biographies (e.g., David Herbert Donald's more recent biography), this book better captures the \\"essence\\" of Lincoln. After reading \\"Malice\\", I felt that I actually experienced Lincoln--his gentleness, his humor, his black moods and his strength. Over all, the book has a strong undercurrent of humor that makes it very enjoyable and easy to read. Moreover, despite the foregoing attributes, it does not seem that accuracy was sacrificed to enhance the the book's emotional appeal. This book is highly recommended. I have read it twice; and, I'm sure, in the distant future, I will read it again . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presents comprehensive and complex view of a popular icon.","review":"This book presents so much of the personality of Lincoln, I have felt I have read the final word on his consideration as a president and a person. This book did not flatter Lincoln in any way yet it did not disparage him either. Oates' understanding of the American culture at this time blended with his analysis of Licoln's character gives the reader much more than a simple presentation of an icon.Oates' style is as melodious and rhythmic as a Vivaldi concerto. He is now my favorite historical author.A must for a personal library section."},{"rating":"2","title":"With Malice Toward None","review":"I learned so much about the life of Abraham Lincoln as well as about his wife.

It definitely improves the grip on the Blackberry especially when I'm using it as a phone. It also serves as an excellent protector when I throw it in my purse. My two problems are that I wish there was more variety in the colors available similar to the Speck Ipod protective cases. (Come on guys! Women use these items too!) Also, the rubber strip between the screen and the keyboard has become loose and not fitted to the Blackberry in the week that I've had this case.

Usually, AMAZON and viewers reviews are a good guideline to choosing what to buy. Not this time. Very tame movie; definitely not what I was expecting. Nothing really gay about it, either; just a couple of high, male teenagers, supposedly going at it. It reminded me of movies of older times: you see a little un-sexy kissing at the beginnig of \\"the\\" scene and then cut to the next day. So, if what you are looking for is hot sex scenes, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, slow moving, attempts to 'get there' and doesn't","review":"This movie is very slow moving. He's on the bus... he's on the bus... he's still on the bus... we get it already! they do this throughout the movie. This movie could have been done in 1/2 the run time. The mono logs attempt to be deep, but fall short. They attempt at showing intimacy between the two boys and the girl in one scene in the boys room. All they do is hold each other and kiss and it's quite boring. Wish I could get my money back and the 2 hours of my life back! Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare footage!","review":"This too short VHS contains footage of some of Jordan Belson's films that are not available elsewhere. If you ever have the chance to see any of his film, go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Inspiration","review":"This book has great, inspirational photos and very good instructions. My main disappointment with it is the authors attitude toward silk paints (i.e., not dyes). I have used several varieties of the paints that are made to mimic dyes and find them to work very well, leave the silk soft and be very easy to use. They are a great way for a beginner to get started and try most of the same techniques used with dyes without the hassle of steaming or the toxicity. I am glad that I had some experience silk painting before I got this book because her attitude would have discouraged me from every trying. Aside from that - it's an excellent book, worth the price and full of great pictures to inspire you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful and Comprehensive Work on Silk Painting Techniques","review":"An excellent book! I have a number of silk painting and surface design books and this is by far the best I've seen. Lots of interesting history of the art as well as very detailed discussion of the materials and techniques used. Lots of photos to illustrate the material and the overall work in the photos shown is absolutely gorgeous. She provides the most comprehensive and valuable information I've found anywhere.

I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has young children who like to be read a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Product, don't buy","review":"I bought this product with the idea that it was going to soften and actually moisturize and take the frizz out of my hair. Well, it did the total opposite, it made my hair very stiff, dry and when I tried to flat iron it, it didn't take the frizz out of my hair at all. I am an African American woman with very dry, thick and frizzy hair. I really wanted to believe that this product would actually work on my thick, dry, curly and frizzy hair. But, it didn't. This product was very cheap. It was on sale and I only paid $5 something for it plus tax . This is junk in a bottle. I guess you really do get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"old products","review":"beware, these are very old products! I made the mistake of purchase 3 bottles and cannot/would not use them after realizing that they are probably several years old. the balm becomes dry and flaky in your hair and leaves a film. gross. otherwise this is a great product...just don't buy from this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Was Expecting","review":"I guess I was expecting this movie to be a more modern version of a classic \\"who dunnit\\" type of film with new twists (sort of a modern version of Agatha Christie's classic \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\") to keep the viewers attention span.Instead, however, this movie is more of a suspense/thriller... Take a naive, married couple with marital troubles deciding to travel across Siberia to Moscow. They met up with another couple (complete strangers, I might add) traveling the same route they are. The strangers are odd from the start and you suspect that something bad will happen and of course, something bad does occur....The entire plot/storyline is just horrible and cheesy, the married couple does stupid, naive things throughout the entire movie. The movie drags out and the characters act and do things that are strange and don't make sense. Even Woody Harrelson's acting was bad in this movie. This movie was a complete waste of time. No wonder I'd never heard of it before."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Where's the Mystery??\\" Train Mystery Movie...","review":"This movie is very, very slow. It takes forever for the set-up to switch gears and get the plot going. From that point on it's only moderately interesting. I recommend watching \\"A Simple Plan\\" over this. It's a similar of type of film but much, much more exciting and interesting. Woody Harrelson did have provide one or two fun moments in his \\"clueless American abroad\\" role, but overall, it's just not very satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"They mailed me the french version instead of the english one that I ordered. I've returned it, but I have yet to receive a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Suspense to the End","review":"Excellent suspense-thriller that keeps you guessing until the very end. The cold and bleak Siberian landscape added to the overall mood. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent thriller with Russia as a backdrop","review":"With so many \\"Hollywood\\" movies being made for a \\"dumbed down mass audience\\" movies like this; Eastern Promises, Tell no one, A Prophet, Ghost Writer, Devils Double, Triad Election, and a few others good movies are a breath of fresh air. Its an enjoyable thriller with a bit of Hitchcock.Spoiler alert- The only issue is the third act of the movie which needed more of a setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good thriller","review":"This thriller builds suspense so cleverly that even its most innocent scenes come to portend peril. Of course, any movie set in Siberia may do that for me, especially when it offers the possibility of freezing to death in the snow-covered expanses through which a couple of American kids and their rather dodgy compartment-mates are traveling. Particularly effective is the contrast between the icy vastness outside the train and the sweaty crowdedness inside among the vodka-swigging natives. The fact that most of the Russian characters speak no English leaves the protagonists and the viewer with few verbal clues as to the true intentions of the Russians, thereby heightening our uncertainty as to who's friendly and who's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trans-Siberian","review":"This movie is a sleeper. The actors were outstanding and the plot moved in such a way it was hard to determine the movies' outcome. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie!","review":"The movie ran slow in some parts, but the suspense kept my interest.One part is quite gory, but that happens. It's worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting \\"little\\" film.","review":"Hard to describe. Not: action; special effects; of great social consequences; thought provoking. Is, some: mystery; drama; cinematography. Not on anyones' top 10 or top 50 or even 500 but worth a look. Guess it could be a \\"date\\" flick. I did like it because of the actors and scenery."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thriller!","review":"This movie was a true \\"sleeper\\". In the tradition of Agatha Christie's \\"Orient Express\\", a trans-siberian train ride is full of unusual (dangerous?) characters. The viewer will wonder if any of the characters in the train are who they appear to be. There is a business with drug smuggling, and the people we meet are not always what we think they are. There are assorted twists in this story, especially the one we find at the very end of the movie. All the actors do a great job in their roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie that frustrates the watcher","review":"This movie was very frustrating to watch. The acting was not bad but the screenplay is what failed to deliver in this case. The sequence of events added up to me being frustrated shouting out why would you do that ect... This is a movie that if you like being frustrated or characters making poor decisions then you may like it but for me it was just too much stupidity to put up with. 2 stars at best in my book. Wait for it on a premium channel don't waste your money on a rental for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a trans Siberian stinker!","review":"This is a lousy digital video quality effort (ie subtitles tiny and blurred)layered on top of an overall weak film. The scenes and setting could have been wonderful, instead it has the feeling of a low budget $5,000 college level production.Buy? We wouldn't even rent this bomb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. This movie sucked. Slow plot, lousy acting and direction.","review":"Carlos and Jessie made this \\"slow mover\\" an absolute stinker. I hated this amateur effort so much, that I don't want to elaborate. Normally, I'd give away spoilers for a movie that sucked as much as this; but it's not worth the effort. Just look at the prices for the used DVDs (108 at 0.43 each) and that will tell you all you need to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore yawn","review":"One of the worst movies I've seen in the last couple of years. It is difficult to understand the good reviews of this one, which is certainly not the least bit comparable to Hitchcock, as some reviewers have said. Literally nothing interesting or meaningful happens for the first 45 minutes, except that the woman from one couple and the guy from the other couple give each other all kinds of predictable, sexually charged, boring looks from the across the train car. If you want to see sexual tension done right, watch Hitchcock's North By Northwest. (BTW, heads-up: there is an incredibly graphic torture scene about 2/3 of the way through the movie, in case you don't like that kind of thing.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"chilling tale in the cold!!!","review":"I can see this over & over!

Hitchcock came to mind--two regular folks drawn into an increasingly murky and dangerous world beyond their experience and understanding but having to decide and take actions anyway, always at their growing peril. What treats Harrelson and Kingsley are; both deliver seamless, compelling performances. Especially fun seeing Woody play against type. Refreshingly foreign: this is turf and situations and people we don't know. I found nothing to not like about this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Great Game","review":"We have had this game for years--bought one of the original ones back in the early 90s. Everyone that we have ever taught it enjoyed it and many immediately went to buy their own copy. The crayons do eventually break, but, hey, they're crayons!

It mixes both from the novel by Robert A. Heinlein and the first Starship Troopers movie. Fans of both movie and book will be satisfied with it. The story is not that complicated to understand. It is one of those pop corn movies that you just watch for fun and do not care too much of the story arc. Great film, loved the action scenes. I mean come-on who doesn't want to kill bugs.

The movie doesn't seem to have many fresh ideas compared to the other movies, but I still thought it was pretty epic.

This could also make a good advertisement for a game.You can see that this was made after the films as it is more of an extension of the films than an attempt to recreate the original writing. They were able to completely strip the film of any original thought that that Robert A. Heinlein was trying to express.What is even weirder is the voice over commentary of the film where they say they are trying to be true to the book. However I suspect they only read the first film script and have no idea that there was a book.Bottom line better suits cheaper dialog with a Japanese feel.Starship Troopers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst 10 dollars i have ever spent","review":"Should have stopped the movie after 15 minutes but I kept hoping it would get better.

They'll cut all of the nudity out, but it's CGI animation, so no big loss there. To give the program its due, the storyline is not bad. The movie incorporates a lot of CGI action sequences that are fun to watch. In addition, there are a number of memorable characters, traditional (Rico, Ibanez and Karl) as well as new (Trig, Hero and Chou, among others). However, the CGI animation is way over-used. It seems like the director is attempting to meld live actors with the CGI animation. However, the attempt fails miserably, primarily because he uses CGI for everything. Sadly, the fact that he used neither real sets or real actors in non-CGI animated roles, makes the movie appear more like an online video game rather than a serious movie. Bottom line: as produced, this movie was very disappointing in spite of the fact that many of the characters had great potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was BAD","review":"My son even got board.

How is it that a crowd of troopers, standing on level ground, with dozens and of their own men standing several layers deep directly in front of them can all fire straight ahead and not tear the men standing in front of them into bits? That's the kind of laziness this film is filled with - mediocre CGI and lazy direction lacking any kind of coherent story. You can get away with this in a video game because at least you get to spend your time just blowing stuff up, but in a movie it gets boring pretty fast. It's a shame that the Starship Troopers movies keep accelerating down hill.Still waiting for a film version that sticks much more closely to the book.

This is not a great movie. The plot seems a tad too simple, it lacks the social satire of the original, and there are parts that are either boring or where it is hard to care about some of the characters, but there are a number of really big positives in this movie. One, it's WAY better than Starship Troopers 2 or 3 (not much of a compliment, but it is worth mentioning). Two, the CGI animation is gorgeous, and presents a very pretty spectacle to watch. Three, a couple of the characters are actually given enough character to care about them, and personal investment in a Starship Troopers movie is nothing to sneer at. It's not great, but it is a lot better than I was expecting. I know fans of the first Starship Troopers have had their faith all but destroyed by the previous two films, but I think this is worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"Being a fan of ST and having read the book many years ago, it's great to see this forward adaptation come to life.

NAIHF combines the best of later-years REM into an experimental experience that's more cohesive than anything since Reckoning. Musically, it's definitely not a happy record like many of the IRS label records. The themes Michael Stipe go after on NAIHF are more broad and challenging. I think it's a better record than the very strong Automatic for the People, Out of Time and Reckoning albums. There's no question in my mind that it's leaps and bounds better than the crummy Monster, Up and Reveal albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great REM album","review":"This is one of my favorite REM albums.

It's got kind of an irritating quality and length to it at first, but these songs have such an atomic and raw feel to them. The vibe is wonderful once you've had it in your brain for a while. I expected to hear more songs like \\"e-bow the letter\\", which in my opinion is the greatest song ever made, but there is nothing else on here like that (although \\"electrolite\\" comes close).\\"Low Desert\\" is quite an unremarkable song at first, but it grows on you in an odd sort of way.This is definitely R.E.M.'s best album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sweet disapearance of our heros.","review":"We've all sat in the corner of our rooms mixing our sad, disapointing reality with the sweet melancholy of REM.

After running in the ranks of Lost Shepard's, \\"Farewell to Oakie\\", they now join the huge army of uninspired alternative rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"No memorable tracks","review":"\\"Thinking man's record\\"? People only apply those three words to albums that nobody would like otherwise unless they labeled it as something \\"challenging\\". If you have to force something down your own throat, it ain't good. There's a time when people should realize when they need to give up on a record, or else they're just kidding themselves. You can't fake liking something, so I don't know why people keep saying this stuff \\"grows on you\\". There's nothing special or fresh about \\"New Adventures\\". And what's so bad about radio hits? Maybe if you think you're better than the average Joe, you could say that you hate a band's radio hits, but unless you're that egotistical, there's no reason to say it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill Berry was wise to leave the band that put out this junk","review":"R.E.M. has created some really excellent songs, such as all of the songs on Murmur and most of the songs on Automatic For The People, to name but a few. But I think it can now be said that this band is out of ideas -- or at least is a heck of a lot more unreliable than it used to be. The first warning signs were the many missteps on Out Of Time. Then came Automatic For The People, which was a redemption of sorts, but also including Losing My Religion, one of the most irritating, vastly-overrated songs of all time. Then Monster proved that even previously great bands can put out PURE GARBAGE. New Adventures is just the latest example of decline. E-Bow The What?? Whatever...... Bill Berry flew the coop after this album. I don't blame him."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad State Of Affairs, a/k/a New Adventures In Lame","review":"It's sad to look at what REM became on this album, a disappointing follow-up to the equally disappointing \\"Monster.\\" Again, no melodies to speak of, badly constructed songs, and most pathetic of all, attempts at hip-hop moves that sound white-boy, wanna-be inauthentic. \\"Monster\\" proved that REM isn't a punk band; \\"New Adventures\\" proves that they can't be a modern \\"funky\\" down-wit-it band, either. What happened to just being yourself, Michael?I half suspect that Bill Berry didn't really have an aneurysm; he just heard the final mix on this album and decided to get out before it got any worse. Finally, this album is TOO LONG. They didn't write enough music to fill up the time, but then again they barely managed to write any songs at all on this one. For a long-time REM fan like me, this is a bitter pill to swallow, and I didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album","review":"Whomever revied this album as Bad or Sorry, clearly does not understand the meaning behind the band.

It is impossible to produce something that's not in the range of these two previous album. \\"New Adventures in Hi-Fi\\" definitely has new perspectives. With more guitar, drums, and Stipe's very unique voice, they just blend to an almost perfect album. With songs like \\"How the west was won and where it got us\\", \\"Undertow\\", \\"E-bow in the letter\\", \\"Leave\\", \\"Low Desert\\", etc,etc.... I think this album is the best R.E.M. has ever produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sum of many parts","review":"I agree that many, if not most, of the lyrical and thematic explorations don't come easy. The first few listens will probably not grab you like \\"Document\\" or \\"Automatic\\". However, over time, if you listen closely, the lyrics will trickle into recognition and the arrangments and instrumentation will start to blossom. Before you know it, you will realize that \\"Adventures\\" is better than most REM albums, which is in fact saying a lot, considering their history. It appears that REM's ride is almost done, but \\"Adventures\\" will someday prove that these guys were on top from beginning to end. Listen closely to \\"How The West Was Won\\", \\"New Test Leper\\", \\"E-Bow\\", \\"Bittersweet Me\\", and \\"Electrolite\\". One of the best of the 90s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overlooked Masterpiece of Journeying Alterna-Rockers","review":"I write now simply to give some words to a five-star contribution needed to raise the average of this masterpiece.It's overlooked. It's stark and loud and beautiful. This is everything Monster should have been and far more. This is the last best album R.E.M. made. The playing is smart and the singing is unbelievable.The new version is worth it, folks, and so is the old if you've not got the money for this.Nothing is as close and haunting here as Automatic for the People, but, like a desert thunderstorm, this record blows in electric and deafens while it terrifies. And then, when it's over, you think you've heard something simple, something unclear yet plain enough to listen to again just to understand and then maybe the clouds will clear up.But it's also a night album. And even when the clouds clear, you'll see that you've just driven into a pulsing, modern city under a black sky. This music is distant and playful and stark all at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"An probing, feeling album that lives up to its name","review":"What is truly fascinating about REM is the conspicuous variation between their recent albums. The group made no attempt to disguise the strange turn they took with Monster, living up to its title with brash, triumphant guitars that are at times overbearing, but always effective. New Adventures is a similarly unorthodox album for REM, replacing the smooth, escapist longing of their previous works with a tone that is at once gritty and curious. Songs like \\"Low Desert,\\" \\"Binky the Doormat\\" and \\"So Fast So Numb\\" convey an oddly fresh road-trip sound reminiscent of the Rolling Stones or Bob Dylan. In tracks such as \\"How the West was Won...,\\" and the album's best, \\"E-Bow the Letter,\\" REM offers a dark, deeply contemplative tone which resonates with maturity and wisdom. \\"Electrolyte,\\" the album's final track, with simplicity and sensibility initiates an entirely new adventure for REM: \\"i'm not scared - i'm outta here.\\"You lead, we'll follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Will Experience The World In Hi-Fi After Listening.","review":"First of all, i'm a major R.E.M fan. Their records are inspiring, talented, and fun to listen to. New Adventures in Hi-fi is no exception. Of course, I would recommend others such as \\"Document\\" or even better \\"Fables of the Reconstruction/Reconstruction of the Fables\\" for the first-time buyer. Like the best CDs, you may need to listen to this about 3 times to \\"get\\" it.

Be careful if you own the original album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their first bad album","review":"I didn't think they could do it, but they finally released a clunker -- New Adventures in Hi-Fi is not only their worst album; It's their most disappointing. It was supposed to be their spontaneous, easy-to make record, the one they wanted to make, instead of being constantly forced to change their sound. Unfortunately, all they could come up with is a lame hybrid of \\"Automatic\\" and \\"Monster.\\" I still think \\"Monster\\" is underrated, but it's pretty much accepted that \\"Automatic\\" was the band's best post-IRS record. New R.E.M. that still kicked. With \\"Monster\\" they changed sounds, added some wit. With \\"New Adventures\\"...they sound Tired, uninteresting. It really is their Chicago XXVI, their Adult Contemporary album. The band, when Berry packed his bags to farm, should have broken up instead of sissolving into a rock act. Well, we still have Reckoning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre \\"Adventures\\"","review":"With their second consecutive largely uninteresting album (musically anyway), R.E.M. officially joins the ranks of the has-beens. It was a great ride while it lasted. Few rock bands have released as many fine albums as they. Much has been made of the harrwoing and heart-felt lyrics on this one. Maybe so, but if the music is second rate the lyrics won't save it, especially from a band that used to deliberately obscure what they were singing. R.E.M. has gotten less interesting as Michael Stipe's vocals have become clearer. Unfortunately, these \\"Adventures\\" are the result of that trend."},{"rating":"1","title":"im old school","review":"Im an old school REM fan and could never get over what they became on the abysmal Document release and the ensuing decent into sheer goof-dom and commercial goo with most of their 90's material.

Be mine is one of the greatest songs Ive ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat album","review":"This album might just be a little better than Out Of Time but hardly by much. The album is very long, songs are wander aimlessly with no hooks or melodies.

Some of the songs are among their best work - Leave, Electrolyte, and particularly Be Mine - but overall it's a little lacking.Of course, the standards REM has set are so high that it's hard for me to be truly objective. This is the best American Band of all time (with possible exception of Allman Brothers.) On a strictly comparative basis, New Adventures is not up there with most of the IRS collection or Automatic or Up."},{"rating":"2","title":"KIller after 3-4 plays","review":"This, unlike some earlier REM albums, is definitely not a showcase for radio singles. Instead, it is a thinking-man's rock album that requires a straight through listen, and grows on you after time. The drumming here is suprisingly good and a bit different. Sometimes when a new member joins an established act, that memeber seeks to become a clone of previous success. That is not at all the case here, and I think the drumming is what keeps this album so alive. The songwriting is fresh, even if Stipe's nasal tenor has seen better days. The older Michael gets, the more he reminds me of Neil Young, which is not a bad thing at all. Some of the lyrics remain confusing, and at times its hard for me to grasp the message. Having said all that, I still feel myself reachuing for this record every few days. Not just for REM fans, this is a SOLID rock album.-Roddy"},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Pageant","review":"I just recently listened to this record again and have to say that I think it contains some of REM's best work since Pageant. The only songs I could have done without are \\"Departure\\" \\"Binky the Doormat\\" and \\"Low Desert\\". \\"Bittersweet Me\\" and \\"The Wake-Up Bomb\\" are classic REM songs that show that REM can rock in different ways then the distortion drenched sounds of Monster. I think if REM had edited the album down a little more, this would be their 90s equivalent of Pageant with an updated sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"\\"Adventures in Hi-Fi\\" starts out slow & tepid with \\"how the west was won\\" & doesn't get any better. The album's best song, \\"electrolite\\" is the last song on the album. In between those songs is 50 minutes plus of mediocre R.E.M music, with grotesque guitar feedback featured on nearly every song & a few discernable melodies thrown in occassionally. They really should have spent more time at the beach prior to making this unremarkable recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"the decline and fall continues . . .","review":"The most disappointing aspect of this album is its lack of focus. While REM lyrics have often been inscrutable, the music has been precise and evocative. Here, however, the songs are dull and muddled and repetitious. They've become drunk on distortion and use it to mask the inadequate melodies and arrangements. As hard as they may try, they are not David Bowie, Iggy Pop, T. Rex, or Mott the Hoople, and the glam accoutrements need to go.
