She constantly laughed behind the locals backs, it was very unprofessional and rude. Overall, both sections failed to show enough of the country. In the beginning one gets the sense that a lot of historical sites were going to be reviewed, but so. Not a lot is going on in this DVD. It really failed to capture Greece's spirit and culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disrespectful to Greeks","review":"I thought that Christina Chang made an absolute fool of herself in this video.

Both of them would play it for hours at a time. If your child is too young to coordinate the balls themselves I would sit with my daughter and one would be the so called \\"shooter\\" and the other for the placement of the balls. 2 people can easily play with this. I still have the older version of this game and adults like it too. The object is to match the colored balls to the design. There are 4 different designs that you can insert into the machine. It definitely teaches eye-hand coordination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pallino is a disappointment","review":"I bought this gift for my 5 year old. I thought it looked like a great educational toy.

We love this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for understanding ISDN and SS7","review":"This book is very book for readers who are new to ISDN and SS7 or interested in knowing about singaling networks. Examples are given with diagrams for easy understanding and that is what makes this book interesting while reading. There are some misprints which make reading difficult sometime. However, they are simple and can be quickly corrected by the reader themselves (with little focus).Best thing about this book is that it is for average audiance who do not have EE backgounrd and would like to have good understanding of the subject matter.I could have given it 5 stars as intro book to ISDN and SS7 but since editing is poor, it's only worth 4 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loudness as we know them: great...and loud!","review":"If you're a fan of Loudness, this album is a must for you. If you like \\"Law of Devil's land\\", you won't be sorry since many songs of this album are present on this live version.Exploder - Akira Takasaki's response to Van Halen's \\"Eruption\\"-is played even faster (and as well)on this than on \\"Disillusion\\".The recording is pretty good and the selection of songs is showing a large variety of styles.Loudness is not doubt one of the finest Heavy Metal band ever. This live album is giving them credit for it and their fans can - once again - enjoy another living proof of that fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comical poems about gap between hopes and reality","review":"The title poem is a 15-page verse play of nine scenes that is like a comical Moby Dick with the nonsensical, yet evocative, repartee of a Samuel Beckett play. The source of McSweeney's poems is a comic energy and skewed eye. The brief poem \\"Bugs Bunny, Or, The Mirror That Held a Little Camera,\\" beings, \\"I'm rundown. I've got a sunburn. These ears are my liability but they hold a lot....\\" Even when the comic style abates at times when a somber subject is raised, the language remains sharp and inventive, as in \\"Youth Image\\" where the poet writes, \\"One bus and then another passed with unresolving traffic of weird angles, logos,/a world that wouldn't math up....\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Good examples but with no instruction","review":"This book, as the rest of this series by Charusin lacks explanation; the examples are interesting, but the book consists only of move lists and diagrams with no explanation of the rationale behind the moves.It would probably be a good book if you have a master available to go with you through the games, but if you are an average chess player by me you will be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This is a really boring book. As you read it, you're always waiting to get to the interesting part that never really arrives. Hotten's writing style is very dry and the book reads like a textbook. He also constantly repeats the same things over and over again - yes, I already know that F1 is very expensive, Ferrari is passionate and Williams has great engineering.Even the layout of the book can get frustrating. The chapters don't flow well and the whole book comes off as being incoherent and repetitive. Hotten should have gathered all his facts and then let someone else write and edit the book for him, probably down to about half its current size. I'm not sure if I can recommend another book for people interested in learning about the F1 business, but I can certainly advise against getting this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased, sterile and boring.","review":"The author collected the background for his book exclusively from British sources and the result reads as an us -the British- versus them -the Europeans- accounting of grievances. The British teams are filled with geniuses while Hitler runs Mercedes Benz and Ferrari is filled with politicizing mumbling fools. The writing is sterile and filled with inaccuracies and one wonders how it is possible to write such a boring book about such an exciting sport.However when time came to sell this tome the publisher placed two F1 cars on the jacket, they are wisely both Ferraris."},{"rating":"1","title":"A serious disappointment","review":"Sometimes things are not what they appear to be on the cover. And this is one. If you want a DVD that is mostly interviews and interrupted music, this is for you. Cutting in and out of the outstanding perdormance of Pirates was horrible. This DVD is an injustice to a great band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the hard core","review":"Some great footage from the early days, but the bits are too far apart and too short. Most of the tunes on this disc from the Black moon tour aren't up to usual ELP standards.If you're looking for an ELP concert disc, this ain't the one. Get this one after you've gotten the rest.Also, I have to agree that this disc wasn't put together very well. Very hap hazard and disjointed. The sound's pretty good, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it","review":"Long-term ELP fans will be annoyed by the chatty dressing-room approach to the history of the band. None of the discussions were particularly interesting, and added nothing to the collection of videos. I'm sure there are better films of ELP out there, and someday a fine producer will make a better presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Image drops the ball","review":"It's a bit silly that Image included both a stereo and 5.1 DD soundtrack on ths disk because it's a direct port from the video and is almost entirely in mono!!!! Only two songs from the entire program are presented in stereo, and there is no use of center channel or surround. Of course, one would expect this for the older footage but for the 90's material this is inexcusible. As if that weren't enough, the audio tracks are very dirty with lots of digital artifacts. Unless you just can't live without the slightly improved video offered here or plan to watch it 1,000 times most ELP fans will probably want to stick with a VHS copy of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"ELP Not welcome back","review":"This dvd was disappointing, knowing of the quality of ELPs work made this dvd hard to swallow.First off the quality is low with popping and clicking across the entire length of this dvd. The fact that is from 1992 is no excuse, I have an Ozzy concert from same year with much higher quality. Then on top of this not one whole song is ever played constantly being over shadowed by talking in the middle of songs is no way to make a dvd thats what extras are for. Its apparent that these people {the ones who produced this} had no idea how to make a good dvd. I do not like a supposed concert dvd with less music then talking. Ohh well with the poor quality it does not matter all that much. I was expecting so much more out of one of my favorite bands of all time. Don't buy it unless your a hardcore ELP fan even then.... Try the new Live DVD from ELP it's much better. On a side note for pure reference it's intresting historical perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Waste of Money","review":"After reading the DVD box, I was looking forward to seeing a live performance by one of my all time favorite bands, but there's not one complete song on the entire DVD. Instead you get a tease of live footage and a lot of idle chatter that adds nothing. The sound quality is poor at best and the video footage is worse. Don't waste your money on this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, don't buy it!","review":"Emerson, Lake & Palmer are famous for their incredible music, and when you buy a DVD you want to listen to their music: well, this DVD has only history... a little live music here and there but 90% of all are words... ...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading box information","review":"Very frustrating! ELP is one of my all-time favorite bands and there are so few movies on them. I guess someone tried to make some bucks out of this situation. The info on the box is misleading. There is not a single complete song available in this disc. Several interviews and footage were old and already presented on the multimedia track of their King Biscuit Flour Hour Live CD. This disc is simply a patch of old material, not exactly a documentary project. The Dolby 5.1 track is awfully mixed, so bad that I preferred to listen to the Dolby 2.0 one.A shame to release a disc with mostly old interviews available elsewhere, and glimpses of live performances. I guess the new ELP Live at the Albert Hall is the one I should have bought. Unfortunately it wasn't available at the store on the day I was easily fooled to buy this one as a real ELP DVD. The Welcome Back DVD should be a freebie/complement to the Albert Hall Live DVD, not sold as a separate stand-alone item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible quality...poor rep of ELP and unprofessional master","review":"This is the worst DVD I've seen...I love ELP so was completely interested in it, having seen 3 dates on the Black Moon tour myself. However, the constant cutting off of songs for interviews (why not just insert the interviews BETWEEN the songs, instead of cutting them?) makes it an ANNOYING view. ALSO, there is a HORRIBLE mastering issue/mistake, where the surround channel only outputs from the Left rear in 5.1 mode, with NO right rear output. I expect to hear that the company either recalls this master and reissues it to purchasers, or that the company producing it is bankrupt. DON'T BUY UNLESS THIS PROBLEM GETS CORRECTED!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"respect to the only source of excitement . ZERO stars","review":"Our time will be remembered for its music, not its politicians. Who remembers which king ruled Austria during Mozart? The same must be said about producers of this DVD. Folks behind the scene decided to get on the wagon of history by cutting up some immortal music and mixing the pieces with some interviews with the musicians.Joking is not appropriate here. You, the scissors-happy fools need to know that in the Ukrainian coal mines in the 1970-th and 1980-th my now dead brothers were yelling \`oo a lucky man he was!\\" You owe some respect to the only source of excitement in the endless dark labyrinths.

Do not waste your money, and trust other reviewers who felt the same.It gets no star from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for the next comeback!","review":"When I bought this DVD I thought I would see more of the shows and less talking, or at least, the interviews apart from the shows (as Alice Cooper's Welcome to My Nightmare). Unfortunately most of music DVDs are released this way: interviews over the music/show. I liked the old footage, but I think there would be at least ONE complete song. ELP version of \\"Fanfare\\" is one of my favorite pieces but I didn't like the way they glued it from two different shows (it works best on CD). For die-hard fans only!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This DVD is disappointing even for a die-hard ELP fan like me. There is not one complete song on the entire DVD. Its value as a documentary is low due to poor video quality and bizarre combinations of interview clips overlaying what little music there is. Can I get my money back?"},{"rating":"1","title":"performances chopped up with cheesy interviews","review":"Don't waste you time on this. All of the performances are chopped up with cheesy interviews. On the other hand, if you are such a total ELP fan that you will enjoy little excerpts of performance mixed in with little excerpts of interviews, maybe you'll like. Personally, I don't get it, and I wish that I had known what it was before I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ripped off","review":"I didn't mean to click even one star.What I recieved was an unauthorizized COPY of a DVD that won't play.It's the only time I've been ripped off using your site, but I thought you should know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rudimentary Genius","review":"I am salivating over this CD, which I bought yesterday. I have always been a fan of Bruford, ever since watching his instructional video, Bill Bruford and the Beat. This just reinforces, and in fact enhances why he is just that amazing. The technical facility, his dexterity, and his intense coordination are simply mind-boggling! Allan Holdsworth and Jeff Berlin are equally incredible on this compilation. The band is tight through all of the crazy time changes, dynamic contrast, and everything in between. Bruford has inspired legions of drummers, and this album is just the tip of the iceberg.

Barry Chamish finds the loose ends, inconsistencies, contradictory testimony and evidence that abound regarding the assassination. My only regret is that while he presents the facts that clearly spell conspiracy, he doesn't come to a conclusion about who he suspects or knows is guilty of the actual murder. The book is explosive. I couldn't put it down. This and the book The Secret War Against the Jews are musts for people who want to really know all news fit to print and not what the powers that be want us to see.

Chamish reveals how the official story behind the Rabin murder cannot be true, and that, contrary to popular belief, Rabin was probably killed by people who were interested in promoting the peace process rather than stopping it.Chamish offers some theories on what may have transpired behind the scenes. When you read the book, remember that the purpose of these theories are (probably not) to give 100% correct answers to everything that transpired, but to give you an idea of what MAY have happened.

All in all, it could have been better although the song \\"Footloose\\" was really cool. If you have the extra cash, buy it.

But, since it is an OBC recording, I will say that it is THE worst one ever made. One might argue that even though it's bad material, it's fun to listen to. Sorry...it just gave me a splitting headache. This stuff is bad. Really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your into musicals, try RENT OBC cast recording instead.","review":"Footloose danced into our hearts years ago when Kevin Bacon danced across the big screen, yet with this stage adaptation nothing even moves. This recording features very talented people, some so talented we may see them in the broadway hit RENT one day. The songs are all rusty, and so is the plot of the musical which they sing about. The producers seemed to want the play to reach out to people of the younger generations. This cd can't though, especially when the characters rap about religious figures who danced (pathetic and true). Instead of purchasing this cd, for now you should purchase other cast recordings such as RENT, where people don't rap about religion, and clear meaningfull songs are presented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"This is one terrific cd! If you love musicals, this is sure to hype you up.

Do not buy this CD for the mostly forgettable score or most of the performances. Buy it for Dee Hoty's excellent performance as Vi, Reverend Shaw's wife, and the uniquely interesting \\"Learning to Be Silent.\\" Most of the rest of the disc--as well as most of the score and book from which this disc comes--can be left at the door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take off your sunday shoes and beat Dean Pitchford","review":"Wow! Is this show horrible! I'm sorry, I know the dancing is spectacular and everything, but since this is a review of the CD and not the show, I'm judging it simply on it's musical merit. It's repulsive! The lyrics are the most contrived and pointless things I have ever heard. Lines such as when Ren is refering to David in the bible he says 'Didn't like math, or geography, but check this out, he loved choreograpy'. That has to be one of the dumbest lyrics I have ever heard! There are two things, and two things only that save this CD, the songs 'Holding Out For A Hero', featuring a great fresh new arrangement of this classic 80's song, and the spine tingling 'Let's Hear It For The Boy', where the female playing Rusty delivers a vocal performance unlike anything heard for a long time on show CD's. And while these are great, shouldn't we expect more than that from a Broadway show? While it may be great to see, it's painful to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent recording","review":"This recording exudes JUST as much energy as the Broadway show did. This is a wonderful cast recording that captures the amazing performances of Jeremy Kushnier and Jennifer Laura Thompson - two of Broadway's newest young stars...as well as the always incredible Dee Hoty.

Sometimes raw and primeval, sometimes delicate and pensive, \\"Exposure\\" exposes every conceivable side of this complex man that you could ever want: apocalyptic ideologue, pedant, guitar wizard, narcissist, genious, and more. \\"Exposure\\" is a mass of musical contradictions and that's why it's one of the highlights of Fripp's career and probably his finest solo work to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Chop Shop","review":"Very simply, it's Fripp's most interesting album and the one in my collection that makes my hair stand on end. But in the process of transferring it to CD, it was butchered. There is a full minute and a half on music missing from the album, as well as Fripp's acerbic wit on some of the songs (esp. Haaden Two) and the most fasceted instrument lines were also eliminated from the album, like the missing echo from \\"here comes the flood\\", the synthesizer line from \\"NY3\\" and \\"Chicago\\". In the end it was given the same rotten treatment that they gave to Fleetwood Mac's \\"Tusk\\", an equally diverse and experimental album. Both CD's should be avoided like the plague. My best advice is just to get an LP Player and enjoy the vinyl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another slaughtered re-release","review":"This should have been the best re-release of Fripp's best album, but it's been botched again. They edit out so many of the instrument lines and audio hooks that it's not even worth the price of getting it. \\"Chicago\\" and \\"Exposure\\" are just bone-chilling on the original cassette and LP, \\"NY3\\" and \\"Here Comes the Flood\\" are missing a keyboard and an echo, respectively. Every song on the album has been altered in some way, or is not up to par because of the out-of-synch job done with the others.An avoidable re-release of an earth-moving album. I bought a fifty-cent cassette copy of the original version, and it runs circles around this cd copy that I own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass","review":"Obviously, this artist deserves a tremendous amount of respect for his contributions to music, given his strong reviews and work with other musicians. But, with the exception of a few tracks including either Hall or Gabriel, I don't see those contributions presented well here. It seems to be a freeform musical (not so much lyrical) exploration of something. As for Peter Gabriel's Here Comes The Flood, the version found here may stand above the one found on PG1, but the piano & vox version found on PG's Shaking The Tree record tops them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind.Blasted what culd be said.","review":"Musta been back wayyyyyabout 1980, listening to here comes the flood with that crazy scientist recording.With my girfriend in the 69 bug.

Just to clear up a few points from other reviews: That's Peter Hamill screeching on Disengage and Daryl Hall crooning on North Star. That's Narada Michael Walden not Phil Collins drumming on Breathless. Also Fripp had nothing to do w/ Peter Gabriel I. He hated the production on that album and convinced Gabriel to let him re-record the stripped down Here Comes the Flood (which includes a blatent missed note on the piano). Anyway, a great album, buy now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this...","review":"The sticker on the front of the package that the CD comes in calls this the \\"Sergeant Pepper of avant punk.\\" I wouldn't go quite that far, but this is surely an overlooked masterpiece.I had put off buying the old cd version of this album because of warnings that alternate cuts had replaced those appearing on the original vinyl version. The first disk of this double cd reissue appears to be the same (or close) to the original album. The version of \\"Here Comes the Flood\\" presented here, much better than the version appearing on the Peter Gabriel cd, makes this worth purchasing. Several other cuts, most notable \\"You Burn Me Up I'm a Cigarette\\" and \\"Mary\\" are also top rate. Some of the songs don't work (for me at least) but I prefer a cd that takes chances, even if not everything succeeds, over one that plays it safe with the same old same old.I haven't yet listened to the second cd but it doesn't matter - disk 1 is sufficient for a 5 star rating.Buy and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reissue of a classic album!","review":"This japanese Reissue is very good, this CD until last 2 months, the price was $120.00 for the 1990 version, now, with remastered sound, a japanese version is $63.00.

Its only drawback is the small photos and lack clarity on many make it not as useful in the field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustration in the Field....","review":"Does not merit \\"thru binoculars\\" status in my experience. A real frustration in the field - attempts to make it \\"work\\" as a true field guide only had me reaching for the aspirin at days end. The species descriptions are obviously written with a specimen, countless images, and hours of experience in hand (Note no binoculars in aforementioned). One is provided with similar species to consider, yet the key comparitive marks again read like a lab description. I am challenged to find much that is helpful to a reasonably competent fieldperson who has no problem IDing a respectable number of birds, butterflies, flowers etc he comes across. Better than nothing, but not by much.For California, Manolis' excellent book is highly recommended, AND , it includes damselflies !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragonflies Through Binoculars","review":"Excellent guide to the Dragonflies of North America.

In my first baby's book, I filled in all the blanks about milestones, birthday parties, etc, but I later realized that the book doesn't really tell you anything about my daughter's personality and what made her unique. With this baby book, I write about my baby lighting up when daddy gets home from work, about him giggling at his sister's singing, about the things he loves to do, about the things that make him special.

Gateway did not answer at that number, but if you like to listen to loud music via long distance, you can call their retail support.

There are glimmers of genuine inventiveness here, but too many of these poems are weighted down by the baggage of a kind of currently hip easy and breezy pseudo-experimental gimmickry. Cutsey little typographic tricks (i.e. crossouts, dashes, slashes and scissor-shaped word-art), studied ironies cleverly juxtaposed against the mock-naive, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. When are the crowd publishing in places like Verse and Volt going to realize that its complacency, not experimentation, when your poems all look and sound exactly the same?

Excellent are the script, concept, photography, scene sequence and sound. Every actor did his/her part, even the kids. The movie touched a wide spectrum of socio-cultural as well as utterly spiritual elements. Taken in a different context, entire movie could be carrying a deep spiritual theme that fuses our fear, preconception and aspirations about life, death, love, security and innocence. I highly recommend it. Few words of caution--Javier Bardem's deliveries are same, irrespective of the movie he is in. I mean to say as follow: in happy scenes, we have the same Javier as happy scenes of a previous movie, in serious, often depressing scenes, we have the same Javier. So, he is not necessarily the driving force in Biutiful. In this movie none in particular stands out to overshadow anyone--each actor, even the tiniest character, does the part assigned and finishes the canvas.Watch it, I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The most depressing film I have ever seen and I have seen a lot.

The Mexican filmaker Inarritu is a master of his medium in every way. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto, the acting of Bardem and others, the gritty realities of the Barcelona underworld visualized with amazing detail in every frame, all combine to make this unforgettable. And a very Mexican sense of a magical netherworld floating just behind the screen. A classic film which will be watched and studied for many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"D for depressing","review":"If you like depressing stories about smugglers with terminal illness, druggy X, bad situation and bad scenery.

Unfortunately, high jinx ensue, and whatever drama could have existed is obscured by child anti-star Gus' stereotypically bad acting and shaggy (anti)haircut. My favorite scenes are when Gus brings blankets (for no apparent reason) and gets socked in the kisser. The hallucinatory scene where the guy gets attacked by a Davy Crockett hat takes the cake though. Truly one of the funniest bits ever captured on film. Inconsequential sideplots abound, naturally... and what a conclusion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true companion","review":"So you're planning to visit the Ionian island of Zakynthos.

This book mainly covers exercises for developing vitality (physical well-being and energy), but also has some good information about diet, correct breathing, fresh air, preserving the teeth, curing constipation, blood purifucation, bathing, clothing, sleep, etc. It covers a wide range of health subjects. Bernarr Macfadden (1868-1955), America's first \\"health guru\\" was definitely ahead of his time. This book presents many of his theories in a clear and readable format. The style of writing is definitely dated, but his message is clear.

The fit and finish is really nice and they are quite simply lots of fun to play and in my opinion a lot of guitar for the money. Both guitars were made in Indonesia and I own a couple other guitars made there and quality control on all of them was obviously of major importance.

If you are going to read Number The Stars then you have to be the reader who loves reading about the war a very long time ago! You have to be the reader who also loves reading about how Jewish people hid from the bad people while the war was happening. The protagonist (Ellen ans Annemarie) are two little girls who are trying to have a normal life! They can't because Annemarie's family is trying to hide and help Ellen's family from bad guys (soldiers). Annemarie and Ellen are two very nice and respectful girls! The antagonists (the German soldiers) are very rude soldiers trying to get rid of all the Jewish people. They are basially trying to kill them.

I would have preferred to have more detail of Annemarie's experiences during the occupation. (Also, the younger sister was too \\"cutsy\\" and very annoying.)

Annemarie is asked to be as brave as she has ever been in her life when it comes to the Nazi soldiers.

This is the kind of story that keeps you interested and you do not want to put down. Every character has extreme significance. I think this would be a great book to read in the classroom.

This book can be read by both adults and children. It should be encouraged reading and discussion in the family home. The story about the Holocaust is told often enough. For young children, this novel is adequate in detailing the plight of the Danish Jews who were mostly fortunate enough to escape the perils of the concentration camps and crematories. The relationship between a Danish Lutheran girl, Anne Marie Johansen, and her best friend, Ellen Rosen (a Danish Jewish girl), is believable. I would put this book as a must read and highly suggest this book in the classroom for the middle school and possibly high school. The Holocaust is a tough subject because it is overwhelming emotionally and psychologically and sometimes a novel like this would be suffice in some classrooms to help understand the difficult situations that everybody in Europe faced during World War II."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding","review":"I though Number The Stars was a good book.

This book features Annemarie, a ten year old girl whose family helps a Jewish family escape to Sweden. This book gives a fairly accurate account of the persecution by the Nazis, as well as successfully portraying the event with appropriate gravity. While doing this, the book avoids becoming overly graphic, and focuses not on the horrors of the Holocaust, but on the hope that is held by those who are escaping. Because of this, I think that this book is appropriate for children ages 9-12."},{"rating":"2","title":"Number the stars is a very realistic book","review":"I love this story about the Holocaust.

As you begin to read you realize that this book is beneficial to one and all. The stories may be written from fictional characters but believe that this book was far from fiction, as the stories told in this book are very similar to that of many Jews in the European area at that time in history. The book has many contemporary stylings,especially the way that the characters are depicted, the vocabulary used by Lowry, and the structure Lowry uses to complete the book.This book maybe short, however in my opinion many things are about quality not quanity and this book definatly is quality. I would recommend it to anyone who would like to really feel what is was like to be a Jew during the early to late 1940's."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an EXCELLENT book!","review":"This book is so good because it's about stuff that actually happend in the world.

She started with the relationship between a Danish family and a Danish Jewish family. A very good beginning. Although the Star of David is not often mentioned, it reveals something important ?V friendship. Probably each star means each Jew who was rescued and helped during the cold war. Through this story, we can know their daily lives such as what they eat, how they live, what they think, what they feel, what they lack, who they are afraid of, who they respect, and so forth. Since Number the Star is a historical fiction book, it is certainly related to human history and some imaginary characters. When I read Denmark the Rescue of the Danish Jews online, I was surprised because events which happen in the story really happened in Denmark in World War II, and now many Jews show great respect for Denmark. Number the Stars is really great and impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"The honesty in Lowry's STARS is strong and moving","review":"Lowry's first Newbery tells the story of Annemarie Johansen, a ten-year-old who is glad not to have to be couragous. But when she is, her life is changed forever. The only downgrade is that story had a sad ending. But that is needed, I suppose, for a story such as this, with a message of friendship and courage written in between the lines. The thrill in this, though, is that it is honest and true, not masking the horrors of the time. Serves as a good beginning to a study of the time period, especially for young children. (Reccomended.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"This was a great book, filled with lots of adventure. It was about a Jewish girl who stays with friends of the family.

It really taught me the true meaning of friendship, and how the Nazis couldn't break that bond. Yes, they had the power to kill innocent jews, for no good reason.Yes, they had their uniforms, guns, and shining boots to show. But they can't stop the many brave civilians willing to do whatever they can to put a stop to this nonsense. I learned that Jewish or not,people were bravely daring to help however they could. Consider that if they were caught, they could be put to death.Though their fears of what could happen were smothered by bravery. Annemarie, her family, and any person in the Danish Resistance had an unlimited amount of bravery, courage, and the common courtesy to even help the unfamiliar and stop the prejudice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I think this book is excellent.

It is written very, very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Number The Stars","review":"Number the Stars is a book about how the Nazi soldiers treated the Jewish people after Adolph Hitler took over Germany,Poland, Norway,and many other countries. He hated Jewish people for some reason,so if a Nazi soldier saw a Jewish person walking on the street they had the right to immediately send them off to a camp where they were never heard of again.In this book,one family took in a Jewish girl named Ellen as their own child,they told her that if anyone asked her name it was Lise Johansen,which was Anniemarie & Kirsti's older sister.My favorite chapter in this book is chapter 5 which is \\"Who Is The Dark Haired One\\",because the Nazi soldiers actually showed up at the Johansen household and tore-up the picture of Lise as a baby.I really like this book a whole lot. Out of a scale of 1-10 I give it 1,000."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Review of a Great Book: Number the Stars","review":"We read this book in a reading group in fifth grade. Since it is such a great book we read it again in the seventh grade. This book was a great book yet it was very sad to learn how some people struggled during that time. This book teaches on how you should cherish the things you have and not take them for granted. It showed how people were treated back then during the war. It toled of how Hitler treated the Jewish people even though they never even did anything. It was a great book and taught us a lot of the values of life as in the book all the people had to deal with all deaths of family and friends looking forward to their own death as well.

It got right to the point and told a clear picture. At times though, the book got off the subject and had too many details. It was very secretive and that made the story alot more suspenseful. The characters were very real, especially Annemarie because she was so curious and scared at the same time. The setting was very helpful to the story because of the ocean that linked to Sweden. I was very fascinated when they told of the hankerchiefs that the people would use to trick blood hounds.

Following up from a thanks to the Danes that my Jewish Community had last Spring, I can say this book really captures the experience of the Danes--both Jews and non-Jews--during the Holocaust. Told from the point of view of a young girl, who is not Jewish, it gives a unique perspective. Further, it tells of a country in which the people bonded together to assist the Jews and help them to escape. Aspects of the Danish Resistance are also covered, as well as an important lesson for DURING the war: the less you know, the better.

They pretended that it was a picture of Ellen's best friend when she was a baby even though it wasn't. They told them that her best friend was her sister.

In all instances, the illustrations are large and easy to follow. In addition to the illustration, there are quite a large number of competition photographs that show some winning throws. The book also has a section on competition Judo and training.One small issue bith the book, though, is that the text is placed around the illustrations in small paragraphs.

I really wanted to finish this book..and had to recheck it out of the library several times before I could finish it. Maybe the problem was that there were different authors, and not just one author with a vision.

This is a unique product influenced by minimalism, new wave and Frippitronics at it's best. \\"The Sheltering Sky\\" alone is worth the price of the album. I would go a step further and say that this is one of the best albums ever made and would be on my top 10 list although this album may be a bit heavy for some listeners. In truth I like this album more than I listen to it. Every once in a while I'll put it in and marvel at the brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best lineup for King Crimson since Court","review":"While I feel this isn't the BEST album of the Fripp, Buford, Belew, Levin lineup of King Crimson it is worth buying as are all the albums this lineupreleased. They were excellent live also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done","review":"First, I am not a fan of the band, but this cd brings new ideas and explores new sounds and textures. I saw the concert from the second row and it reminds me good times from the early 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific album","review":"Probably my favorite album by an oft-forgotten great band. 'Frame by Frame' is one of my top ten favorite songs of all time. I never buy CDs anymore, but the lack of a version of this great album on Rhapsody or Zune made this purchase a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, if uneven eighties maiden voyage..","review":"I'm inclined to agree with one of the reviewers below, that listening to this album after hearing such Crimson stuff like Lark's Tongues or 21st Century Schizoid Man is a little like seeing Al Pacino in Scarface after watching Serpico. Still, this album has a lot going for it, hardly the least of it being that it signified a newly formed '80's incarnation of the King, which was obviously as influential for groups (paging Primus..) as the other albums. Adrian Belew has a decent voice and made for an interesting foil for Fripp, while Bill Bruford storms accordingly on the skins. Too essential for Crimsonite to pass on."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album I have ever purchased 18 times!!!","review":"King Crimson is one of the best bands ever.

Like the emperors new clothes it appears no one had the balls at the record company to tell RF ET AL that what they've recorded is self indulgent rubbish,no doubt egging them on to greater heights. Ill leave it at that be warned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Crimson's best","review":"Discipline is a departure from the shattering Avant-Jazz-Metal-Classical amalgam that typified King Crimson's approach in the 70's. This was arguably the best music made in the 80's. On Discipline, King Crimson revealed the potential of 80's rock before it was co-opted by the music video movement and degenerated into a parade of talentless one-hit wonders. Discipline is flawless from start to finish. The musicianship is a wide-ranging marvel of technique and control. Elephant Talk and Thela Hun Ginjeet are sinewy and propulsive examples of ultra-sophisticated funk. Matte Kudasai, Frame By Frame, and The Sheltering Sky are atmospheric and dynamic. Indiscipline conjures King Crimson's legendary power and places it in an ultra-modern context. Bruford's electronic drum flurries, combined with Fripp's raging soundscapes and Belew's twisted vocals and guitar work, make this the highlight of the CD. An enduring and classic work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best \\"new\\" KC.","review":"I could listen to this album over an AM car radio with a blown speaker and still enjoy it. If I hear 5 seconds of Indiscipline, my day is made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless!","review":"This is one of those albums that should be on the Desert Island list. King Crimson gets a new lineup with Adrian Belew on guitars and vocals, Tony Levin on bass, stick and backing vocals, Robert Fripp on guitar and Bill Bruford on drums. Apparently, this recipe of musicians was all that was needed to produce a disc full of great songs. Each number is strong enough to stand out on its own. I remember when it first came out and I heard it for the first time, I was overwelmed by how strange Adrian Belew's guitar sounded. I regret that I was not quite ready for such progressive sounds and it would be many years later before my ears grew up. This is a near perfect album, but it is definately not for everyone. You have got to have the ears for it. - Ciao"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fripp gets Discipline","review":"Fripp spent 3 years after he broke up Crimson in 1975 studying the works of JG Bennett. Well, he really reinvented himself here with a new and improved version of Crimson. The tragedy is, it's one of the best records of the 80's that I'll bet not many people have ever heard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Easy-Going","review":"I really enjoy this video!

I like this instructor. She explains the yoga and meditation very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"I feel completely relaxed","review":"After doing this routine just once, I feel completely relaxed. The body scan is more powerful that you may think. The stretching in the beginning really prepares you for the meditation and releases all the tension built up during the day. Once you move to the meditation, your body is tingling from the stretches that you just did and it helps you visualize and feel different parts of the body. I love this dvd and will use it often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful & Relaxing!","review":"I have always had difficulty being able to stick with any exercise or yoga program. However, this is one program that I am not only sticking with, but I actually look forward to doing as often as possible!Also the meditation segment is so wonderful and relaxing, that when I do it in the evening, I sleep like a baby. Definitely better than nights that I don't meditate before bedtime.I HIGHLY recommend this DVD to anyone looking to destress/decompress and learn effective relaxation techniques that are \\"user friendly\\" to those of us that are not long-time yoga/meditation experts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I reviewed this before, so I'm not sure where it went. I just put in her name to see if she had made another video.This is the best meditation video I own. I have bought a number of video and audio tapes on meditation and I think all of them missed the boat completely---even Rodney Yee. But I love, love, love his AM yoga. It would be even better if the meditation section was longer and he would NOT talk.Hmmm, this is weird because I just looked through my reivews and the one I did on this DVD about a year ago is still in my list. So I don't know why it was deleted.I also love the Plum Village meditation CD with Thich Nhat Hanh. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"This DVD is easy to follow.

(and if you're one of those people who thinks 'it sound too hard' or you've tried to meditate only a few times and say 'it's too hard' - it gets easier! meditation IS hard! at first...it takes time to learn to settle your mind...but once you keep at it and LEARN...it's the best thing EVER!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"Any benefits from the meditation is highly compromised EVERY time you start the DVD. First, there are several cover-their-butts warnings. Then there is the LONG commercial for the publisher, GAIAM Media. I repeat, every time you start the DVD. Every stinkin' time. EVERY, every, every time. Did I say, EVERY time.So you want a nice meditation session. Wonderful. Great. But let me first shove an in-your-face corporate commercial down your throat, whether you want it or not. You know, because we can. And becasue, of course, we are more important than you.To me, this makes the whole premise a lie. People want meditation to get away from the busy-ness of the world, which of course, primarily consists of heavy doses of corporate crap we are CONSTANTLY fed. Margarine anyone?Boycott it, dont buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, yet effective for the beginner","review":"I have been doing yoga for 18 years, so I am familiar with the poses on this DVD. However, Maritza's choice of specific postures (many focused on the spine which is my problem area) are very effective at promoting relaxation and are non strenuous. I find myself doing her routine more often than my other yoga exercises these days. I have also been doing body scan meditation and mindfulness practice for years(not regularly as I should) but I find I am more likely to follow through with her routine and instructions as they are simple and to the point. I also find her voice calming. I think this is a good DVD for anyone interested in beginning meditation and it works for those of us who also have some experience with the subject but might lack the proper motivation : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very LLLOOONNNNGGG.

They really shouldn't have tried to cheat customers by doing this.It is really only for the hardcore 3 stooges fans who have seen absolutely everything else by them. Much of it is pretty sad--only a little bit funny--stuff with recycled routines from earlier moves/shorts.

However, in my estimation, it is a poor how-to guide on the subject. There aren't a lot of visuals demonstrating techniques. Just a lot of printed text describing the history of the genre. I am disappointed in this book and wouldn't recommend it for someone who is looking for how-to info."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much has changed since 1930","review":"Ink and pen was pretty much perfected around the turn of the century and the benefit of that expertise is captured quite well in this book. You still get the best and most expressive lines from a steel pen. This seems like a perfect book for a beginner or an experienced artist interested in all the nuances of the pen.My only real issue with the book is it seems to be focused heavily on architectural themes and technical issues and less on art. So I give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact and effective","review":"I love this product. I have a larger booster that I use while home and purchased this for use at a relative's home.

My daughter suffered serious internal injuries and a broken back. As a result of the accident, sh is now a parapalegic. Since this device is little more than something to allow her to be the right height to wear a seatbelt, it offered no back support on impact.

The missions are also a lot of fun too, such as bugging phones, rescuing hostages, and the like. The main (and most interesting) difference between this FPS and another is that you do not have a particular amount of health, just a full circle that goes to half or none. Sometimes, if you are lucky, you can get away without hurt from getting shot. However, there is also no healing in the game, making it more of a strategy than a Ramo Mode type of game.

Also, there is an adversarial mode as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pastoral Perspective","review":"Pastors in Transition: Why Clergy Leave Local Church Ministry-is an excellent and accurate assessment of the prevailing pressures exerting itself on pastors in churches of all sizes and denominations here in the US.

This album left me waiting for the bass to kick in, and wondering when the sensuous layers of sound weaving were going to begin. Then I realized the track was over!

Her heart shines as she revels in a carnival of delicately drawn characters. Some are sad, some sick, some brilliant, but in Pleasant's world they are all appreciated equally.

This lady rocks (so we won't have to). Woman has lived through quite a bit and lived to write about it--and we get it all: the good and the bad. What makes her stand out as a writer is her own, very unique way of putting the word down. Might remind some of Henry Miller, Jeri Cain Rossi, or even Charles Bukowski--by that I mean she bares her heart and soul and stays away from the phony type of writing (one might find in mags like The New Yorker and others like it.)

It was not as good as I had hoped it would be, though decent enough for a children's story. The plot seemed a bit unlikely, with Maddie and Johnny discovering Nazi saboteurs (as well as the Star Points, a group that seems to appear in most childrens' books in various forms), and the diary's subject matter seemed too trivial for a thirteen-year-old in the midst of a war. That's the main point of my complaints--the entries seem too forced. The writing does not seem to be realistic, more like an adult trying to sound like a child. Perhaps the author is too far away from childhood, or perhaps I'm too demanding of \\"perfect fiction.\\" However, it was better than some books I've read, and the actual history was intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good!","review":"My Secert War was really good!

Besides, Chris ended up the ultimate villain towards the end by not caring anyone but his sister. \\"Cliffhanger\\" was not so hopelessly hilarious, but it is definitely not a worth-buying. As for \\"Into Thin Air\\", I haven't even heard of such a film!

Still, Eno's slow songs come with plenty of their own pleasures, especially the almost-country \\"Here He Comes\\" and the breezy \\"St. Elmo's Fire,\\" which could have been a hit single. \\"Everything Merges with the Night\\" may not move quickly, but it has genuine power, and it shows that high-pitched guitar sustain need not be confined to the soundtracks of sleazy movies.The bottom line: This is some of the best pop music anyone has ever made, in the 70's or any other decade. Even a mediocre compilation of it is a great experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the ambience?","review":"If you've heard of Eno and are thinking of getting one of his albums, be forewarned: this is not the ambient glory that I had expected.

As mentioned elsewhere here, \\"Nightingale\\" is not to be missed and some pieces are similar to the \\"Acropolis\\" selection.The new instruments and use of vocal as instrument (no words in some of the vocal pieces) is a new facit of Yanni's work and is appreciated after repeated viewing.His new CD, \\"If I could tell you\\", released in 2000 is more like his earlier work and another \\"love it from the first listen\\" selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the bests","review":"Since we purchased this DVD we have been watching it over and over again for more than 10 times (in one month) and we still want to watch it again when we have free time.

Best of all, the concert is played at the two most beautiful man-make wonders of the world, Taj Mahal and the Forbidden City. The recording was good and you will definitely be entertained. This DVD thus comes with many extras, on the making of the concert and also beautiful scene of both China and India. If you like Yanni, then this is a must buy!

I knew that after Live at the Acropolis things can only get worse. I just couldn't imagine that \\"worse\\" could be that bad. First, when I spend my twenty five bucks for a concert DVD I don't want a National Geographic world-is-beautiful program or \\"we-are-all-the-same\\" mini speeches. Mercifully, the skip button on my remote came to rescue. It is the music that made me sorry I ordered Tribute rather than Live. Now, what can possibly be wrong with Tribute? It is that simple: now matter how many times I play Tribute, I cannot hum or whistle or repeat in any manner a single piece. Tribute seems a result of a \\"cut-and-paste\\" computer-run process of creating songs from the elements stored in the best-of-Yanni library. Great music, like great speeches, is predictable and can be easily memorized. Tribute seems more like a farewell to the greatness of Yanni."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it 0 stars, but it wouldn't let me","review":"Evil. I was forced to watch it in orchestra class.

I was not a real fan just when I listened to his previous CD albums. Before the Acropolis live, his music was mainly performed by synthesizers, which I didn't like and enjoy.I love his two video albums. Even my mom and dad aged 71 to 72 enjoy the videos, saying \\"Yanni is a very talented musician\\" whenever they see them. I think \\"Tribute\\" is somewhat differrent from the first one. I like his new efforts made to this video. And I like the vocalists and other musicians including Van Johnson and Karen Briggs. Yanni is a genius.

The perfect blend of music and voice need no interpretation of language to know there meaning. Marisa Monte's clarity of voice and presentation in this one song is powerfully moving even in the sometimes hushed tones of the background. For this one song along the purchase of the CD is worth it, happily I can write that I was only to be rewarded song after song with originality and beauty. The compliment of male and female voice blended together throughout the album is amazingly arranged and meld together leaving the listener to realize that any other combination or change would be unthinkable.Bravo Tribalistas"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow - A Very Nice Surprise!","review":"I saw The Holy Ghost as the first of three bands performing in a small club in Brooklyn about a month ago. I went to the club to see the Australian headliners Wolfmother (who are tremendous, by the way), but got there in time to see all three bands play. As the opening band, the Holy Ghost didn't have the best sound system, but it was clear that they were a talented band with some good songs. I remarked to my friend that \\"I bet they'll sound better on CD than they do here tonight,\\" and I was right. \\"Welcome To Ignore Us\\" is an undiscovered gem. Great singing, complex lyrics and arrangements, excellent production, this is an album worth checking out. I honestly don't think there's a bad song on the CD. \\"Shut Up and Play\\" might be my favorite right now, what with its weird \\"Twin Peaks\\" guitar and utterly infectious chorus.

Maybe they were a little boring in parts, but then so is life at times. Anyway, I am a huge sucker for love stories, and that's exactly what these were. I absolutely love how Ms. Mitford shows the two different sides of the narrator, Fanny in each novel.

Their production is titled \\" Love in a Cold Climate \\". I might otherwise not have heard of this title had it not been for the TV previews and because of WGBH's record of quality, it's the sole reason why I bought this book.

I grew up on it. \\"full length\\" is an overstatement in this case. They took out too many darn scenes. And cable TV was the only formatted version of this I ever watched. One of which was a scene when Elliot (Cosby) has a close call with a falling power tool followed by a cord his foot is caught under when standing at the high edge of a building at a construction site for his soon to be new office.

Its almost as if they're talking about a different movie.I am a big Bill Cosby fan, but there is almost nothing about this movie that is worth watching. The premise itself is hard enough to believe, what makes it worse is when the rules of how Cosby's non-corporeal self communicates and interacts with the real world seem to change at the writer's whim. There is absolutely no logic governing how this happens. Why, for example, can he walk through walls but is able to pick up a scotch bottle ? How is it possible for him to talk on the telephone ? For that matter how is it possible for anyone except his children to hear him when he talks ? There are no answers to these questions, because its obvious the writers were just making it up as they went along.Bill Cosby is a great television actor but his movie career leaves much to be desired (Leonard Part 6 anyone ?), this movie is one example why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly Awful","review":"This movie is so bad that it almost makes it worth watching just to laugh at its stupidity.

The author sites a study performed by Shere Hite that was so poorly done, many introductory statistics texts give it as an example of what not to do in a study. The author has frightful real-life examples in each chapter, but these are not supporting his arguments. The worst example of this is the rape chapter. The author argues that rape is mainly about procreation, but gives examples of men raping then killing women and women who are sexually tortured, but with whom the men do not copulate.I feel that the author presents some valuable ideas and theories, but that the author's supporting evidence is highly suspect.

The tour guide ate in grubby diners with toothless people, hung out with black mascara loving punks and looked like she was freezing the entire time. There was almost nothing of the pomp and pageantry that most want to see in England. A brief tour of a castle was nice and a scene of battle was interesting. But if you are interested in London in particular, you see basically nothing of the city. If you are seeking info on the Beatles (I wasn't), then you might enjoy this a bit more than I did. I feel like I wasted my money and only learned that if and when I do go to England, there is no way I will go there in late October when its as bleak and dark as a dungeon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Excellent","review":"I can only say that this is the best documentary I have seen thus far on the great Ayrton Senna.

A guitar and music for the mind Professor","review":"This album although well executed is dissappointing as I ordered it from customer recommendations the expectations were great but. Compared to Steve Vai this guy is like a wet weekend. I did not find even one track that held me, it was more like background music compared to what I normally listen to. Even though the guy can play very well there was no soul in it, no fun, no excitement,no hairs on the back of the neck stuff. Still I will keep trying some of the newer guys may come up with something amazing, you never know"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vinnie Moore is the best musician ever!!!","review":"There are lots of guitar players in the \\"market\\", Joe Satriani and his passion, Steve Vai and his experiments, Yngwie Malmsteen and his talent, but Vinnie Moore offers something different: integration. His composition are out of this world, his is probably the 20th-21st Century Beethoven, and every song is a real symphony. The Defying Gravity album is no exception, with lots of acustic guitars and a \\"spanish\\" influence, but you only need to listen to the first 3 seconds of the first song and you know it's Vinman...I really would like to give this album 5 stars, but it's a way to recognize that there are better albums, like Time Odyssey."},{"rating":"1","title":"made on a color printer","review":"well the title tells u most of what this is. just a computer printing of the image,lots of pixalation around features on print no copy of artists signature, no copy writemarkings quality of image is that of some thing you would copy & paste then enlarge& print (not the quality of a mass produced print )If I had to guess I would sayit's probably bootlegged & it may be an 80's era ,but was printed in recently"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"Back when this album came out I thought it was great.

Several years later I saw it at the local CD store and remembering how much I liked it I bought a copy and drove home expecting to be just as pleased with it in 1995 as I was in 1986. Well, I matured but the music remained the same. I was very disappointed. The CD simply was not nearly as good as I remembered it. In fact shortly after buying it I took it to a used CD store and sold it. Killing Jokes earlier music was fantastic but this was truly trite and overly produced junk.

They should've released the original instead of the remake. There is also another thing I think is rather dumb, they should release episodes that are not seen on TV, but instead they come out with these bare-boned DVDs with most of the episodes we've seen on TV, but this one does include two shorts which are not shown on TV, which is a plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"The head of the duck is gigantic, and its cheap plastic.

Now I have to go through the tedious process (and it is tedious) of re-packaging/re-ordering the correct item.

But this new cd was remastered very poorly. It's all midrange. This applies to the other two UK albums as well. I got all three remasters and played them side by side. The new ones are fine for someone who has never owned any UK but if you have the old ones (on EG) and you have a good stereo you will want to keep them. The sadest part is that the remastering was done by none other than Eddie Jobson himself. I don't know if Eddie has lost his hearing, if the master tapes were toast or if he rushed it but this great album was not done justice by this pressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prog's Golden Age Swan Song","review":"This isn't a review so much as an observation.It has always been my humble opinion that this particular album was the last great \\"hurrah\\" of the Golden Age of Progressive Rock Music. With the release of \\"Danger Money\\", along with the waning days of the 70's, the curtain closed on the last of the bombastic self-indulgent giants of this over-looked genre'.You still had many of the upper tier Prog bands soldiering on into the 80's, but their best work was behind them.When you listen to UK putting their heart and soul into this project, try to imagine the intensity of creating and playing at this level of virtuosity and knowing only a minute percentage of the listening public will even appreciate the effort.I find the instrumentation unique on this work. (What, no lead guitar?)To the members of UK and all that came before striving to produce a sophisticated blend of rock and jazz that had never been heard before, I salute you."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHALK UP ANOTHER GEM BY THE OBSCURE","review":"This album was one I stumbled upon. Another one borrowed by my brother, which came across my path. If you are a Terry Bozzio fan, you must buy it! Some of the music is quite different from what the normal rock fan listens to. Believe me that once you do hear it, see a dentist(he'll reset your jaw for you after it becomes dislocated). The timing these three come up with will astound you. Bozzio is simply one of my favorite drummers. He's even more amazing live! Quite a different spin on a trio: drums, bass, and keyboard/electric violin? No guitar? By the time the album is heard, guitar is not even necessary. Favorite track: The Only Thing She Needs. Buy it. Let others hear it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I still listen to this.","review":"Yeah, the first U.K. album was a milestone. (Jet aircraft engines on takeoff are quieter than Eddie Jobson starting \\"Alaska\\" in a 4000-seat theater.) Along with Synergy/Larry Fast's \\"Cords,\\" that was my favorite album.Danger Money is a different sound, but disappointing only in relatively very few spots. Bozzio's drumming is astonishing throughout (i.e., the last minutes of \\"All She Needs\\"). Wonderfully complicated cadences, time signatures. The writing is strong enough overall; \\"Caesar's Palace\\" is a minute too short. I want to articulate that Jobson, Bozzio ARE very much virtuosos on their instruments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing blend of jazz and rock","review":"i have always thought that this was one of the absolutely BEST albums i have ever heard.the lead singer, john wetton, has one of the silkiest voises i have ever heard, (who later became the lead singer for Asia) and eddie jobson (mostly electric violin --- one made of lucite!) is so versatile that i have never heard anything like it.the drummer, terry bozzio, technically perfect at the most amazing syncopated beats (like 9/16th time -- i didn't even know that such beats were possible!) -- later moved on to form the group \\"missing persons\\"i want UK to do a reunion tour and/or album!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"minor league ELP","review":"The first U.K. album was a recording of great promise. The musicians: John Wetton, Bill Bruford, Eddie Jobson and Alan Holdsworth combined to make an innovative, creative debut that left one eager for future developments. Unfortunately, such developments never came about as Bruford and Holdsworth departed to form Bruford, a progressive jazz-fusion outfit. Jobson and Wetton were left to carry on without them. Rather than recruit another guitarist they opted to transform the band into that of a power trio with Terry Bozzio on drums. This strategy looked better on paper. Where all three are talented musicians they are all better suited to the role of backup. None are to be considered a virtuoso on their respective instruments. The compositions are also weaker than on the previous effort and reveal a more pop-oriented compositional flair. This is a disc worth passing over. Purchase the debut, pass this one over....Simon"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Bruford no problem...","review":"When Allan Holdsworth left after Eddie Jobson wanted him to play the same solo as on the record every night live; you would think that along with Bill Bruford's departure would have meant the end.Other than the fact that you have no guitar solo's the exciting drumming of Terry Bozzio was an enjoyable change.Attrition can sometimes mean less is more..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent album by 3-membered U.K.","review":"Eddie Jobson played with FG, Curved air(I am missing the Metamorphosis!), Roxy Music and for King Crimson and even YES.

Generally, one tends to think of happy-happy pop music, but none of the themes really fall into that category. Rather, the majority of the tracks are laid back, with a comfortable groove that fits in with late 80's/early 90's American style music that covers many genres, including early techno (Equal Romance), jazz rock (Positive), moderate ballads (Present), J-pop techno (Friends), and your more joking, comedic fare (Lambada Ranma and Lai-Lai Boy). I feel this album is worth purchasing simply because of the relaxed and casual feel embedded in it; after listening to it, you really can't feel bad. - Shour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every gardener should study these color and design theories","review":"This book has a lot of useful things to say about color and garden design. Some of the color theories presented are flaky and esoteric (such as detailed color-emotion link tables, and matching hues to musical notes and making a literal \\"color harmony\\"), but the reader is free to learn and choose from many color and design theories. Since garden design is a subjective art, I can reject the need to use, say, the \\"golden section\\" in a given design, yet believe that it's a good idea to consciously consider it.The book also has about 150 pages of information on specific perennials, by genus, and chapters on matters such as building up soil, and building paths - wasted pages if you already have a good basic library. For me, the book's best feature is its 80 well-annotated color plates, arranged by season, showing either a medium close-up of 2 or 3 plants or a broader landscape view.

Upon first listen, I remarked to my wife that they sounded more like Peter, Paul, and Mary than the Dubliners. She correctly pointed out that Peter, Paul, and Mary were actually much better than this pablum, and that the Irish Rovers more closely resemble the fictional Main Street Singers from a Mighty Wind.Truly, absolutely, unlistenably passionless, cloying and bland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remaster?

Piazzolla was always intent on combining jazz and tango, coming up with his popular \\"Nuevo Tango,\\" and this cd, though a little farther on the jazz side still has many typical Piazzolla characteristics.\\"Summit,\\" the title track is probably my favorite--it starts out with a typical Piazzolla fugue on bandoneon, joined by bari sax on the second phrase, then marimba and elec. guitar, and piano and bass. Then all the instruments join together, and Mulligan has room for a solo. Very exciting and fun cd, good for either a jazz fan or a Piazzolla fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great duo! Jazz meets urban Tango","review":"Great music if you like Jazz. Piazzolla re-created Argentinean Tango, modernizing its sound and making it more contemporary (that created a battle for the name of \\"tango\\" between the hard core old school tango lovers and the Paizzolla lovers...but that's another story) and accesible to other cultures.You must listen to it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pablo Cruise Meets David Sanborn","review":"As a big fan of both Mulligan's and Piazzolla's works, I was incredibly disappointed by this CD. Recorded in 1974 (need I say more?), the session finds both artists straining to find common ground, periodically relying on cliches that complement the '70s percussion perfectly. This would have made a nice soundtrack for a Starsky & Hutch movie. Mulligan is one of the most versatile blowers that ever lived, but this pairing just didn't work.

Sometimes the focus is a bit too much on the host and not enough about the place itself, as *we* experience vicariously the host reacting the sites, sights, events, people. Yet this may be one way to share the feel of the experience over the substance. I do find the hosts attractive, charismatic, and funny. As much travel entertainment as travel guide.

Unless you like songs that have three notes per minute, you probably won't like this one. Don't let Eno's colossal earlier solo records, and stuff he did with Roxy Music fool you. Evening Star is a totally different pace. Buy \\"Before and After Science\\" instead, you'll be pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozer","review":"Eno and Fripp were on downers when they wrote this. It affected me profoundly.

The CD sleeve, and all the printing the CD are correct for \\"Evening Star\\", but the actual music is \\"Before and After Science\\". If you bought this disk, and it wasnt like you expected, perhaps you had the same problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the foundations of ambient music.","review":"I heard this record in 1976 and still enjoy listening to it once or twice a month.

This would be one of the discs I would take with me to a deserted island."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Really disappointed.","review":"I'm not gonna recap what happens in this volume, since it's so terribly boring. I had high hopes for this anime since it's from the creators of Sakura Wars. The story sounded interesting, and the character designs looked cool. the only 2 things that this anime has going for it are the cool character designs and the decent story. This anime has really outdated animation. It's on par with animation 10 years before it's time. The voice acting is also terrible. The character sound like they are only half awake. The story really kinda drags too. There is no way I can recommend that anyone watch this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made piece!!!","review":"I was VERY pleased with this product, which is an EXACT match for my old JBL G-730 speaker handles.

I already had one of the Juno model, and really liked it. This was a first try for the ISIS, and I don't like it as well. It's not as supportive, and the lower band rides up under the bust during workout activity.

The minor shortcomings are far overshadowed by the content, artistry and balance of styles. We are currently using JOY and YES! I CAN DO IT to back up our Jr. Church group in their opening exercises. They love the CD and are trying to find some to purchase for their own. The positive attitude supported by biblical principles is outstanding and we look forward to future offerings from this producer.

Two star-crossed lovers who live in adjoining apartments decide to elope. Pyramus takes his life when he mistakingly thinks his true love was eaten by a lion. Thisbe takes her own life soon after, and lo and behold they die together in love. This book is only worth reading as a companion to Shakespeare's a Midsummer's nights dream to explain the \\"play\\" within the play. A classic theme, perhaps the first of its kind... but a non-worthwhile read if you the story of Romeo and juliet. This Story also offers an interesting explanation of why mulberries are blood red instead of their \\" orignal natural\\" white."},{"rating":"2","title":"great ambient album","review":"haunting, beautiful, mesmerizing, great for doing homework, and great if you want to write true mood music.

It's OK to study to, but don't try to actually *listen* to it, because you'll be bored to tears. Or at least I was. I don't know what the big deal is about this album. Take a really basic sound pattern made up of just a few notes, throw in some tape loops and build upon it ad nausem, and you've got ambient music. Me, I prefer actual songs. Give me \\"Another Green World\\" over this any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"___","review":"After listening to some of the ambient works of todays artists such as Aphex Twin and Autechre this music feels a little bit outdated. It doesnt mean that this music is bad by no means, it's nice ambient stuff. My main objection with this album however is not with the music but with the copy-protected disc.

I still enjoy \\"Music for Airports\\" and it's a go-to album for destressing after work.The album is divided into 4 sections (\\"1/1,\\" \\"2/1,\\" \\"1/2,\\" and \\"2/2\\"), and it soothes the listener with repetitive piano and synthesizer motifs, and adds the color of chimes and vocals. This is the \\"ambient\\" music style, something to play while you need to concentrate, perhaps, or to relax or go to sleep by. I can also recommend the newer \\"Glitters is Gold\\" which also has non-linear music of this type."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting listening.","review":"I've been into Tangerine Dream for several years now, and finally decided to branch out a bit in my current ambient music obsession. I've found several remarkable ambient albums in my recent search, and this one probably tops the list.I can put this CD on, press repeat, and have hours of music that doesn't grate on my nerves or get repetitive. Every time I hear \\"Ambient 1: Music For Airports,\\" I hear something new. And the songs are so simple!Being a software developer, I have to concentrate, so I like to have music that doesn't get in my face or force me to sing with it. Ambient music is perfect to code to, and this Eno CD is perfect for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"ambient pioneer","review":"What people usually mean by \\"ambient\\" is music intended to be experienced not on its own but as part of a larger environment. It's music that doesn't overwhelm the senses but instead subtley alters the preception of the entire range of sounds, sights smells, emotions your experiencing at the time. Of course Eno didn't invent this ability...music has always had this effect. He wasn't even the first to intentionally compose ambient music...but he was one of the first real artist to do it so well. This disk is simply one of the most effective ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seminal work","review":"This is one of the very best ambient works ever made. Arguably the Godfather of Ambience, Eno created music that was complex and deeply moving, while at the same time keeping everything withing a minimalist context. This is NOT New Age / Muzak kitch, which has been passed of as ambience more than once. On the contrary, this ambience is real, legitimate music and should be considered as a genre worthy of the highest respect.I have listened to this many times at airports, and this work has captured the multitude of emotions and conceptions that occur in airports everyday, with sincerity and poignant observation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Soothing Album","review":"This is by far one of the most relaxing CDs I've ever heard. Soothing humming and a light piano actually do make you feel as if you are flying. If you feel stressed, this is an excellent CD to use in calming yourself down. It's not the most rich, multi-layered soundscape ever created, but its simplicity is highly effective. It really does clear your mind of worry.

Blood Sport is written totally objectively and deals with all the players involved in every Clinton scandal except for Monica, which broke after publication.The book details the business partnerships the Clintons had with the McDougals from the 1970's on the 1990's and its fall out. The story stretches from Arkansas to the White House and even goes a bit into the suicide of Vince Foster.Stewart makes no judgments as to whether any impropriety occurred in any business dealings, so this is a good place to start for an objective reader who wants to make up his own mind about the whole sordid mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another attack on the most moral man in America","review":"This is another example of how the vast right wing conspiracy has gone out of their way to attack the one man who has done more for Americans since JFK.

It is time for someone to write the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of inaccuracies, poor writing, not even good expose.","review":"This book is long and plodding! It parades itself as investigatory but there are inaccuries and mistakes throughout the book. Even if its an expose book, it's not a very good one becuase its not dramatic nor eye catching. The writing is plodding and becomes boring, you start wondering where the sensational material is. Not a good book on the Clinton scandals, its not informative. See, The Hunting of a President: The Ten Year Campaign to Destroy Bill and Hillary Clinton, for an excellent critique of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair, but OBE","review":"Overtaken by Events; even the latest edition is way out of date now! Stewart writes with such detail of the shenanigans that initially landed the Clintons in the hot water that they deserved that, as Imus would say, it'll make your hair hurt. But if you want to know what that Whitewater mess was all about, you won't find a better, more sober book. Nor will you get a better feel for why the Clintons really have sullied the Presidency--and this before the Monica story broke."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"Jim Stewart made the talk-show circuit insinuating that he had uncovered massive incriminating evidence against the Clintons re: Whitewater. But, the book practically exonerates Bill and Hillary and portrays them as innocent, passive, albeit duped, investors. I felt betrayed by this Clinton cronie. He knowingly lied and deceived people by deliberately misrepresenting the book. I suppose he knew that the book would sell better if it was billed as an expose on Clinton, so he portrayed it and himself as just that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, unbiased, factual explanation of Clinton scandals","review":"This books gives a complete picture through 1997 of the Clinton scandals & is factual & unbiased. As a lawyer, I have seen similar things to what he describes in the real estate dealings & the innerworkings of the Rose law firm.

I loved the different spin the game took on traditional fighters by adding items and destruction points to each stage. However, with the good comes the bad. I was a little disappointed to find that in order to unlock Hinata as a playable character, I'd first have to play through Neji's scenario.

My brand new PC151's are every bit as good -- the bass response is noticeably better than the old ones, actually (although that could just be from age/abuse :)I love that they use my existing sound card, no USB drivers or separate sound card needed. The mic switch and volume control on the knob are waaaaaay handy, and I've never had any complaints about voice quality while using voicechat during online gaming sessions.Only complaint is that they're a little tight on the head when brand new, but I do have kind of a big head I guess.All in all, I've gotten more money's worth out of these than pretty much any of my other computer stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality, Good Price","review":"I've always heard Sennheiser brand gaming headsets are the best, but was deterred by the prices.

I've been trying out different brands to communicate back home and these sound no better than the Chinese brand knock-offs I purchased from a local store. Actually, a bit worse. Anyone who uses Skype regularly will do better to purchase a headset in the $150 range; it seems this is the price point where you start to see real improvements in products/components.

When they worked, they were very charming and I really appreciated the rich sound. As another reviewer pointed out, these guyz are hot on the ears. I would probably only use this headset for the occasional game of counterstrike and wear some better quality headphones with more breating room for regular listening and gaming.The fantastic sound that these make in mind, my headphones broke remarkably easy. Personally, I am in my latter teens and I am pretty careful of my gaming equipment. I can imagine someone less careful than me having a far less time span of this headset.The cord is undeniably too small and thin, that is all there really is to say. I would invest in a higher quality Senn product because they make great sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work well","review":"They do a pretty good job for what they are...

They felt superb and extremely comfortable (which they do feel like). But the major flaw is the microphone. I don't know if it was just me, but the mic was completely terrible and made me sound scratchy and robotic. I would recommend this product probably just for listening to music, but if you're trying to talk to people or go on long skype calls it just won't do.Pros- Comfortable, Great SoundCons- Terrible Mic, Seems Flimsy"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it","review":"I went to Amazon to read reviews for over 20 headphones with a mic. I bought this one in Fry's electronic today, and I am definitely going to return it today.It is very uncomfortable. The headphones sit ON your ears not around. This results is a painful experience. The headphones are also very warm, and your ears will be sweating a few seconds later. Finally, the mic is a bit far from your mouth, and I could barely hear my own voice. Even the mic of the laptop seem to capture my voice better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good","review":"I'm writing this review because I wasn't satisfied with this headset. Don't be fooled by all these other good reviews. I just want to make sure that you will get a nice headset for yourself so that you don't regret buying.1) it gets discomfort after wearing it for more than 1-2 hours because the earphones are just so small, it doesn't fit right over your ear so after wearing it for a while, you will start to feel the tension on your ears and you will not want to wear it any longer. The earphones sits right on your ear!2) the microphone was horrible, can't really hear me when I was chatting3) Don't get it because you will regret buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Likes Their Buzzwords","review":"The headphones are good. They have great noise quality. The microphone seems to work well. And they are comfortable to wear for long periods of time.I was disappointed that they weren't noise canceling headphones. After discovering this, I looked closely at the packaging and the Amazon product. It is the microphone that is noise canceling, not the headphones. I don't even know what a noise-canceling microphone does for me. What I wanted was a noise canceling headphones, but alas, I was fooled by overuse of buzzwords."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Headset","review":"I've had Sennheisser headsets for a few years now, they never disappoint.

They are extremely comfortable and the price on Amazon cannot be beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Affordable & Sounds Great.","review":"The good: I have had this headset for about two months now. It delivers great sound quality. I use it to make calls over the internet. Sound's quality on both ends of the line is great. I also use it to listen to music. It has helped me realize that 'what separates good music from great music is a good headset!!' The inline volume control & mute function comes in handy.The bad: It feels a bit warm on the ears with all that padding, no major discomfort though.The Bottom Line: It's a well-designed, well-built headset with distinctive sound quality. It's a value bargain; you get what you pay for in full. It doesn't look nor feel cheap. I would recommend it to a friend with confidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black eyed blues","review":"2 1/2Seems overrated here (what doesn't?), but then again I find most of their albums lacking that true ethereal quality, found in TS, which conveyed a haunting depth through production that songwriting alone sadly cannot repeat.

Unfortunately, the second section does little more that repeat the cursory and unclear contents of the first section, without adding any real information. Everything seems to be covered, but even after actually reading it page by page, I gained only questions. The data structures and different objects are \\"discussed\\" but that discussion consists of \\"you can <insert some mysterious task> in C++\\" without telling you why you might want to do so or giving helpful examples.

It is almost in the so-bad-it's-good category. It's not that it's offensive (unless you're offended by a flimsy plot and ridiculously bad dialogue), it's just that it's a waste of time. (I am, however, surprised by viewers who hailed it as a wonderful family-friendly movie, because it has enough adult themes and dialogue that I do not think it appropriate for children. Of course, when I say adult, I do not mean in the sense of mature and intelligent.)I looked it up here on Amazon after renting it, thinking I should have looked here first because it would probably have lots of negative comments. While it does have some, I was surprised to find some positive comments as well, so I thought I should add my opinion to help warn others away from this movie.I should also add that I am not a movie snob. I have enjoyed many a brainless romantic comedy. But this brainless romantic comedy is completely unenjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My husband and I are big fans of Alias. When we saw this at our local video store, we couldn't wait to see it. How disappointing! The writing and editing are dismal, the chemistry between Michael Vartan and Natasha Henstridge is missing that special something that gives movies like When Harry Met Sally and You've Got Mail their magnetism. The movie isn't so bad that you feel compelled to turn it off, but we found ourselves caring more about the best friends getting together than the main characters. All in all, we were hoping to see the kind of passionate intensity that smolders between Michael Vartan and Jennifer Garner in Alias. This movie lacks that fire between the main characters. Without it, it becomes obvious how poor the writing and editing are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointing","review":"Being a die hard fan of ALIAS and Michael Vartan, I was on the search for any Michael Vartan movies, and stumbled upon this. To be honest I was quite disappointed in this movie. The script is so old and has nothing new to offer. The only redeeming quality was Micheal Vartan and even he couldn't carry this movie. He had nothing to play off of and it clearly showed since the movie went straight to video... So I would say skip it, unless you are a huge, I mean HUGE fan of Michael Vartan and just want to see him for an hour an half."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chick Flick at its best.","review":"Michael Vartan is main actor NOT Jospeh Baldwin as stated in other review.

Kind of film you can watch with the girls, a glass of wine and a tub of Ben & Jerrys. (Plus Michael Vartan looks good throughout)"},{"rating":"1","title":"it had to be bad","review":"Not surprisingly, I saw this on Lifetime over the summer. It's a cliched version of love and romance. This Vartan fellow says the right thing at all the right times, and the ending is so picture perfect--it makes me sick.I'm a strong believer of true love, but I don't see this as any example. It, like almost all the rest, is merely a fluffy fantasy I care not to indulge in."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big No","review":"Ever sit down to watch a chick flick, already with the blanket, fire in the fire place, drink and snack in hand....and then you start the movie and say to yourself...I think they are just reading a script, no chemistry at all between the key characters...predictable...didn't even make it thru the whole thing...shut it down and picked another flick.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK","review":"This book was a huge disappointment! It was a waste of money! I looked forward to finally buying a book about the hall director position so I chose this one. This book has many grammatical mistakes and looks like a first grader wrote it. I let other people see the book and they could not even get through the first 2 chaters. I on the other hand took the time to read the entire thing in hopes that it would get better...but it didnn't. You will be tempted to get the red pen out and mark up the pages!

Wading through the zillion run-on sentences, as well as the same number of comma splices became so distracting, due to the fact that so many sentences and paragraphs had to be reread, that I ceased to care just \\"who done it\\" and turned to the book's final pages. This is too bad, since her last work of fiction (Cannaletto and the Westminster Bridge) was quite good indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent collection","review":"As usual, this is an excellent set of music. This album includes music from both Starday and King eras and is a good overall sampler of Moon's career.Although not as wellknown as Elvis Presley, there is no doubting the similarities between Moon and Elvis: both were very versatile singers, were regarded as the King of their chosen field, had countless imitators and derivatives and loved black music.This CD displays Moon Mullican's unique versatility: from oldtimey country like \\"Wabash cannonball\\" to a raunchy cover of Roy Brown's \\"Grandpa stole my baby\\" to ragtimey tracks like \\"Ragged but right\\" And \\"Magnolia rag\\" to originals like \\"Trifling woman blues\\", \\"Pipeliner blues\\" & \\"What have I done\\", Moon [to forgive the pun] shines throughout. No matter what the genre, he sings and plays with equal enthusiasm and ability and can effortlessly switch from one to the other at will."},{"rating":"2","title":"moon the legend","review":"Well, this disc is a pretty good collection of moon's material. If you are an audiophile you will be let down by the hiss and pops (obviously 45's that were recorded into a digital format) as well as volume changes throughout the disc. BUT, if you are a fan of moon you don't expect hifi recordings. This package has some of moon's hottest tracks (though I wouldn't go so far as to say that all 22 are great hits). Maybe I am biased as moon is my (get ready for this) great great great uncle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moon Mullican not at his best","review":"Ouch this is painful to say, but pass on this CD unless you just want to have everything Moon Mullican did. This CD is was done late in Moon's career and is not his original stuff. It sounds like it Moon, his piano and maybe a guitar player playing in a hotel room someplace. The tape recorder used on this recording in the 1950's is very so so.Moon has so much great stuff, but buy everything else he has out there before this CD>Still its Moon Mullican so that's worth two stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"I bought it for the song Shoot the Moon which I heard on Pandora.

They were shocked to find that I did not know about it- knowing how much I loved \\"Love Story\\". My aunt prepared me for disappointment....but she was wrong.Oliver's story is a gut-wrenching story about the pain and the empty life we often lead after a loved one leaves us too soon. Oliver's Story has no pretense of a happily ever after, and does not leave you with the rain clouds departing. Oliver lives the life we all might lead, absent the glowing Hollywood ending. He struggles a lot in this book, and although you are tragically sad for him, you know the ending is right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oliver's Story","review":"The book was slow paced and boring.

I purchased 2 books from you that I can not use beause all the bars are in Spanish.

Neither one of them is known for following established music formulas, and the two songs here live up to that. The first one is especially nice---a lot of space, a nice steady drone in the back. The guitar is instantly recognizable as Fripp's.

Well, could be, but it is not. At least not for me. The album is hand includes two tracks in which Pripp is handling the guitar and Eno handling the Keyboards. Together they try to create a strange form of primitive ambient music, that for the most part just does not work. The first track is particularly strange, and at times can be even unlistenable. The second track is somewhat better, but still, nothing really stands out. Being a big fan of both musicans, this album is a major disappointment to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality","review":"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the line up, BUT, the recording is poor quality. It's a live recording and the overall sound quality is a reflection of the technology of 1979. My suggestion is for you to buy Bill Bruford's \\" Master Strokes \\". You will hear the same songs, with Allan Holdsworth on guitar and it's a studio recording, so the quality is superb. The live recording just drowns out the overall sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"subpar recording","review":"this was a great band from back in the days when bruford smacked the snare rather than today's fiddly cymbal work (hint: bill, your progressive rock/fusion drumming was/is far more interesting than your attempts to be an old-time jazz-o), but the recording quality is appalling, fluff such as the sponsoring radio station's promotional announcements were left in whilst decent songs were poorly faded out early to fit the 33-1/3 disk layout, and i did mention the recording quality is appalling. spend your money on bruford's studio recordings, \\"feels good to me\\" and \\"one of a kind\\" rather than this lame excuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE the NEW EDITION is a CDR","review":"I love Bill Bruford's musicI think he is one of the best and versatile drummers that came from rock realmI have this Lp for many years.

In all of them or the sound was too processed or is stuffy, but even if I decided to buy this version of The Bruford Tapes. For my surprise it is a CDR! It is sold as CD but it is a CDR.It also has enough space to give us a complete version of Travel with Myself and again a cut version is presented. There are bootlegs with this same entirely concert.

I remember it being played on WNEW-FM in New York at the time of its original release, and have been eagerly awaiting its release on CD.It's hard to believe that a song this good is so-little known in rock music circles. The title track alone is worth the price of the CD if you're into classic late-60's music of the Pink Floyd/Fever Tree variety; and, surprisingly for a group which made only this one album, the majority of the other tracks are enjoyable as well.The sound quality on the CD is excellent.

Huge mistake. While there are a couple scenes where Ava and her fellow actresses shed their clothing, they're only about a half minute in length.The most annoying part was the slow motion. A scene would begin in slow motion, go to regular motion, and back to slow again, all in the span of a minute or two. At first I thought my DVD player was flaking out.The flashbacks were also endless. How many times do we need to see that guy shuffling the cards? Was I supposed to forget about the poker game the first two times I saw it?The plot of this may have been enjoyable if I could keep track of what was going on, but these flaws just completely ruin it, by distracting your attention.The DVD is lacking. Sure, there's a menu, but the only option on it is \\"play movie\\". No scene selection, no extras.Do yourself a favor, and forget about this flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"My husband and I were quite diappointed with this movie. The same song was used throughout the entire video. By the time we finished it, we wanted to shoot the TV. The erotic scenes lacked credibility. Also, there was an exagerated amount of flashbacks, but to make it worse, most of the flashbacks were played in slow motion. This made the video seem longer that it needed to be. I definitely do not recommend this video to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite stories","review":"I love the Little Rascals but the ones featured in this DVD are not my favorite.

Ninety nine percent of the book directly involved the main character Jane Rizzoli. There was marginal direct involvement of the character Warren Hoyt and practically nothing to develop the character of the \\"Apprentice\\". I found myself questioning many of the situations in the book. They either lacked in originality to the point where the situation was too farfetched to be believable, or the situation seemed to lack any relevance to the general flow of the storyline. The ending was truly disappointing as it both peaked and concluded literally within a mere couple paragraphs.If you want something riveting that will keep you on the end of your seat, keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rizzoli & Isles series","review":"A must read for fans of Rizzoli & Isles.

Have had it for 10 days and am still trying to work through the sludge. Jane Rizzoli as a lead in this book is all wrong in my opinion. She isn't likeable, has a chip on her shoulder, and isn't convincing in the role. She is simply too bland to carry a book. I didn't really mind her in the first book as she added color as a supporting character.\\"The Surgeon\\" was a 4 star book that had a beginning, middle, and end. Why a sequel Tess ? 2 thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I've had it with the Tess Gerritson novels. I'm tired of the constant gore fest.

Her personality changes with each page. She is constantly being hunted down by serial killers...she is the target of all the criminals in her 1st and 2nd outing. The books ending has her set up for another criminal adventure with her as the intended victim again. By the tenth installment, hopefully someone will finish the job and put poor Jane out of her misery.This was a hopelessly silly book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Apprentice - Rizzoli & Isles 2","review":"I've read the surgeon and loved it, so I bought the Apprentice and now I am a Rizzoli & Isles addict!

Very good reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Surgeon\\" redux","review":"Thank you, we've all seen quite enough of the superman serial killer. Dr. Hannibal became silly after a couple of reruns. The Surgeon (Hoyt) was barely OK the first time, but to reprise him is to reduce him to a joke and a blatant attempt to cash in on violence. This book isn't even close in suspense to its previous edition.I would also add that the author repeats information and no editor caught it--or the repetitions were included to fill out the book. Let this sub-genre die. Harris did it. Gerritsen does it. James Patterson just did it. And I'm sure there must be others. Let's hope it will end soon and we can get back to real characters and believable crime fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introducing Maura Isles!","review":"I love this series. This is the first appearance of Maura Isles, who is my favorite character. I had already seen the episode that was based on this book, so I knew the overall plot line.

Tess Gerritsen's work is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Tess Gerritsen fan","review":"I have just begun the Rizzoli & Isles series and am liking it already.

There was no page in that whole Novel out of stream. But here everything goes loose. There are many loop holes in this Novel:1: Why the hell Rizzoli is still not out of her misery. Dont tell me you are planning of one more sequel with the same story line...No Please!!!! Why she kills the driver and not Hoyt....Why was Dean always before she reaches the body...many things i dont understand...and is O'Donnel a serial ladykiller?

What was the underlying story?3: From where this war and all FBI crap came into picture..what is the relevance to the storyline...Only one thing I can say..This Novel could have been written and ended in much better way ...but it has pathetic ending..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Skilfull Hands","review":"This addition to the Surgeon, includes a second pair of skilfull hands where there is someone that is helping out the Surgeon. There is a major different twist this time. Not only are the surgeries still being done, but there is also one where the apprentice attacks a couple, and then makes the man watch as the woman is mutilated. To see more adventures, then get a copy of the Apprentice, and read about the situations that these two go through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good not great","review":"This was an good escape book that promised a bit more psyhological development that it delivered. \\"The Surgeon\\", The Apprentice\\" and Gerritson's last novel, \\"The Sinner\\" contain an interesting mix of a independent woman involved in resolving violent crimes against women. Not great but worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the Gore Obessed Only","review":"And I don't mean Al. I was not all that aware of this sub-genre of the cop novel. If lovingly described tableaux of decomposing bodies on the autopsy table or in the field is your favorite dish, then you've found your author. Tess gets right in there with the stench of corpse gasses and the dribbling, squirting liquified putrefaction. You may need a barf bag near to hand when you read this one. What is the deal, people?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Readers wanting medical thriller will be disappointed","review":"I hope this isn't an indication of Gerritsen's changing interests, but this is primarily a police procedural with some but no where near enough medical details for medical thriller fans like me and my husband. I thought Bloodstream was her best, where I felt she skillfully combined a Stephen King-like understanding of teen life with excellent medical background. The Apprentice will appeal to you if you like Tami Hoag."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Hated it. The writing is awful; the story line [stinks]; the characters are psychologically shallow and inconsistent. Midway through the book, I lost interest in the story itself and could have cared less about what happened to its characters. I have better things to do with my life than to spend any part of it reading something as bad as this book. What HAPPENED to Tess Gerritsen?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Started","review":"I have just started this book and hope I don't have to read too many graphic autopsy reports.

If the content is even remotely true, then it is a must read!! I personally have not yet decided whether I believe it or not. However, true or not, this book is definitely unique and worth reading.The author makes no attempt to claim that those who don't believe or read his book will go to hell.

I bought this book from Amazon and wish I hadn't. The author's writing skills are very poor and it comes through in this book. This book is fiction but the author tries to make you believe it is all true. I would believe that the toothe fairy is real before this book. The author gives no proof in his ramblings that the story is true. Angles,Opes Dei,The king of Spain Juan Carlos,the end of the world, anybody can search the internet and find a million hits with the topics he wrote about with the same conspiracies.If you check the authors web site you will read a bunch of writings saying the end of the world is going to happen very soon.

This book was not written 25 years ago, read the copyright. The author may claim that he wrote it 25 years ago but he can also say that he is Bozo the clown. The author is a clown attempting to benefit from 9/11 by writing these lies and claiming that they are true. It took me a couple of days to read this book because it was written like a childs book. Definately not recomended reading material, unless you are interested to learn about another Christian Cult.

I like groups like Everything But the Girl and Morcheeba, but found this cd to be so much better in some respects. Probably because the entire cd is strong and flows really well.The best track is definately 'Destiny' followed by 'Distractions' and \\"In the Waiting Line\\", but pretty much all the tracks with vocals on them are good. If there is one downside to this cd is that some of the instrumental tracks are not as compelling as the tracks with vocals, but that's becuase Sia Furler's voice is so beautful.Still, I love this cd. The music on here is timeless.

This is a great CD!!! And is that really a bad thing to be compared to AIR? Of course, not. Art imitates life, and life imitates art, and all that philosophical crap. And who doesn't sound like somebody else in the business these days--except for maybe Amon Tobin who sounds like nobody else on this planet, but I digress. Zero 7 does something different, of course, by utilizing much stronger vocals on \\"Simple Things\\"--both from male and female, as well as deliver a more soulful/folksy/funky groove than any AIR CD I've heard. Zero 7 is a extraordinarily talented duo and it shows in every track on \\"Simple Things.\\" I've had the CD since the beginning of the year (2003)...nothing unusual for me...call me a late-bloomer...I usually buy a CD several years after its initial release.

This British electronica duo really sends out some contagious soundtrack-like vibes, considering this is their debut album. For those unfamiliar with them, beside Air, if you like material such as Everything But The Girl, Morcheeba and chillout acts such as K+D and Thievery Corporation, you will enjoy their music.Personal favorite tracks: \\"Out of Town,\\" \\"Destiny\\" and \\"Waiting Line,\\" (this last one being totally Air-like, it has to be said.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Genius","review":"There is a fine line between 9 out of 10 and 10 out of 10. That fine line is near impossible to cross in my view, and Zero 7 did it. Its not an adherence to anything, it simply is. Not even a distinguishable similarity in beat with even the most special among talented musicians. Zero 7 has soul, like an inspiring piece of art. They may not sound like others, but given the right circumstance, have totally eliminated any need for narcotics. They are in everyway the true nature of a brilliant band. Buy the cd; you wont regret it. If you don't get a high from the music, keep listening, and if still not, change your life style. If you like Morcheeba, Thievery Corporation, Blue States, and the like, you must learn of this band. Enough said; I made my mark in this world. goodbye"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenominal","review":"I bought the CD after hearing \\"Waiting in Line\\" and am now very glad I did. Being new to this genre of music I've had a hard time finding reliable groups that I can really get into.

I recommend this highly to anyone that wants to reinspire their musical pallete after feeling like they've reached a lull in their listening. I realize this is an older CD, but I had not listened to much electronica earlier and I almost think to categorize Zero 7 and particularly this album as electronica is oversimplifying it. There is much depth to the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like downtempo and lounge house, this is for YOU!","review":"Ever since I bought this CD, it has not left the CD changer in my car. It's one of those CDs you can listen to over and over again when you first purchase the CD. Over time, the entire CD has grown on me. The music has hints of disco mixed with downtempo and occasional light lyrics. The standout tracks for me have been Destiny, Red Dust, In the waiting line, This World, and the bonus track Salt Water Sound. Great for driving, relaxing at home, and for setting the mood wherever you go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful album, but too similar to AIR for 5 Stars","review":"I first heard of Zero 7 when I saw their video, \\"Destiny.\\" I have to admit that they first time I saw it I immediately thought that it was a new AIR song, so I was surprised to see a different name at the end. I just bought this album two days ago and don't regret it. I will say that they are HEAVILY influenced by AIR, which is a fabulous electronic band from France. Zero 7 almost sounds TOO much like them, which is why I couldn't give this album 5 stars. However, their sound is different because of the volcalists. There is a male vocalist as well as Sia for many of the songs. Sia has an angelic yet haunting voice that adds to the mellow and hypnotic sounds of \\"Destiny\\" and others. Electronic music is such a general term, since there are so many genres within it. I would recommend this album to anyone who has enjoyed AIR's Moon Safari. (although I still believe that Moon Safari is much more innovative and original than Simple Things)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still amazing","review":"I remember first hearing Destiny back in 2000-2001 and loving it.

The 2 singers are 0h-So-Pleasant, and Beth Gibbons' voice is nothing if not relating displeasing emotions!Please, check out some real downtempo, sonic-texture artists like Airlock, Crustation or Thunderball.

It's an amazing effort, and Zero 7 demonstrates some amazing ability to utilize pretty varied musical genres and techniques to achieve a cohesive collection of songs that all get stuck in your head after a couple listens. Listen to a well-known track like 'Destiny,' then follow that up with the 'End Theme' track. They are amazingly talented and the music is both incredibly catchy and very genuine. If you like Air or Thievery Corporation this is right up your alley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smoke & sunshine","review":"For the past few years I've listened to chillout and have bought many, many compilations. When an artist stands out, I go and buy their full album. What makes Zero 7 stand out? Well, in electronic music and the rise of the bedroom artist, true musicianship is on the decline. It's become too easy to make bad music. Too much synthesizers, one-finger keyboards and drum loops, and not enough chords, acoustic instruments, melodies and weaving of parts into a whole. I love Thievery Corp, but to be honest, most of their songs are forgettable - a year later, I won't be listening to any of the tracks. St. Germain, on the other hand, gives the feeling that several people were jamming together in a studio session. Zero 7 is on another level above these two excellent artists, with their (guest) vocalists, atmosphereics, emotion, beautiful pads, chords, guitars, hard-yet-soft beats and musical sensibilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zero 7 and Paris under a groove great dinner discs","review":"I bought both records here on amazon. Had some people over and the wine and conversation flowed. Most at the function asked about the music. Zero 7 is organic and smooth funky downbeat music. Paris under a groove is modern day contemporary funk for the sophisticated music lover. And there are tracks for the club minded, like Mantis by Versus, and House De Couette, by Terrasse Tranquille. So, I thought I pass the good word on to others here. Thanks to these records and artists the party kicked off just right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio Bliss","review":"This is the first time I've been inclined to write a review on Amazon--this album is just fantantic.

Instantly the mellow, moving sounds bring a sense of peace and I'm able to get through the day. I swear I have less muscle tension as a result of this CD!\\"Distractions,\\" and \\"Destiny\\" are two of the most beautiful and haunting songs I've ever heard. \\"In the Waiting Line\\" is also exceptional. Sometimes they'll randomly get stuck in my head and I'll HAVE to listen to the CD. Like others have said, it's totally addictive! It's perfect as background music, bathtub music, or makin' love music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chill Out with soul","review":"Easy to listen to, some songs are heartfelt and others more abstract. Definately has Air influence on some tracks. Worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST albums I own (and I have about 400)","review":"This album has quickly claimed the title of one of my favorite albums ever. I'm only sad that Zero 7 doesn't have any other original full length albums yet -- yes, I'm quite sad about that indeed.This is a very eclectic album. Every song is really good and has its own distinct personality. Sexy, innovative, heartfelt, imaginative -- Zero 7 demonstrates their skill with every composition. There are many layers of sound, but all come together to create a beautiful tapestry of aural pleasure. And their lyrics are wonderful.Favs are SPINNING, DESTINY, DISTRACTIONS, IN THE WAITING LINE -- heck they're all great! Truly original and honest. I'm ashamed it took me so long to discover them! Don't wait any longer to get this terrific album."},{"rating":"2","title":"not just fluff","review":"These guys have managed to produce an album that's very mellow, yet not generic. If you listen to the album, it's not just a bunch of canned smooth jazz beats on somebody's keyboard(which is why I disagree with the reviewer who said this has roots in smooth jazz) rather you can hear a lot of moog and rhodes in there, which is probably why all the comparisons to Air have been drawn.Point being, although it's smooth, it's not bland by any means. This is fairly complex, nuanced music, although they're not trying to be Boards of Canada, and they don't need to be. All in all, a well-produced album with quality vocals from a variety of performers over some great lounge music. Stylish and polished, but not cheesy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Unique Album","review":"To this very day, I still recommend this album to new people I meet who are looking for something different....something that lets us escape from reality and it truly gives me a natural high. Everytime I listen to this album it feels as if I am listening to it for the first time and it is so futuristic that you can't even tell that it came out years ago. I highly recommend this one for you mellow cats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music for any setting","review":"This is a fabulous album, I can listen to the whole, thing without skipping ahead to the next song."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRAVELL COMES THROUGH AGAIN","review":"As usual with Travell works, this is a clear and extremely helpful way to see exactly where to go to alleviate your clients' pain.

I got it for my sister for her birthday and she couldn't even play for 5 minutes without getting bored! I am extremely baffled because she's a young child, supposedly what this is suited for, and she even said it was boring! My god, this is a first! A 6 year old child not liking an entertaining kid's game. In a way though, I'm not surprised at all, this game is the most ridiculous thing they have ever even had the nerve to put in stores! Take it from me, this game is very, VERY boring. Don't waste your money. Believe me, all I did was watch my sister play and even I got bored with it! Not worth the $$$ at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best trad-jazz disk in the whole world.","review":"When I was a child I listened to this album on LP (remember them?) and about six years ago my battered and scratched copy finally went missing. I've been hunting a CD copy ever since but the LP was called \\"Pixie Dust\\" and the CD is called Kenny Ball in Disneyland. I can't recommend it highly enough. It is the most \\"up\\" album you will ever buy and I guarantee many smiles for every listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great movie","review":"I love this movie, no matter the cussing and stuff!

(I have all the games of .hack)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad attempt at yu yu hakusho","review":"I love the show yu yu hakusho.. and i was really looking forward to the movie... then i watched it and it wasnt anything special... all the voices are different which makes it hard to follow whos speaking if the voice comes from off screen... second they changed the animation which made it look dumb... the bad guys are really stupid and dont last very long... they set the movie up so that it seems like its after yusuke defeated tugoro yet yusuke cant use his giant spirit gun and is weak as ever... i strongly reccomend renting this movie before buying it.. im glad i did.... also the final fight isnt very good... its all a bunch of running around occasionally throwing punches... but its good to watch just for the experience i suppose thats about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poltergeist Report - A big waste.....","review":"This movie was HORRIBLE, ... I rented this, on the back of thebox it sounded awesome, and when I sat down to watch it, it was sooooboring, the plot is weak, and they skip around too much, it becomes confusing, and a lot of the attacks and dialouge are plain stupid, the fight scenes are very boring, and they do not let you know what is going on, they talk about these five things, and the whole movie revolves around them, and without explaining it, they expect you to understand it. Just dont waste you time, or money on this. Buy something else such as Ninja Scroll, or Ghost in the Shell, both great movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocracy at it's best.","review":"I don't believe this. It's bad enough that the show went straight downhill after Yuske came back to life and basically turning into another DBZ/ Saint Seiya Tournament type show, but now this? I expected a lot from this movie. I figured they could come up with an interesting story that was above what they do in every episode of the T.V. show, but they didn't. It's just more shoujo action. One rediculous fight after another with some of the most horrible back ground music I've ever heard. The only thing keeping this from getting one star is the animation. The animation was handled very well and didn't just look like another episode of the show. If you're a fan of Yu Yu Hakusho, you'll enjoy this. But if you're looking for a an anime that actually requires the least ammount of though, watch anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"not too bad","review":"Yu yu hakasho is my second favorite anime series my first being Inuyasha,but anyway this DVD is definitely worth buying the animation is superb but compared with the series the voice overs are not so good the only character that even begins to sound like his counterpart on the series is Kurama.but if you are a fan of the series this is a good one to have in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was good","review":"The movie was good. it is 1 hr and 30 minutes long.it is about how a demon from the nether world wants to come back with 3 other demons. they have to go to 5 different sites then has to go get the power sphere. yusuke, kuwahara(spelled in the movie),karama and hiei are fighting crime with another guide of the spirt world named hinageshi.botan wasent in most of it because she was really hurt. there are also some funny parts in the movie. the action of the movie was great. the best one in my opinon is the one with hiei vs. this other 3 eye demon also when karama fought his long time friend. the plot was ok thats why it deserved a 4 star. my opinon is if you want action packed movie then you should get this but i recomend that you dont show this to little ones because of the profanity and violence. there is alot of cursing and violence. but overall a great anime movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible anime","review":"A great anime similar to Dragon ball execept the fights arent as drug out and LONG they fight instsead of talking half the time. Since their is no series or manga here yet it is kind of hard to understand but once I looked it up I understood it perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"YYH is great, but this movie really sucked","review":"The voices, the freakin' voices, they are so horrible. The original voices are awesome, why did they change to these new crappy ones. I love the Yu Yu Hakusho episodes, but this movie just can't live up to the show's greatness. It started with a great concept, but the voices combined with what ended up being an incredibly corny script totally ruined it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!","review":"I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS A OSCAR WINNER! NOTHING CHANGED BUT THE VOICES!BUT WHO CARES, THE SHOW WAS CANCELLED!I ALSO LOVE THE PLOT. EVEN THOUGH THE BEGINNING WAS BORING. BESIDE THE FACT THAT BOTAN GOT ZAPPED BY LIGHTING!ALSO THAT THEY ADDED MORE CHARACTERS,I THOUGHT THAT WAS AWESOME!OVERALL IT WAS GREAT!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yu Yu Hakusho Poltergeist Report the movie","review":"This movie is an awesome example of good fighting evil to save the human world. Fans of the television show wiil not be disapointed though use of different voice actors takes getting use to. This is a great story and the demons and battles are animated great. The characters are shown a little differently and in more depth than any episode shows. You also meet characters thet have not yet been shown on US television.In short if you are a fan of Yu-Yu-Hakusho or you just like butt-kicking action,good against evil, then you will not regret buying this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Damn Good","review":"It's a good movie, but obviously dubbed by another company. I suggest that you watch the Japanese version with subtitles. The voices in Japanese are much better and soothing to the ears. They aren't over exagerated like the English dubs.I'm not going to spoil the movie for you, but I reconmend it. You get to see Hiei's new attack, and Kurama's old frined Kurone. For you Kurama fangirls...Kurama takes a bath in a lake, have fun drooling over him.Hiei seems to be the coolest one in the movie and anime, and possibly even the strongest one. Even Yusuke(Main Character) is afraid of him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as Big a Disappointment","review":"I am an avid Yu Yu Hakusho fan. I think the plot line for this is very good. The whole Netherworld concept was explored which was nice. I will admit there were times where it was like huh? why would that happen. But over all it was a good movie.Now for the dub, I don't want this to be a rant. I for one did not mind the dubbing. This was before Funimation had the rights to Yu Yu so of course it is not the same cast. My thing is people complain if its dubbed because of the voices others complain if its not dubbed because then they have to use those oh so unimportant reading skills they acquired (note the sarcasm) so really no one is happy ever.Anyways yeah the voices weren't outstanding to the point they moved me to tears, but hey they were good. I would maybe argue that Kuwabara's voice got a little annoying because of the deepness but again nothing is perfect right?Plot was good, art was nicely done, the voices were also good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money, but worth watching.","review":"I actually sort of liked this movie [...]. The story was pretty weak, it had a good concept but the whole \\"fight battle after battle after battle until you fight the main guy\\" idea wasn't really a good execution. And the voice acting, oh my the voice acting. Its quite bad. There are a couple barable ones in there, and actually the villain has a pretty good actor, but a lot of the main characters are just [...], especially yusuke. As far as action goes, I love it, its got some good fight scenes. That is the only redeeming quality to this movie [...]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting mysticism and brawls","review":"This is a fun anime that explores the relationship between 4 worlds when the balance between them is destroyed. The spirit world join forces against the demon world and netherworld. There's a lot of different influences present -- everything from Dragonball Z, Ah My Goddess, and Fist of the North Star... Botan, Kaeru, and friends must fight to save the universe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just terrible","review":"I cant even watch this movie. I love yu yu hakusho but the bad voice acting kills me. I tried watching this movie I really did...about 25 min of it and I felt like I was going do die. Maybe one day before I die I might watch this of if somehow my cable goes out and someone takes all of tmy dvds but this one I will try to watch it again. I am very dissapointed. I am sure it's a great movie and all dont get me wrong I just cant seem to watch it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad acting, horrible picture quality","review":"The dub of this movie is pretty bad, they get basic things like name pronunciations wrong. And the guy playing \\"Kuwahara\\" is way too serious in the role of a comedy relief character. To make matters worse, the image transfer here is VHS quality at best and is taken from a pan and scan copy of the movie. Now that Central Park Media has gone under, Funimation will probably release a better version of the film at some point."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are people thinking rating this a 4 or 5 Stars?","review":"First, let me just state here that YuYu Hakusho is my favorite anime of all time. No matter what new stuff I watch my heart comes back to this animation.On this note, I have no idea who is rating this. I'm finding more and more that you can no longer rely on people who rate these animations on any sites. This movie was awful; even on the Japanese version; and I'm not talking about the English voice actors. The story plot was terrible and worst of all characters like Kurama and Hiei seemed weak and spoke, in one case, in a way that their characters wouldn't. It was overall bad that I sold it back. For someone who loves YuYu Hakusho it was not easy, but I knew I would never watch it again because it tarnished the characters I grew to love over the course of the series. If there was a 0 Star I would ahve chosen that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie- Bad Dub","review":"First of all if you watch this movie in English you will be disappointed to hear that the voices are not the same as the ones shown on Cartoon Network. With the exception of Kurama the new voices don't fit the characters at all. Kuwabara and Yusuke's voices are especially terrible. Luckily you can watch the movie in its original Japanese language where the voice actors give off a superb performance.The story itself is fun but not anything great. It is your typical \\"save the day\\" type story. However the story is fast paced and enjoyable and it is always nice to see Yusuke, Kuwabara, Hiei and Kurama in action."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did they do?!?!?","review":"I think that manga corps didn't dub it right. They screwed up all of the voices. I'm sure that there is a reason for it, but they killed it! Hiei was ripping out his Jagan eye every minute, and never turned demon. Once you get past the little flaws like that, the movie is actually ok. The plot is good and all. The scariest thing is this: Kuwabara actually sounded intellegent! o.O"},{"rating":"2","title":"horror","review":"I liked this movie.It had a combination of horror/anime.If you like this sort of thing then youll enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"These brown babies gonna boogie for you!","review":"Wow, does this album kick! I'm not a big fan of most live albums, but this one is just outstanding, all the way from the incredible opening overture to the walk-off. It just shows how incredibly talented and versatile the Pointer Sisters were and still are."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING AND FINALLY ON CD","review":"I loved the Pointer Sisters the best when it was the original 4 sisters and their nostalgic/r@b blend was very unique. There musicality was a rare gift. This live recording LIVE AT THE OPERA HOUSE was a favorite of mine when a teen and here it is on cd gloriously remastered.Talk about eclectic. Salt Peanuts will make you dizzy with is amazing speed and harmony. Hands Up/ Wang Dang Doodle allows the sisters to do their amazing improvizational stunts and they soar. The hits Fairytale, Shaky Flat Blues and Steam Heat are all amazing. Each sister gets their time in the spotlight but it is singing together that they are majestic.This music is not dated in the least and it puts modern day young r@b singers to shame. Just pure, raw music talent. This is one of the best live sets of any genre. The ending Love In Them There Hills is a tour de force. You must listen to this to believe its magic. I highly recommend this to any true music lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was there that night.","review":"It was one of the most magical nights of my life. The War Memorial Opera House in SF. The sisters were nothing short of amazing. We sat in an upper balcony and it was over all too soon. I bought the vinyl released shortly after the concert and I wore that album out. I had no idea it was re-released in CD format. I am so excited!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a random order and incomplete","review":"I have the double album (2 records) and it's a live recording. Though the order of the recording on the CD is random, totally off from the original and sometimes the songs are not completely recorded and suddenly end. It really takes the joy away to listen to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"About time Saga put out a concert DVD. Since they never play in the US, it's great to see what all their fans in Europe are getting to see. Not the slickest production DVD you'll ever see, but well worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old footage? why?","review":"I have not bought this disc (yet) I most likely will because I'm an old fan of SAGA. I can't believe thought that they would actually release old video concert footage if that's what people are saying. I'd expect a 5.1 DTS mix and videos that were possibly shot within a year or 2 of it's release, not from the 80's. I mean come on I hope they can make another DVD with more recent technology. I'm guessing that perhaps SAGA thinks they themselves have lost the magic from yesteryears.But nonetheless I will buy it. I remember growing up in Luxembourg seeing 2 live concerts and having a great time. I even had a live video concert on VHS that was broadcast on a German TV station back in the 1980's. I wish I had kept it.. now I can get the DVD and still feel like I was there again (flashback, oh yea)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Album That Never Was\\"","review":"An excellent concept, this album packages all the master tracks from two Nashville sessions in May 1963 and January 1964 into one complete set. Originally intended as an album, the May '63 tracks instead were used as singles and album \\"fillers\\" over the next few years.Some of the mixes differ from their original releases: \\"Blue River\\" doesn't fade-out (unlike the version used on the \\"Double Trouble\\" soundtrack); while different mixes are noticeable on several tracks, including \\"Devil In Disguise\\", \\"(It's A) Long Lonely Highway\\" and \\"Witchcraft\\", in which Elvis's vocal is given more prominence at the expense of the backing vocals.

I'm a beginner and I was looking for a DVD that would teach me some different rythms, preferrably in an easy \\"play along\\" way.If that is what you too are looking for then I would really recommend you to skip this DVD and go with Thione Diop's DVD!! The \\"Remembering How to Drum: Djembe Technique\\" was a big dissapointment and I can't understand how it has gotten such good reviews (even if there is just eight reviews) - are you friends of the producer??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD to teach all the basics!","review":"This DVD is great for all levels of djembe players! I've taken lessons and still had plenty to learn from this. The full songs even allow you to practice solo-ing. But I really think it is great for beginner to intermediate players. I played this for a few friends who'd never played and they still had some beats down after the first viewing. The choice of viewing angles really helps develop your technique too. Definitely a great purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very useful","review":"I felt the author was showing off his skills but not teaching much. Other than the very basics, you will not learn much about rythms and technique from this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool","review":"I really enjoyed this DVD. The instructor is very charismatic, unlike most instructional videos. He really knows his stuff. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because I don't believe that any DVD or video can really train a person to play an instrument. It comes from personal experience, not formula."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for me as a beginner","review":"I read the reviews and the DVD held true to the promises. I really appreciated being able to see over the drummer's shoulder or switch to seeing him from the front. This is very helpful. I also find that having control on the drums heard in a piece made it much easier to follow. In three weeks my skills have come a long way.I would buy another DVD by this skilled teacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good golly","review":"This has to be about the best book I have ever seen.

I've owned this album since it was issued and it has to be the most personal and quietly devastating work of musical art I have ever experienced. Frighteningly devastating...how can we ever thank you Harold Budd and Brian Eno..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best Budd/Eno team-up album of all time","review":"Even more than \\"Music for Airports\\" and \\"Plateaux of Mirror\\", this album is the definitive collaboration album from the Budd & Eno archives. A groundbreaking classic of the ambient genre, this disc just gets better with time, especially in an era when the New Age and ambient genres have been overrun with imitators and dilettantes.Subtle, gorgeous piano and synthesizer work features throughout, with a richness and emotion that is hard to find on other ambient albums. When it comes to \\"relaxation\\" tunes, this one has the field beat, and I've spent many an evening, in bed, under the stars, with my wife or alone, letting the quiet, spare beauty of this disc spirit me away from the troubles of the everyday world.Anyone seeking to find the roots of true ambient should look no further. Budd & Eno were doing it long, long before most others, and they were doing it with a style and a gentle grace that has come to typify their collaborative efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect solitude at dusk . . .","review":"This CD is a masterpiece.

The music has a less “soundscape�?style to it and is more structured (probably due to the piano). Simple chords introduce every track before the piano starts playing a hunting and beautiful melody. Every single song from this album creates a calm, enchanting atmosphere and wakes melancholy in the listener.Most opinions about The Pearl that I’ve read claim it to be a masterpiece of ambient. After the very first listen I couldn’t agree more with them.

To top everything off, I sent in the rebate and after 18 weeks I'm still waiting.I have requested a status update of the rebate but no response.I purchased the unit because the rebate made it an attractive buy.

Boy was I wrong. After the first week, the garbage headphones that it came with stopped working. After a month, the sound kept on going on and off and stopped working the next week. It is also very hard to navigate around this thing. Save yourself the time and money and buy yourself something like the SanDisk Sansa m230 which is a little more money, but probably worth it. Now I'm stuck with a broken mp3 and I am going for the m230. Trust the reviews. The people that gave this a good review, probably rated this a day after they received their mp3 player.

Even the so called \\"kids\\" mp3 players available are at least $80 or more in the toy stores. I found this one for under $40 and it has been a great bang for the buck! It actually does a bit more than I expected for the price. It allows you to scroll through menus to choose music, ebooks, sort through your albums and even has a little voice recorder. The voice recorder is great fun for the kids. It is smaller than I expected too but the buttons are easy to learn and it is so light weight. The earbuds are less than comfortable, but what do you expect when they \\"come with\\".

The acting is sub-par, the \\"campfire stories\\" are dull and predicatable, and the myriad video camera angles and technqiues border on the nauseating at times (oh, not to mention the worst CGI you'll see this year in the \\"Indian\\" story). It's such a waste of time, that there is really nothing at all ever remotely interesting enough to make a comment like \\"worth seeing for a laugh\\" or the usual... Just skip it - save your time and money. (yes - it is one of THOSE movies, sorry to say).Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.

It is set with the typical story of three teens, lost in the woods after their car gets a flat, who come upon a crazy looking guy in a boy scout uniform. The overgrown boy scout proceeds to tell the teens three scary stories around the campfire, ostensibly while waiting for a tow truck. Each of the three scary stories become small movies within the movie. Very Tales From the Crypt in style. Of course, the movie ends with them dead.While I can't consider this great horror or very thrilling, it delivers on all the necessary points to be graded as an excellent Bgrade flick. There's enough entertainment value to justify a few watchings if you are willing to suspend disbelief and your higher sensibilities. Much like a Jello No-Bake cheesecake, you can enjoy it if you just accept it on it's own terms and stop trying to convince yourself that it's something other than what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"trash","review":"this movie is not even worth renting, trust me. the entire crew of this movie put so little effort into all aspects of production that it is completly unwatchable.

The recording is exceptionally well done and the compositions, all by Ms. Miwa, are lovely. The only criticism I have is that I was hoping to hear some traditional jazz standards and there were none. Even just a couple standard tunes if played as well as all the tunes on this CD would have caused me to give the rating five stars. Hopefully in the future she will produce a CD with some standards. Ms. Miwa's music is lovely to listen to and her talent is comparable to other Japanese jazz musicians such as Toshiko Akiyoshi (the grand dame of Japanese jazz pianists), Ayako Shirasaki, Eri Yamamoto and Junko Onishi.

It has an ancient, murmuring, earthen quality, with rich percussion, a sense of centuries passing by. It also captures the heady art pop music scene of the early 80's. I would put this in a series of Brian Eno's other canonical collaborations from this time, namely My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, and The Talking Heads' Remain in Light. I know I've placed Hybrid in excellent artistic company, and am convinced it deserves the praise. Ancient and modern, resolving the seeming paradox effortlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Exist - this was a homemade bootleg","review":"I think I know what happened. You'll notice Amazon has it listed under \\"Everything Else\\" and not \\"Music\\". That's becuase it was probably only ever available (like collectibles) from one of their affiliate vendors, not Amazon themselves.What most likely happened is someone tracked down all the individual tracks listed in the end credits, made their own compilation CD, printed up a cover, and sold it as the soundtrack (illegally, I might add!). This often happens with unavailable soundtracks.Further giveaways it wasn't an official release: The font of the title is wrong compared to the official theatrical posters and DVD art, and the listing says it's from MCA Records. MCA owns Universal Pictures - Ferris was put out by Paramount; they wouldn't release through MCA."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUCH A BLESSING!!!","review":"I have never read a book that simply felt so real in my heart.

I have a close friend in Mother Clare's church, the Order of Christ/Sophia. I have seen a lot of disturbing changes in her behavior since her involvement with that group. I have also seen a lot of practices in that church that don't seem very supportive of families, and don't even strike me as very Christian. I was hoping that reading this book would give me some comfort and reassurance about Clare's beliefs and her church's practices. After reading this book, and hearing Clare speak, I am more disheartened. Spiritual wholeness is more than just internal feelings and visions. You have to live your life in giving and loving ways. I agree with the reviewer below ... most of the positive reviews here seem to be written by members of Clare's church.

This movie is seriously under rated. We all know the story of Justin Bieber, but this movie goes into far more detail about his early career and let's you know about things we all wondered. Like what happened to the girl that beat him in the Ontario talent show?! She's in this movie!! And she talks about her life after beating Justin Bieber. The movie also has interviews from people who actually matter in the music industry. Big name celebs like Snoop Dogg and Rihanna. Tons of soundbites from Justin Bieber himself and the quality of the film is way better than others I have watched. If you are truly a fan of The Bieb then you should want an accurate in-depth look at his life leading to his stardom. This film delivers just that and I am glad to be adding it to my collection. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best video on Justin...","review":"After viewing all the DVDs available on Justin Bieber, I have to say this is the worst one. It was boring. Ten year old got up and left the room, she said she liked Never Say Never better. So did I. This one was ALL talk, no singing and we didn't care for some of the people reviewing his rise to fame. Even the title was misleading to me. Also didn't care for the constant reference and filming of the girl that beat him out in his home town talent contest. She's certainly no Justin Bieber. Got the feeling the people in the DVD just didn't care much for him. I'm no teenager, but I like him and think he has a good chance of being around a while. If he can keep his head and not go \\"Hollywood\\" on us. This DVD was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.","review":"Bought this for my pre-teen who loves Justin Bieber.

This book helps to explain the metabolic reations that occur within the bodies of people who are insulin resistant, and explains how changing the way we eat combats insulin resistance - which results in weight loss.When I follow this diet - I find that it is actually easier than I thought it would be, that I feel satisfied, my cravings are gone, and I have been losing - and keeping off - the weight.

I did take away a few general principles that I will apply to my eating, but overall I don't see myself being able to follow this plan. Also a large part of this book is recipes and lists of foods. I'm sure someone who has serious blood sugar issues and the ability to follow a strict plan would benefit greatly from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like this book at all!","review":"I found nothing new about IR in this book that I didn't already know.

I cant wait to try the menus and look forward to feeling better soon.I have tried extremely low fat diets but it became boring and soon was on my way back to my old eating habits, either no food at all or ice cream and cereals.

Terrible recipes full of fake, tasteless, plastic fat-free foods. The food on this plan gave me horrible cravings because I wasn't eating enough fat. Also, the authors don't address sugar cravings and hypoglycemia. So I made the chocolate cake and ate half of it at once and then made myself throw the rest out so I would stop eating it. I stopped using this plan after a day or two, it was obvious it wouldn't satisfy me and my energy wasn't great either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulin Resistance Diet","review":"I really didn't think it was all that great.

It gives you a very simple solution to keep from feeling hungry and help your body turn food into energy instead of storing it as fat. I've read it and passed it onto my father who has diabetes. It is extremely easy to follow and you can eat any foods that you want so long as you adhere to the guidelines of when, how much, and what to eat it with.

I went from a size 18 to a size 8. A year later I am still following the plan because it was so easy to make it part of my life. I am off all cholesterol lowering medication, my blood pressure is perfect, and I feel wonderful. I have ordered this book several times because I give mine away when people ask me how I lost the weight. I love this book so much because after 4 years of trying to get the 100 pounds of weight off from having a child nothing seemed to work until I found The Insulin-Resistance Diet.

My more then exciting introduction is about how I felt about the book. There were facts, lots of them but overall no real excitement or much to get the normal reader interested in the book. I got through about 175 pages before I gave up. The author tried to punch up the book, but the subject matter did not lend its self to it, there is just noting scandalous or exciting about a well-run company. This is more of a 400-page case study best left to a university class on management.

I love the Law and Order and CSI games, and I assumed this would be the same type of game. Oh how I wish I'd read the reviews on this site first. This game is nothing more than a poorly put together advertisement for the show Cold Case Files. The only gameplay involved is clicking on something when it pops up on the screen.

I finished the first case in 5 minutes and then i replayed it thinking there would be a different outcome because the game states 35 possibilities but the outcome was the same. I finished the whole game in less than an hour. there isnt really much playing to do and thinking involved at all. you barely collect evidence or work in the lab. this game was really a waste of time and money. All six cases dont add up to 1 case of CSI."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold. Case Closed.","review":"Rubbish. Honestly is.My wife completed the whole game in just over hour and half.

At the end, you are told to go to the A&E; Cold Case Files web site to download a special bonus case. Good luck finding that, I certainly never did.There is no support for this game anywhere. It's like Activision completely forgot they even made it. I was so excited to get this and get home to play it, and ended up being incredibly heartbroken. The other reviewers are correct in that there is no thinking required, just click on the right thing at the right time. Avoid, you're better off with just about anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Game","review":"I bought this game thinking it would be along the lines of the CSI or Law and Order series. What a mistake. There is no guesswork or thinking involved in this game.

Waste of the whole hour it took me to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"The way the box reads you think that you are actually going to have to think your way through the game.

Each song is intertwined with unusual, Pink-Floydish sounds which fit perfectly between each song. One who is not familiar with Pink Floyds music will find this almost like a complete dissappointment. At least that's what I thought when I bought the CD in January of 2002. I thought it was horrible. I didn't know a good majority of the songs, nor did I know much behind the band's disposition with Syd Barrett and that he was their main inspiration and huant throughout their history as a group. After listening to this CD for a 3rd or 4th time, it came to me as classical music. Beautifully inspired are the songs, and wonderfully inventive are the lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I'll cut to the chase- what's wrong? Big hits not included! No 'Dirty woman'. Should have been a (reasonably priced) 3-CD collection, not jammed on 2 discs.

This album is for newbies, younger fans who need exposure to Pink Floyd. Granted even ten cds would not do Pink Floyd justice but that would not be cost effective. The songs picked represent different phases in Pink Floyds career.

I don't necessarily agree with all of them. Who but PF could sell yet another CD with the same old stuff?

It may have some of the biggest known singles such as Us and Them, Money, Wish You Were Here, etc.. But How the hell on earth do the songs such as Young Lust, Run Like Hell, Brain Damage/Eclipse are missing.. That's baffle me. Also, The songs from Syd era are under represent. But the sequential of the songs is really killing me.. They don't flow smoothly from song to song. Hence, the concept of \\"Concept Album\\" is entirely missing.. And that's not Pink Floyd.

It's an excellent overview of Floyd's hits, showcasing their weird but intriguing sounds and lyrics. This collection is particularly good for people who like Floyd, but aren't such hard-core fans as to have all of the individual albums. The obvious hits from the radio [Brick in the Wall, Hey You, Money, Learning to Fly] are here, as well as lesser-played but still great stuff, like Arnold Layne and Fletcher Memorial Home, and when the Tigers Broke Free, which is a heartfelt reflection on losing a father to war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pink floyd is not meant to be listened to like this","review":"Pink floyd songs are great, yes. But, Pink Floyd albums are supposed to be listened to one album at a time for the full effect to take place.

However, the way the songs are listed could've been thought out more meticulously and arranged differently. And there are a few songs that could've been omitted such as The Fletcher Memorial Home and When The Tigers Broke Free since these tunes focus more on Roger Waters's songwriting genius rather than the collaborative effort of the whole band. These could've been replaced with fine tunes such as Welcome To The Machine and Have A Cigar. Its a good thing they included the song Echoes, the namesake of this greatest-hits package, since that tune exemplifies the band at the peak of its creative ability.

Marooned is shorter than the version from The Division Bell2. Echoes is also around 16 minutes, not the awesome 24 (I realize this is beacuse the disc can only hold 80 mins. of music)3. Why is Us and Them not right after Money?4. Where's Young Lust, Run Like Hell, Dogs, Have a Cigar, and Lucifer Sam?The good stuff:1. It flows very nicely for a greatest hits album2.

Its complete and utter nonsense. Now, lets assume for one brief second that the addition of When the Tigers Broke Free makes up for this unfortunate error in judgement.

It still works, and the sound quality's excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"believe the hype","review":"This is an outstanding compilation. Pink Floyd is of course an \\"album\\" oriented band, but they manage to pull off the \\"best of\\" title with the tracks delivered here. My only complaints are that \\"Echoes\\" isn't the complete 23 minute version, instead we get a 16 minute edition. It's too bad the band didn't find a way to include that entire song, as it is probably their best ever, and is after all, the song the cd itself is named for. I think some of the other tunes are edited as well, though i'm not sure. Also, where in the world is \\"Run Like Hell\\"??!! One of their most popular and biggest hits is mysteriously absent.

Its concept is, simply, the story of Floyd as told by its four members and the ghost of Syd Barrett. That being said, it could still be better (as much of the other 76 reviews attest.) If the 2 minutes of the edited \\"Marooned\\" were eliminated, there'd be room for \\"Young Lust\\", \\"Nobody Home\\" or maybe \\"The Gunner's Dream.\\" And exactly how is it that not one of the reviews mentions the omission of \\"Fearless\\"?It would have been great to see this artwork on a large vinyl album cover.

However, nothing from More, such as Cymbaline or Main Theme, nothing from Obscured by Clouds, such as Free Four or Childhoods End, and no Brain Damage, Eclipse, Mother, Run Like Hell, Carefull with that Axe,Eugene, etc.etc.etc. Nevertheless, with the segue ways and so forth, it is still an excellent buy.

If you want \\"Cymbaline\\" or \\"Mudmen,\\" then I see where you stand. Echoes gives no justice to Pink Floyd whatsoever. They give it a new identity. Pink Floyd is supposed to be slightly different in every release. This just jumbles everything up in an ugly mess...I am just happy they were wise to include \\"Fletcher Memorial Home\\" and \\"Bike.\\" Although maybe this wasn't a good move because all these garbage-consuming people want is Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall. I like both albums, but I certainly believe there is more to Pink Floyd than just that."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehhhh","review":"I don't think the selection is very good...For starters, where is \\"Green is the Colour,\\" where is \\"Summer of '68,\\" where is \\"Wot's Uh the Deal??\\" My three favorite Floyd songs, missing.The stuff between Syd Barrett and Dark Side is poorly represented...

I looked forward to this 2-CD compilation, thinking \\"It's about time!\\", only to be disappointed once again, and cancelled my order upon learning what the cuts included on this so-called \\"Best of\\" farce would be. Way too much space is devoted to early Floyd's Syd Barrett psychedelic noodlings, and not enough to truly essential Floyd.

Nowadays the general public is bombarded with boy-band crud and fred friggin durst and his brand of pseudo rock. The timing behind this release could not be any better. Aside from Radiohead, music isn't very exciting today. Echoes was intended for a broader audience accustomed to TRL and its bland offering.Even the most hypercritical Floyd loyalist can appreciate the fact that a new generation of music lovers are drawn to the sonic beauty of this album. Remember how you felt when you first heard the Dark Side of the Moon?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Echoes: the best of pink floyd","review":"I agree with other reviewers, this two disk set is missing so many songs that I consider hits. In fact, only half the songs included in this set could be considered hits. I can't ever remember hitting the forward button on my cd player so often, to skip songs. Who decided all these songs were hits? Will a second anthology come out next Christmas with the rest of the hits? Only a true die-hard fan will enjoy all the songs on these two disks and they probably already have the original albums. Even though you won't hear the song on this set, I suggest that like Mr. Floyd, you hang up on this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"Finally, a collection of Pink Floyd's hits are all together in one place, This is a must own for all true Floyd fans.

That song just creeps me out, especially the freaky noise at the very end.Secondly, I'm disappointed that they cut Gilmours Blues solo in SOYCD.I still give it 5 stars though.EDIT: BTW...

The only good thing about this compilation is the artwork. If you don't have any Floyd albums Dark Side of the Moon will suffice just as good or even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry..that's not pink floyd","review":"First let me say - Pink floyd is the best band ever existed. They made music at it's perfect shape.BUT - Pink Floyd is not a band that should put out a greatest hits CD. Every CD that was made by Pink Floyd has it's own personality. every song matches the record and is an integal part of it. To take some of their more popular songs and put it on a collection disc - is WRONG.

So I am a huge fan. I think they should have added some songs like Brain Damage, welcome to the machine etc. I don't understand why they put Echoes and Shine on you crazy diamond but didn;t put dogs on it. Other than that, this album is perfect. Here are my favorite Pink Floyd Songs:1. Comfotably Numb2. Learning to Fly3. Sorrow4.High Hopes5. Marooned6.Us and Them7. Brain Damage8. Welcome to the Machine9. Run Like Hell10.A Pillow of Winds"},{"rating":"2","title":"I had \\"High Hopes\\" for this collection.","review":"Amazingly enough, even though this \\"Best Of\\" includes 26 tracks, it's still too little for \\"Pink Floyd\\". I'm sure even a casual fan could easily add another 13 track disc to this set. I won't even begin to say what's missing though. I normally like a career spanning selection too, but the early stuff (Syd Barrett years), though it's good, is just too different from the majority of their material, and could have been dropped for more essential songs. But on the bright side, this is all great music, some of it mindblowing really, and is a good collection for fans new or old. In fact, this is almost as good as \\"The Wall\\" album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Floyd fan but box set could have been better","review":"The songs on this cd were all good but there should have been some live performances and some more songs in general. Also, a story booklet about the formation, success and fall of the band would have been nice too, most people probably wonder why Roger Waters is such a strange person. The live versions of Mother, Young Lust, the rare version of pigs on the wing and the normal version of goodbye blue sky would have been nice as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointoing","review":"When I got this CD, I expected the best of albums such as Dark side of the Moon, Wish you were here, the wall, etc...

Maybe I just enjoy reveling in how misinformed the negative opinions can be. In this case, I agree with all of the \\"pro\\" ratings. My only gripe is that nobody has talked about the amazing job the producers did in re-mastering all of this material. This collection represents a phenomenal bit of engineering that is worthy of the advanced output that Waters and company have provided throughout the (many) years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Floyd's albums, not songs","review":"Although this album has some great songs, I recommend buying their albums, not their individual songs. The meaning is lost on songs from \\"The Wall\\" and \\"Animals,\\" among others, because the entire album is more like one song, telling a story. Each song, like \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and \\"Mother,\\" are only segments of these terrific pieces of art, so it appears that the songs have no meaning. And even if you disagree, where are other classic hits, like \\"Dogs?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"where's Have a Cigar","review":"There could have been a few more inclusions -- Have a Cigar, Brain Damage, The Final Cut but the songs here are a nice overview of the history of the band from Syd Barrett up to the latest lineup.

I am a HUGE Pink Floyd fan, and I must say that I am very disappointed with 'Echoes'. It lacks songs that people really need to hear. Songs like \\"Have A Cigar\\" \\"Welcome To The Machine\\" and also \\"Run Like Hell\\". My main reccomendation is to not buy this. If you want to start with something, start with Dark Side Of The Moon, or Wish You Were Here. Later, explore The Wall and all others. And one more thing, don't buy this only for \\"When The Tigers Broke Free\\". That has much more meaning to the movie than standing alone in a poorly put together \\"hits\\" compilation."},{"rating":"1","title":"and if the band you're in starts playing different tunes....","review":"Well, some people might get into Floyd because of this compilation and that's always a good thing but as far as I'm concerned Gilmour and company can ride the gravy train to the slightly dusky side of the moon and they won't recapture past glories. Money seems to be more important to people than art these days but if this twitching dead horse of a band ever decides to release something worthwhile and say to hell with the sales figures then the people that these millionaires owe their money to would be delighted to hear some of the out-takes, BBC and live recordings left in the vaults. That would be very nice thankyou but a coffee table compilation for the fashion victims seems to defeat the object of there even being a Pink Floyd in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"if you are a true fan than there is one thing that you'll realize. pink floyd's discs are all individual, with all of the songs flowing together to create a beautiful harmony. putting them together as a best of takes away from the story of each cd, ie dark side, wish you were here, and the final cut, to name a few. its like reading the cliffs notes on a great story, you only cheat yourself of the experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"another rehash","review":"Great.

I can easily keep this down anytime...but it was ok till last, however as usual the author ends the novel by opening the climax in just one page with no more details there. I feel she tries to build lot of things in overall novel but dont give some time to explain the climax....it just ends with no full explanation..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sinner","review":"This was a great book....I love the series very much. Tess Gerritsen spins a very good story and keeps you guessing until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Uncharacteristic Showing","review":"I have been highly impressed by Tess Gerritsen's style of writing in her previous novels: Gravity, The Surgeon, Harvest, The Apprentice. Unfortunately, The Sinner does not carry with it the same level of suspense and excitement that has made her other titles absolute page-turners. In fact, there is nearly no suspense involved for the first 3/4 of the book, as the mystery tying together 3 seemingly unrelated crime scenes is unraveled at a painfully prolonged pace. Yes, this is more of an average quality murder mystery novel than the characteristically excellent medical thriller that has made Gerritsen a multiple-time New York Times bestselling author. Although The Sinner certainly is readable, I would recommend spending your time on one of Gerritsen's more acclaimed titles instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This was disappointing is so many ways: the plot started out nicely then took a huge wrong turn -especially when the ultimate villain was someone who would never have been allowed to be in the position he/she was in (I don't want to spoil the end for those who may want to read the book); both lead female characters were too \\"pat\\": strong women who excelled at that work, but were unlucky in love. A fast read, but in the end, a dissapointing one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordiness kills this story","review":"I'll keep it short and to the point. The story itself would be OK, but this book is so incredibly wordy, I found myself saying \\"shut up and get on with it\\" too often. The author details everything, and what's worse, is redundant. I don't need to hear that the priest has strikingly blue eyes every time he's injected into the story. The story is further damaged by the reading of Dennis Boutsikaris. Any sentence that started with \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" was articulated ridiculously. Nobody talks like that and it gets very irritating very quickly listening to someone read like this. I only finished these CD's because I invested too much time listening to the first 3 while giving it a chance. Strip away all of the nonsense and tell the story with a little more precision and it would be a pretty good book. But with the extreme excessive wordiness, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This book was way below Gerritsen's usual standards. She couldn't seem to decide if the book was a romance or medical thriller. The plot was engaging at first, but then got silly.

The Bone Garden shouldn't have seen the first printing, The Surgeon and The Apprentice are okay due to the appearance of Mr. Hoyt. The Sinner inspired the deepest apathy in me of any book I have read in years. A quarter way in I realized that I didn't care one single bit about Jane, Maura, the victim, the nuns, Gabriel Dean or any of the plots surrounding them. If you like Tess Gerritson you will probably like this book... I personally just don't see the appeal though.

Highly recommend \\"The Sinner.\\" Received in perfect condition, and quick and easy transaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"Rare is the thriller that can scare me enough to leave the lights on at night, while bringing me to tears. The Sinner did both. Filled with more twists and turns than a labyrinth, The Sinner throws a curve at both Jane Rizzoli and ME Maura Isles. Jane must deal with a huge obstacle in her life as well as her relationship with Gabriel Dean, and Maura must face her own ghosts in the form of her ex-husband.This book serves as a pivotal point in the character development of both women, and is a must-read if you are a follower of the series.The mystery itself is tantalizing and surprising. No plot spoilers here -- you must read it yourself to see how the death of two nuns in Boston relates to a terrorist attack on a colony of lepers in India. A true page-turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something??","review":"Maybe I missed something that everybody else caught, but I found the book, somewhat lame.I thought the characters were weakly portrayed, and the story line very predictable.I had to force myself to pick it back up and finish it to the last page.Only glad it was borrowed, and not purchased"},{"rating":"2","title":"A strong read","review":"I have read all of Tess Gerritsen's books, and have been thoroughly happy with all of them. They have all been excellent. They all have various themes to them. The Sinner has many different adventures that Rizzoli, and her group have to solve, but there is one main theme in this book involving a nunnery. Read this book to see all of the adventuers that Rizzoli and her crew go through, and you will be hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly didn't finish this one","review":"I wasn't sold on The Sinner as I was withThe SurgeonandThe Apprentice. While the latter two had elements of romance, The Sinner seemed to be flooded with them. It's not to say I'm not a fan of romance - I have read a couple of Nicholas Sparks novels in my time - but I really don't like to see it in my crime fiction. Of course I know that romance is a character builder and it's must if you want three-dimensional characters, but the focus was on it - at least for me - quite often in this novel. From the uncertainty of Rizzoli's situation to Maura's ex-husband returning to after a three-year estrangement, it seemed too much like a TV crime drama where aspects of their case mirror their persona lives.But Gerritsen doesn't fail me with her prose. Still compelling as ever, The Sinner is much a page turner as its predecessors. I only hope that the next book in the series, Body Double, lives up to her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great read","review":"I love all of Ms Gerritsen's books.This one is another page turner start to finish!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Edge of seater!","review":"This series of books by Tess Gerritsen is absolutely a page-turner.

This book was a major step down from her other work. I found the character of Maura Isles to be a tired rehash of other ME characters and I found the rest of the people/plot elements to be both wooden and predictable.Maura has a series of very strained love interests which do nothing at all for the book and only function to irritate the reader.Gerritsen must be feeling the pressure to release work quickly, because I know from her other work that she can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love the TV program but was so disappointed that the books and the program were so different.

Am tired of having to upgrade fairly new software just for Vista 64, tired of not being able to hear streaming music, not being able to use my Slingbox, not being able to see certain HTML effects, and not being able to get help for any of this. I also needed something that would work with my other hardware such as printers, scanners, etc. for which there are no Vista 64-bit drivers. By the time Vista 64-bit is ready, five years will likely have passed. Don't buy this unless you're running something that truly needs it or you have another PC that you can count on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got a Palm? It won't sync","review":"I just got off the phone with Palm -- they have absolutely no products that will be compatible with this Microsoft 64 bit technology. No patches at all, either. So if you have a Palm -- watch out -- it will NOT work with this. Palm says Microsoft issue. You will not be able to use any Palm software at all. That means if you have a palm PDA, it will forever be stuck in the PDA and not go onto your computer at all, if you get this software."},{"rating":"2","title":"Windows Vista Home Premium 64 Bit","review":"I have had the product installed for over a month now, and I have no complaints about the OS. The only issue that I have encountered is that not all of my old software plays nice with my new 64 bit OS as a result I wasn't able to reinstall all of my old apps. No problem I have since found alternatives for most, but still miss some. Fortunately I still have an XP machine in the house and can load the apps on that machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Distance","review":"On Land is the finest of the Ambient series or any to date. Thursday Afternoon and Neroli are excellent as well but the mood of this one is so far out in distance you never return! Eno is an amazing soundscapist and a master mood conjurer. For the no. 1 album in ambience - this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have Masterpiece","review":"Brian Eno is the greatest of the unsung musical geniuses of the 20th Century. Eno's audioscapes fall somewhere between soft wind and the rarest cognac. A treat for the ears and the soul. This album should be part of any serious audiophile's record collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Land + Plight and Premonition mix","review":"Here's something I've been doing lately: Synchronize \\"On Land\\" with track 2 of David Sylvian's \\"Plight and Premonition\\". Put both CDs on infinite repeat and start them up (make sure the sylvian goes from track 2 on to track 1, then 2, then 1, etc.) The two seem to mesh together in a really weird way. And they're not the same length, so you could keep this going on and on forever if you wish. I like to think of this as in the same spirit as Eno's recent \\"generative\\" work: a mini-installation, if you will.Try it out. You might like it. The Sylvian seems to be unavailible on Amazon, but I found it for sale at the All Music Guide [website]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music to daydream to","review":"I discovered Brian Eno by accident a few months ago and I have to say that it is some pretty amazing. I am a big soundtrack and classical music fan. I also like New Age music from the Windham Hill days and I am always searching for something to relax to that isn't too distracting. Brian Eno's \\"Ambient\\" sound is very cool. It is music meant for daydreaming. I highly recommend you give it a listen. His other ambient work is all excellent as well. I do not like his vocal or Roxy Music sounding stuff however...it seems that he has experimented with a lot of different sounds and music genres."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible...","review":"There really isnt any other recording quite like this one...I rememeber when we first got this..this recording blended so well into our urban environment, that we kept going over to the sound system and turning it down to see if the sound was in the recording or part of our city environment...An incredible piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Believe in what you buy (nobody else will)","review":"What a pity the impulse to review CDs stems from a personal drive to let others know how good we think things are - so very different from the political motives that forge the expression of ideas. But, that's capitalism for you. As for this CD, it isn't even half as good as those previous reviewers claim, but the record companies won't mind that a jot, now will they."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Land","review":"If you are in the market for music, don't get this. This is not music. This is a collection of finely tuned soundscapes. Each track will put you in a particular place. It may be peaceful, a little off center, maybe even a bit disturbing. Your ear may yearn for resolution, but none may come. I don't have much music in my collection like this. I think it's good to have though, for those moods when you don't want a lot of structure and instead would like to float through sound. It's engaging and overall yields a good experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately my favorite of the 4 ambient records","review":"On Land is an important, interesting record in so many different ways. I have always been intrigued by the concept of the album, Eno is trying to create a collage of different places, similar to the way you remember a certain place or time in your mind. Indeed, the album is dense with auditory imagery and each piece makes you feel as if you are in a different surrounding. Many complain that this is music to sleep to. Yes, this has been known to induce lucid dreaming, in fact, but that does not mean that it is in any way a boring record, in fact quite the opposite. You just need to have patience and a probing ear. Many fans of eno have said this record is too dark and dreary, but I would describe it more as enveloping and dream-like. Any way you look at it, On Land is quite worth the price if you are at all interested in different styles of ambient music or in the musical life of Brain Eno."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dazzling","review":"If you want a virtuoso romp across the keyboard this is it with incredible runs that are mind-boggling.

Can we really be expected to believe that it took, like, 45 minutes for an ambulance to be brought to an officer?Snipes lines seemed.......labored. I don't know if it is because it was out of character for him or if the writing was really just that bad.Whatever the case, this movie went right into the trash after being viewed.

The author is either unaware or does not acknowledge the strong empirical data that sharply disagrees with her use of statistics. I cannot recommend to any client in my practice a book which is so blatently incorrect in its research on this subject. There are many other books available on the subject of domestic violence that I believe women would find of much more use to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"barefoot in paris cookbook","review":"I went to Paris hoping to purchase this for friends, and instead bought it thru Amazon while in the City of Lights. Jerry has already prepared 3 recipes and loves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useable Recipes for Busy People","review":"Opening this book, I found a layout of table arrangements, alluring food photographs, Paris cookware shops, and recipes so common that I just wasn't sure anyone would need another book on these classics. Yet, to my sweet surprise, after examining the book closer, and cooking some of the dishes; I found a lovely and very useful book. Ina Garten has put together a choice collection of French classics that fit the American palate. In an easy cooking format, she's modified recipes to fit busy schedules, but seriously the dishes hold their flavor and are well thought out. I would recommend this book to anyone who wanted to cook French food; especially time deprived cooks. Its recipes take you to the market for fresh produce; allowing you to feel how simple a dish can be, yet so gourmet at the same time. Barefoot In Paris shows what's really going on in home kitchens set out over the beautiful countryside of France, and that simply put; is great cooking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Expectation","review":"This was my first Barefoot Contessa book (it was a Christmas gift) & I have to confess I'm pretty let down.First off, the book is rather anemic. For the price, promise, and reputation I expected at least a few more recipes, and something more original. Easy doesn't have to mean boring or common. Also, for a cook book I don't expect an already slim menu to be falsely fleshed out with drink recipes (and a Kir is the best they could do??) and personal anecdotes that really come across as a little too self-centered.I'm not inclined to buy any more of her books, certainly not at full price, without taking a thorough look at it in the store.I agree with the earlier reviewer who suggested that this book is best for beginners. Anyone with even moderate culinary experience in European cuisine will probably be bored.Pretty pictures do not a great cook book make!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit thin, but classic Garten","review":"I found the book a bit thin in both content and quality. Most of the hints (Table dressing, flower arranging, etc.) and recipes are very American and not all that unusual to the American public. I agree with the other reviewer, enough of the name and place dropping, let's just get down to what really matters.But she is still her sweet self and I'll keep the book, but supplement it with some French bistro and Provincial cookbooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything Delectable","review":"I own every one of her books and you can count on her recipes working.

None of the recipes are really French, and also seem like some of them are repeated from previous books. How about LESS PHOTOS of Ina, and some original, delicious recipes. I will be giving this away as a Christmas gift! Not a keeper for my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Boring","review":"Just plain, lots of photographs and little substance.Won't add anything new or usefull if you are a skilled cook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barefooted Nightmare","review":"I have a paralyzing fear of French cooking being done while barefoot.

The pictures and the text transport you to Paris. The recipes are delectable and the advice on French cookware invaluable. Another gastronomical delight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I own all of Ina's cookbooks and was so excited to get this one for Christmas this year. The photos are gorgeous, and the recipes look easy (even though they're FRENCH!) and generous. I love her approach to food and cooking and can't wait to try a bunch of the recipes. Sure, many of them are classics, but they're classics I would've been afraid to try otherwise. The recipe for palmiers (three ingredients!) is going to send my whole family into ecstasy when I try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ina's the best","review":"I loved the Barefoot Contessa cookbook and was not disappointed by this one either.

We got back a week ago and had a fabulous time! I mapped out all the recommended destinations at the back of her book. We were having such a good time we only made it to one (giving me an excuse to go back), E Dehillerin. It is the Mecca for anyone who loves to cook. Needless to say, I came back with a set of Mauviel copper pots and pans. We also had a Croque Monsieur during a picnic on the Champ de Mars (wonderful view of the Eiffel Tower) which I reproduced using the recipe from this book. It was like I was in the City of Lights all over again. Thank you Ina!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Least Favorite","review":"While I have all of Ina's previous cookbooks and use them frequently, this is a cookbook that I can't say I've made much use of at all. The recipes don't have as much appeal to me as the recipes from her prior books. They seem a bit fussier to make (in keeping with French cooking, no doubt), but not only that, the food itself simply doesn't seem as appetizing. I realize this is simply a matter of taste, but had I actually spent the money to purchase this book (I received it as a gift), I would have been extremely disappointed. Perhaps my day to day life doesn't call for recipes such as Bouef Bourguignon and Filet of Beef au Poivre. And as charming as Ina can be, reading the personal details of her idyllic life with Jeffrey in France does get just a tad bit nauseating...I would highly recommend sticking to food, and particularly the food that Ina made so popular in the Hamptons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gourmet recipes that are easy to make","review":"I made a steak with bearnaise sauce and french-style green beans using recipes from Easy French Food You Can Make at Home. Based on those recipes, and reading the book, I'd highly recommend purchasing this cookbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Ina","review":"This book is much like Ina's other books in that it has very clear instructions, lots of color photographs and a lot of her personal opinions. The recipes are not, I repeat not, pure French, but one talented woman's unique take on them.Ina has inhereted a style that began with the original Loaves and Fishes, The Silver Palate, etc. If you have liked the food you have made from the recipes in these books and you generally like French food, you should enjoy this book. Fans of her other books will enjoy this as well. I have.I tend to buy a lot of cookbooks. Too many as a matter of fact. Over time I tend to cull my collection. I know that this, as are my other books by Ina, will be a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good selection, but disappointing quality","review":"I chose this disc as I was looking for a good genearl Peter Dawson compilation and it contains most of Dawson's better known songs. However when I listened it, it became obvious that the recordings had been filtered out to such an extent that it removed ALL the crackle from the original 78's. In doing so, it also removed all of the higher frequencies of the recordings. The end result was rather like listening to the music whilst wearing ear-plugs! The original character of the recordings has been completely lost. It's better to leave some of the crackle and be able to hear the words clearly."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Denueve...what else it there to say","review":"It's Deneuve...what else is there to say.

This was one of the books I purchased for us to study from. After taking the TOEFL the second time, he was amazed at how many idioms he now knew and felt confident with. It is organized in such a way that similar word idioms are grouped together, so it is easier to understand the slight differences (to show up vs. to show someone up). History of where the idiom comes from (if known) is also included, like 'know the ropes' comes from sailors. The way the book flips over is nice, so that it is it's own 'flash card' system. No re-writing forever onto small cards!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you need more pop block, use lycra.","review":"This product gets the job done and the price is very decent.

Genius, plain and simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Entertaining Legal Thriller","review":"This is the second in the 'Chambers of Justice' series by Craig Parshall. As with the first one, this is well done.The plot centers around the child welfare authorities trying to remove parental custody based on an allegation of terrible child abuse. There are many twists and turns throughout. The courtroom drama is great as is the rest.In addition to being a legal thriller, this book explores many spiritual issues. The lead character, Will Chambers is a fledgling Christian who is working on his spiritual life in addition to the action in the main storyline. That part is well done also.I will certainly be checking out more books in this series. I recommend this book, but readers should probably start with 'The Resurrection File', which is the first one in this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"soundtrack to my life... when I was 20","review":"I heard Telephone and Rubber Band on Public Radio, and assiduously tracked down the album (on cassette, which I wore out.)

Telephone and rubber band is a delight. Clever, even beautiful arrangements. Each instrument has fairly simple parts that become part of a rich polyrhythmic tapestry as other instruments join in.

The reason why I wanted to check out this CD was because I had heard the songs Derb and Addicted to Bass on other CDs, both of which I like and figured that this could be okay also. The majority of these songs did not interest me at all. Songs on here like \\"Supadupafly,\\" \\"Operation Blade,\\" and \\"On the Move\\" are just not really what I'm used to hearing. But, this is the first CD I've ever gotten with the title \\"Techno\\" on it. Normally my CDs are entitled House or Trance or Club but never techno. Oh, yes, and the mixing is not very good.6/3/05- In response to the review after mine...

Fascinating book by a REAL cook, not someone who opens cans or boxes and dumps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing Concert","review":"This DVD is a great disappointment. Not only are the picture and sound qualities abysmal, Bernadette and her stage act are equally poor. The end credits indicate that the show is from 1979, so I don't know how well that fits into Bernadette's career development.Her greatest fans will only cringe on seeing such an embarrassingly poor performance.

In my opinionit is the single best Christmas album ever recorded, and I have and enjoy dozens.Perry Como's \\"The Christmas Song\\" leaves all other versions in the dust.The beauty of his voice throughout the entire album, and the superb production andengineering make it seem as if it had been recorded yesterday.This one is a must for every Christmas collection.Merry Christmas!P.S.

It took four decades until I found out that they were notthe singers of the late Ray Charles but of a totally different Ray Charles! They still soundgreat."},{"rating":"2","title":"An oldie but always a goodie.","review":"This is one of my favorite Christmas CD's.

The arrangements of the classic Christmas songs and carols on here stand alone. Do yourself a favor and get this for yourself and your family, especially if you have kids. The photographic memories didn't stop after finally hearing this album for the first time in it's entirety since I was a kid. Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, Santa Claus Is Coming To Town and the classic Home For The Holidays all wonderful arrangements reminiscent of a time when things were a lot simpler."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY EARLY WAYNE","review":"CLASSIC JOHN WAYNE-IF YOU LOVE HIM, YOU WILL LOVE THESE COPIES OF THE ORIGINAL FILMS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I'm going to be honest, I only started to get into Cursive all of, well, two days ago, so don't expect me to be very knowledgable about the evolution of Cursive's sound. Since then I've grabbed all the music I could get my hands on, and I must say, this EP truely stands out. I'll keep the review short and sweet considering I don't want to offend anyone with my horrendous review capabilities.This album offers pretty tunes, awesome instrumental vocal and instrumental riffs, and interesting lyrics. Each track is as complex as it is catchy. I don't want to say anything cliche but I gotta agree with the other reviewers who say that the occasionaly off-key vocals or instruments give the album a far more realistic and interesting appeal. While it certainly takes a bit of getting used to, Cursive's unique style is brilliantly original. I highly recommend this EP [and several listens thereof], especially just putting on \\"The Great Decay\\" and cranking the volume.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Burst and Bloom","review":"Five songs that are much more individually stunning than the rest of Cursive's work. Although these songs are very good, I do enjoy Cursive's 2 most recent LP's more.The first 3 tracks would have to be the better side to the album with 'Sink to the Beat' leading the pack as far as standout tracks are concerned. If you are already a fan of Cursive's other work buy this and keep supporting a great band. Otherwise, check out The Ugly Organ or Domestica first."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply amazing","review":"I am an avid cursive fan and am simply amazed by the lyrics.

By the end, I was confused between the impressions that I got from the Amazon reviews and what I actually heard myself.I didn't notice anything outstanding about this collection of songs. It sounds just like all of the other contemporary pop/rock that abounds on MTV nowadays. Maybe the 5 glowing reviews are written by the band members' families? This just didn't catch my ear.This EP is not awful, but it definitely is not 5-star material. It just blends right in with the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Excellent cd this rocks harder than anything or anybody. All her songs are so perfect.

This DVD is 100% not my style, but I still cannot get past the cheesiness of the whole thing. This is just a bunch of guys hanging out playing together and having the camera run. This is the kind of stuff that people watch and then sit down at a drum set and start banging away and think they are a drummer. Maybe on a Saturday morning in the late 1980's this would have been a little better, but this DVD does not pass the test of time. There are too many other, much better things out there to watch and get inspired from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible production, terrible music","review":"Wow this is really bad. First they should call it drum set duets because most of the playing is done with two drumsets or drumset + percussion. The music is really canny and would be most suited for kids cartoon show.

However, if you spend your day at your desk making and receiving phone calls, this is not a good solution. To lift and lower the handset, you need to press the button on the headset. This gets irritating, and painful, quickly when what there should be is a button on the lifter to press instead or in addition to pushing the button on the headset. Unfortunately, this is going back and I'm going to use my manual handset lifter that I purchased years ago instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Works exactly as advertised, although it depends on the specific model of desk phone you have. It would be great if this was a digital solution versus a physical one, but for $50 it does the trick. Make sure you use alcohol to clean the top and left side of your phone and let it dry. When placing the lifter on be careful as the adhesive grabs really quickly! Hopefully, that means it will stay attached permanently."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must!","review":"If you have a headset this lifter is a must! Works great!

It was a powerful combination that allowed me to answer my phone up to 300 feet away from my office. This lifter fits onto your phone base and lifts the receiver when you press a button on your remote headset. You can answer the phone or hang-up when the call is completed without ever touching the receiver.The lifter came with a plug in mini-microphone ring detector that attached to my base phone and it allowed the base station to notify me when the phone was ringing. The setup was quick and easy and the device took up almost no space on my desk as it attached to my phone.I spent thousands of hours a year on the phone and this device along with my remote wireless headset saved me a lot of neck stress and phone holding for hours a day.

Mostly echoing, bassy boominess from the hall that these were recorded in.The one from 1977 (a sound board) is the exception, and is a really nice listen... there are flaws, but that is true with ANY soundboard tape.I hope that there are more of these releases, and maybe the quality of the boots will go up.

The only thing missing is a true singer with an in your face voice. Nuno is a good singer and that's about it, good not great. Nuno's former band Extreme had that great singer that appears to be absent from Mourning Widows.

With Mourning Widows, Nuno returns to funky, hook-laden tunes with solos and some frantic fretboard work (something sorely missing from \\"Schizophonic\\"). Fans of Extreme's final album will certainly enjoy \\"War Paint,\\" \\"Space,\\" and \\"Swing.\\" Mourning Widows has enough of their own unique flavor, though, to appeal to those who didn't care for Extreme (though why you wouldn't is beyond me). Even if you disliked Nuno's first album, check this one out. The Mourning Widows debut album, still only available in the US via import, is also quite good with stronger production than this disc (though I think the songs here are better)."},{"rating":"2","title":"NUNO has done it again","review":"Nuno and the band have really put alot of intelligent music on this album.

A little short thought so you may want to think about how much you are willing to pay for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Doodle Pro","review":"Our 5-year-old son had a school bus magna doodle that he just used and abused. It was on its last legs so we put this on his birthday list and he got it. He loves the Lightning McQueen car and the tracing stencils. The frame is very solid. There's a post to keep the car on the board but I wish there had been some place to put the stencils too. They keep getting separated.A good choice for kids who like doodle pros and Cars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool for beginning writers","review":"I've loved Doodle Pro items and they have been great with my babies. It gives them the ability to write and draw anytime, anywhere without writing on the walls, floor, or themselves! My daughter's writing improved greatly when she received her first doodle pro. So for my 3 year old son, who is a huge Cars fan, this one was perfect. The size is great and he loves the characters. Also, received mine in 2 days so it was readily available. I recommend to any Cars, or doodle fan in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never got this item!!","review":"After waiting for a few months...I was told that this item is NOT available!!!!!!I was VERY disappointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Cars Fans","review":"My son loves Cars and has watched it a million times. He likes to doodle and have me draw for him. His little sister likes it too. The only reason I couldn't give it all 5 stars is that even though I did exactly as it said to color in the whole thing before use, we now have permanent dark lines in it..... I would still buy it again and think it is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Durable Toy","review":"We got this for my 2 year old boy for Christmas 2007 because his sister and him kept fighting over the other one we had. This turned out to be a very durable toy and he loves the little magnetic race car that comes with it. Although we put the stencils up because we thought he was too young for them right now, this doodle pad has still proven to be of very good value.Jodywww.madaboutsavings.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"don't waste your time or money on this one.

A fairly quick read, settle into a chair on your porch, patio or deck for an afternoon that might change the way you look at your neighbors. I read this book years ago and was just searching Mort Castle's name for something new to add to my library when I ran across this title that I already own. It's worth a second read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"I was lured to read this book by the description on the cover. I had fairly low expectations going in and this book did not even live up to those. Castle's writing, while tediously descriptive, is pedestrian in every other way. The plot was plodding and the \\"surprise\\" ending was no surprise at all. I could not find a level at which I enjoyed this book. It was a bad horror story, bad literature and not even an enjoyable slasher type thriller. I'll not belabor the point, there is nothing to recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Late Night","review":"What a surprise this movie was. It had suspense, some comedy and scarry moments. If you want some Texas big foot adventures when the locals decide to come out with their own version of pitch forks and torches(pickup trucks and deer rifles) to find the monster, this would be a good choice. Has the feel of the old movies I use to watch late night on the black and white TV, at every noise I would go make sure the doors were locked. Start the DVD around midnight for best results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor attempt at 70s horror","review":"Let me start by saying I LOVE the 1970s subgenre of horror/pseudo-documentary films. So I had high hopes for this one when they used a title card lifted from \\"The Legend of Boggy Creek\\" about how this film had some of the real people playing themselves. But it all went downhill from there. The film is too mean-spirited to be campy or nostalgic, and too amateurish to be truly scary. It seems as if the filmmakers tried to combine \\"Boggy Creek\\" and \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" - they did not succeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"the wild man of the navidad","review":"This is one of the worest movies I even seen.

And a fantastic film came out of it?!? YES; these guys have put together a very capable homage to the drive-in horror of the 70s. If you aren't familiar with those films, the movie might be somewhat unintelligible, but it's a good time nonetheless! The environment of rural Texas (and the creepy inhabitants therein) are worth a watch alone. The directors did a fantastic job rendering Texas on film. You're trapped where I grew up: good luck getting out alive with a sane mind! Then there's a man beast making minced meat of people with the antlers of a stag. Oh yeah. It's like that. Add a few moonshine stills and you have the recipe for much bloodshed in the Texan sand.A really enjoyable flick; I look forward to seeing what these guys do in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much action","review":"i like big foot movies. this left me guessing as to what it is about. the movie itself i did not understand all of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun...","review":"I got this game for Easter and I think it is great, except it is too easy!!

A lot of hours and time went into this Trip, 6 months of planning, just so much in so little time, I am ordering my 3rd copy of the tape, because I gave away the others. The editors could only put so much into the complete video, We were in Tibet over 2 weeks and so much was cut. Yes we know about the politics in Tibet but this was not a Political Trip. I have seen the video over a dozen times and still enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully filmed, but lacking insight","review":"This documentary gives a wonderful, albeit brief, view of the landscape and people of Tibet. The photography was magnificent, capturing at once the beauty of the countryside and the incredible spirit of the Tibetan people. However, having been to Tibet myself and witnessed many of their religious ceremonies, I found the performances by Paul Horn intrusive and inappropriate. I wondered who gave him permission to \\"perform\\" during the sacred ritual chanting of the Buddhist monks. It detracted a great deal from the spiritual significance of these ceremonies. Also, there was no mention of the political atrocities the Tibetan people and culture have experienced as a result of the Chinese occupation. Overall, I did not find this documentary to be an accurate representation of Tibetan culture and religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intro","review":"Eno's Discreet Music was a good transition for him (and can also be a good one for an Eno listener) between his serialist experimenting with the sound of Robert Fripp's guitar and his more muted ambient works that came after \\"Music for Airports.\\" The title track is thirty minutes of unobtrusive melody; it goes on a bit long, but it is wonderfully relaxing (not boring, but relaxing) if approached in the right frame of mind. Side Two could not have been more different. Eno takes a cue from his deliciously eccentric rock records and, with the help of Gavin Bryars, disfigures that other piece of \\"relaxing\\" music, the Pachelbel Canon. Gyorgy Ligeti, the Hungarian composer, once described an orchestral piece of his as \\"a body in various states of decomposition.\\" What we have here is much the same--the Canon as a dead carcass. It's utterly riveting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first track's the best--Ambient 0","review":"The first piece, \\"Discreet Music\\", is a beautiful, pastoral bit of process music--two separate lines of soothing electronic woodwinds changing timbres and relations for a half hour. An excellent example of the \\"less is more\\" philosophy, where the number of notes a piece has is necessarily in inverse porportion to appreciating harmonic and structural potential sound can generate.The three variations on Pachelbel are far less successful. To me, only the first--\\"The Fullness of Wind\\"--is interesting, because of its opening seconds, when the recognizable fragment of the canon promptly falls apart as the time values change, and extend themselves off into the distance. By the end of the piece, a single pulsing chord is being held.The other two variations have their moments, but..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eno creates atmosphere rather than entertainment on this one","review":"Eno's experimental attitude towards music of all and any kinds is distinctly muted on this album. Here he is trying to make ambient music as a background or counterpoint to other activities which can also be used as a focus for meditation or similar \\"non-activities.\\" The whole album becomes a non-activity that serves very well as aural wallpaper but isn't likely to inspire or provoke anything in particular ... which is what its intention is in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected Better","review":"Would not recommend this for any child. The only thing that he/she would be able to see \\"up close\\" would be insects - big ones. The toy is very cheap feeling and looking.

Truth be told, Ms. Muldaur's voice, while striking in her early years, became a richer, more expressive instrument as the years passed, and this recording, taken from some U.K. shows in the early '80s, when her popularity was bigger overseas, takes matters further by presenting Muldaur as an exciting live performer who could grab hold of an audience. The track \\"Sweet and Slow\\" is a particular standout."},{"rating":"1","title":"This disc needs to be taken off the market","review":"I wish I could review the film itself, because it looked very promising. Unfortunately, it isn't possible because the two copies I screened were defective. Some players refused to track beyond chapter 7, others, the last 2 chapters, 19 & 20. In every case, the picture froze and broke up, making complete viewing of the film impossible. The original, more expensive release of this DVD by Velocity Home Entertainment has been reviewed on this site without technical complaints, so I'm ordering that one instead. Meanwhile, Platinum needs to take this botched budget pressing off the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good and full of unpredictable twists and turns","review":"I truly expected this movie to be the very definition of a \\"B\\" movie with a mediocre cast and shoddy dialog.

I liked it alot."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think Stars can trust their friends","review":"I bought this album on iTunes because \\"Set Yourself on Fire\\" is one of my most favourite albums. Unfortunately many of their so called \\"Friends\\" mangle their songs badly, including on of my favorite bands The Dears. The First Five Times by the Russian Futurists just plain sucks. I really like the Junior Boys doing Sleep Tonight and\\"Set Yourself On Fire\\" (Montag), \\"Ageless Beauty\\" (The Most Serene Republic), \\"Reunion\\" (Jason Collett), \\"One More Night\\" (Apostle of Hustle) .So there are a few good tracks but most of it is rubbish.

While the slower numbers \\"On A Clear Day,\\" God Bless the Child\\" and \\"Smile\\" are magical numbers, the remainder of the album does not quite hold up. The first tune \\"A Million Or More Times\\" is not very creative, and basically sounds like a 60s TV show theme song (can we say \\"hoping to cut a hit single\\"). The jazz standard \\"Wee\\" and \\"Blues in the Closet\\" are swinging but this is 1967, not 1957, and with a band of Walter Davis, Paul Chambers and (especially) Alan Dawson, I expected it to be more experimental. Instead, the quartet seems more at home on the slower tempo ballads. In all, \\"Portrait of Sonny Criss\\" deserves 3 1/2 stars, but since I can't I rounded it up. If you want to get a better portrait of Sonny, check out the newly released \\"Complete Imperial Sessions\\" on Blue Note."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift","review":"we got this for my mother in law who has been looking for these tree faces for a while.. she just loved it! it arrived quick, packaged was perfect and it seems like something that will last more then one year. thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"HOW CUTE!","review":"This was a gift for friends of mine that have always wanted one!He is so cute and now brings a bit of life to a tree!!Shipped ever so quickly!Thank You!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great CD!","review":"I bought this CD last week, and I'll have to say that Love Seed has done it again!

I would love to hear \\"Flying Solo\\" on the radio. I think it would be a definite hit.

And the insert has a bean shaped intention that the lid doesn't (I can't even figure out what the lid is for, actually, since it doesn't fit the other pieces), so there's no way to stop the grease spilling out the top right back into the receptacle you're pouring the jus into.

There are some humorous moments but as British humor is a bit different from American humor, I would caution any Americans who are currently undergoing IVF that you won't probably find the story itself humorous. It is not. Yes, there are some funny comments here and there and definitely some funny moments, but you mostly feel the pain that they are going through.

She is the ultimate heroine. She is tough, smart, and sexy. She starts off tracking her exboyfriend to a club in order to bring him in before he can skip bond. She soon realises things aren't always what they seem and she gets involved in Frankies world... I don't want to spoil the plot so I wont say much more other than the characters have a lot of chemistry and Julie has created a wonderful adventure series... With a lot of romance mixed in.

But when more and more people quit smoking, flint became much more difficult to find. Campers still use it, so it has become a camping supply no long found in drug stores. Flint does deteriorate, so if you have some laying around for many years, chances are you now have a small pile of powder. I found this flint at Amazon and quickly bought it for my camping supply box because at the time I wasn't sure when and where I would see it again. Quite frankly, I have not even opened the packet, nor will I until I actually need it. My advice? If you have camping equipment that still uses flint, buy your flint when you see it, not when you need it. Coghlan is a known brand and ten pieces will last a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"$1 to buy and $31 to ship.","review":"What should have been $2 or less to ship cost me $31 to ship.

Here, Malcolm runs down Elijah's wild story of how a mad scientist named Yakub created the White race to bedevil the Black race. Fortunately, within two years M/X would break away from this kind of foolishness and give better-analyzed messages on the condition of Blacks in America. However, it is interesting for historical reasons as an example of M/X's early speaking style, which is why it gets 2 stars instead of 1 from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"I bought 'Apache server bible', this book does not cover enough on Apache server.

It is extremely heavy. Watch out for little ones. My son dropped it on the side of baby's head. If it had hit her straight on the head I honestly think we would have had to go to the ER - it's HEAVY.

Easy to see why it was so nominated and awarded. Excellent English dubbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good but violent thriller","review":"The Swedish version of \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" is a good thriller witha fascinating main character. Lisbeth is a type frequently seen in successfulthrillers. She lacks social skills and is a bit of a loner, but she is alsotechnically adept and capable of exacting horrible revenge on anyone who mistreatsher. The film is pretty tightly organized and edited. So, your attention doesn'thave a tendency to wander while watching it. Although there are some places inwhich I was startled by the graphic nature of the film, I still found it to be entertaining and worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"@ 2 hours+ Long but well paced and kept my interest.","review":"Interesting Swedish film. Been a while since I watched a foreign drama video and took a while to get used to the pace. This is slow moving but the pace allows for some depth of characters not usually present in American action/drama flicks. If slow, well paced, even through out and kept my interest. Was glad I saw, heard the dubbed version. Interesting scenery throughout. And \\"The Girl with the Green Tattoo\\" is a very special character. Will say that some scenes are graphic in nature but no gushing blood, etc. Still, some will find these scenes hard to take because of their nature. Overall, recommend as a mystery drama with good acting. But once again, 2+ hours long and can feel long now and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"Read the book first and then watch in Swedish and then in English dubbing - just to get the whole intense experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"An excellent thriller. I didn't read the book(s) so I got a lot out of the movie(s). The sub-titles didn't affect watching the movie at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie - If you read the book","review":"I enjoyed watching this with English sub-titles. It has been long enough since I read the book to make it more interesting. Reading the book, in my experience, seems necessary for an understanding of this complex story. So many of the details needed to make sense of this wonderful story are left out of the movie version. Michael Nyquist is well cast in his role, but Noomi Rapace steals the show. She will forever be the Lisbeth Salander character for me. I highly recommend the movie for everyone. If you have read the book, it is a perfect compliment to it, if you haven't read the book, it should be a motivator to run out and buy the 3 book series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite worthy of all the hype","review":"Despite what some of my friends said about the Swedish version of this film, I decided to watch it and boy was it worth it. Its a little explicit at times, but the movie as a whole is well worth its long time. Its got wonderful twists and it really engages your inner Sherlock Holmes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Film","review":"This film is superbly made. Even those who read the book (http://www.amazon.com/Girl-Dragon-Tattoo-Stieg-Larsson/dp/0307454541/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1281188269&sr=1-1) and know the story, will find the film gripping. The casting, particularly Lisbeth Salander, is amazing, exactly how I imagined the characters when I read the book. The slow - un-Hollywoodian - pace, allows the story to develop with surprising minimum omissions. Dark colors and settings help make the film true to its source. Highly recommended, but read the book first, better still, all three books. It does not spoil the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality dvd","review":"I'm in love with the books and looked forward to seeing the dvd's as they had great reviews on NPR. I was so looking forward to seeing this movie. The quality was horrible. The dvd kept skipping and even reverted to English dubbing from the Swedish subtitles on its own. I don't know if this was because the dvd was produced in Mexico or what. I will have a difficult time buying a dvd from Amazon again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is hard to follow","review":"I've read all three books by this author and loved them all. In fact I got hooked on them. I looked forward to watching the video but was very disappointed because the subtitles were so long, it was hard to watch the action. I ended up falling asleep and I really have no desire to go back and watch it again. I think I'll wait until the American version comes out and purchase that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like an X-rated LMN movie...","review":"If you like cinema: Scorsese, Coppola, Frankenheimer, Lumet, Jewison, Capra, Weir, Mamet... Do not watch this movie.Boring, dull plot, hack screenplay, cliched characterizations. Pretentious, overly intricate plot that is simply not interesting or clever. Vile, exploitative view of men and women, sort of a \\"Saw\\" for Swedes. I fast-forwarded through much of the final third. I simply couldn't bear to watch the glacial, boring plot unfold to it's utterly predictable and irrelevant (because I simply didn't care) conclusion. A \\"C\\" movie that has some sort of cachet because it's Swedish.I may never shop at IKEA again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably believable! Astonishing and engaging story!","review":"Wow.That about sums things up. The book,The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, is on my reading list, but I was talked into watching this movie so I could go with family to see the next movie in this series. Since books tend to be even better, I have something to look forward to.Journalist Mikael Blomkvist takes an assignment with a wealthy capitalist to solve a 40 year old mystery... who killed the capitalist's niece? Through a totally believable series of events, Blomkvist pairs up with the strange young woman, Lisbeth Salander. Salander is an extraordinarily unique individual. They uncover human monsters and unravel an extraordinary mystery.I can't wait to see that next movie. And I've still got the books to read!Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"The movie was exceptional. So good that the overdubbing into Enblish was almost unnoticable. THe story line stayed fairly true to the book, Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent (For Adults!)","review":"Very gripping and graphic. I didn't read the books, but was pulled into the story. There are a couple of rape scenes that are shocking but are key to the story. Don't watch it with the kids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Adaption of the Wonderful Book","review":"Fine adaptation of the wonderful book of the same name. Both the film and the book are in the same genre as The Da Vinci Code, and they have in common one more thing. Just as in the Da Vinci Code, the film leaves out some of the fine details that make both books unforgettable. While it is great to see Stockholm, the Swedish countryside, the town in Northern Sweden, the Vanger Compound, and the characters come to life, watching the film is not the same experience as reading the book. The author died shortly after the book was published, and I kept thinking about that all during the reading of the book, which contains another layer of international intrigue. That said, this is a film well worth seeing. It, like the Da Vinci Code, has that 'certain something' that makes a film into a phenomenon. It's a very well-crafted film, and it's great that the film was made in Swedish by Swedes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good thriller ...........But ?","review":"I guess I didn't totally understand what the 2 and 1/2 run time was for ? I watched this film and yes, I found it sexy, and yes, I found it interesting? But was the long detailed journey of the girl that was missing really that necessary ? When in the end there really was no huge pay off to carry it out that long. The goth girl was the only really interesting character in the movie. But in the end you still didn't know a whole lot more about her than you did in the beginning? This is a interesting movie but please don't expect it to unravel some amazing conclusion. The film is darkly erotic and interesting well written in a detailed aspect but lacks depth. I would say rent this or download at best because this is truly a one or two time watcher at best. It Squeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeezed the life out of me waiting for the payoff ! When in the end there was really know difference, just a sexy girl that was darkly disturbing in her own way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to book","review":"I read the books after seeing the movies.

The problem arose when the second part of the movie was streaming. Unfortunately, it never happened. I don't know how the movie ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A shame the ten books won't be written","review":"Meant to be a ten book series, cut short...a real shame. I too have been pushing The book on my friends, the movie was very good. At first I thought the books were a bit slow, but the character development (including the bad guys) made the reading more visceral and the characters more HD than the movie had time for. Granted Directors only have a finite time frame, did a great job, '...Played with fire' opens soon here so am looking forward to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"Would like to have the other two movies but I do not know whether they are available in English yet. Do not want to read subtitles while viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Picture!","review":"It shoulda been a contender! I was blown away by it. Too bad more Americans don't watch subtitled films regularly. It could have been in the Best Picture category. Excellent acting. Great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st of the trilogy","review":"I rate this version more closely aligned to the mores of Europe and Scandinavia than the Daniel Craig version. It is followed seamlessly by the later two books/films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just read the book...","review":"After reading the book, I was looking forward to seeing it on film. Unfortunately, the movie was a poor adaptation...the characters were not as I had pictured (ex: Salander looked WAY too old)and not enough time was given to their development to understand their actions. The movie skipped past several chapters at a time and some of the plot was completely changed from that of the book. I would think that a movie made from the book would at least TRY and keep with the given details as much as possible. I don't understand why something as simple as the jacket in the picture of the murderer being sought after needed to be changed to a blue sweater?! Even the ending was hurried and left out some of the most intriguing parts of the story.Maybe if you hadn't read the book, I might say the movie was 'interesting' at best. But I won't be watching any sequels...I'll stick with the books, thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Truly disappointed! The tale is lame, and somebody forgot to pay the light bill. The film is all dark (literally and figuratively) making some scenes hard to see. It would be of real interst to somebody needing an excuse to watch pornography,sodomy and fellatio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well it was not the book...","review":"Not impressed. As a film, the movie was alright but as a film adapted from a book it was mediocre at best. When filmmakers change the plot and characters so dramtically how can a reader be expected to like the film? If you are expecting the film similar to the book be prepared to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dubbed Version Is Horrible!","review":"The movie in its original form is wonderful. The dubbed version is terrible. They seemed to have gotten a handful of third rate actors who ruin the story and the film. Don't waste your money - see the the original version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but too graphic","review":"This was truly an excellent movie, great story, acting, etc etc... My only complaint is the depiction of murder victim's in photos. It is totally unnecessary to show the gore and it disappoints me that so many directors choose to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl with the dragon tattoo is powerful and shocking. Wonderful movie.","review":"Noomi Rapace totally nailed it, hook line and sinker. Her character Lisbeth Salander, a researcher teams up with Mikael Blomkvist to look into a forty year old mystery. Beautifully done, best movie I have seen in a long time.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thriller For Non-Aficionados","review":"Now, normally, I am not a fan of psychological thrillers but this one, this Swedish one, sub-titled in English, had me hooked after the first several minutes. Put together an abused, overwrought young woman (with full dragon tattoo and full psychic scars) who has seen her share of life's misery but who is also a technie whiz, a middle-aged Indy news journalist who has been set up by forces unknown (although we know it is some nefarious capitalist, Swedish variety) while just doing his usual thorough investigative job and a request to find a long missing (forty years) girl by a good Swedish capitalist \\"father\\" figure and we are off. For a land that is suppose to be something of a\\" paradise\\" there is more social and psychological pathology here in two hours than one would find in, well, America. This is the first of Larsson's books (out of the trilogy) to hit the screen. Bring on the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl with Dragon Tattoo","review":"I enjoyed this movie,it was very much like the book. Hollywood seems to change good books into so-so movies. This is a foreign movie with subtitles and was rather explicit in parts. It has a good story and the scenery is also enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tell Tale Tat","review":"This engaging film benefitted from superb writing, excellent directing as well as editing. All the characters from main to supporting were totally believeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on shock, short on story","review":"I only made it 3/4 through, and then quit. The story hadn't drawn me in enough to balance the repulsion I had of brutal sex scenes, and an anti-hero that was more anti than hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extended Version Not to Be Missed","review":"The dvd quality is great, the grain is not going to go away whether you have blue ray or DVD, because the film was not filmed for HD. Your blu ray will do the best with either and it will still come out well. The edited version did not leave out any graphic parts, however what it did leave out was characters and minor story lines. It gave you ah hah monments where you see why certain story lines played out they way they did. You get to see background information and you also see where the american version connects to the swedish version. I have been obsessed with this movie for weeks now, getting the extended version was a treat. I love movies like this especially foreign mini series. Sherlock Holmes on the BBC is a great example. If you want something intellectually stimulating, frustating and suspenseful (no spoilers). Pick this up.Sherlock: Season One"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"What do you say about something done so well, I loved the characters. I liked that both Lisbeth and Mikel are equally portrayed and introduced to us. There was not a focus on one character more than the other. There is a lot of heavy sexual content and rape and abuse that I was not quite ready for, as I have not read the books. But now I want to read them and learn more about these characters. The story definitely did not end how I thought it would. Very unique friendship comes from these two working together."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite movies of the year","review":"I first saw this movie earlier this year and was blown away. I'd heard some buzz about the film but went in with no information or expectations, and immediately loved it. The style of the story is an old one, isolated location with a limited number of possible murder suspects, but the presentation is sharp, modern, and wonderfully stark - the weather and scenery fitting perfectly with the coldness of the crime. I've also read the book and I think the screenwriter did an excellent job of putting in exactly the parts of the book that would make a good film and leaving out anything that would slow the pace. It's an intelligent thriller that keeps up the tension throughout and delivers a satisfying conclusion. I can't wait to watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, BUT.....","review":"Great movie.

This is b.s. just don't send the damn movie and refund my account plain and simple"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dire","review":"I came to this movie having never read any of the books. A distinct advantage I always think. And what a depressing experience it turned out to be. After all the hype, absolutely no pace to the direction, half baked acting and laborious editing. And a lot of artificial snow !And the ending, I've not experienced such a dismal contrived close to a movie since 'Australia' (Gawd help us). It just went on and on pointlessly, and the final scenes were an embarrassment that should have hit the cutting room floor. Honestly, it made the Swedish 'Wallander' look like 'Citizen Kane'.The trailer for the next in the trilogy looks even worse.Look, save your money on this crap, and buy 'The Secret in Their Eyes' It's released in the UK on DVD at the start of next year,I got hold of a copy from the USA. Now that's a bloody marvellous movie...........!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dispointed","review":"I was sooo excited went i found this movie,seen sooo many preview's about it...An again it wasn't in English,had to read at bottom of screen everything they were saying...Couldn't even get into this movie at all...:("},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of disturbing violence","review":"Although I read through the entire book and found the basic story interesting, I was disturbed by the detailed level in which some very brutal violence was described. What is even more appalling is that I recently found out that my friend's 14-year old just finished it after having selected the book from his school's summer reading list. I agree with \\"Busy Mom of 2\\" and felt that at least one other person needs to warn parents to read the book or see the movie before deciding if this is appropriate for your child. I am amazed that the DVD is sold out. The story isn't THAT compelling. The only things that make it stand out are the scenes of torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: Severe Rape and Violence!","review":"I could kick myself for only reading 1/8th of the book before watching this film recently at an arthouse movie theater. I had NO idea that there would be DISTURBING and TRAUMATIC rape scenes and sexual abuse in addition to the subjects of child molestation, incest, and child rape. Plus, the gruesome and graphic murders of young women are all included in this movie. There is one scene that shows you all the pictures of the women's dead and murdered faces. Absolutely horrible. It's been several days and I am still traumatized by the violence and have absolute NO interest in finishing the book. I do not understand the fascination of this book or wanting to make a Hollywood version of it. Rape? Child molestation and incest? No thank you! And please change the title of this book and movie back to its original, which is much more appropriate in describing what the subject matter is: \\"Men Who Hate Women.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo: Extended Edition","review":"Film is in ENGLISH SUBTITLES, amazon didn't specify that is was, ruined my evening I didn't feel like reading dialog for 3 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Girl w/ the Dragon Tattoo","review":"The first bit of the movie, I guess I wasn't paying attention to or not reading the subtitles fast enough, because I had no idea what was going on. A third of the way through everything started clicking for me and from about that moment on I was completely enthralled. The suspense built up at a steady pace and I was gripping my chair waiting to see what would happen next. I thought it was shot well, the actors acted well, and the whole thing was a great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie.","review":"I liked the movie, even though it was a bit long at 2 1/2 hours. The actors fit the parts. There was a lot of detail left out from the book, but the movie was already pretty long."},{"rating":"2","title":"true to book","review":"Really enjoyed the book and curious about setting it to film. The film is quite true to the book, the acting crisp and the characters (especially Liz i.e. Noomi Rapace) come to life. Would give it 5 stars, but like all attempts to bring complex stories to screen, and despite the rather long run time, the nuances do not come across fully. The truest test is whether the story hangs together without reading the book, and this does so (I beleive). All in all, very enjoyable and worthy of the time committment to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"I knew the book was a real gem but the movie surpassed my expectations. The subtitle version was not the least bit distracting to the quality and realism of the actors. I will view this many times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutality is not entertainment","review":"Let's see... after you get past the scenes of oral sex (forced), rape, torture, mutilation, casual sex, and sodomy (forced), there's a really good mystery story here... until you're treated to even more graphic pictures of even more victims. The body count is too high; the sexual violence is horrifying. The story itself was buried in the excessive violence, for my tastes. I can understand the reviews; it really is a riveting story. There are simply too many reasons to look away and not look back. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the book","review":"I read this book when it first came out in paperback and kindled the last two books. I saw it was playing in limited engagements in the United States so I had to order the DVD. The screen adaptation is outstanding. Lisbeth is as mysterious in the film as in the book. Of course, more is revealed about her in the later books. Michael is played to perfection. The movie is on of the best films I have seen in years. Even Plague is correctly portrayed in the film. I received the DVD on the 8th and have watched it twice. Hopefully, the motion picture industry will show The Girl Who Played with Fire nationwide. Actually, I could care less if they remake this film in the United States. The foreign actors is part of the intrigue in the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thriller with Subtitles","review":"I had heard about this movie for awhile and I am glad I bought it. This is a great Thriller! the Investigation for the Long Missing Girl takes you through twists and turns and gives you the not so glorious history of modern Sweden. There are a couple of brutal scenes but Noomi Rapace is great throughout the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow did they get this right~","review":"they really nailed this movie perfectly...adapting it wonderfully from the book...they took out what they needed and matched the rest perfectly! i loved this as much as the book~"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Opps! I just reviewed this product as the book and not the movie. Now I have to delete all that I said about the book and offer an opinion about the movie instead. Having purchased and read the book, having read good reviews of the movie version, I did buy the DVD and viewed it. Having done that, I wished that I had rented it instead. Yes, it is a good tour of some of Sweden. I take it on faith that the movie was filmed in Sweden. The island setting of the story is esquisite. The actors portraying some of the main characters are somewhat unattractive, but that could be a plus rather than a minus depending upon your point of view. Still, for me, the movie version is not as good as the book, as some reviewers promised -- except for that island. Oooo,...the cold weather and that island. You can't beat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie!","review":"This is an amazing movie. Generally I am distracted by the foreign language with English subtitles, but never in this one. I had read the book and loved it, but my husband had not yet read it & thought it was one of the best movies he had ever seen. The American version will have to go a long way to beat this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtitled Girl With The Dragon Tattoo","review":"Never watched it as when we tried to order the movie in English it gave us this one instead. There was some kind of glitch on the ordering page. Be careful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've had any sort of violent trauma DO NOT SEE","review":"I really was very disappointed in this movie. Not only was there a very violent rape scene, but it went on so long, I had to wonder if someone (maybe even the author) had some sort of fetish. I had several friends with me and two of them left because they could not deal with those particular scenes (they started having violent flashbacks)... I understand that her experiences were important to her character but this was COMPLETELY unnecessary. They told me that if it hadn't been fetishized in the movie they would have stayed to see the rest (and only slightly better) middle-ending of the movie. I really do not recommend this movie to anyone. There really is no set plot and what I believed was supposed to be the main plot (the mystery --- based on reviews and descriptions of the movie) turned out to be a side plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, boring sloooow","review":"SUPER SLOW dull dull dull. Perhaps it is because I watched the extended version. Maybe the books were better, I haven't read them, and I don't plan to, but watching this was painful. I kept waiting to find out what all the hype was about, and it was just hype. I love subtitled movies, movies with unique flare, and lots of culture...so do not dismiss my review because you may think that I do not have a broad enough perspective.The entire movie was centered around old men having obsessions/sex with younger women, with a really sloooow mystery mixed in.The uncle obsessed about his nieceThe Hacker was raped by her older parole officerIt was eluded the Hacker was molested by her fatherThe Hacker had sex with the journalist twice her ageThe missing girl was raped by her father and brotherThe father and then older brother had sex and molested young girls"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many rape scenes make the series disgraceful and tasteless","review":"The investigation of the missing girl is interesting because there are so many suspects, and no one was really sure if she was actually murdered. But the rape scenes with the \\"gaurdian\\" parole officer and the girl with the dragon tattoo are tasteless and derrogitory. Although some feel that the Swedish author's original \\"brutal\\" story should be kept in tact, it surely turned away more people than it attracted to the series. The original author must have been a seriously disgusting and disturbed man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage - Should have left the original title....","review":"If you enjoy the torture and murder of women as entertainment, this is the movie for you. My family and I thought it was disgusting and overly graphic. The distributors should have kept the original book title - Men Who Hate Women - that is a far more appropriate title for this movie.I really wish I had not spent money on this DVD. I will be throwing it in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible movie","review":"lousy screenplay, leaves out big parts of the story from the book, Michael Nyqvist who plays Blomqvist in the movie, projects zero intelligence, very one-dimensional portrayal of the character from the book, Noomi Rapace is better in role of Salander but character in book is much more complex and interesting, to sum it up, neither actor brings intelligence and multi-dimensions to their roles, avoid the movies, stick to the books, that's it.."},{"rating":"1","title":"LET TEDIUM REIGN","review":"Tedious. I got into this for about 30-40 minutes before I turned it off. The characters were bland, at best, and I found the pacing to be incredibly slow.

The movie was really well done and I reccommend it as a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl with Dragon","review":"This is my second swedish film... i think. The only other swedish film i seen many times was \\"Let the right on it\\". maybe i seen other swedish films, whatever.I like this movie a lot. I didn't expect some of what I saw and i didn't start reading the book until after i saw the movie. I really like the character Lisbeth Salander. She's cool and got some wicked style going on.I'll watch this movie again in due time though it is a little long i have to admit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie but not for kids","review":"This movie was only expected to sell maybe 30,000 copies or so but it ended up selling millions. I heard that the author died before he knew how famous it was but I might not have that story correct. I must agree with other reviewers in that this is not for children, as some of the scenes are quite explicit. I normally don't like movies where I have to read the subtitles, as I usually feel they detract from the actors and when I first sat down to watch this movie I was sure I was in for the same. But I was very happy to be totally wrong. Within minutes I found myself completely immersed in the story and barely noticed I was reading the subtitles. Any fans of suspense thrillers will love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Note: NOT for Youth","review":"While browsing lists of suggested reading material for pre-teen girls, this book/movie was recommended.Luckily we decided to watch this before gifting because... wow.Graphic rape scenes, cursing, &... violence.Excellent story... for adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie watching on my motorola xoom","review":"This movie is great i love all the action and the story line is terific cant wait to watch part 2 im watching it on the go in my motorola xoom great quality right off the browser keep putting up good movies amazon :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The last two movies actually have english dubbing, this one didn't but captioning was still very good. I recommend getting all three movies and watch them in order. I was blown away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost As Good As the Book","review":"This movie actual does the book justice. It does eliminate some of the minutiae, and it does not hurt the movie in any way. So far I have seen this movie three times, and cannot wait for the other movies in the Millenium Trilogy. Naomi Rapice IS Lisbeth Salander. She is electric in the role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Close to the Book","review":"Like many I loved the 1st book, have read the 2nd, and look forward to reading the 3rd. Bought this video because of all the good reviews and since viewing it I have to agree. Liked the fact that you could view with subtitles or dubbed - watched it both ways. In short anyone who loved the book will love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see","review":"Some people claim that \\"the dubbing ruined\\" the movie for them. I have poor eyesight and the dubbing was a God-send for me. I've wanted to watch the movie since it came out, but the subtitles were too small, and went by too fast, for me to read them. Some people claim it \\"burns horrible images into your mind\\". Well the movie is definitely not for children, nor faint-hearted adults who don't want to know that this kind of horrible stuff happens waaay more often than is reported in the news. It is a good story, told at a good pace. There was a scene where the music was so intense it freaked me out. I had to pause the movie and go do something else for 5 min. before I could continue watching. It had a good ending, too. Not sappy, somewhat realistic, but good. This is a movie I would watch again. That's the litmus test for me. A movie I would watch again gets 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just watch it.. :)","review":"Dang! gotta put 20 words in this.. lol.. I do not usually review much of anything on amazon, unless it was bad, to keep others from buying it, etc. .. but wow. this was a neat thriller/suspense/mystery movie on the swedish side, that did very well on the story telling.. lil bit of reading involved on the subtitles.. but well worth it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"mashup of a Michael Crichton, Stephen King, and John Grisham","review":"I would describe this book as a mashup of a Michael Crichton, Stephen King, and John Grisham novel. It's part story, part thriller, part mystery. Overall, it comes together very nicely, and although it's long, you finish it quickly because you want to know what happens next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overlong and overwrought","review":"I hadn't read the book nor did I know about the plot prior to viewing this film.It's a fairly average thriller that relies on high level violence and sexually explicit scenes to try to push it over the top. The story is rather weak and at least 30-45 minutes too long. Despite the movie's length, there is very little character exploration, giving it a strangely hammy quality that makes supposedly serious scenes almost laughable. It just doesn't ring true and because of this, is not as suspenseful or menacing as it attempts to be. The anti-capitalist pro-socialist subtext also distracts from the story. In other words, the writer has an axe to grind in the guise of telling a story. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtitled!","review":"I did not realize this was subtitled, so I did not watch it. I have read the books and liked them very much. I'll \\"Cloud\\" it and look for the English version"},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtitled..waste of money","review":"Didnt even watch this movie, on the Ruko it showed ENG but I didnt see that it was subtitled until we started to watch it. Went back and once it brought the movie up on a bigger screen I noticed the subtitle.Do not want to read thru a whole movie...a waste of money. Very disappointed!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all like the book!","review":"When I started reading the book I couldn't put it down. The plot and the character dynamics intrigued me. From start to finish, the book was amazing. I was anticipating the film to be much like the book - however it seemed more like a complete rewrite. So many events were different from the book it was annoying. The actors are nothing like the book describes them. I haven't read the second or third books yet but soon will. I will NOT be watching the film adaptations for the last two in the trilogy. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie","review":"This is one of the most graphic sadistically violent movies I have ever seen, I was not able to watch it through. It goes right down there with Trainspotting and A Clockwork Orange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I loved the books, but this movie is just too different. I have no idea what other reviewers are speaking of when they say it is a good adaption.Characters are missing, some dead, some never or barely mentioned. The time line is all out of sequence. Some of the key points have been changed to give lisbeth a bigger role. There are extra scenes that are just pointless to the plot, just there to up the action. The whole Wennerstrom plot is is barely mentioned.I hope the US remake is more faithful to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH IT","review":"This movie is missing 90% of the details found in the book. I read this book but my husband did not. We watched the movie together, and I had to explain everything that was happening in the movie. I suggest reading the books of this trilogy, and forget the movie version. I give it \\"0\\" stars, but amazon made me choose a star rating and \\"0\\" wasn't a choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hold out for complete 3 hour version!","review":"In Sweden, they are selling all 3 movies in their extended (3 hour!) television versions! A box set with all the movies plus 90 minutes of special features is being released in Sweden in November! Why not in the US???"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it more then I thought I would","review":"I started hearing all about who was going to play Lisbeth in the american version. I did not know the story of the author, so I came to this movie with no idea what it was about. Now I know why there is such a buzz. Noomi Rapace is so good in this film as the mysterious and deliberate Lisbeth, I can't even imagine anyone being better. The financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) is also well done. This movie can be graphic at times, but it held me through out. The pace is good, the screenplay well fleshed out and the soundtrack fits, the acting the scenery was all first rate. I had to read the novels after I watched the movie and I thought that the book was well captured. Good movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best film for the end of 2011","review":"The best film I have seen in 2011, I was anticipating the film when I heard of the up and coming release. The film did not disappoint me. An absolutely amazing film. I was pinned to my chair from the very beginning. Great story line and awesome plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie, missing a few important scenes from book","review":"Good movie if you like murder, mystery. Viewed on the Kindle Fire...it is pretty dark, so if you're in a light room...don't start watching. A few good character building scenes from the book should have been kept, but hey, fitting the tomb of a book into roughly 2 hours I'm sure wasn't easy. Will be interesting to compare to the new release."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY AWESOME.","review":"ABSOLUTELY AWESOME. What a great movie!!! I can't wait to watch the next two!! WOW... I think this is the best movie I have seen in years. Translation for english was well done. What a fantastic story line. TEN STARS!!! **********"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to see the next one","review":"Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Now to watch the next one. I am really excited to see the US version of the movie too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great movie","review":"As has been said before, the acting was terrific, the cinematography, music, script, everything... I didn't realize there were two versions (this is the older, original Swedish version versus the 2011 American version) and was at first disappointed this wasn't the American one. I haven't seen the newer version yet, but I can't imagine it could be any better; I have to assume it will be a let-down after this one, as I've felt with other American versions of excellent foreign films.Note added August 2012: I was extremely disappointed with the American version. There was much less depth of character involving Lisbeth, with nothing to explain why she is like she is (ie father's abuse of mother). In the American version there was little depth to the story comparatively, and much sensationalism and shock value (the cat), whereas the original film has true substance, layers, subtlety, and intrigue. The Swedish version is so much better in every way! Noomi Rapace is riveting."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG....","review":"This movie knocked my socks off! An intense murder mystery...or is it? Thrilling, intense, scary, brilliant. Don't miss it! Part 2 is in theaters now. I can't wait for part 3. Interesting the same characters go from book to book, movie to movie. The acting is superb. The story is well-plotted and played out. I knew nothing about this movie, just happened to download it from Netflix (yes, you don't have to wait to receive it in the mail.) It's one of those movies you must sit through without interruption, and when it's over, you want more! So, pour yourself a stiff drink, turn off the lights and watch this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtitled but a super good movie","review":"Yes this movie is subtitled and yet it is extremely good. I would recommend all three movies from this series. I typically hate subtitled movies but this one really draws you in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feminist Tripe","review":"I was offended by the perspective - men bad, women heroic victims - mostly because of its intensity level. I was able to sit to the end of the movie because I was trying to figure out what language they spoke while reading the English subtitles. This ought to play well in America after a Hollywood remake. If you're a normal guy you ought to skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic story, poorly done","review":"This is an amateurish film at best. The screenplay is awful, but the basic story is pedestrian so I doubt the next version will be much better than this. And apparently most men in Sweden are secretly crazed rapists (at least according to this trilogy). Big let down here since I really wanted to see a decent movie from anywhere other than Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"About packaging only","review":"As my title says, this review is about the packaging only. I've previewed the movie, and feel sure it's excellent! Now about the packaging: I ordered and received the Blu-ray version. When I buy DVDs I like to have the option to (1) leave them at our vacation rental for our guests, (2) re-sell them, or (3) occasionally keep them in our own DVD library. With this packaging, those options are pretty much out, except maybe for the last one. The main paper part, with the movie description, etc. just fell off, yet the plastic was very difficult to remove--leaving a clear case with the DVD inside. At least, the disc itself is labelled with its movie name, thankfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Watch This!","review":"Hi,I agree with the other poor ratings here.This movie was awful. It had a rape scene near thebeginning part of the movie, yuck! I gave the movieabout 15 or so more minutes to get better...surelysomething positive would happen? But it didn't.This girl had everything bad that could happen to aperson, happen to her. That was a mouthful, which wasby the way the type of rape they so graphically portrayed.Depressing and Disgusting! It took me awhile to get overthe whole experience, and I didn't even watch the restof the movie.And they actually have a sequel to this???Do yourself a favor and do NOT watch this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book? What Book?","review":"The book was great... the movie is passable but too bad it was not based on the book. It is very sad that the screenplay is a complete rewrite of the book. I have never been able to understand why producers of movies will buy the rights to a great book only rip the guts out of it... (Mayhaps, they just can't think of a good name for a movie so they buy one) they must really hate those who can make art. Anyone who gave this movie more than one star has not read the book... and if they say they have, they lie. Oh, and the lead male is fat. This movie is a maybe see the book is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately there is no stars","review":"I fell for the hype of this movie. Big mistake. I prefer family type movies & this one is absolutely not for families. Wish I had never rented this movie. Forget getting my money back. I just want what I did see out of my mind. Even my 21 yr old daughter refused to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a review of the movie not the book","review":"First of all, I give the book 5 stars. The movie, however, is a complete bastardization of the book, and proves that Hollywood isn't the only enterprise that can rip off other's ideas for a cheap and quick profit. First, the movie is missing approximately 50% of the book, making it a slideshow, not unlike the boring presentations of your relatives' visit to India, with images of \\"me in front of the temple,\\" etc., without the interesting details that make it worth while. The worst offense, however, is that the actor who portrays Lisbeth is about 15 years older than the actual character, who is described as appearing under legal age. This is an extremely important part of the story, in this book and the following two. There are several reasons for this, which you will find out if you read the books, but not if you rely on the movie interpretation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from the dragon","review":"Beware this movie contains adult themes and would earn an X rating in my book. Sluggish, limited story line. Low rating for immoral, sadistic content and sluggish story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only","review":"I was really looking forward to watching this film, asI have read the book and enjoyed it. When the DVD arrived we settled ourselves down with glass of wine, and nibbles --only to find out that the DVD wasn't compatible with UK dvd players!! If only that had been made clear when I ordered it! so I now have one unplayed DVD of The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo - any offers?"},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good As The Book","review":"This movie is great. I was quite surprised at how closely it hews to the book. There are things that are cut from the movie, but for the most part that is understandable. If they hadn't I would expect the move would have run to 4 hours. Bloomqvist's affairs have been cut out and a lot of the background of Lisbeth, but for the most part the movie manages to stay true to the book.Salander's relationship with her mother is significantly different in the movie than the book. Salander visited her mother in the book and the mother was so far into dementia that she couldn't recognize her daughter. There were other changes with the end that really didn't damage this film and was true to the spirit of the book.I highly recommend the movie, even if you've read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo-Two Thumbs Down","review":"You know how people say don't see a movie based off a book? It's true. I understand that they need to leave things out, but do they need to change things too? How hard is it to read the book and base the script off of what the characters say and do, instead of changing and rewriting? I found so many things wrong with this movie that I was angry at myself for even watching. On a positive note, I will say that the actors did a wonderful job. If I didn't read the book first, I would have thought that movie was great. I'm just hoping that the American version is as good as actor, Daniel Craig (Mikael Blomkivst), says."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a breath of fresh air for moviegoers.","review":"My mom and I enjoy foreign films and television shows. She hadn't heard of this trilogy (either had I frankly) and she accidently watched the last one first. Then, together, we watched the first one Girl With a Dragon Tatoo. What an amazing film. I'm so tired of watching the same movie, with the same characters, same everything, you ALWAYS know what someone is going to do (my mom and I have guessed movies in the first 3-5 minutes many a time). This movie's character's were so great and you never know whats going to happen, or what the main character is going to do (she is kind of crazy but I LOVE her).If you are TIRED of watching the SAME movie as you ALWAYS have then this is a movie for you! Like a breath of fresh air!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't wait for Hollywood Version!

GREAT GREAT GREAT movie. Seriously; BUY IT NOW and WATCH IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Noomi Rapace is Lizbeth Salander - don't miss it!","review":"Having already read the Trilogy, I had to extend my delight with Stieg Larsson's characters and view this film of the first chapter, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\". The story line, although necessarily trimmed down from the novel, remains true to the original story, and the missing events do not impair the clarity of the adaptation. Noomi Rapace is perfectly cast as Lizbeth! This Swedish film lacks the usual \\"hollywood touch\\" but is beautifully stark and direct. I've thoroughly enjoyed the film, highly recommend it, and anticipate the future release of the remainder of the Trilogy.The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't pause it.","review":"It is a real thriller, and it just keeps surprising you. It's a trilogy, and I will look forward to watching the others. The sound, and the cinematography are first rate, and the Amazon stream is perfect. The Amazon deal is a great one, and I sure am glad that they made this a feature for Amazon Prime members."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't sure what to expect by the title, and this was the first time I had ever heard of the movie or the books. The movie is graphic, but that lent to the realism of it. It kept me glued the entire time. Now I want to know what happened in Lisbeth's life to make her the way she is. I'm looking foward to watching the next two movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the edge of your seat...","review":"The first of a three book series, the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo presents some cold, dark and harsh glimpses of life in Sweden since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the opening of the east to western capitalism. Along the way, there's significant intrigue about the socio-economic inner workings of Sweden's society. The surface story is captivating, intense and fast paced. It is contemporary in thinking and production, vicious and dark at times, and it's a mystery/thriller with intense drama. Excellent and spell binding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swedish Film","review":"This is the highest grossing Swedish film of all time. It's in the Swedish language with English subtitles. I would not recommend it. Worth a rental, though. Outside of a few very brief nude scenes, I found it rather pedestrian and wouldn't want to see it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo","review":"First of all I thought I was ordering the Daniel Craig version.

The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is hopelessly bleak and unforgiving and assaulting - for over 2 1/2 hours. When it's finally over, you'll feel like a victim. I guess this is what passes for entertainment in some circles, but not in mine. If you're feeling overly happy and optimistic about your life and want to alter that, watch this film - I guarantee your mood will change.

With the exception of Noomi Rapace that would fit our heroine's role like a glove...if the script wasn't so messed up as to steal from her salander's \\"silent suppressed anger\\" and \\"terminator mode\\" moments.I'm afraid it is overall a very poor result.Hope these guys had a much bigger budget to do the shooting properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dark dark downer","review":"I did not read the books, so I am not comparing the movie to the book. I merely watched the movie for it's own merits...of which I find little.The acting in this film is executed superbly, so that I never felt outside of the characters or the film.The story, or 'mystery' as it is sometimes called, was so predictable to me that I found it hard to believe this aspect alone recieved any acclaim.The content of the film, or story, is dark and vicious. Ugly sexual appetites are the springboard for this descent. Nothing to laugh at or enjoy here, nothing to recommend this to anyone I know.I have no interest in viewing the next two movies that follow this one, because of this one.

Many storyline in the book are deleted or altered. It's like watching a totally different movie! With that in mind, the movie itself is still below average. Maybe it's just the way Swedish people act/talk, but the actors are bad! They all look and act \\"subdued\\".

I have to say that I think this version is much better. This version is more gritty, it gives you a real idea of what Lisabeth Salender is about & what makes her tick. It is unfourtunate that this version gets at least in my eyes short changed. If you like the Daniel Craig version, do yourself a favor ^& watch this one. you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is much better","review":"As usual, this movie does not stand up to the book upon which it is based. I fully realize that movies \\"must\\" be limited to a certain time frame (due to audience attention rates being so low), so the makers are obliged to pick and choose material from the book. However, this movie simply lacks all of the subtly and well-written prose that the book contains. I found the book to be much more graphic than the movie, so I am not sure what is so over-the-top there. I do not normally watch slasher flicks or anything with such graphic violence (it is rare that I am reading Larsson's book anyhow...I did not realize the amount of graphic violence/rape in it prior to starting; I was interested in what all of the fuss was about over it in popular culture). My issue with the movie is that it was just a poor adaptation and it did not match the book to my liking. I don't know if I'll see the next movie or read the next book, but this is what I had to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"gratuitous rape scenes","review":"A rather forgettable serial killer movie.

Noomi Rapace is sooooo much better a Lisbeth Salander than Rooney Mara and the Nyqvist is so much better than Clueless Daniel Craig that I had to remember who was even in it. This version has a different ending from the book and drops out one of the big subplots but it's creepier and so less flashy. I like David Fincher movies like \\"Se7en\\" and \\"Fight Club,\\" but his \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" felt like a really pretty commercial. The original movie is so much darker and you never feel for certain if the heroes are going to succeed.

My main camera is a Nikon SLR, but I wanted something that I could keep in my pocket and snap away without all the bulk of the SLR. The SD40 is small enough to keep in your pocket, it produces great pictures and the on camera editing feature is very nice to change color hue, I particularly like the vivid setting. The video is also very capable, battery life is good and a 2gb card holds enough storage for the pixel count of the camera, the flash is very small so don't expect great results with it. The LCD is a bit small and hard to see in daylight but that is a trade off for the overall size. I also like the blue lighted button on the back that lets you shoot in a vertical position.

Pictures come out great. There's a variety of settings and the pictures come out greeeeeeat.If you can afford it, get the weather case too.

Her 52 bits of sage advice take the new mother through the phases of motherhood from newborn to toddler. Even the cover evokes images of comfort: three little ducks in a sudsy bath; a baby's foot in a mother's hand; and cozy slippers resting delicately in a basket.Braner's honest examination of motherhood left me, a two-time mother, feeling understood and, quite frankly, loved! Her thoughtful essays interweave the right amount of personal stories to give the reader the feeling that Braner has been there, too. I will never look at my \\"skinny jeans\\" in the same way; nor will I engage in negative self-talk, which so many mothers do. Her book made me want to kick back, take a guilt-free bath, and enjoy my kids as their childhoods enfold before me.

I first saw Sarah Brightman in April, 1988 when she starred as Christine Daae in Phantom of the Opera. Her voice was both shrill and weak then, and nothing else has changed. She butchered Ave Maria and Nessun Dorma was a disaster. I used to think she was better off with musical theatre numbers, but if you listen to her English reindition of \\"Memory,\\" you'll blow your ear drums.It's quite a shame her voice is shrill because the music orchistrations are fantastic as is the backing vocals. That is the ONLY saving grace of Sarah Brightman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbing down of great music...","review":"The kind of music-making of people like Brightman and Andrea Bocelli wouldn't bother me that much (I'd just leave it and, as anther reviewer wrote, buy something else) but in this age, these \\"artists\\" are having a negative effect through their mass market appeal on the \\"legitimate\\" performers of this kind of music.I am truly afraid that with the mind-set that the only things that will be produced must make a lot of money, appreciaters of the art of real classical singing will eventually have nothing to select from except singers like Brightman and Bocelli!Ironically, opera was a popular art form in the 19th century, expecially in Italy.

Her voice is as awesome as the selections."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a fraud!","review":"I cannot believe that Sarah Brightman lets loose with some of the sounds she makes and gets away with calling them singing. As stated in another review I read on Amazon, she sings in a little girl soprano. The tone is totally unsupported and this becomes obvious when she is forced to overcompensate for her lack of vocal ability by scooping to notes and singing through an unbelievable wobble. If you want Nessun Dorma...listen to Pavarotti. If you want Rusalka's Song to the Moon...listen to the divine Renee Fleming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Recordings","review":"This is my first Sarah Brightman album so I really can't compare it to earlier albums, but I find it wonderful. She has an amazing and versatile voice and really shows it off in this collection. \\"Ave Maria\\" is a great song and Sarah pulls it off with pleasent results. \\"Winter Light\\" is another pretty song and like \\"Ave Maria\\", it's not performed in her typical opera voice. \\"Pie Jesu\\" is yet another highlight. My favorite opera-style songs would have to be \\"O Mio Bambino Carro\\" and the fantastic closing track \\"Time To Say Goodbye.\\" Ms. Brightman sounds great on both. This is a good CD to relax to. The vocals are fantastic and go great with the orchestrations. Definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah, oh Sarah...you are the ultimate Diva!!","review":"The six new songs on this cd is worth the purchase alone...but then, as any true artist, Sarah wasn't satisfied with some of her other classics and re-recorded them...beautiful.

More of the adult singer and less of the kid I think. Not bad at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sales Technique...","review":"A three-star recording, a zero-star sales technique. The singing on this CD is a bit airy and thin (not enough color, and some sliding through notes, which seems to indicate vocal fatigue) but overall, enjoyable. However, I do NOT appreciate the photography on the CD and the attempt to imitate some type of playboy centerfold in the booklet. I had hoped to find some INFORMATION inside the booklet, not bawdy, sexual photography. I urge people to consider whether they want to support such a distasteful sales technique by buying this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daughter of the Devil: Voice of an Imp from Hell","review":"Unless you have a previous exposure to opera, you might take Brightman for a diva, yet she is unworthy of this honorific. Her weak, unsupported, pale English voice has no right singing such arias as Rusalka's \\"O, Moon, on High\\" (look to an authentic diva such as Lucia Popp or Renee Fleming for a heart-stopping rendition of this Dvorak piece) or Puccini's \\"Nessun Dorma\\" (seek out a tenor such as Jussi Bjorling, Franco Corelli, or even the much lighter-voiced Pavarotti, pre-Three Tenors-phase please, to hear a authentic rendition of Calaf's declaration of love. Run, run as fast as you can to get away from this cd: it's vile and an insult to opera composers and singers who work very hard at perfecting their art and are not heartily rewarded by the record companies these days (because of such also-rans as Brightman, Bocelli, Church, and Watson)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is There a Manager in the House?","review":"Brightman needs a firm hand while she decides between Beverly Sills classicism and Dolly Parton. The mix with mechanical thumpa thumpa is too trivial an accompaniment for so lilting a program. Most pathetic is the semi-nude shots, which add nothing to the album. Grow up, Sarah.

I have bought Eden, Time to Say Goodbye and the Andrew Lloyd Webber collection but I will definitely skip this one. I love Sarah's voice but does she have to go the cheap route with her CD jackets?! I saw the video to Ave Maria and Winter Light off this album and they both feature her topless, covering herself in the appropriate places but I still wouldn't call that a bikini bottom. How can she sing Ave Maria half naked? Disgrace!!! Well I guess she figures she lost some weight so she'll start shedding the clothes-NO THANKS SARAH PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON AND SING WITH SOME DIGNITY!!! Why do need to cheapen yourself to become the Brittany Spears of the genre?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycling of materials","review":"Sarah Brightman sings in the same old style again and again.

On this album, she tries her hand at a number of well-known classic and classical pieces (first among them Schubert's \\"Ave Maria\\").The resulting auditory catastrophe -- her voice fails to carry in the general sense and is hard-pressed just to maintain the proper note -- has been attempted to be whitewashed by the producer by adding in a disgraceful arrangement, likely produced on the cheapest of Casio electronic synthesisers.If you love music: Stay away, or you will be disappointed.If you love Brightman's voice: Stay away, or your illusions will shatter.Felix Kasza."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black ants don't even get close to it","review":"I bought this product to get rid of black ants in my house.

I can only imagine that it must have been some sort of copyright or patent issue... which of course causes all consumers to lose.One star until they reinstate the original WORKING design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"My first Amazon review! The reason I finally wanted to review something was because this product was extremely impressive. Much like other reviewers, I've dreaded the slow drain because many products have failed to unclog them. Even my plunging and snaking efforts were typically unsuccessful. A royal PITA whenever a drain started to slow.I finally found this product and thought i'd give it a go, simply because i've tried practically everything else.Upon first sight, the product looks suspiciously too simple in looks. Usage is even simpler. I thought no way would this work.Upon first use to my slow sink, nothing happened after the startlingly forceful event. That was until I slowly lifted the product away from the surface of the submerged sink. Once the seal broke, the drain started to clear IMMEDIATELY with zero restriction. AMAZING.This product is incredible. Worth the purchase price by far. I also like the idea it doesn't use harsh chemicals.Stellar product IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"My plumber would have more money if I didn't have this.","review":"This product is incredible. It's worked even when our toilet snake has failed us. One time we had a clog way down the pipes - it was clogging most of the drains in the house. I called the plumber who said we had to call a guy to flush the system out. At the last minute (thankfully I'd had to leave a message for the other guy) I remembered I had this product. It worked so well I called my plumber back to let them know about it. I can't imagine how much money I saved not having my main line flushed out...."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY","review":"I spent expensive $25 dollars on a product I was hoping to solve my problem. My bathtub went clogged just 4 days ago and did not seemed to be something very hard to solve. I followed all the instructions on the box for this product and after 4 unsuccessful applications, guess what??? The tube had gone empty! That was it, the only thing that went down the drain was my $25 dollars.But this history have a happy ending. Not satisfied to be stuck with this clogged bathtub that leaves your feet all the way dirty drowned I prepared myself a solution with Coke, vinegar, salt, vitamin C and boil it all together. It was the most acid thing I have ever seen, and guess what I poured out into the drain and unclogged everything! I recommend you that have a problem like that to use that solution and it will most likely work for you.

Later I learned the problem was deposits in the water channels that fill the bowl-- there is a single large one near the bowl drain and smaller ones under the rim. I scraped them carefully with a small screw driver-- I could tell a little bit of deposit was coming off but it didn't seem like much-- but viola, it was the difference between a toilet that almost flushed and one that did.Additional Info-- My 'free fix\\" eventually stopped working and there was nothing I could do at that point-- the plumber confirmed to me that after 25 years many toilets stop working effectively because of mineral deposits. One benefit of the new toilet, other than working well, it it uses much less water."},{"rating":"1","title":"did Not work for me!","review":"First, let me say I shop on Amazon all the time...Love it! but this once I have to say I was not happy with the product.

You can only see the deleted scenes in the special features section. Not only that, but the uncorked option that is supposed to be \\"longer, wilder and funnier\\" is actually shorter and less funny because they removed one of the best parts of the movie.You can't just sit down and watch the movie with every scene included and that's a big negative for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good!","review":"This movie was not funny at all.

In fact, I only giggled a few times at some of the jokes and one-liners, and laughed to myself at how bad and cliched the rest of the movie was.Vaughn and Wilson have got to be two of the most annoying, obnoxious, and overrated actors working in movies today. Crashers portrays them both as players who crash weddings to pick up girls. Their game turns on them when they crash the wedding of the Secretary of Treasury's, played by Walken, daughter. They both hit on two other daughters of the Secretary and find themselves falling in love.As you can see, I didn't go into details nor did I use concise plot points to discuss Wedding Crashers because I find it all a waste of my good time.Wedding Crashers is one of the worst films of 2005.Not recommendedD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype...worth renting, but don't buy!","review":"I just finished watching the DVD about 10 minutes ago.

The jerky fiance gets punched out, and the good-at-heart guy gets the girl.I don't remember laughing once during this movie.

I found nothing in this movie funny, the fact that these 2 horny sickos meet the \\"girl of their dreams\\" one day and are in love the next is just plain ludicrious.

Jeremy unknowingly deflowers the Secretary's virginal/sex maniac daughter (Isla Fisher), while poor John falls in love with the Secretary's other daughter (Rachel McAdams), who unfortunately has an asinine boyfriend (Bradley Cooper). The film does lose a bit of momentum halfway through, but it still contains plenty of laughs. It was a little strange watching Wilson play the straight man for once, but he did an excellent job in his role. Vaughn is the real star of the show, though: His one-liners are hilarious, and the Jeremy/Gloria scenes made me laugh so hard that I cried. \\"Wedding Crashers\\" is a very funny film that is definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother, you'll be fine without it.","review":"An utter display of horrid acting by Vaughn.

The relationships portrayed between men and women are shallow and dreary, the ending very depressing because it's supposed to be a happy ending when people who hardly know each other and are all dopey and moronic wind up \\"together and in love.\\" How inane! Misogynisic, patronizing, offensive, idiotic. I can't think of enough words to describe how lame this movie is.

Wilson and Vaughn are capable of much better and they're slumming it here. Hell you even have Will Ferrell here who is unfunny.The only reason I gave it two stars was because of Rachel McAdams who rises about this mess.I'm all for R rated comedies like the recent 40 Year Old Virgin and old movies like Stripes but this one is lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare to Laugh....ALOT!!!","review":"This movie falls in line with a particular type of comedy. The kind that are extremely funny. This film keeps coming with the laughter. There is about a fifteen minute portion of this movie where you will yawn. I feel it's a small price to pay for the nearly hour and a half of consistent and incredibly funny scene after scene.

Two unethical sleazeballs crash weddings for free food and free sex...what's romantic about that?? They get attached to one of the world's most dysfunctional families and everyone except one daughter (played by Rached Mcadams who is lovely) acts like a total butt head. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I like Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson (not necessarily together) both of whom have been in much better/funnier movies. This is NOT a movie you will remember or want to view twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A joke is funny only once","review":"This movie seems to turn in cirles.

Don't waste you time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie That Inspired Poor Behavior","review":"The Wedding Crashers is a case of a good movie that inspired a rude fad. The movie itself is very funny and is a good comedy. However, it inspired all sorts of copycat behavior.

A trick that can kill or paralyze someone that I am sure some idiot will try after seeing this.This film is so poorly executed that it is worthless except for the cute girls in it. Vince Vaughn is his usual coked out self and is just not funny or believable and neither is Owen Wilson. The premise that there is this set of rules or commandments for crashing weddings is just stupid. The only funny thing in the movie is the first instant where Will Ferrell appears. But even he is so diluted now that his charm dies within seconds. Don't waste your time or money on this trash. Vince Vaughn's only great performance is in \\"Swingers\\". He has become nothing more than Hollywood trash and a high school student could have made a better film than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny","review":"\\"Wedding Crashers\\" is a terrible movie. I had expected more considering the ads.Everything was predictable within the first 20 minutes. I could've overlooked that if only the movie was even halfway funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, but I was expecting more","review":"Wedding Crashers is another in the line of adolescent comedy that seems so popular nowadays. There are some funny scenes, and Will Farrell has a great cameo. However, with Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, I was expecting to be laughing out loud a lot more, and I wasn't. By the end of the film, it seems more like a shallow love story than a comedy film. Good for some laughs, but these actors have done better films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vince Vaughn steals the movie","review":"I like the interaction between Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson but Vince Vaughn was hilarious. The blu-ray disc has good picture quality. The deleted scenes are 24fps as well. Dialogue was clear throughout. Sound is directed from the front, little to no engagement of surrounds but this type of movie doesn't lend itself to showcase surrounds. Overall still an enjoyable movie for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent study of the lives of the founders of AA and Al-anon","review":"This is an excellent study of the lives of the founders of AA and Al-anon.

The selection, placement and quality of the music is superb. The clarity and richness of the remastering by Diamond Cut is remarkable, as one discovers while listening to \\"You Took my Breath Away\\", \\"Night and Day\\", \\"It's De-Lovely\\", and \\"Take My Heart\\", just a few of the wonderful 1930s songs in this album. In addition, every singer is perfectly matched to each song. If you enjoy music of this era, you also will not want to miss \\"Got A Date With An Angel\\" by Hal Kemp and \\"La Cumparsita\\" by Francisco Canaro (Asv Living Era).

I appreciate constructive criticism and historical honesty in a book. This book, however, was disappointing in its repetitive and gratuitous criticism of most of the religious (Christian) aspects of Rome. In most instances the criticism was unneccessary for the story. I was left with the feeling that the author had an axe to grind. In fact \\"City Without a Soul\\" would have been a better title. The author's superfluous chapter describing his \\"love affair\\" with a married woman was baffling. I have no idea how those materials got past the editors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rome is eternal - (this rating is supposed to be 4 stars, not 1)","review":"City of the Soul - I certainly have to concur with author Murray that Rome is a unique and wonderful place. This little book is a gentle pleasure to read. Not much new here, but there are some interesting factoids and it's nice to read of this man's personal attachment to a place that I also love. He's a good writer with the soul of an opera singer, which he originally wanted to become, and has a genuine talent for describing some of the very special locations that exist only in the eternal city."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rome for Romantics","review":"I finished this book wanting to read more - about Rome and about William Murray and his family. Shortly after finishing City of the Soul, we went to Rome and enjoyed many of the walks he described. Not only that, the maps on the end pages are excellent, and the small size of the book makes it an ideal book to take along.Murrays' mother was Italian and he grew up in Rome, although he was just as at home among Americans and British. While guiding us through central Rome and the discussing the history of the landmarks, he talks about growing up with his journalist mother and her lover. Murray's Rome is populated with artists and writers and this is both a great walking tour as well as a revealing journey of post-war Rome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it and had to have a Palm","review":"Great book and a real page turner!!

Some were remakes, not by the orginal artist, and even that worked together with the worship atmosphere, giving some favorites a fresh sound, proving the music is transendent of artist or time. Absolutely wonderful performances, great rythms, hot guitars, soul touching moments coming from the heart of the worshiper to the heart of God. It is an experience each and every time.

It reminds me of much more expensive classic Grand Seiko watches. I don't have very big arms, so this medium sized watch doesn't look like it's too big for my wrist. (I'm not a big fan of the current trend of huge watches.) It keeps time very well, within a few seconds a month, definitely acceptable. I have worn this watch quite a bit and it stands up well to the usual everyday abuse. No scratches on the glass or band yet. I also like the band closing mechanism very much. Very easy to use. All in all I would buy this again, if you are looking for a classy elegant low profile watch, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not about the Guitar","review":"Brilliant stuff.

Unrealistic and not becoming of American Forces---the point guard in the movie should have been sent to the rear for much needed mental health care and was not. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie makes you root for the enemy!!!","review":"This has to be the worst movie about WWII ever produced.

And by the way, Gary Senise made a horrible Mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"seamless masterpiece","review":"A Midnight Clear ranks as one of my all time favorite war films. The World War Two, Battle of the Bulge, drama unfolds on a scale far diminished from giant films like Saving Private Ryan. A Midnight Clear effectively works its scaled down production to full advantage. In place of intrusive special effects, the viewer is rewarded with spell binding performances from all members of its twenty odd cast. Ethan Hawke is utterly convincing with his youthful, detached, yet traumatized narration throughout the film. Hawke's performance should be a model to follow for any young actors preparing to do a World War Two period piece; for the simple fact that men and woman of that era did not speak in the tones, nuances, and slang common today.Hawke's narration is innocent and devestating to experience through-out this heart breaking, was is hell, film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Midnight Clear is one of the best WW2 movies ever.","review":"It shows the horrors of war very realistically. It also shows the sadness, unsureness and yes even the humor of men in war. This plot was very interesting; not the most original but a first of its kind I've seen from Hollywood. Ethan Hawke pulls off a strong preformance as a 19 yr. old Intelligence and Reconnaisance sergeant who doesn't really want to be in the war. Gary Sinise, Frank Whaley and the rest are wonderful too. Seeing this movie made me want to read the book (also *very* excellent, read it!) The screenplay, as I saw after reading the novel, most of the time literally took the words off the page and put them into the script. A very rare thing amongst movie adaptions. I put this movie in my top 3 strictly-militant-point of view movies of WW2 from the American side. 1. Saving Private Ryan 2. When Trumpets Fade 3. A Midnight Clear In short, WATCH THIS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GENUINE CLASSIC","review":"I had no idea what to expect when I saw this movie on HBO a few years ago. It was a cold wintery night with snow on the ground when I settled into this movie and its a viewing experience I wont forget. Its a flawless film-I would rank it right up there with the other great war movies (Come and See and Saving Private Ryan)Thats why I finally bought the video from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"So quiet...","review":"A Midnight Clear is one of the most beautifully done war filmsI've ever seen.What I like most most about it is that the makerstook the glory out of it like we see in so many other war movies.It's quiet when it needs to be quiet, and violent when it needs to be violent and it is never overdone.From the opening shot of the chateau to the final scene, the film keeps you in a sort of peaceful, yet anxious trance.I thought that the comparison of a savage war on top of the tranquil beauty of a snow covered forest was put together marvelously.All in all, this is a movie that EVERYONE, young and old should see. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing!","review":"This is another of those anti-war movies disguised as a war movie. It was full of big name actors but I had never heard of the movie and could not figure out why.....then I watched it and found out. None of the characters were developed enough to get to care about them. None of them showed any of the gritty toughness you normally would associate with vets who served in the Ardennes battle.This was more like a bunch of guys with attitudes more befitting a Vietnam war movie than a WWII flick.I thought the idea behind the story had possibilities was I had no connection to the main characters so was left flat. I would stay away from this one if you are a big WWII movie buff like I am. Try the Saints & Soldiers movies instead. They are well acted, good story, and lots of action."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent movie, but this is no masterpiece....","review":"I am surprised at the amount of praise that this movie is getting on Amazon. A Midnight Clear is a thoughtful WWII drama with some nice sets and a decent amount of well crafted exterior shots. However, the story becomes fairly predictable as you pass the mid way point, and the acting ranges from very good to horribly, insultingly, goofball . Technically there are many flaws, poorly lit scenes, terrible sound production, overuse of certain music themes, poorly crafted replica uniforms, etc. Don't get me wrong, A Midnight Clear is an entertaining movie, but comparing it to Saving Private Ryan is ludicrous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"The movie isn't your typical American hero type war movie. Like the characters that develop through the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very believable war movie.","review":"Once you've seen Band Of Brothers a movie like this is just not very believable. Neither the acting nor the story are very convincing. A lot of details that made BoB so realistic are over looked (but remember, this movie was made a few years prior to BoB).[I'll leave the synopsis up to the other reviewers.] This is a 'When Trumpets Fade' style of movie though WTF is better in my opinion. If you like WTF you might like this. But if BoB is what you judge all war movies by this one will probably disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Typical Band of Ragtag Army Misfits Movie","review":"As an Army vet, I can say that the characters in this movie are just as crazy and varied as you're likely to find in any military unit. Falling somewhere between the Dirty Dozen and Jacobs Ladder, this sleeper is not for everyone. It's pace is slow. It's full of surreal moments. But such is life in a combat zone -- I saw some very surreal things in Desert Storm. I'll admit the writers took it a little too far a couple times, but most of their risks worked, and these accomplished actors pull it off somehow. Overall the movie stands out as one of the great commentaries on war. If you're not too much of a literalist, I'd highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Bad Move on Columbia's part","review":"Why would Columbia transfer a great war movie on a Pan & Scan version only? If any movie deserves to be kept in it's widescreen format, it should be this one. Get into the program guys, Widescreen is the future. Please release this one in a Special Widescreen Edition!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Serious Mistake On This Dvd Release,","review":"Basically i concure with the positive reviews stated previously about *A Midnight Clear, however the problem with this Dvd release of *A Midnight Clear is that it was altered from its original widescreen aspect ratio into a 4.3 pan&scan ratio, this is a real problem with the visual caliber of this film. It is definitly a HUGE mistake on the side of Columbia Tristar. I really love this film but I will not purchase this butchered version which is missing a lot of video content, I do not recommend the purchase of this Dvd version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for everyone","review":"While this film demonstrates in the best way possible why war is futile and heartbreaking; they have done it in a very effective way.The characters are well developed, and you really care what happens to them.A reviewer or two has quibbled with minor technical flaws, one involving the geography of the locations. This has little or no effect on the overall quality of this film. Great performances by all. A wonderful cast.This film would have to be in the top 5 of my top 10 war movies ever made. And in the top 50 of top 100 favorite movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Release, still full frame","review":"What is it with this movie? This is the third time it has been released on DVD and it's still full frame! I own the 2002 version, the only thing different appears to be the cover art. I guess I am a little confused because it was originally released in the theaters in widescreen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated Book from Dated Authors","review":"This book would have been helpful--if it had been written twenty years ago. Oh, I'm sorry; it already was. The authors (mainly Engel) use ten-year-old examples from books they wrote over twenty years ago, putting them some thirty years out of step with the way missions are mainly handled today. They shoot themselves in the foot by citing several current examples of missions' organizations they claim are doing it right. If they had done this in a positive, helpful manner rather than a smug, superior attitude, this book may have been of some use.This is just another example of Christian authors making a quick buck by rehashing stale examples to make themselves sound like they still know what they are talking about. The review in Christianity Today magazine really says it all. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"To missionaries: STOP","review":"Here is a new direction for missionaries to consider: leave them alone. Cultures around the world have perfectly fine religions and traditions of their own. How would you like it if some non-Western religion sent missionaries of its own to your town to convert you and your family? What makes you any different? Xian missionaries are in places where they have no business. Missionization is a dead practice, based on colonial and racist ideas. Stay the hell out of other people's societies and lives!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Repetitive, yes, but a good ending to the series","review":"Having called this a good ending to the series, allow me to elaborate. I was expecting a big blowout. Instead, it kind of petered out, as if it ran out of steam. However, it is more realistic this way - a lot of wars peter out when the combatants are tired of fighting. And it served as a useful setup for the Colonisation series.The major gripe is the same as I've had with the other books in the series - too repetitive! I guess this is useful if you had to wait a year between installments, but surely if you've read all the 3 previous books, you realise by now that the Race has a long history, that they can't mate without female scent pheremones, that Earth is colder than Home, etc. Still, an entertaining end to an entertaining series. I will definitely pick up this alternate history in Colonisation."},{"rating":"1","title":"After a real flogging, this horse is finally dead!","review":"Turtledove must have had a golfing appointment and needed to finish his excellent Word War series in a hurry.After three exciting books, this final volume was a real let down, with main characters being led through one pointless situation after another until they either died a trivial death or just dissapeared in a puff of banality. I have found that epic, multi volume series are very difficult for authors to finish off as well as they began them (such as Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars series), and this one is no different.Unfulfilling and ultimately a grab for cash is the unfortunate fate of this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank goodness it's over!","review":"I usually start a series with misgivings. This series reminded me why. Like many or indeed most multi-book series, it has enough content for a single novel but either due to a crumbling editor, a greedy publisher and or author it was published as is. There are very few multi volume novels that deserved to be delivered as such. This one should have been delivered in one book. The premise is original and promishing. The delivery is very very repetitive repetitive. Did I say it was repetitive? If you like the central core (alien culture battles earth) read Footfall by Larry Niven. It's only around 650 pages long. And MUCH better.David M. Rya"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story - bad editing","review":"I'm a glutton for punishment I guess - once I start something I can't finish. This is a great story idea with interesting, and well thoughtout characters and plotlines. The writing style though leaves a lot to be desired. I highly doubt I'll be picking up any more of this authors books.There's a huge problem with the whole series - it's written as though each chapter was published in a monthly magazine. There's extensive review and repitition at the beginning of every character's section of a chapter. I first noticed this in the second book, and by the fourth, it's really become bothersome. A competent editor could have trimmed this repition out, and possibly delivered a much tighter story in 3 books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many different people fend off an alien invasion during WWII","review":"Take World War II, add an alien invasion and massive occupation, through in Hitler with the Atomic Bomb."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great novel!!!","review":"Striking the Balance is an excellent novel, a welcome change from the usual alien invasion novel where the aliens get literally blasted off the face of the Earth. The peace treaty between mankind and the alien Race, and both sides' plans to backstab the other (at the end, last few pages) are entirely plausible. Also, someone said that Turtledove portrays \\"all Germans as evil\\". This is wrong- the character Heinrich Jager is a great example of a good man under a bad system. Political intrigue and action are combined a la Tom Clancy, and even without the intrigue and double-dealing the book would still be great! The entire series is great and I can't wait to start on the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet again, it's us versus THEM","review":"Not a bad book, although it's starting to get a little far-fetched as the series leaves us on a cliffhanger waiting for the fifth book. The aliens' psych is the weakest link in believability. If they're really as slow to adapt to new situations and ideals as Turtledove portrays them to be, then they wouldn't be able to make any sort of a match for humans in combat. Despite some of the logical shortcomings in the series, it is pretty good pulp. If it doesn't end by the fifth book, though, I'm gonna give up hope of finishing the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"This book is a pretty good piece of writing. Turtledove's style is not very literary, but good for a work of fiction. The story gets you involved, and the many threads seem to coincidentally (sometimes almost too much so) work themselves together. Turtledove's penchant for steamy scenes also annoyed me a little. It seems that many science fiction writers are perverted that way. Not to give the ending away, but it was somewhat disappointing to the patriotic earthling that I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God It's Over","review":"Unfortunately, I was sucked into this book series by the idea behind the books. What could have been a fantastic series was totally destroyed by an author who has no concept of the written word. Mr. Turtledove, I GET IT ALREADY! For God's sake, get on with your story. Every aspect of this series was described, in detail, mutiple times throughout the book. There is no need for the reader to do any thinking while reading these books because the author has taken it upon himself to describe at great length every connection a reader can make for himself. If you are thinking of buying this book, be warned...you will be sucked in so that you have to finish them, but you will wish you hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment.","review":"Having read the last three books (couldn't find the first) I kept expecting it to get better. It didn't. It was an excelent idea but are all Germans really evil? Are all English and Americans really good? There were so many subplots it was hard to keep track of what was going on. Each subplot was mentioned in each chapter and many had nothing to do with the main plot. Made you wonder why they were written other that to just fill paper.Turtledove missed a good opportunity here to write a classic science fiction novel. He would have been better off to mention his idea to someone else and let them write a 600 page novel than meander through 2400 pages himself.Yup, still read three of the four books and he is spending the royalies he made off me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"The only book in this series I didn't like that much was the first one.As for this one, why is everyone complaining that the ending is bad? Just because it's not your typical hollwywood ending where we triumph over the aliens an blah blah blah George Lucas style, all of a sudden it's bad?The great thing about this series, and this book especially, is that it is REALISTIC. This is a series about what would HAPPEN, not what we would like to happen. Even though we WOULD like to fight to the last man, the typical glorious ending for the underdog who triumphs, it will never be that way. For all of those who read it and were dissappointed by how the world turns out when the war is finally over, all I have to say is;\\"Hey, Turtledove has the PhD, all you've got to work with is what Hollywood gave you...now shut up .\\"Email me if you dissagree ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Undiscovered masterpiece","review":"I have never understood why even among Lansdale fans this book doesn't get more love. Sunset JOnes is one of the most interesting female characters in modern fiction. Strong without being Superwoman, very realistic and believable.

Highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best yet","review":"I tell stories to my wife at night. Usually they put her to sleep. Then I started telling her Lansdale stories. She couldn't get to sleep until I told her the whole story--or at least as far as I had read. Then I started to deplore my recitations, style of my origin not being of his genius. He lets us see just and only what he wants us to see or, rather, what the story needs us to see. Lansdale is the storyteller. A few other are, not many. Hamsun occurs to me as another. The storyteller has one mistress--the story. On this one, I had to read the whole thing to my wife, word for word. Until she could sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing Women Characters is not his strength.","review":"As a big fan of the Hap & Leonard novels, I found this novel to be a disappointment. It never really hooked me. I forced myself to read two thirds of this book but finally gave up because I just wasn't enjoying it, and forcing myself to read it just wasn't worth the time.The author seems to share what I believe to be a common characteristic of most authors; they lack the insight necessary to write believable characters when that character is the opposite sex. In other words, few male authors can write convincing female characters. Likewise, few female authors can write convincing male characters.I look forward to future Hap & Leonard novels, and I will probably try some of his other novels, but I really can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio CD Version","review":"Sunset and Sawdust is a great book.

But lately...I dunno, I don't finish his books with the same \\"what a great read\\" feeling I normally have. Captains Outrageous was just bad...it was Hap and Leonard...but it just seemed a chore to finish. With Sunset and Sawdust, the story starts great and then half way through (where we finally meet the real villains) it started to lose me, and by the end, I was kinda mad I started reading it. Anyway. that's just my opinion. If you felt the same way about Captains Outrageous, you might want to give this one a pass too."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's nothing sorrowful about it","review":"Truly a lovely cd. I bought it as a whim not knowing anything about the various artists listed. I must say, it was and continues to be one of my favorite cd's.

Not that Clash was bad, but God Candy has more of a diverse mixture of songs. I can't compare them to one certain artist or group, because there is a little of everything mixed in. My favorite songs on the album are \\"If I\\", which was written by Richard and features both Jonathan and Richard on vocals, \\"Bubble Town\\", which is also written by Richard, who does the lead vocals with Jonathan doing background, \\"Trip If You Have To\\", \\"Only When the Rain Slips In\\", \\"Denied\\", and \\"God Candy\\". I prefer the slower tracks, though the upbeat ones are really good too. \\"Coffee and Tea\\" is not my \\"cup of tea\\", so to say, and neither is \\"Show and Tell\\", but if you enjoy hard rock and strange lyrics, you will enjoy these. I have to agree that if Jonathan ever gets tired of acting, he definitely could fall back on singing. Richard, too. This is all-in-all one great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good backgrounder","review":"If you're looking for a good backgrounder in dub, then this is a pretty good place to start. There are a lot of traditional names here, providing any person new to the music with a solid foundation for future listening.The only problem I have is that even though Mick Hucknall is a really into dub and cites King Tubby as worthy of a statue next to Bob Marley, there should have been a little more variety to the cd. There is a lot of King Tubby here and some of his proteges, like Jammy, so you kind of get stuck in one style when a CD like this is supposed to cover a lot of bases.Anyway, a good listen and with 19 tracks, worth the cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent compilation","review":"This is, perhaps, my favorite Blood and Fire selection. Pretty much every single track has something going for it. Great mellow dub sound. Nice versions of many classic dub licks.

Every song comprises a bad tune, a weedy voice and a cheap \\"beep beep bop bop\\" from a synthesiser. From start to finish this work sounds as though it was made by two teenagers goofing off in their bedroom one afternoon. I read somewhere once that Tony Mansfield (the brain behind New Musik) considered \\"Warp\\" to be the weakest of the group's records and he's certainly right there, as long as you substitute the words \\"most abysmal\\" for \\"weakest\\".

Check out the Spellman family tree for an example of what I mean.The only thing that really made this book go down for me was the ending. It seemed to me that her truth sprinkles revealed one thing to Sabrina in the middle of the book, and helped her do something almost completely opposite in the end of the bok.

Unfortunately the songwriting of Self mainman Matt Mahaffey is still too cute by half, with each song pinballing between too many ideas like case studies in the debilitating effects of Attention Deficit Disorder. Only \\"Trunk Fulla Amps\\" comes close to being a fully realized song, and all the slick studio trickery eventually undercuts the impact of the toy instrument conceit.

I can understand them trying to portray the life of some boxer, but the scene was unnecessary.I really do think that there should be a distinction between christian movies and secular movies, and not just us praying and calling out the name of Jesus in a movie.(with all do respect)It had a good plot, but that's it.Carmen is a strong figure to a lot of people and I don't think that he represented himself that way in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLEASE","review":"Why did the people behind this flick compare there fight scenes with the likes of raging bull ?

Her voice reaches into my soul and jerks my heart open - pure talent at it's finest. She shows just how rock should sound with \\"Take Me Down\\", a rock song to the Nth degree. \\"Take Me...\\" spares no mercy with musicianship or her fabulous vocal ability. Some sing from the throat, some the diaphram... Ms. White's voice rips free from a tiger that pounces and rips the listener with rasp, raw, and power. A beat that makes me wanna shake, oh yeah!

The account is drawn primarily from Japanese sources and thus provides a full view of the chaos of battle from that perspective. The Soviet side is made to seem perhaps too orderly and well controlled by the very lack of detailed information. The strength of the Soviet command, particularly Marshall Zhukov, is also somewhat glossed over. These are, however, minor objections to what is an excellently organized presentation of a very complex set of events.Why should anyone care? The aims and methods of the Kwantung Army are extensively documented, a matter of major importance for any study of China. The policies of both the Guomindang and the Gongchandang are much easier to understand after reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exhaustive, but hamstrung due to lack of Soviet resources.","review":"This book is the authoritative work on the Nomonhan, or Khalkin-Gol battles of 1939. The book is well-written, with excellent battlefield maps. Coox was a Japanese scholar, so it is not surprising that his material leans heavily on Japanese sources. This is a problem in the sense that at the time of publication, there was very little material available from the Soviet side of the conflict, other than Marshal Zhukov's memoirs and a few other similiarly suspect works.However, if you are interested in this little-known but extremely important series of border engagements (the Japanese defeat here strengthened the Navy's 'go south' policy, with disasterous consequences for the European colonial powers) then there is no better reference work than Coox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best as ever","review":"This series of books may not be as good as the Tallchief series but they still possess the same arrogant males and sassy females.

Overall, since it is official Dogg Pound made music (other than a lot of the beats), it is still a good CD. The only flaw is if you own a lot of Dogg Pound related music (Daz Dillinger, Soopafly CD's) you will hear some recycled tracks that are on other CD's. 5-6 tracks are on other albums, but other than that, it is worth the money and a good majority of the tracks are bangin'.

Dogg Food is hailed as a West coast classic and in my opinion isnt even that great, and this is much better but almost no one knows about. Possibly because it's unreleased tracks from the Dogg Food sessions that \\"Tha Row\\" just released, but whatever the reason, this is a quality cd from Daz and Kurupt. The production is on point during most tracks, and Kurupt and Daz come with the smooth flow and lyrics. The \\"Change The Game remix\\" is great, and \\"Just Doggin'\\" is a classic track that reminds me alot of just how great of a label Death Row used to be. Unfortunately, since those Days on Death Row, Daz and Kurupt's efforts have been progressively getting worse (aside from Kurupt's latest album Space Boogie: Smoke Oddessey which is also a quality album). Hopefully Daz and Kurupt will team up again and produce an album of equal quality (their newest effort D.P.G. sure doesn't cut it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Instant West Coast Classic","review":"Dogg Pound 2002 is a great Westcoast CD, with dope beats, and great rapping from Daz and Kurupt.

The only bad thing is that the CD contains songs from the recently released DPG CD, like Crip Wit Us, the exact same song as Dipp Wit Me but they use different words in the chorus and Living the Gangsta Life, the exact same as We Livin Gangsta Like, fromt the DPG CD.

It's just so sad to see your favorite rappers go down that long hall of \\"MAINSTREAM\\" music. Tha Dogg Pound has just made one too many dollars and their hearts were not in this album, their money was. This album is their money speaking, not Kurupt and Daz. Every song on this album sounds the same, and that same sound is just not \\"Dogg Food material\\".

The film starts with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and ends with the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in the same order in which they happened during the war. This film uses actual footage taken during battle sequences.I would not recommend this movie as an objective look into the war, after all the government only says what they want the public to know in this fim.

Normally I'm not into female vocalists, with the exception of Annie Haslam and Sonja Kristina, but Toyah Wilcox (Mrs. Fripp) is great in the context of this band. Fripp's playing is much in the vein of his 80's Crimson work on this release. Stick bassist Trey Gunn, later of the 90's Crimson, makes his entrance here;however he's not as impressive a player as Tony Levin.

The books were always so fun to read. This story, however, I really didn't like. It wasn't very intriguing, and it feels like there are several other books in the series that are too similar. In this story, Ginny Lu Culpepper comes from the Appalatians to Sweet Valley. Her different ways lead to her being harrasssed by the popular girls and feeling left out. I didn't like how the popular girls treated Ginny Lu, and I really didn't like Ginny Lu's character.

If you are a real Sabbath fan, you can find beauty in most of their releases, so if you are already into Sabbath, go ahead and get it. but if you are not, beware. This album is weak. thats about all I can say about it. Its amazing that this is the same band that released Sabotage the year before, which is one of their heaviest albums ever.

I have all the albums and have dabbled into their music in the darkest of corners and listened with open ears and mind time and time again. You know how it is when a song is great and it gives you \\"The Goosebumps/ Chills\\"??? Well there is hardly anything on this album that does it for me. Dirty Women is the best song and arrangement on the album. There are no \\"great\\" tracks besides that, and as hard as I try, I have no love for this record.

From the get go it fails to impress, lacking any of the mystique and power from previous classics. It really was a step back from the awesome Sabotage and miles away from Paranoid and Masters of Reality. There are a couple of decent songs, namely the ballads, \\"it's alright\\" and \\"she's gone\\". The other so called rock songs, \\"gypsy\\", \\"backstreet kids\\" and \\"rock'n'roll doctor\\"are boring, contrived and contain recycled sabbath riffs. ozzy has never sounded so lack lustre.

If only the rest of the album were as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A case of a rock band going on a little too long","review":"Black Sabbath's seventh album (1976) was full of new musical direction, but the results were dreadful. The turmoil within Sabbath didn't help matters either and the lyrics are especially difficult to take. They were beginning to fall apart and is definitely in evidence here. Even when Deep Purple were under such strain they could still deliver a really good album like \\"Who Do We Think We Are.\\" Overall, there is no doubt this marks the weakest of Ozzy's run with Sabbath.Creedence Clearwater Revival had their Mardi Gras and Black Sabbath had their Technical Ecstasy.Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's unfortunate, but it foreshadows Never Say Die too well","review":"Sadly, 1976 was an unkind year for Black Sabbath. The rift between traditionalist Ozzy Osbourne and the more experimental Tony Iommi had begun to overshadow the band's efforts in the studio, and Technical Ecstacy shows that internal strife was unraveling the Sabbath weave.This album is nearly as uneven as it gets--songs such as \\"You Won't Change Me\\" and \\"All Moving Parts Stand Still\\" are sandwiched around bombs like \\"Gypsy\\" and \\"It's Alright,\\" which was, ironically, sung rather well by drummer Bill Ward. Too keep it short, Technical Ecstacy was the death knell for Ozzy-era Sabbath. The follow-up, Never Say Die, ended up being the funeral march."},{"rating":"1","title":"The weakest Black Sabbath/Ozzy album","review":"I think it's quite a fact that this album was by far the weakest album of Black Sabbath with Ozzy.

This is, without a doubt, Black Sabbath at its all-time worst. It's hard to believe that Technical Ecstasy came out only a year after Sabotage, the band's all-time best studio performance.

After all the fun and creative energy of the first great albums of heavy metal, where do we go from here? Back to days spent rocking in the backstreets? Cooked out radio attemps? Imagine conquering the world, attaining great knowledge, drinking wine with the Gods, joining the Greeks in Battle with the Trojans, meditating the Buddah's, exploring the Amazon Jungle, and dancing in the great volcanos of our time...and then walking back down home street and caroling to neighbors?

Sorry guys, nice try but you should really use a different name and not try to ride on SB's famous name. The first 4 songs are simply crap with so-so rythm and bad vocals. #5 is the first song that reminds a little of SB style and the entire album has exactly two songs that I liked - certainly much short of expectations.

With the departure of Neal Morse, the beard are no longer the undisputed kings of progressive rock; they're not even a progressive band any more. They tried. They really did, and you can tell, but its obvious that while the remaining members are quite talented and know how to play their instruments, they are unable to write a decent song between them. This music is a sad shadow of a once great band.If you've never heard the original Spock's Beard this disc will probably not bother you, but if you were a fan of their previous work it may scar you for life. If you need to have a fix of new Beard music, go and buy Neal's new disc 'Testimony', that is, if you can find it in yourself to ignore the obnoxiously christian lyrics.The Beard is dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spock is Rock","review":"People tend to disapprove of this album because they are expecting another prog masterpiece from Neal Morse.Neal Morse isn't in the band anymore, and they have changed.This album is filled with tons of great rock tracks, with a slight touch of prog. Nick D'Virgilio did an awesome job at stepping up to the plate and fronting the band with his vocals. His deep voice is very soothing, and makes you wonder why it was never used on previous SB albums. Of the three new SB albums, I've listened to this one the most.PS- Get the special edition of this album. The song Moth of Many Flames, though a short acoustic track and sung by Alan Morse, is one of the most moving songs on the album. Definitely worth the extra buck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like \\"V\\" and \\"Snow\\"? You may not like this one.","review":"If you're like me, you really like (most of) \\"V\\" and \\"Snow\\", as well as Transatlantic (although you prefer SMPTe to B.A.F.), and you think about half of every Flower Kings album is brilliant (and the rest \\"okay\\").On the same page? Ok. Good.I can't recommend this album. Wanted to like it. Can't. So much of it collapses into hard-rock cliches or limp ballads. The other 2-3 star reviews on this page are spot-on.These guys are cracker-jack musicians... no one's doubting that. And Nick D'Virgilio is a more than competent lead vocalist (as he demonstrated on \\"Snow\\").But the songwriting just isn't there. Not enough hummable moments...and I like humming Allan Holdsworth, so what does THAT tell you?That said, I'm curious to see what the next album brings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing, unfortunately...","review":"The clever arrangements and lush harmonies of Neal Morse aregone, and with the exception of \\"East of Eden, West of Memphis\\"which manages to raise the rating to two stars I must sayI wish they had waited a bit longer to put out a new record, and tried to focus more on the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the old Spock's Beard we have come to know and love","review":"I can understand this band being at the crossroads and wanting to redefine their sound now that Neal Morse has left the group, but the remaining members went out of their way to sound nothing at all like the old Spock's Beard. For potential new fans who hate progressive music, this is probably good news, as this one has the potential of selling a gazillion copies. For us old progressive fans, well, this one is almost unbearable. (The Inside Out sampler included in this Limited Edition is much better than the main CD!!!). I don't see how they can still call themselves a progressive band, and I am sure they would rather drop that description, much in the way Genesis did when Phil Collins took over. Good luck to the remaining members, and don't let the riches spoil you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spock Really Did Die In Wrath Of Khan","review":"Neal Morse leaving Spock's Beard brought some sense of trepidation, but I was willing to give this \\"Neal-less\\" version of the Beard a chance. Man, was I mistaken! The fall of a great American prog-rock band could not have been faster! I'm not sure if this new Beard wants to be a lite version of Dream Theater (which could of been a good thing) or a more commercial rock band. And, this free fall happened from one album (V) to the next one. At least Genesis waited for the THIRD albumn of the post-Gabriel era to make the turn to the dark side.An appeal to Neal -- Spock returned after the Wrath Of Khan, perhaps you can find your way back to your creation and set the ship right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Try","review":"I am a huge fan of Nick and his work, but this just isn't a \\"Spock's Beard\\" cd.

The band simply tries too hard to make up for Neal's departure. It's overproduced, overplayed and, well, just plain over. I will give SB one more chance (meaning I'll buy their next CD) and will make up my mind then. Until then, I'll play \\"Snow\\", and all the other SB titles and keep this one in the drawer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll make this easy for you","review":"I have one thing to say about this CD : \\"NEAL MORSE, PLEASE COME BACK!!!!!\\"I am trying my hardest to get in to this CD, so far it is not working.

Don't get me wrong, I love Spock's Beard - maybe if you are a total hardcore Beard fan, you'll like this - some songs are \\"OK\\"....but you'll have to admit where the REAL talent went.As for me, I'm still listening - still trying to like it...hopefully the Beard will prove me wrong on their next outing...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spock's Beard is Dead to me.","review":"This CD is a mish-mash of directionless [material]. Forget melody, forget harmony, forget color, forget counterpoint, forget the space that Neal Morse's writing provided to each instrumental and vocal line... it's all gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sonic Manifesto","review":"Feel Eurphoria is yet another fine release from this very talented band. Listeners are treated to a sonic manifesto--from the impeccible drumming and vocal work of Nick D'Virgilio to the Wakeman-esque keys of Rye Okumoto and the heat-seeking guitar work of journeyman Alan Morse with solid backing by bassist Dave Meros. Neal Morse has moved on, but SB fans will not be disappointed at the playing and energy on Feel Eurphoria. Every track on this record stands on its own, and one can only be awed by the level of musicianship on each track. In my view, Feel Eurphoria can only be fully appreciated upon repeated listening. If Feel Europhia has a highlight, it's \\"Carry On.\\" There's something very special about this track, and it's fitting that the record ends with a golden touch. One can only wonder just how dynamic the next Spock's Beard record is going to sound given the precedent set on Feel Eurphoria. This record gets my highest rating. Five stars. Rock on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album blows chunks!!","review":"After being a being a fan of a couple previous Spock's Beard releases, I had some hopes of this one being their best. WRONG!Not only isn't this album their best but it's one of the lamest albums I've ever heard! Prog or not! I'd rather listen to Shakira or Britney Spears and imagine them shaking their booty than listen to this weak rubbish. Obviously when Neal left the band he took the talent with him. Neal's bible thumping will leave many cold/ashamed/or irriated but at least he can write a good tune. Too bad the new Spock's Beard can't. Don't buy this crappola, I'm sorry I did. I think I'll sell it for a dollar and rent a cheap video. Anything is better than sitting through this wasted, weak attempt at \\"progressive\\" music. The band better get day jobs soon cause this album it a total clunker. Don't say I didn't warn you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute S**t!","review":"This may be by far the worst album I've ever heard. I had heard of the band somewhere in reference to Porcupine Tree and remembered the name when I saw this cd in a record store. Always looking for something new, I made the gross mistake of buying it. The songs are comprised of New Age music, reminiscent of Yanni and John Tesh, combined with horrible lyrics, reminiscent of bad 80's power ballads (\\"I Dream you're not very far/Cause your my shining star/Shine your light on me\\"; \\"Carry on/When your whole world comes apart/There's a place for you to start/When the current drags you down/There's a way up to be found\\"). Not one song is listenable all the way through. Listening to it, I felt embarassed for the band. As I believe in giving credit where credit is due, however, I must say that the artwork on the cd case is great. If only there were a decent cd inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as you expect","review":"The grachis on this game isn't no PS2, but it wasn't very fun either. The game wasn't in complete 3D like the movie was, it just had some parts that was it, I suggest passing on it even if your a big Spy Kids fan.

I was a bit skeptical about ordering the battery through Amazon (because it was at least $50 cheaper on Amazon than any other website).

There is a sensational quality to her writing, particularly in her depiction of child and young adult addiction. She heralds her Odyssey House as a panacea for all \\"her\\" downtrodden children. In fact, after reading this book, I got the feeling that these children are nothing more to her than a means to her own financial end. She would be better off in private practice employing her Freudian training as a psychiatrist i.e. listening and not speaking...Certainly, she should not be writing.

Both mothers love them, and have asked where I purchased them so they can buy another one & friends want to buy them also. Two nice safety features are: (1) the lid closes slowly so you don't have to worry about it dropping on the children and (2) there are slots and airholes in the box so that even if the child hides in the box, you do not have to worry about suffocation. The Lipper toy chests are very well built and I would definitely recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, large, and kid safeish","review":"I love the easy on the closing hinges.

It is nice looking, and good enough quality for the money. It has the no-slam lid to prevent little fingers from getting crushed, and air holes on the back side for any children who might decide to climb in and close the lid. My husband said it was easy to assemble, except that the pre-drilled holes for attaching the lid were off line ever so slightly, so the lid is not perfectly square on the toy chest when it is closed. It still closes just fine, and functions for what we need. You have to look pretty closely to see that the lid is not perfectly square on the chest. It's also sturdy enough to use as a bench seat. The frame is made of actual hard wood, but the front, back, and side panels are not real wood. Our son hasn't destructed it yet, and as long as he doesn't kick in the front or sides when he's older, I think it will last just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"lipper toy chest no good","review":"Dont buy this item unless you want a bunch of pieces of broken wood in a box!!

Much to my disappointment, the entire toy was filled with loud cellophane, rather than just a panel or two. Rolling up against any part of the toy would wake my daughter up. We thought the musical feature was unnecessary, had crappy music, and was difficult for the baby to find anyway--and just made another loud noise. The critters on the colored side are also poorly sewn and poorly adhered to the bumper.

Shot in Germany for the very popular TV programme \\"Ohne Filter\\" in July of 1994, most songs are from the album Candyman, which basically was more of a group effort (Los Lobotomys) and so you'll get some amazing playing. Unfortunately, this is not the complete performance. Original TV station SWR erased the entire material, and therefore this DVD misses 2 songs from the complete set. What you get is the edited TV version. Well, better then nothing I would say.

I have had the privilege of seeing them in concert a few times while in L.A. and to be able to pop this DVD in whenever I want and relive the experience is priceless. The production quality is less than stellar, but it's tolerable. If I had one wish, it would have been for a longer performance, but hey, I'll take what I can get.

The only reason I would not give it five stars is that in many scenes, the dialog cannot be heard. I find myself pumping up the volume to \\"jet engine blast\\" levels while people are talking, only to have to grab the remote and quickly turn it down again when a sudden burst of music threatens to break the glass in the windows. The compromise has been to use the subtitles, which at least let me find out what is being talked about. You would think that the sound engineer, particularly in a film which relies heavily on slang terms and offhand remarks, would have been extremely careful about making sure the dialog was audible. But if you don't mind reading your way through the film, or you have the sensitive hearing of the average canine (and a strong familiarity with 1920's slang expressions) then you'll find the rest of the film top notch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raucous and self-indulgent","review":"Probably meant to be humorous, this attempt to re-capture Damon Runyon fails on all counts.

Though I had anticipated it for months and waited with impatience for its release, I now find I was impatient for mediocrity. The performances are disappointing, with only Richard Chamberlain as Octavious showing any passion in his performance. Indeed, Jason Robards as Brutus illustrated the poorest Shakespearean acting I've yet seen, and it's an embarassment for anyone attempting to light a fire for Shakespeare in teenagers. Robards speaks his lines as if he is reading them for the first time on his couch at home.Until Hollywood gives this another try, I recommend the BBC version of the play available with English subtitles from Ambrose Video. Of course, there is always the Brando version of the play with James Mason doing a much more credible job than Robards as Brutus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously someone made a home video of the the video","review":"The movie itself is fine. I think Charlten Heston is a fine actor. However, the quality of the film was \\"abysmal\\" I got ripped for 12.99 plus shipping and handling so that I could show my classes a piece of fine literary material that looked like someone had filmed the film on their video camera.

Even though the 1970 version is in color with better production quality, the black and white 1953 Marlon Brando version with antiquated scenery is a better movie. The 1953 version also had much better casting. This includes the roles of Mark Antony, Brutus, and Cassius. The only actor in the 1970 version that was better than the 1953 version was Sir John Gielgud's Caesar. Ironically, John Gielgud played Cassius in the 1953 version and Caesar in the 1970 version. He was superb in both roles. I was disappointed with Lewis Calhern's Caesar in the 1953 version. The 1953 version of Julius Caesar was superior in almost every way that matters.There is a reason the Brando version costs $13.99 and the Heston version costs $8.99. If you have to choose between the two, buy the $13.99 version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not High School Friendly","review":"this was not the movies that I had expected for my high school class, I had to order a more \\"teen-friendly\\" version.

Jason Robards, I never thought of him as that bad of an actor until I saw this. It was like they tried to mix some actors with good shakespear experience with some big names, and the big names really faultered.

And it's not really in a good homage sort of way. Young's vocals are lacking, he doesn't have much range in his voice. Musically the song is far overproduced--could have seriously done without the car/motorcycle sounds. And then the lyrics...maybe I'm used to deep lyrcists like Bono, Pat Monohan, Rob Thomas (the list goes on), but this song seemed rather inane. If Young wants to be a serious artist he needs to find a new group of songwriters and producers. Otherwise he's always going to sound one step away from an average boyband. However, he'll probably sell a bunch of alumbs/singles because the MTV TRL crowd will eat him up!

Since the fans aren't running, the compartment (and wine) warm up. To get rid of the ice you have to unplug the unit, which causes all of the wines to warm up. Thus some of the wines we've wanted to save have both 1) gotten too warm; and 2) been through several temperature cycles.The cooling unit for the lower compartment has now completely given up. The fans seem to work but with a temperature set point of 58 deg F it isn't keeping the temperature below room temperature.Haier's only troubleshooting advice is to make sure the fridge is level and that the door is well-sealed.

Real leaders are narcissists; they have an inner drive to influence others and they like power. Now, narcissism can manifest itself into positive or negative leadership, as Maccoby explains.Successful leaders are not warm and fuzzy types; they succeed because they can take tough decisions on difficult matters, oftentimes ignoring or not listening to others. They are mission driven and will do what's necessary to get the goal done. This book flies in the face of Daniel Goleman and others who have jumped on the emotional intelligence bandwagon (claiming that the stuff of leadership is empathy and emotional intelligence). According to Maccoby this stuff is \\"wishful thinking\\" and not what great leadership is made of (e.g., Bill Gates is the prototype narcissist with an EQ of zero)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changing the world personality","review":"Maccoby used his personal and professional experience as consultant for different corporations and settings in changing the view of narcissistic leader from negative to more positive one. He emphasized the importance of the role of the personality in the workplace. The book focuses on personality types, their weaknesses, and their strengths, and how to understand those types in the work settings. Maccoby asserted that the productive narcissist has many positive characteristics that enable them to improve the quality of the work. Also, he emphasized that strategic intelligence has a major role in the success of productive narcissist.

He is a subtle genius with perfectly-timed sarcasm.This film isn't fast-paced, obvious, or sexy: It is thoroughly entertaining, witty, and universal.

Albert Brooks is good too, in all capacities--acting, directing, and especially writing. You will laugh and smile and nod with recognition during many scenes. A worthwhile addition to any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mommy Problems","review":"This Albert Brooks film is an interesting little movie. Once you think you get a funny comedy, it turns and has some serious and dramatic moments. It's an intriguing movie. Brooks stars as a science fiction writer who moves back in with his mom, played superbly by Debbie Reynolds, to help him understand his problem with women. What happens is an interesting premise where mom and son reveal secrets and feelings. Sometimes funny, okay, hysterically funny, and often tender and serious, this is one great achievement for Albert Brooks, who also wrote the film. It's also a great moment for Debbie Reynolds. This is the greatest thing to of happened in her career. Rob Morrow o-stars as the younger brother who can't seem to grip the whole odd situation. Lisa Kudrow has a very brief role as a bad date Albert goes on. This is one incredibly crafted movie with a great, intelligently written script. Check this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"All too familiar","review":"This movie hits home with it's depiction of mothers and their children.

You have to use the 2 cup pod holder for this pod as it has the coffee on top and in the lower half of the pod is the creamer in a small 'basket' I like to add a tsp of fat free sweetened condensed milk along with a splash of 1% milk to my coffee and if I'm in the mood I will add a caramel filled hersheys kiss as a treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where 's the taste????","review":"If you give more than two stars you have mislead consumers.

A full cup with one pod is water downed and pretty tasteless. Yes, people have commented that one pod should only really make the half cup. But the dark and med. roast for me makes a full cup. I don't like things that strong. Paying as much as you are I expect to have a full cup from one pod. You can take a normal med. roast pod, make a half cup and fill the rest with your own skim milk, sugar and vanilla creamer and it tastes better. This is less pods then the dark or med. roast for the same price.

However, this one is a let down. Firstly, a ten count package only makes 5 reasonable sized cups of Cappuccino so not good on the value for money side.

I remember the first time I had coffee from my Senseo, something in my brain was disappointed because, with all the nice foam on top, my subconscious thought it should be creamy coffee. I saw this product and thought ah, at last, creamy coffee from my Senseo!So I bought it, and made it, and it tasted like...coffee with creamer in it. Yes, the foam lasts a bit longer than regular Senseo foam, and yes, the foam is creamier. But really, the coffee doesn't taste any different than coffee that I've put my own creamer in.When you consider that these pods cost almost twice as much as the regular pods (since you get 10 per package, instead of 18), that's some mighty expensive creamer, too.Save your money and add your own creamer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cappuccino coffee pods","review":"These were just awful. The cream part was caked and didn't dissolve no matter how you tried to get it to do so. It must either have some added ingredient to make it cake or it was just on the shelf too long.

What a waste!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!","review":"This stuff is disgusting! Unfortunately,now I have almost 4 packs of it left and I don't know what to do with it. It doesn't even taste like coffee let alone cappuccino and you really only get about a quarter of a cup of cappuccino out of each pod. Don't waste your money on this, rather make your own.

I wish two would fit in the Senseo machine though, for a larger cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good!","review":"I have tried almost all of the Senseo flavors now, and I have to say that the Cappuccino may be the worst. The flavor is very bitter. Not that I would expect an actual cappuccino to come out of my Senseo machine, but I thought it would at least taste okay. It does have a nice, smooth texture, but I just can't enjoy the taste. Also, the pods tend to leave behind a little mess with some of the cream that leaks out and they leave a lot more water in the holder than normal pods do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad Product...Ugh","review":"Horrid, bitter, watery waste of money. I have tried these 5 times now. I am stuck with a quantity and just keep hoping it will somehow get better. No. I am reminded each time how bad it was the time before. There just is no body at all!

However, for a quickie at home, I find these pods to be more than adequate. The taste is so pleasant and close enough to the real thing that I'll purchase them regularly in the future.

Despite following the package instuctions to use the two-cup pod holder and selecting the 1-cup brew button, the cup is very weak with a rancid bitter taste (even after adding a teaspon of sugar).

I can usually read a book in a day, two at the most, if it is good and I have the time. This one is a hard to follow, very boring story. The characters are more a brother & sister than two people trying to start a relationship. No \\"sparks\\" what so ever. I could really care less if they get together or not.

I don't read book jackets but the cover told me that Iris Johansen \\"Takes you to the edge of suspense.\\"Unfortunately, the book looked over the edge, got scared, and ran like hell. The suspense was barely perceptible, the characters drawn from the stock-footage locker, and the plot had about as much momentum as bowling on a sandy beach.It's clear that Ms. Johansen knows how to write - she just didn't put herself out on this effort. The book should give you about as much excitement as reading this review does. Unless you're a fan of pure drivel. Then you should you love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deja Vu?????? Wake up Johansen!!","review":"I have always enjoyed Johansen's books but they are gettingpretty predictable with the female protagonist and the male protagonist at odds with each other, building into anobsession and her finally succumbing to his charms. Its the same story with her other female protagonists as well. Other than a little different type of killer, these stories are as redundant as a Victoria Holt gothic novel and I gave those up many years ago for the same reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Worth Reading if Your Stuck on an Airplane","review":"I've read rave reviews for Iris Johansen, but decided to try a 'single book' as opposed to her serials. Boy did I get a wrong number. It's like she wrote this book on a weekend after seeing the old \\"Firestarter\\" movie with Drew Barrymore. (By the way it's not as good and even more hokie.) This book reads like a blah movie on \\"Lifetime\\" network.The whole \\"psychic\\" stick is so badly done that they wouldn't use it on \\"The Ghost Whisperer\\". The characters are so two dimensional as to be non- existent. At the end I was rooting for the bad guy, hoping he'd set everyone on fire and put them all out of their misery. I found the most 'human' of all the characters to be the dog, Sam.I will assume that her mysteries are much better than this and that she was just going through a bad period when she wrote this one. The best she could do is to get all the copies of this novel and then have the biggest bonfire and roast some marshmallows."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Johansen Reader","review":"This was the second Johansen book that I read. I picked up Firestorm on CD to listen to during a long drive and instantly, I was hooked. The characters were memorable and the dynamic between them was incredible. I admit that this a little bit of a \\"chick\\" book (the fairy-tale ending is a perfect example of this) but I was holding my breath towards the end. Since then, I've read some of her others, but this is one of the best ones she's written. Bernadette Dunn did a great reading of it, which only helped me get really involved with the story. I hope that she writes another one with Kerry and Brad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A soap opera of mystical tomfoolery","review":"This book is in the running for worst I've ever read. It's about 90% dialogue, and any textual description is so dense and turgid that it's nearly unreadable. Every cliche known to humanity is showcased here.

I would not recommend this to anyone I liked or esteemed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader in CD Version Bad","review":"Kate Burton reading of Firestorm, was without feeling and bland. Don't bother getting the Audio version, the book is so much better.

It just carries rhetorical dialogue between the two main characters & never really develops the main story well. The bickering between Kerry & Silver becomes boring drivel & is endless. The Firestorm, & how it's carried off, remains mostly a mystery hidden away. There's a devious North Korean who remains faceless and is never developed. The author tries to save it with a twist toward the end, but by that time you're so bored it's anti-climatic and I didn't care. The best thing about the book is it's cover. Bottom line? Save your money, unless you have trouble sleeping, that is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio - Such a disappointment","review":"I absolutely love Iris Johansen's books! I listened to this book on audio, and I don't know if it was the reader (who I didn't like at all) or the book itself but Carrie seemed like such a sniveling individual. Her interaction with Silver involved the same \\"stay away from me\\" statement in about every conversation throughout the book. Their interaction is quite repetitive and annoying.

From the other reviews I imagine that the book is a great book - just stay away from the AUDIO version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have enjoyed Iris Johansen's books in the past but this one was totally second-rate.

The plot is interesting which is why I stayed with the book but her characters never came to life for me at all. They weren't even vivid enough for me to see why they would fall in love with each other. When I closed the book I felt like I had indeed been looking at them through smoke.

Being that at one time of my life I was homeless on the streets of Washington DC I know how bad it can be. I can only imaging how it is in NYC.This movie has GREAT acting from Glover and Dillon. Proves that Dillon is more then just a \\"Pretty\\" face. To see his great acting in the movie Crash I smile to myself thinking \\"If you think Crash was good then you have to see The Saint\\"Not many movies these days can make you appreciate acting without the special effects and yet still have a compelling story line.The only one downfall is that they never put it on DVD. I wish that it was on DVD so I could share this gem with all my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, funny, and still funnier!","review":"This book was just ridiculously funny! This was the first book I'd read by the author and she immediately had me hooked! Tory and her friends are a riot but that Tory, (desperate, shameless thang)was a gas! LOL. The message was clear: that much desperation ain't pretty on nobody! But it was fun taking the ride with Tory. I'm glad she finally got the message and wised up.

My only negative comment is regarding its size. My son is 14 months old, with an average size, and the costume fit him exactly; if he was a bit bigger I might have a problem fitting him into it. Also, the headband that comes with the costume was too small (but this can be adjusted with a little work). So I doubt it would fit an 18-month old. Other than that the costume was great, and received many compliments :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloomfield steals the show!","review":"Back in the vinyl days when this recording was split into two sides (Kooper Bloomfield side 1, Stills Kooper side 2), I played side 2 a lot. Kooper did a fine job covering both Dylan and Donovan. But now, I can't get enough of side 1. Bloomfield's playing on Super Session is some of the finest I've ever heard, bar none. It may take awhile to get into it, but it's well worth the investment. No rock music collection should be complete without this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic Jam Session","review":"I first bought this album when I was about 17, I'm now 52 and I love it now as much as I did then.

I guess if you are an Al Kooper fan, there is some merit, although, the Kooper kuts here were done better and more dramatically with BS&T. Bloomfield never impressed me much, so he has that NY Long Island playing style that worked in the Catskills, but came off as less than convincing outside that circuit. Stills? Please. What was the first side of this record was made stronger by virtue of the fact that Stills turned in a workmanlike effort. Sure, played hard, not much to show for it. I do suspect that this effort was the nascent arrival of an insufferable ego that would only undermine him as time wore on.Give credit to the remastering crew, though. You can hear pristinely how overwrought every note on this disc is. The 2002 remixes are a waste on top of something as thoroughly unnecessary as anything I've ever heard. Caveat emptor (that's let the buyer beware for all of you from LI)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some damn fine stuff here","review":"There's more than enough great playing here to make this disk well worth the price of purchase. Albert's Shuffle & Stop get things off to a tremendous start. His Holy Modal Majesty (what the hell did that mean?) is a wonderful jam, it must have influenced Duane Allman who was just coming into his own around this same time.The Stills stuff is not quite as strong as the Bloomfield stuff. It Takes a Lot to Laugh..., a Dylan cover, is pretty good. Season of the Witch is totally re-imagined from the Donovan original. Still haven't decided what I think of it. You Don't Love Me sounds really dated, in my opinion. Man's Temptation & Harvey's Tune are not strong.Alas, the version I had doesn't include the 4 bonus tracks. I might have enjoyed hearing Albert's Shuffle & Train w/o the horns, which definitely feel like they were plunked down rudely on top of the rest of the mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"About a lousy copy of the fine perfomance","review":"I have listened before this outstanding perfomance and decided to order in lp, we keep it from around 2 months without playing from the moment we bought this one and amazing when we played for the first time this unit came completely destroyed unlistened, the records does no have any major scratch but all surfaces seem to be treathed with some kind.

I could skip most of the Stills stuff on this record as well as any of the songs with vocals. But the blues guitar and keyboard songs from this album are classic. I particularly like the new remixes they added without the horns. The horns always sounded overdubbed and canned to me in the original recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Session","review":"Super SessionThe Album, \\"Super Session\\" shipped promptly, and came to me exactly as described.

Her loud whiny nasal tone really got under my skin. I did not laugh once throughout the entire video.None of what she said is original. There is nothing surprising about the fact 75% of peoples conversations tend to be negative and what you say and act like affects how effectively you can deal with stress. If you walk around the place complaining and sighing, chances are stress will get the best of you. The way you see yourself is often the same way others will see you.

Yes, it might be irritatiting to some who expect th eold Bruford of YES and UK or solo fame. But as the band's name suggests and is pointed out in the linernotes, Earthworks are new, groundbreaking and meant to confound people from time to time. This is unlike anyhting Bruford did previous. A definite addition to anyone's collection, even a non-jazz person such as myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slick and disappointing","review":"First, let me wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewers here who praise Bruford's musicianship; he is one of the greatest drummers who has ever played, regardless of what genre you're talking about. However, having said that, this record was very disappointing to me. It is way overly slick and overly produced and sounds more like a Spyro Gyra or Kenny G record than real jazz. If you like slick, shiny synthesized perfection with very little excitement or vibe, this disc is for you. For me it was a big letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This was just what I was looking for.

These characteristics are given the generic term of \\"parameters\\". The author describes these parameters in an excruciatingly slow process. One of them, for example, is whether a tensed sentence requires a subject or not. Far from developing a \\"periodic chart of languages\\",it is more like playing a game of twenty questions. If this book describes the latest development of linguistics, then the field has devolved into trivialities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid","review":"The sound engineering on this CD is variable. Quartets 1 and 16 were recorded in 1933, and sound almost as good as a modern recording. No. 11 was recorded a year earlier, and there the sound is somewhat muffled, but still enjoyable. Surface noise from the 78s is at a minimum throughout. As performances, these may be the best ever. No. 1 receives a reading full of classical poise and elegance. There is no underestimating how beautiful the Busch Quartet sounds. No. 11 features much contrast of light and shade. As for Beethoven's last quartet, it receives a deeply spiritual performance. The slow movement is almost effortlessly soulful and poised, while the last, Muss es Sein, movement proceeds at a tempo that just sounds perfect. This is quartet playing of rare distinction."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I was very disappointed with this game. The graphics do not hold up to the standards set forth by other baseball games, the gameplay is boring and the manegerial roles are very simplistic and unexciting. In the actual game play it is difficult to do more than flyout while hitting or hit the occasional homerun. The announcers are very boring and have limited phrases and often get things wrong. All the games are extremely low scoring because you cannot get hits. The computer catches everything, so unless you are lucky enough to hit a homerun you will sit there in boredom the whole time. I would not recommend this game unless your idea of fun is sitting around for an hour while playing a game into extra innings flying out every time you bat and either winning or losing 1-0 with maybe two or three hits the entire game."},{"rating":"2","title":"A look inside his decision to live in a L'Arche community.","review":"This book is a moving, intimate glimpse of Nouwen's journey from living the independent, public life of university teaching to entering into community by living with a L'Arche community in Canada.

The information is broken down into different countries and influences. Unfortunately, all of the photographs are printed in black and white, frequently with poor contrast. The photos are helpful for explaining the text, but it would have been nice if someone had paid a little more attention to how they were printed.Something important to know about this book that I didn't, is that this book was written in 1955 (in Norway). The text is incredibly thorough, but when the author starts comparing the work to the work of 'today', he is referring to the 1950s. We all know that the 50's dont look like design today. This is a person who had not yet experienced many future design movements such as post-modernism.

I'm going to have to stop bragging about this flashlight to \\"everyone\\"! The things you want a flashlight to do: bright light; solid construction; reliability; good feel in your hands; long battery life. This flashlight has them all! The light from the LED is somewhat different than a regular bulb. Much brighter and whiter. Don't point the light into the eyes of a friendly human, but for some reason, the light does not seem to bother night time animals: cats; possums; raccoons; armadillos. Battery life is well above normal, and something odd to me was that one of the two batteries goes bad--sometimes with a negative voltage--while the other battery tests fine.If I lose this one, I'll buy another just like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great !!

Anytime I have a need to label something, particularly create a new folder for my important documents, invoices, etc., I just turn on the Brother P-touch QL-500 (and my computer of course),type a label using all types of fonts and styles, and presto -- out prints my label.

I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware if you have a VISTA operating system","review":"This is probably a fine label machine for most computrs, but it wouldn't work with my new Vista operating system.Brother's customer service representative put forth great effort to do what was needed to make the driver function. After three phone sessions with Brother, the driver did work; sort of. Yes the label printer worked, but then my printer/copier wouldn't.I suppose that I fiddled with it for over an hour by myself, and then almost that long in company with a Brother Tech Support person. I must say that the Brother telephone support people were really great. They seemed to know what they were talking agout. They were patient and really tried to get the thing working properly.After I found that what had been done for the Brother machine messed up the operation of my Canon printer/copier I decided enough was enough, and the label printer is now landfill somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"The software will make you want to run away screaming!","review":"The printer, itself, is OK. The problem is the software that you need to use it. The P-Touch software is poorly written for anything but the most basic printing jobs. Then there are it's incompatability issues with Windows OS (as well as Mac, apparently...) I run Windows XP pro, and for some reason (automatic updates???), the P-touch software has stopped working in conjunction with MS Outlook (where my addresses reside). Brother support was also not helpful. Be prepared to invest time in learning this misbegotten software and then eventually hit a dead end and wonder why you ever thought that this device would make things easier!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nifty","review":"There's something to be said for a gadget that may not do much, but does what it does very well indeed. This is one of those gadgets. If, like me, you hate hand-labeling envelopes, the QL-500 is ideal. It makes highly-legible labels in a flash, and thanks to a simple label reel system, allows you to change label types in a jiffy. And, miracle of miracles, the software that comes with the QL-500 is actually good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Hardware, but there's better software for Mac users","review":"I am very happy with the printer. It is versatile and easy to use and load with either labels or coninuous tape. Unfortunately for us Mac users, many of the software features and add-ons only seem to work for Windows OS. But fear not - I've started using Mail Factory Home Edition, which does for Mac what the Brother software does for Windows - gives you total design control over your labels and works seamlessly with Mac OS X Address Book ! This software makes the Brother label maker a superb addition to your Mac OS X system! I did some price comparisons, too, and dollar for dollar, I don't think you can do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and easy to use","review":"As my auction sales increased with more packages to ship everyday I needed a way to avoid waiting in line at the Post Office to purchase postage and mail out my packages. This machine filled that need perfectly. I highly recomend the Brother QL-500."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Macintosh Friendly","review":"I have generally been quite satisfied with Brother products but I do not consider the QL-500 to be very Macintosh friendly, at least not for my intended use. I wanted it for personal use in printing address and shipping labels using my AddressBook. It is really designed to use in conjunction with it's own application, P-touch Editor.I experienced problems registering with Brother and used a chat session to do so. While I was there, I asked about what applications worked with the printer. He gave me a link which listed several PC applications and stated that Brother had nothing to do with them. Try this link for more info: [...]Within P-touch, there is an icon for connecting to the addressbook but it is not clear how to create a template to use it and even their site refers to typing the information in. Never does it address use with AddressBook.Look before you leap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, easy AND cheap!","review":"If you've been holding off getting a label-printer due to price, this is the printer for you. Not only has Brother lowered the price point on the printer itself (with rebates it often dips below $50), but Brother's standard address label refills are reasonably priced - about 3-cents each.Setup on Windows XP is simple, but the iconography in the quick-start instructions manual can be a little frustrating. The printed instructions for label printing are anemic; the on-line (PDF) manual is better. Printing simple address labels is sufficiently intuitive that it can be accomplished without ready the manual.Finally, this printer is fast! The first time I printed a label I thought the printer was just spinning the roll - turns out it was printing! The only downside I've found so far is that the printer's footprint is larger than some of the more expensive competitors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Choice for Ebay Shipping Labels","review":"I purchased this printer to print shipping labels for packages we ship out for our Ebay on line business. It works great with the ship feature in Paypal and has been trouble-free ever since I bought it.

I have also used this to print address labels (with the postnet codes as a feature of the excellent software which comes with this unit), CD labels and file folder labels.

I only use the label maker for home use (Holiday cards, etc.), so it was not overworked.I decided to go with the Brother after reading about other folks with similar issues with the Dymo. While the Brother is slightly larger than the Dymo, it prints much quicker and the software is so much more advanced than the Dymo. It was easy to install and the software hasn't caused any glitches with any other programs (the Dymo affected my MS Word). It comes with a broader variety of templates, clip art, and symbols than the Dymo as well.The main disadvantage for me is that the Dymo was compatible with the Palm OS. You could print directly from the Palm Desktop using a Dymo icon. However, for $25.00, I bought software that transferred all my Palm contacts into MS Outlook Contacts in about 5 seconds. With the savings on the Brother vs. the Dymo -- I am still way ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Brother P-Touch QL-500 Manual-cut PC label Printing System","review":"Brother P-Touch QL-500 Manual-Cut PC Label Printing SystemI purchased this simply because it was so inexpensive but have been very pleased with it.

While the literally enormous beauty of the wall paintings and drawings cannot be displayed in the book, that's not the point. The paintings and drawings themselves are temporary, to be whitewashed over when the exhibit 'moves' on.

The brown track is much sturdier and better made than the blue, but it took my handy dad and my super handy husband (who can fix ANYTHING) an hour to assemble them and as soon as my son barely touched the sheds, they collapsed. We hid them and I recently pulled them out to try again. As soon as I tried to put a 3rd piece on, the 1st 2 fell apart. It is impossible to put together. We don't have the room to store such a large, fully-assembled toy - assuming we could assemble it, without welding equipment! (yes I know it's plastic - it's THAT frustrating. The bridge is fun, but the blue sides pop out if you barely nudge the track. Also, the supports are not tall enough to run another loop of track under it. That is, until my handy hubby took a razor blade and made them stackable. HIT truly needs to redesign the sheds and send a free replacement to everyone who has bought this piece of junk.

My kids wanted the Train Shed so bad to go along with their Thomas set-up. The way in which this toy is constructed makes no sense what-so-ever. It sort of 'snaps' together, but if you touch it wrong, it completely falls apart. Eventhough my kids fall within the suggested ages for the toy, it is not constucted for their use. Even when my wife or I move it, the side wall comes unsnapped and sometimes falls apart. Compared to all of the other Thomas items we have purchased... this design of this isn't even close. I paid over $100 for a toy that if my kids move falls apart. Fun for the whole family! This product is a bad way to spend your money and what's worse, it's disapointing to the kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a really good playset","review":"My 3 year old son received this as a Christmas present. I was able to put it together in about 10 minutes. The shed is a bit daunting at first but I had no problem in putting it together and having it stay that way.

Nearly mpossible to get the shed together without it collapsing 35 times first. Please do not attempt to put this together with your child present.

I did read the reviews, but since my husband and father-in-law can build and put together anything(they have completely remodeled several houses) I didn't worry about assembly.Well, we also have had the difficulty that the others have expressed. The sheds are very difficult to assemble and they do collapse quite easily. I dread having to put it together whenever the train set comes out. It has become a joke at our house.It is so cute and we like it, but the the company needs to redesign it to be child friendly. We work hard for our money and it is frustrating to see it spent on such a poor product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The falling Shed","review":"My kid loves this track, he used to have the blue tracks and i liked that they where compatable ... christmas morning was a great one. I helped a 3 yr old to put the track together and the tricky part was the shed but we managed to do so.the shed is very fragile and wont stay put, the roof is made from about 7 pieces that are supposed to snap together, but they just wont. i have to build the shed at least twice a day, so i ended making a smaller shed with only three pieces, that makes the shed last longer, but if he moves the track its very likely that i will need to build the shed again. Its hard for an adult to build the shed, and imposible for a 3 yr old.Besides that, its a wonderful toy that my kid loves, he doesnt build a track, he builds long roads that strech the whole room, i like that he can combine his new and old tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointed","review":"We were really looking forward to giving the Tidmouth Shed to my son for Christmas. I thought he would really enjoy it. Once we opened the box and tried to put the shed together, we were disappointed. My husband and I have had a hard time trying to get all the pieces to stay together. It is awful. Once you get a few pieces in place, then another piece falls out. We are going to glue the shed together. We shouldn't have to though. I am going to write to the company and I hope others do, too. I hope the company redesigns it. I think it would be a great addition to the Trackmaster if made right.I do think that the remote contolled thomas is really cool, though. My son really enjoys contolling Thomas and watching his face change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't torture yourself","review":"Too bad I bought this for lots more money at the Day Out with Thomas show in November, under a little pressure from my 5.5 year old son... anyway, the thing is absolute torture to set up. Spend your days and evenings with your face on the floor trying to fit and keep all the little pins together, with the frustrated kid next to you. The slightest touch makes the whole thing collapse. Gluing it is a good idea except who has room to store a fragile plastic curved building that measures 24 x 9 inches. The turntable is nice, the bridge is great, but the sheds are so badly designed that it is a crime. At least it comes with two little track pieces that adapt to the old blue tracks, which we have thousands of."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Frustrating Than Fun","review":"My son is a huge Thomas fan so he was thrilled when his grandmother gave him this toy for his birthday. Unfortunately, it was difficult to assemble and the shed simply falls apart when he plays with it. The engine is fun in that it runs in reverse as well as forward, but the bridge and shed seem ridiculously flimsy to me. My son gets frustrated when it falls apart again and again. He can't fix it himself, so I don't see how it has any real educational value. The most disappointing thing is that this would be a really fun toy if it were not so poorly made."},{"rating":"1","title":"More delicate than a house of cards","review":"Beware - if you want Tidmouth Sheds to stay built longer than thirty seconds get out the superglue - that is if you can get it together in the first place. This set can be a lot of fun for the little ones and comes with lots of pieces (Remote control Thomas, Harold the Helicopter, three way tunnel, roundhouse turntable). We recently ran out the batteries on the Thomas remote controlled engine and after fifteen minutes still cannot get into the battery compartment (the screws were tightened down hard and pretty well stripped already!). We won't be buying any more trackmaster products (though my son loves the battery operated Fearless Freddie!) and will be purchasing a wooden railway - he'd rather push the cars around the track anyhow. If like the idea of the trackmaster try a different set from this one unless you want to get out the superglue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value, but assembly can be very challenging for kids","review":"While the shed is certainly not easy to assemble, I did not find it quite as challenging as others posting reviews. But I will say your child will not be able to assemble the sheds alone. Glue is probably not a bad idea to keep the sheds stable after assembly.I did find the Thomas engine a bit underpowered and it had difficulty navigating the initial track grade where it started elevating. The changing face switches on the bottom of the train coupled with the track switches can be difficult to get set correctly.I really like the TrackMaster and Tomy train series because the sets are more affordable than the wooden Brio-type trains and way more affordable than the HO scale from Bachmann. They are perfectly suited to pre-teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mimi","review":"We gave this Thomas the train set to our grandson, who is 4 years old, on Christmas morning.

I am so disappointed and feel so ripped off by the poor construction and fact that the pieces don't fit together I am never going to buy anything from HiT toys (whoever they are and whatever they make, I don't know, but watch out HiT!) Plus, these tracks should connect to the wooden and other plastic tracks. It's blatant they they make these all with different joints just to make parents shell out money needlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Building the shed","review":"My 14 year old tried to put this together at christmas with the directions and got frustrated enough I thought he was gonna explode, lol. We had just been playing with the tracks without the shed, which is fun enough for my 2 year old.I finally decided to give it a shot today. I had no directions and maybe that helped me. I actually came to amazon to see a picture. Whatever the directions say, forget it.Build it upside down. Start with the eaves, then the building ends and then door frames (with doors already in there), then put the track part on there, all upside down. You have to hold it while you're snapping the door frames in but it was easy enough. It took about 10 minutes that way.I agree though it doesnt seem to be the sturdiest design, and glue probably couldn't hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"How is a child supposed to play with it!!","review":"I wish I had read the reviews before!!

He further says that chant has no rhythm of its own. My goodness: it's a wonder anyone sings it at all! Indeed, he doesn't come anywhere close to describing how to sing a single one. He discusses some particular chants but never mentions where they fit in liturgy. He is fixated on the old St. Gall neumes to the exclusive of every advance since then -- and then wraps it all up in the garb of the Cardine school.

I was excited by the small size and prospect of 4mp resolution. I also liked the slide=away lens cover which I felt would be highly protective and the metal body.It is a lovely camera but has had one flaw that makes it less than ideal for me.The problem is the focus, indoors in low light. It's fine for outdoor snaps but most of the pictures I take are indoors. Often the light is low because I am in a meeting room.In this case, the camera cannot autofocus well and, as there is no manual focus to override it, the problem is impossible to fix.I returned the camera for service, thinking perhaps it was a manufacturing defect but, sadly, it did not improve.I am now looking for another camera to replace it.It's a pity because it is a sweet, compact thing that's easy to carry. It would be a great choice for someone who is mostly interested in outdoor pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loses its shine after a while","review":"I originally loved this camera.... small, light, good battery life, hi-res photos to work with. However, after using it for the last year, and taking over 2,100 photos with it (the camera keeps track) I have to say I'm extremely disappointed with it.Unless you're outdoors in VERY bright sunlight, or using the flash, forget about taking decent photos. I've held the camera solidly against a wall to take indoor photos without flash and all you get is a streaky mess. You can't control the apeture setting, and hence EVERY photo comes out blurry unless you are in bright, direct light.I spend a good 3-4 minutes with EVERY photo that DOES come out O.K. (not blurry) touching it up in photoshop. For whatever reason, the CCD is just not getting enough photons to take good, crisp, bright photos.Too bad, too, because in most other ways its a great camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps erasing mulitmedia cards!","review":"I bought this camera and the second time I used it, took some pictures and turned it off.

The Piano Guy lifts what it wants out of other books and adds nothing new. It is a poorly made book unusable at the piano. Basically if you MUST buy this nonsense I strongly suggest a used copy as you will not be adding to his pocket from a work copied from others."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book misses the point","review":"Forget playing classical music on the world stage. How about any kind of gig? Pop, rock, jazz, polkas. Or do you want to doodle in your own home.Should you take classical music if you don't want to play classical music? It really isn't necessary. But the book's premise that everything classical music teaches you is inappropriate for non-classical music is BS. The understanding of the music system and technique that classical gives you works across all other genres of music. Most gigging keyboard players (not just classical) have at least some classical background and it serves to make them better. I am one of them.Does this book teach you anything? Very little. It's mostly hype designed for folks who want the easy way out. Whatever method you decide you want to study, it takes time and work and perseverance if you are going to be any good.And this \\"method\\" won't help you much."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with the don't get this book group","review":"This is a regular paperback to be read somewhere other than in front of the piano, so why bother. To have to hold this little paperback with one hand and try to practice with the other is not worth the trouble. It is much easier to just get a beginner book with a binding condusive to page turning and teach yourself. The shipping time was also not worth it - 2 or 3 months if I remember correctly??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This is not an instructional book at all. It can be summarized very briefly. Play chords with the left hand, and melodies on the right. DUH! The author doesn't care how you do it, just do it! Just don't contort your hands! This is more of a motivational book but with nothing to support it, unless you count the author's numerous marketing links to his own products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost on the Treble Clef","review":"I was encouraged to buy this book by Scott's pragmatic teaching method, a regular now on the PBS fund raising drive. As a complete neophyte to the piano, Scott seemed to be a clear choice for the beginner whose goal is to play popular music and the recognizable standard tunes. Someday, perhaps I will, but not from reading this book. I was stopped cold in the first few chapters explaining the reading of a treble clef. For a skill that is very vital to understanding the rest of the book, I found definitions and visual aids vague and too brief. If you know how to read music already, then, this book is useful. For those hopeful to become pianist, the answer is out there somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE disappointment.","review":"I was very disappointed with the book.I tried to read the book while sitting at the piano so I could actually try the techniques he described. Instead of showing a few measures of actual music that illustrated the technique he was describing, he referred to his web page and suggested we listen to music utilizing the technique. This meant I'd have to hop from piano to computer back to the piano.I can't learn to play by sitting at the computer and listening to examples or passages of music. Perhaps I'm a more visual learner than others out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for people who have had lessons!","review":"I gave it two stars because at the very least it was easy and entertaining to read. I took lessons for 2 years when I was a kid and this book didn't teach me anything. My husband has never had lessons and didn't learn a thing from this book either. Scott Houston totally glossed over the part about learning how to read music and then went into a discussion on theory of chords. Then he spent two or three chapters discussing how easy it is to play the blues. Then he ended it with a motivational \\"speech\\" about his philosophy of playing non-classical piano."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of fluff","review":"This book is just full of fluff IMO. If you have ever seen Scott on TV, he talks 95% of the time in a motivational way and 5% of instruction. This book might be 99% motivational text and 1% instruction. If you are new at piano, as I am, I'd like to know how I do I play chords that overlap the melody line or vice versa. I'd also like to know good fingering technique but more specifically, how do I practice playing with both hands at once and without looking? I know it is practice, but how? What are some good techniques to getting to that point? Sure I understand his technique of lead sheets with chord symbols above the melody line, but I have no clue how to practice playing both at once. This books provides no insight on these matters and find myself looking at other books that may help me in these areas. If you new to piano, I assume you must master these same issues that I have of getting started. This book does not help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why didn't my piano teacher give me this book 20 years ago?","review":"This is a great tool for those who don't want to be a classical pianist but just want to have fun! The author gets to the point quickly with no \\"fluff\\" and tells you exactly what you need to do to sound good immediately. Although I had taken a few piano lessons as a child many years ago, I couldn't play a thing. Now I am able to play songs that I want to play, not songs my teacher wanted me to play... Will it take some effort? Yes, but now I am looking forward to playing what is fun instead of \\"Chopsticks\\"! It is also a lot cheaper than lessons..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't unduly impressed.....","review":"Basically the book contains a single premise... that one can play the piano using simple chords with the left hand and the melody with the right. I had gained this knowledge from watching the author on a TV cable channel and was looking for further insights...I read the book very quickly in a single sitting, there are not that many pages, and many of those consisted of tips like modulating the chords to get a different presentation.What would have been nice would have been chord charts but I had to buy another book for those and a Goggle search on the web found the tricky ones not in that book.But, like another poster, I found little of substance beyond the initial premise. To me it looked like a book cobbled together to pad it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same as Randy Milano's book.","review":"I seen his infomercial on PBS and decided to give this book a try. Much to my dismay the only useful information in it was the chord learning system in Milano's book I had bought years earlier. The rest is, besides the usual \\"you can do it\\" stuff is just basic notes on a scale that you can find anywhere on the internet. Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Play piano in a flash","review":"Easier said than done. More like a low voltage flicker than a flash.

But when I found out that I was inheriting a piano, I bought this book. It seemed very logical, but would I really be able to sit down and play? Well, the piano arrived yesterday. To my utter delight, I was able to pick a song I like and pluck out the melody! I just need \\"target practice\\" like the book says, but it is instantly fun and rewarding to begin practicing on a song I like. I also began playing the chords with my left hand as the book suggests. So, after two days, I feel confident that because of this book I won't need expensive lessons to soon be a decent piano player. Also, I am finding the electronic chord finder that the book recommends very helpful. It is way cheaper to buy it on Amazon than on the book's website. So, if you always wanted to play the piano, this book along with a lot of fun practice is the answer for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"With great anticipation I awaited this book.

I used to support our local PBS affiliate in Nashville, WDCN-Channel 8, but withdrew when they started airing commercial nonsense like the aforementioned.The Amazon listing says: \\"Play Piano in a Flash: Play Your Favorite Songs Like a Pro -- Whether You've Had Lessons or Not!\\" I say \\"Pure B.S.\\"!

Nothing comes without practice and good piano 'playing', regardless of whether it's classical, pop, jazz, rock or whatever, requires skill and practice in timing, technique, dynamics, and (when reading from pop or jazz fake books or lead sheets) chord theory. This stuff is basically what you would learn in a first lesson from any piano teacher. Playing something that is 'recognizable' as opposed to something that is tasteful are 2 different things completely and I think most people should aim for the latter. For a beginner, this is a very easy way to develop bad habits with fingerings and chord voicings that will be hard to break later on. Sorry Scott, but nothing comes that easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"half book hyping you up, then dissapoints with poor content","review":"He doesnt have a system or anything. All he say is to buy a sheet music of your favorite song and play it. Only interesting part are the few pages of cool techniques of \\"faking\\" the chords, which are rather advanced. I think he could have done better naming this book, \\"how to play a fakebook\\", and develop on those techniques not just explaining them on few lines.He wants the beginner to start playing the music sheet.

This is the third book I've read of Tropper's and while there is a degree of sex and drugs in his other books, this one is only about teenage sex and pot (despite any claims to the contrary). It's quite egregious. I'm not a prude but there's only so much you can take and then it's just a bad joke--pointless, embarrassing and boring. I couldn't even finish the thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"I have read all but one of Tropper's books and really liked all of them.

Wonderful read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasing fiction.","review":"A well written book of fiction about the self-indulgent Joe Goffman who writes a scathing work of fiction about the characters that make up his hometown of Bush Falls. His book is a hugh success -there is even a movie made- with the general public; but not the besmirged residents of Bush Falls. Due to his father's illness, Joe must return to the Falls fifteen years after he left and face the people he has insulted and face his own demons from the past. I enjoyed the return to Bush Falls with Joe. I laughed out loud a number of times and even could empathize with him on occassion. I enjoyed the flashbacks to Joe's adolescence in the 80's that colored his current status and relationships with the denizens of Bush Falls. I found the book, humorous, sad,sometimes thought provoking and always entertaining. I look forward to reading more by Jonathon Tropper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to perfect!","review":"It's been a long time since I read a novel that I found so completely absorbing. In this fresh take on a returning prodigal son, Joe's voice has the perfect combination of sensitivity and wit, never (or almost never)overdoing either one. The characters are fully realized and the dialogue is authentic and often hysterically funny. Whether it's a 33 year old man coming to terms with his own poor character or an eighteen year old boy feeling the pangs of unrequited love, the author makes it moving, honest and very funny. And unlike so many other books in this genre, Tropper seems out to move with substance, rather than impress with style. I was truly sorry to finish it, and look forward to his next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick read","review":"I read this on vacation in 2 days, very entertaining. Parts were hysterically funny, some a little depressing, but overall a book that you always want to pick up and finish. Would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly Enjoyable.","review":"Troppers themes of returning to a childhood home, rekindling a past love, and finding yourself are all present in this earlier book that almost seems to be sowing seeds for what would later become the excellent 'This is Where I Leave You'. Joe Goffman writes a bestselling novel ala Peyton Place that is turned into a blockbuster motion picture smash, that manages to trash half the town. Now, seventeen years later he's returning to the scene of the crime after his father has a stroke. Shifting between his teenage years in the eighties and the present, the alienated writer attempts to piece together what had happened in the past,to what's become of everyone in the present. The book to me, doesn't quite have the finesse of his latest book, but Tropper is a talented writer who has a knack for creating charming, likable characters that are both relatable and winning."},{"rating":"1","title":"memories","review":"Who doesn't have a boatload of memories from their high school days? There's the hot, older woman you always desired. The high school sweetheart and first love. The buddies you ran with and the obnoxious bully. This author covers all this and more. At first, I was pulled into the story and tripped down my own memory lane. After a bit, things began to sound a tad bit sophmoric and juvenile. It was easy to predict the plot and the humorous tone of the writing just didn't carry well. The ending was okay but left me wanting resolution with the bully.It's not that the guy can't write. He's got some chops and tosses in the occasional insight. I think that if he would let go of high school, there's a nice book, waiting to be written. There's several titles available but after this one, I won't risk my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Irving without the overcrafted artiness","review":"Maybe it is just me sliding down the wrong side of middle age, but this totally resonated with me--coming of age in the 80s as I did.

Charming, poignant and meaningful."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't go home...or can you?","review":"Tropper is a witty, highly quotable author. This is the first book I've read by him and I will be definitley checking out his other work. The Book Of Joe is about a 30 something author who has successfully penned an autobiographical novel based on his small hometown and thoroughly trashing many of it's inhabitants. Suddenly called home for a family crisis he has to confront and attempt to reconnect with all those who were left behind with very mixed results. along the way the inhabitants of Bush Falls behave in ways that totally validate his impressions but also provide a few surprises of their own. From his close friend who is dying of AIDS, his brother whose marriage to a HS sweetheart is on the rocks, his old girlfriend and several others who played big roles in his teen years, the characters are richly drawn and feel very real. This is a very entertaining book and the author's witty one liners are truly memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved this book","review":"My wife bought this book because our son's name is Joe and she thought it was cool that someone wrote a book with his name in the title. God, I'm glad she did. It's a wonderful story, well written, funny, touching, from the heart. I haven't been this moved by a novel since \\"The Corrections.\\" Some critics said some of the characters were cliche or stereotypes, but they missed the point. The book rings true and touches your heart. Can you ask for anything more? Buy it, read it, commend it to your friends. They'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Page Turner with Intelligence","review":"I loved this book -- couldn't put it down. Tropper combines a fast moving plot with complex characters woven together with wit and depth.

I don't know how a movie can possibly do the book justice -- but I'll be sure to watch it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Melodramatic","review":"I didn't read the reviews until after I read the book, since I wanted to make up my own mind. I think Publishers Weekly hit it on the head in their review in which the reviewer called the book a sophomore effort that relied too heavily on canned lines and easy melodrama. If this kind of book sounds like something you'd be interested in, do yourself a favor and get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pack-Up Your Adjectives","review":"I guess sometimes this is what we have to show for allowing poppy little english grammar ditties to be so catchy. I can see Mr. Tropper as the kind of writer motivated by two things: Schoolhouse Rock and vocab-building page-a-day calendars. The writing here was laughable at times, overly flowing and several syllables longer than needed. The vocabulary used was over the top for what was required, and all the more jarring in that the author tends to use (or wants to use) a seemingly accessible, pop-culture-riddled, casualness to the story-telling. The story itself is ok, though nothing exceptional here. For a better, albeit surreal, look at the \\"voyage-to-the-hometown-of-renowned-author\\" genre, try Jonathan Carroll's *The Land of Laughs*."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic and overdrawn","review":"This novel never rose above the level of bad sitcom - lusting after a friend's mother, confrtonting the high school friend (now cop) who keeps beating him up, immature relationship with his high school sweetheart.

You are THERE, in Bush Falls, cheering, loathing, ranting, crying. That is the investment you begin to feel almost immediately, and that is the gift of great writing.I woke up in the middle of the night, could not sleep, and opened the Kindle to read some more. I finished at 4 this morning and was only upset that the story had to have a last page.Give yourself a gift - The Book of Joe is by turns laugh-out-loud funny, nostaligic (you will find yourself revisiting your own high school years and the BS that inevitably was the thread that ran through them when we all thought we were invincible), sad, and uplifting."},{"rating":"2","title":"my first Tropper book","review":"I'm a huge reader and picked this off my shelf when I was sick at home with many hours to kill. Great writing, really got into the book within the first few pages. Amazingly enough, when I started reading The Book of Joe, I thought it was the funniest book I have read in the longest time (I really appreciate the dry humor and sarcasm, especially living in NYC).

'His Lordship's Pleasure' is particularly guilty of this. Though only a 200 page regency it moves swiftly through a complex and yet completely meaningless plot and so wastes precious time that could be spent developing the somewhat two dimensional characters. If you want an enjoyable romance however and do not ask for believability or an immersing read then you may well still enjoy this as it has some charm. It is nothing like a Georgette Heyer however (which the publisher claims) and frankly the comparison is an insult to Heyer. A mildly enjoyable adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything You Wanted To Know About Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers","review":"With the first half of the book being about his life and the formation of the band, the book takes a different take with a Q & A like format that allows Tom to tell his story in his own words. The second half is all about this break down of the songs and the albums. Just as interesting as his life, it's impossible to put this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celebrating 30 Years of American Rock 'n' Roll!","review":"I've been a fan of Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers since 1976 so I thought I knew all there was to know about Tom and the band...how wrong I was! This book was enlightening in regards to TP's childhood, how his love for music unfolded at an early age, and how his life experience naturally seeps into his songs. The book is broken up into two parts. The first part is all about Tom's life and he talks about everything from his parents to getting a record deal to recording with the Wilburys to the tragic death of bassist Howie Epstein. The second part is devoted to TP's songs with comments from him about almost everything he's ever written. For me, the first section of the book was my favorite, though I did learn a few things about Tom's songs in Part II.This is a terrific book for anyone who loves rock 'n' roll, and Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"view on an artist's live","review":"This book gives you an clear view how an artist lives, how they make songs, how the musicians cooperate. The photographs from the beginning untill now are great to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was tricked !!!","review":"I have read the secound have of this album ( ABOUT TOM's MUSIC AND SONGS's ),........\\"And was I ever tricked\\". WHY ??? Would anybody ask questions and write about almost every song TOM PETTY ,has wrote and not tell people or ask TOM himself ----\\"WHAT WAS HE SINGING,WRITEING, and TALKING about in each of those songs\\" BOY, was I dissappointed. Why go to all that trouble and not say what each of his song's where about ? VERY Up-setting. This book should GO BACK, REPRINT and ask those questions ( REFERED TO TOP OF MY COMPLAINT ), and print what the songs mean. \\"THATS WHAT EVERYBODY WANTED TO KNOW\\"........You missed the point of the book ........FIX IT !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A really great workout for athletes!","review":"While this isn't my favorite yoga DVD, I use this DVD often. As a runner, I need to work on both strength and flexibility, and this DVD delivers both. I work up a sweat every time I do this routine! The workout is pretty basic, but does the job. My only complaint is that no one seems to be enjoying this workout, including the instructor. She is so serious!One other complaint, it is impossible to skip the introduction. Once is enough. Note to producers: next time, make it possible for viewers to go right to the workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power Yoga","review":"Power Yoga for Athletes is very easy to follow. You don't have to think. I like the way Adrienne guides you through the different yoga positions step by step in a very encouraging manner. I also like how it is set up so that it doesn't matter what level you are at when you begin the program. You can be a beginner, advanced or anywhere in between. She has a no nonsense approach in her method of leading you through the exercises but she also comes across as caring deeply about what she does. The results of the program for me have been very effective. I play hockey and I feel more balanced and relaxed on my skates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a power Yoga buff and do tapes of Rodney Yee (my favorite) and Brian Kest (if he could only talk less sometimes...).This tape as a number of flaws: the positions are too short, many power positions seem to me to be designed to inflict pain rather than to help the training and finally, the worst, there are some sort of ads during the relaxation phase, the most horrific experience I have ever had with a tape. I jumped up from my Shavasna in horror. I find the voice of the trainer slightly annoying, but that is likely to be a personal problem of mine.In short, I tried it a few times and then tossed it as useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk about intense!","review":"This DVD is not for the timid. I must admit that I was skeptical before I bought it; I thought that people only practiced yoga to meditate and gain flexibility. Wow, was I wrong! This DVD provided me with a workout I will not soon forget. It is a complete body workout and will definitely leave you feeling great. I highly recommend this DVD to any active individual that is looking for a new way to work out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent strength oriented yoga session","review":"The virtues of this tape are also its limitations - the session focuses on developing individual muscle groups by grouping poses together to generate a lot of heat and lactic acid in those specific areas. This differs from a more traditional yoga philosophy, which tries to even out body work without pumping too much blood and energy into any particular body part. The pace is also fairly fast, with not a lot time to settle into or work the poses. Because this is a strength-oriented session, moreover, the emphasis is on muscle work more than flexibility (not a lot of seated poses). Overall, this is an excellent, strength-oriented athletic yoga session, which should be of great help to athletes at all levels. For experienced yogis, this session can be great if you remember to focus on breathing, your locks and keeping a long, supple spine. The pace and the focus on muscle-building might turn some people off, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying","review":"I bought this DVD based on the raving reviews here and I was very disappointed. It was fast paced, and while I had no problem keeping up, I felt like I wasn't getting a good enough workout. I am used to a more rigorous Ashtanga flow and to me this was a lame imitation. I would not recommend this to anyone, especially those who like a challenging yoga workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good gun","review":"This gun kicks.

It goes together fairly easily -- all you need is a screwdriver, Allen head and open end wrenches along with a tire pump. I spent just over an hour uncrating it and putting it together.

I am now beginning the tedious process of exchanging this item for a more subtle hue. This requires calling the company personally for \\"return instructions\\".

The only part I agree with is that the front canopy does have to be removed before folding. I usually left it off - my older child didn't want it anyway. Otherwise it's a smooth ride with plenty of storage. An infant car seat fit nicely. I would buy it again. However, if you have an infant and an older child who's over 2 1/2 I'd recommed the Joovy stand-up stroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to push but carseat problems","review":"I just bought this stroller a week ago so I could be ready for my 2nd little girl due in May. I have a 20 month old. The stroller is EXTREMELY easy to push around and maneuver with just one hand! I admit that I do have a few concerns. I also bought a graco safeseat to use with the stroller but it's so hard to get it in the stroller! Not to mention pulling it out. Maybe I need some more practice but time will tell. Also, my 20 month old is a big girl and when the front seat reclines for her to take a nap, she'll be bumping her head in the car seat behind her. She's just not comfortable to nap in it unless I switch her seat to the back and the carseat to the front. Other than these problems, the stroller looks nice and is easy to use. I'd recommend it to anyone with a normal sized baby but for those with big kids, beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I returned this!","review":"I wouldn't even give this a full star! I loved my single Graco stroller and thought purchasing the DuoGlider would be a great purchase. However, after using it for less then three months, the front left wheels became very stiff and difficult to maneuver. The fabric on the bottom of the stroller also began to tear from being moved in and out of my SUV. The front canopy and tray need to removed whenever folding the stroller and they are a pain to snap back into place. I wish I did my research and am pleased that the store that I purchased this stroller from was more than willing to take it back. I'm a smarter consumer now and I'm looking forward to picking up my new stroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stroller with hard to use storage","review":"I've had this stroller for over 3 years now, and it is still going strong. It is very durable. We take this on trails in the woods as well as through the mall. It is impossible to steer with one hand when there are two kids in it. Might be wise to invest in a bluetooth headset if you plan on using the phone while pushing this :) My major gripe and the reason I gave it only 4 stars is the big storage compartment under the seats. It is a great size, but nearly impossible to use if you've got the back seat fully reclined. You either have to unsnap the mesh on the side (which only gives you partial access to storage), or you have to cram all your stuff into the storage via the gap between the front and back seats. Other than that, it's been a really great piece of baby gear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have had this stroller for 2 years now *** updated**** 8/8/10","review":"We love this stroller. It is safe, easy to use, easy to fold up, and has a huge basket on the bottom for when we are shopping.In the two years I have owned it we have had no problems at all. I can't say enough good about it.The only bad remarks I can give it is that it is huge even when folded and the canopy for the front seat pops off way to easy. We have since just taken it off because it prevents us from seeing what our 2yr old is doing anyways so it turned out to be good for us!Update:We have had this stroller now for over 4 years and we still use it every single day and with another on the way it seems we will be using this stroller another 4 years if it continues to hold up as well as it has! We could not ask more of a stroller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Double Stroller","review":"I just had my third baby boy and own many strollers. My latest was the Joovy sit and stand. Which doesn't hold my infant car seat. I bought this one and I love it. It was easy to put together and easy to use. My infant car seat fits in the front or back. It is a little tight in the back but over all it works just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to guide, comfortable...","review":"This stroller was ready to assemble. It is very roomy and easy to adjust. The seats recline to a comfortable position and can be done with one hand. You can collapse the stroller with one hand also. I purchased this for my twin grandkids. There mom can handle them and the stroller with ease."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality vs. Functionality","review":"This model is more posh than some of their others, with very nice canopies for both seats and a large storage area, however it is not as functional as the one that I have at our other home, as this one has only one adult cup holder and when you put the upper canopy back, it covers that space making it impossible to use. When you push it away to reveal the cupholder and storage, it covers the infant area so much that the baby gets upset if he's not asleep.I also am not crazy about the hard plastic wheels versus the rubber that I have on other models, but the stroller is great quality and easy to setup/fold down with a reasonable weight so it's manageable."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice stroller","review":"I just received this stroller a couple days ago - and so far it is working great. While long, it does fit in the bag of my minivan. My husband was even able to unload it from the car and unfold it while holding our infant son. The description from amazon was not very detailed -- this stroller has a 3 OR 5 point harness on both seats, and it has the drop down basket- so that you can have access to the storage while the back seat is down flat. Pretty much it is exactly like the duoglide in Fortune print -- only looks a little nicer and more modern."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL STROLLER","review":"I currently own a Laura Ashley \\"Graco\\" stroller for my daughter.

The hardest part is that the basket does not drop down when the baby is in the carrier in the back so there is not great access to the basket. Other models do have this feature. On trips we had to take the baby out when going into buildings with a scanner so they could check our diaper bag. The canopies fold in a very akward way and are hard to put on once they come off.

She loves it and raves about great it is every time we talk. The baby sits in the rear seat, which reclines all the way back for naps and the toddler sits in the front. It probably wouldn't be the best stroller for infant twins because only the rear seat reclines. The features she likes most are the massive storage basket underneath the stroller, how easy the stroller is to open and close and how easy it is to push and turn -- it feels light and nimble, considering it's a double stroller with two big kids. It's not perfect, but it really is an exceptional value for the price.

How can you top the inventiveness and vision of Kashmir? Or In The Light? What about topping the sheer power and class of The Wanton Song or The Rover?This album does make Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones & John Bonham the gods and devils of rock altogether. The thing is, this is Zeppelin on top of their game and to me this means unsurpassed beauty.Physical Graffiti is a timeless gift of music, it will always be as powerful as it ever was.

The story revolves around a young country gentleman and his sport activities, which are mainly cricket and fox hunting. The story makes one long sales pitch, especially during our times of never-ending pressure, for the countryside world described by the author: sunny and beautiful days, cricket, fox hunting, and a cup of fine tea every now and then. The more revealing aspects are what is missing from his world, endless shopping, pressing deadlines at work, traffic jams, and all the ‘gems�?modern life has to offer.

Instead, this collection of songs channels far more mature and cohesive sound, more akin to their debut album (\\"Like the Exorcist But More Breakdancing\\"). In gerneral, songs are pretty clear cut and direct influences like Nick Cave, Johnny Cash, and Tom Waits are immediately spotted. That being said, the true strength of this album comes towards the end of the CD.

Even with all of these accessories packed in, the dimensions of the bag get no bigger than 8\\"x8\\"x6\\". It is also nicely padded around the area that the lens would be, so it feels very safe. It comes with a detachable shoulder strap, or you can simply use the strap that's on the camera already.I have a separate camera bag that can fit several lenses and a flash, but I wanted a compact alternative that was easier to carry around. This bag will definitely fit the kit lens (18-55mm) with room to spare, but it's nice to be able to accommodate a larger lens like the 18-105mm VR as well, since that's the lens I currently use as my walkaround."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big","review":"I was looking for a small bag to carry my new Panasonic DMC-FZ35.

The answer is no, they want you to go thru all the software soft paks and they do not work. Also compaq is useing AMD boards in some of their newer computers, So guess what is not working? You guessed it cybergenie. Also they say that the least ram to run is 64mg. Well if you are running only 64 mg dont run anything else,The cybergenie will loose connectivity if ya try to go online it wont let you online or it will make your system lock up.

Handsets last six months to a year. Speech engine has it's fair share of problems with any kind of background noise.The quality just isn't there.

Doesn't really matter much because they never answered the phone and the website was never available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor range...","review":"These phones have horrible range. You will get further range from a $20 cordless phone from Radio Shack. I was only able to go 30-40 feet away from the base. I even wasted $30 on an USB extension to put the base at the top of the ceiling away from all other electronic devices. That only gave me maybe 10 more feet. I returned the phones and just got some Engenius phones and I LOVE THEM! They go 1/2+ mile easily through the neighborhood and I am going to purchase the outside optional antennae for long range. The fancy features on the CyberGenie hardly ever worked for me. The voice commands would work less than 5% of the time. This product has a lot of good ideas put into it, but it cuts corners to save money. It is not worth buying and you will end up returning it for better quality phones. Luckily, Amazon returning procedures are wonderful and among the best you can ask for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, bad product","review":"My cat typically loves laser pointers and will chase them for as long as I'm willing to play. However, with the Bada Beam, all he can do is sit there and look at it. The Bada Beam's light spins in circles on the floor so fast that I find it hard to believe that any cat could actually keep up with it.Multipet had a good idea, but failed on the execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD BAD IDEAS","review":"I agree. A GOOD idea poorly thought out. YOu would have to mount it on a pole or hang it from the celing to get the desired effect. Rex is laser CRAZY and he is not into this toy.I hope they are working on a new design, maybe the mirror should rotate ?PS. We played with it some more and found if I set it on top of the very high chest it works ok and Rex will be interested SO am bumping it up a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"A toy no cat will play with...","review":"I have to agree 100% with the first review. I just got this, and my cats are more interested in the box it came in than the laser beam this thing spits out. (I guess they're like children in that way!) The beam has only two settings - one that is emitted directly about 1 foot ahead of the device on the floor, the other about horizontal from it so that it will appear low on your walls or furniture. Basically, it's just like a revolving police light on a squad car; it simply spins a dot around in a monotonous circle over and over. My cats just looked at it in puzzlement instead of chasing it like I'd hoped. Then they looked at me like, 'Woman, why did you buy this crazy thing?' To get them to take an interest in it, I have to actually pick up the device and shake it around to make a random enough pattern for them to chase. And even then, they'd rather lie around. There's $19.99 I'll never see again...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for version 2.0","review":"A great idea, but falls short for the cat. It needs to do more, maybe if it turned around in circles (the whole thing) ocationaly, and had a speed control. Unless I am holding it and moving it myself, my cat simply stares at the beam or sniffs at the toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Cat Insanely Loves This Machine","review":"My kitty is obsessed with this machine. She demands to be beamed in the morning before breakfast and when I come home from work in the evening. I direct the Ba-Da beam in front of her, and she speeds faster than imaginably possible after the circling dot, with furious acrobatics and (at times) aerobatics. Finally, when she puts her paw onto the beam, with lightning reflexes I shut it off. Then I congratulate her for killing it.I think that if you simply place the Ba-Da Beam in some fixed place, or even on a string, the cat will likely become bored. It is superior to an ordinary laser pointer in that the beam makes irregular motions, with occasional stops. I believe that it is important to let the cat catch the dot, and to be praised for success."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Dogs & Cats","review":"This toy will enterain a dog or cat.

I cut it out of the packaging, inserted the included batteries and adjusted the mirror. The light came on, but absolutely nothing else happened. I read the directions on the package, which were vague at best. They implied that the light would come on when the mirror was adjusted to one of two positions. I moved the mirror around, but the only thing that happened was that the light went out. I returned the Ba-Da-Beam and decided to buy the Frolicat BOLT auto laser toy instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for...","review":"My little dog LOVES to chase a lazer! I thought this would be a way for her to get the fun and exercise she wants without wearing out our wrists! Not so. #1, it projects onto the walls, not the floor. Even setting it at an angle on a shelf, it really doesn't work for the floor. It is also very difficult to get it to stay angled on a shelf due to the rounded bottom/side. #2 it moves VERY fast. Really, too fast for my dog to follow. #3 it is pretty cheap plastic and after just a few uses, it quit working.I don't know if a cat would play with it, but skip it for your dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I wish I would have read these reviews before plunking down the money for this. It's light goes around too fast for my cat and kitten to even try to keep up with. I tried to place it at several levels and it didn't work so well. My biggest concern is that the laser light can sometimes shine across my cats' faces. It would seem unsafe to have the light shine in their eyes.I will be returning it asap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was excited to buy this item for both my dog and cat because they both loved when we would bring out the laser pointer. The laser moved way too quick for my dog. My cat could keep up a little better but because of the quick motion she lost interest in it very quickly. She would only play with it for about a minute but the normal laser pointer she would never get tired of.The thought behind this product is amazing but I just didn’t like how fast the laser moved nor the settings for the mirror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money","review":"I bought this toy for two of my cats that love to play with lasers. I thought by buying this toy it would provide them with entertainment when I am not home. The laser moves too quickly which results in my cats losing interest in the toy. The toy does have two settings but it means you can have the laser appear on the floor or wall. Overall it is poorly designed toy and not worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"I had actually bought this product at a local pet store in the city I live in for my two cats. I got it out of the package and put in some batteries, and it started out at the laser pointer moving very slowly made one inch per 3 mins. On the packaging it does say it will start out slow, I was thinking for like a minute of less, I understand some products need warming up. Well after like 30 mins of it moving slow it finally started going fast, and my male cat was chasing it, but it was going in circles, and after 30 sec of playing and chasing and going in circles he didn't want to do it anymore cuz he was getting dizzy. My female wanted nothing to do with it, but she is a lazy cat anyway. My male loves laser lights and will play with one all day but not when it takes 30 mins for it to got fast and it going in circles the whole time. It would be a good product if it jumped around and did zig zags and went in other directions, but just going in circles the whole not a good idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I bought this at a local pet store for my cat. She loves laser pointers and I thought that this would keep her entertained when I'm busy. The instructions were pretty lacking on how to exactly get the device working. It turns out that the toy was broken from the start. The toy seemed cheap so this wasn't a huge surprise. A decent idea for a cat toy, but the build quality is atrocious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ba-Da-Bummer :(","review":"I was so excited to get this toy for my cats. I thought by looking at the design that it would rotate around in circles with the laser light. It doesn't... all it does is shoot a laser out in one 3' x 3' section.This was not designed for cats in mind. The laser although is interesting to the cats it moves too quickly. It moves in fast circles in one spot and then stops for two seconds or less. It doesn't give the cats time to try and chase the laser. I WOULD SUGGEST BUYING A LASER LIGHT OR A FISHING POLE CAT TOY INSTEAD!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Like almost everyone has said in the reviews, their animals might play with the beam for a minute or two then never play with it again. I have five laser-crazy animals. The cats were more interested in the device (it makes a small whirring noise) and none chased the laser. One of the two dogs appeared interested, but quickly became confused and just stood in the middle of the circle looking at me quizzically. Maybe a really simple-minded pet will like this, but mine aren't interested. I tried putting the device on the floor, a shelf, the coffee table, and other locations looking for a way to get the critters to take interest. For the most part, the movement is too fast and too repetitive.Recommendations for improvement match others here - rotate the mirror (randomly), make the mirror fully adjustable instead of just two settings, and slow down the movement so pets can track it more easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"Initial my cat liked it.

Yeah, it moves the laser beam around, but only in a circle. Every once in a while it stops, and then it starts up again. It doesn't make a big circle on the floor, mind you, but a small circle on the wall. I guess you could hang it from the ceiling, but even then, it'd just be going in a circle. And, as everyone else has said, it goes way too fast. As far as I can tell, you can't adjust the speed or pattern.Even the kittens I'm fostering ignored it. I'd give it a zero if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this for my cat. It is the dumbist concept yet!!

I put in the included batteries and turned it on. To my surprise, my normally evil kitty shied away! That's not what the problem is though. After a while the noise that it made, so annoying, wasn't such an issue except that it distracted the cat from the laser. So wait, maybe it is an issue. The other problem I have is that the beam goes super fast in a circle while stopping in random spots. Those random stops were so fast that even I didn't have time to locate the beam. My cat didn't have time to even try this toy as it really would be better suited for a party for everyone to stare at. That would probably be pretty dull anyway. You can hold the toy and play but it's too fast and doesn't work well that way either. You can't really aim it. I would not recommend this cat toy before finding someone who has one to try it out first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, bad design","review":"I recently purchased this item but am returning it.

The 2700's water supply is very good, but it's all down hill from there. Besides the funky coloring, the 2700 has a weak, easily broken stick pump rather than the attached pump of the 3200, Monsters, 2500, etc, and the pump is at a weird angle too. The nozzles, 2x, 5x and 10x are a step down from the older 2500's 5x, 10x and 20x, and the range is pitiful. Even the smaller 1700 has a good many feet over the 2700. Also, the nozzles are encased in some decorational purple flower thing that makes changing the nozzles difficult. If you're thinking about buying a 2700, I'd recommend going for the smaller 1700, or spending the extra few bucks for the 3200 or Monster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Plot.

I love John's voice, but unfortunately he does not shine here. Also, production quality is weak, and song-writing is somewhat uninspired. Must have been a real difficult transition period for the extremely talented Wishbone Ash crew. Wetton left before this album was taken on tour.

I've had my 2nd edition copy for twenty years, and no other book I've seen discusses visual theory so simply, logically and completely.

The quality is great -- very well-made. But after you find one or two ways for the marble to bounce down to the bottom, you're pretty much done.

It has 650 color illustrations (drawings and photographs), 1,800 entries, and pretty well covers the beginning words used by young readers. Each entry has a definition, as well as uses the word in a sentence to give context. If there is more than one definition, they are numbered in order of common usage. Variant forms of the word are listed at the end of the definition. The illustrations are bright and cute, and the type is large enough to facilitate easy reading.My only real quibble with this book is that there is no pronunciation guide given for words. I realize youngsters might not be able to use such a guide all the time, but it would be good to have anyway.

The L bracket supplied with the stands is too short to fix the screw through it. If you speakers have a mounting hole in the upper half of the speaker then you may have a problem with mounting using these stands. I ended up using the double sided foam which i am not sure is a permanent option.The speakers can be rotated on horizontal plan by rotating the upper speaker rod. But tilting is not possible.

Can't go wrong with the price. I very happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I could find for the dollar","review":"These are great stands for the low price I paid. The price beat the large stores by $14. Two things you may need to know, first be very careful not to cross thread riser into base, I found it easier to thread the pipe from the bottom of the base to clean up threads and then put it together correctly from the top side. The other thing was the mount is setup for speakers with a pre-threaded insert or wood housed or plastic housed speakers that you can drill holes into and screw the base of the stand into. Another option which I used is double sided tape included, I had plastic housed speakers I did not want to drill into, so I used the included double sided tape. Fot extra security I put a screw in the wall hanging hole in my speaker housing and secured it to the back support brack with a flat washer and nut. These stands look stylish and fit perfectly with the styling of my livingroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent speaker stands for smaller speakers at an awesome price.","review":"These speaker stands are fantastic for my two front speakers from the Klipsch HD Theater 300 set.

These stands are flimsy. The threads on the inside of the telescoping pole that attaches to the weighted base were off kilter. As such, when setup, the pole leaned. Unusable. The sticker logo on the base was missing when I opened the package. I later found that the adhesive of the label was so poor that it peeled away prior to opening. These stands are a good concept with poor execution. Highly recommend against buying these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Price,good quality but suitable for speakers with flat base/rear","review":"I was impressed with the quality and ease of assembly but unfortunately it did not suit my speakers(POLK TL1600).My speakers has a curved rear and the base had three small rubber pods.This product is suitable for speakers with a flat base and flat rear face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best satellite stands for the price. Sturdy with classy look.","review":"I purchased 4 of these satellite stands for my onkyo 7.1 stereo system after reading all the reviews. Let me tell you, these are the best satellite stands on the market for the price. I placed all 4 stands on carpet and it was very sturdy. The only issue I had was with all the wires that you have to hook up so my place had a ton of different wires of all colors coming out. But for the price I paid, it was worth it. The great thing about these stands is that the resell value even after 4 years is quite high. When I moved last year, I sold my onkyo system with all 4 stands and if I had to break down the sale, I sold the 4 stands for 40 (I paid 50.00 shipped brand new). I never had any issues with sound, static, wires breaking/coming loose, or any of that. I will purchase these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stand for a low price.","review":"They are easy to set up and work great.

The stands are quite heavy and the bases are rather large and difficult to snug into a corner or behind furniture.

You can see them swaying and they are always cockeyed and never straight up and down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality!","review":"I have have other similar stands before and these are junk!!

I bought 3 pairs and they are great with my Onkyo Home Theater In A Box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive, well designed, sturdy, great value.","review":"As multiple reviewers have mentioned, speaker stands are terribly overpriced.

I use them to support my cube speakers and they work brilliantly. Great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap, sturdy, easy to assemble","review":"My husband spent a while browsing speaker stands online and then ordered these to use with our newSony BDV-E770W Blu-ray Disc Player Home Entertainment System, Black.

Why pay more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job","review":"Exactly what I was expecting when I received them. Setup was a breeze. Very functional for my rear speakers (small speakers from the klipsch HD 500 set). Minus 1 star because the stands made my speakers appear to be leaning forward on the stand. Had to bend the back bracket to make them appear straight. I would recommend for the price for a quick easy solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"(Unusual) Bad experience","review":"It seems that the average experience with these stands is that they work just fine. However, in the interest of fairness: we had a different experience. We tried two sets (unable to replace the second set because the product is out of stock), and both sets were defective. You see, the support pole attaches to the base with a screw-thread design (the base is threaded to allow the pole to screw on). On 1 stand of each set, the threading was inadequate to support the weight of the pole. Rather than stand straight up, the support pole would lean over/wobble when you moved it. It would rest at about 70 degrees from horizontal (looked messed up). I didn't take the time to attach speakers to either set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good quality speaker stands","review":"For the price, these were definitely an excellent purchase. They are high quality stands and fairly sturdy. One thing to consider, though:-They have different ways of connecting your speakers, but mine were just a bit too tall for these, so I ended up having to use 3M velcro tabs. In the end, I like these better, because it's very easy to remove and reattach as needed, while still being (fairly) firmly attached."},{"rating":"2","title":"speaker stands","review":"not much to evaluate about these speaker stands--they are simple devices that adequately do the job they are intended for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surround Sound ENTERTAINER","review":"I really enjoyed this product and it was a surprise to receive the items delivered very promptly.

Great value assuming you can receive them in on piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars...","review":"They were simple to set up and look good -- rather \\"Industrial\\".

So, it is not surprising that one pole that screws into the base, one of the stands, was incorrect. The base was tapped for a larger hole that the pole was threaded for.The other one works just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Construction","review":"These stands were a joke to put together. The main tubes wouldn't thread in properly. The threaded hole was too large and the tube would move side to side once in place,(wouldn't tighten). The adjustable tube also wouldn't tighten down without side to side movement. And the compression collar had to be glued on to keep it from spinning freely. Other than that its Super. If you don't mind repairing your new stands right out of the box then snap em up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy duty","review":"I got these to pop my speakers up off the ground a bit more. The base is HEAVY. Cast Iron, I think. The mounting screws didn't work with my speakers (Yamaha surround sound set) because they didn't screw in all the way. The solution is just a shorter screw but I'm not moving these around so I don't care. They are screwed enough to stay on. The wire is hidden through the stand which I love. They adjust up several feet and the lowest they go is probably 24-30\\". I like them."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are not SILVER!!","review":"These stands are not silver in color.

You won't be disappointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Price","review":"Compared to the big box stores, such as Best Buy, who want to charge you over $100 for speaker stands, these are a steal. They were easy to setup, and it took a little fanagling with my Sony speakers, but everythign was setup in no time flat. The nice part it is if I get new speakers that need to be attached anouther besides a screw from the back, I have other options.

The package arrived extremely fast (used free shipping option and arrived in 2 days) and was very easy to put together. I really like that the wires can be hidden in the tubing, it makes for a nice clean look. It was also very easy to adjust the height of the stands. The speakers that I use fit easily into the universal mount and feel pretty solid. Overall I was so happy with the look and price of these stands I decided to buy another set for my front speakers.

Offers 3 mounting solutions: bolt from the back, double-sided tape, or wood screws (not included) through the bottom. Most speakers can use a back-bolt, and 2 different bolt sizes are included. I couldn't ask for more. The wires hide inside the pole and the foot has a notch to help keep the wire low. I don't particularly like the logo on the front of the foot, but mine are hidden since I used these for surround speakers.

The bottoms have a good weight and are stable on tile floor. Only thing was we had to create our own \\"wire brackets\\" to hold the speakers (due to top-mounting, commercial Bose speakers).

Don't be fooled by the price or you may end up the fool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy Piece Of Metal","review":"If I could give it 0 stars I'd start there and add 1 for price. It's basically a tiny 1x1inch sheet of metal that your speaker sits on. Making it even flimsier, the speaker sits on top of the cable as well. You either have a wobbly speaker or can't hide your cable. It's cheap in the overpriced world of speaker stands, but still probably costs 25 cents to manufacture.

They are heavy so they won't tip over, they look better than you'd expect for the price plus I love the fact that I can run the speaker wire through the bottom of the stand up through the inside of the pole for a clean installation. The only thing I don't like is that the supplied screws to mount the speakers were too long for my speakers which are similar in size to the ones in the product picture. This prevents me from being able to secure the speaker snugly against the bracket although they are attached and not going anywhere just loosely attached. But this is really nothing as all I have to do is pull out my trusty little Dremel tool and cut the screws off to the appropriate length. Best bang for the buck by far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stands for the price!","review":"The best deal on speaker stands that I could find. These are well built, powder-coated metal stands.

However, I am unable to use them because they did not fit my surround speakers. The hole for the screws to attach to the stand were too high for the brace.

I found that speaker mounting bracket was too large to fit my Bose speakers and the bracket stuck up approx 3 inches above the top of the speaker. It workd but just did not look professional. This unit is also designed for the cable to go inside of the support column so if your speakers have a connection other than just bare wires you have to mount cable outside of pole. One other quick note: Unit already had rust showing on base and around treaded areas. Will they work - Yes, are appealing to the eye, No."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works Great!","review":"Pros:1.

FAR better quality than I expected for the price. In fact, I searched the 'net and found some online stores charging as much as $99 a pair for these exact stands (plus shipping)!I needed two sets so I even got free shipping! $46 for four stands!

The first order arrived with a hole that was tapped crooked, so the support pole was wobbly (threads were too shallow to make it stable). After returning them, the second order arrived with a similar problem: the hole was severely off-center from the cast extrusion - enough that there wasn't a solid wall for threads.

Well made and sturdy.However, here are some differences/facts you may want to know.1. The titanium stands are nowhere near as bright as the photo posted for the item. They are a dark grey color and look fantastic in my opinion.2. The stands do not correctly fit forOnkyo HT-S6300 7.1-Channel Home Theater Receiver and Speaker Package with iPod Dock. They speaker bolt hole does not line up with the attachment portion of these stands. However, you can use the provided double sided tape to adhere the speakers to the stand or if you are daring, you can drill the speakers onto the stands through the provided drill holes. I chose the double sided tape option and feel fine with that. I would rather not take a drill to my newly bought speaker system...Thats all!

A great product at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Economy stands don't look cheap","review":"Speaker stands are only expected to do a few things.1. Hold the speaker at variable heights securely: this is done quite well if you are talking about a typical home theater satellite speaker. If you have a 5lb speaker buy a product designed for it. I have a question though: why did they not put the pole in the middle of the triangular base? Instead it is to the side, I have very thin carpet so it isn't much of an issue, but with longer carpet this stand is going to lean toward the heavier side.2. Look good: These stands have a simple design that looks good. The speaker wires are routed out of sight. Ironically the one thing wrong is that their own logo is inadequately glued to the stands. I bought two sets of stands and all the stands in both boxes had this problem. I just simply threw all the logos away, I like the stands better without.3. Be affordable: I couldn't find a comparable product in the same low price range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent speaker stands","review":"I needed some speaker stands in my apartment, but was worried they would not work with the speakers I purchased. These did the trick, and they are made very well. The stands are solid. They don't make you think of 30 dollars at all. This is one of those products which you actually get your money's worth. They will work for just about any speaker, and the cord is hidden inside the pole. Speaker stands can easily be over-priced at the store.

But the manufacturers also include thick double sided tape and even wood screws for attaching other speakers. Overall, I am happy with the purchase and for the price they can't be beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"They work, what else is there?","review":"I like em. They are nice enough to be in the decor' of the condo. They are small enough they blend in, in the corners of the room.. Easy to assemble, easy to attach to any speakers. I had to drill my speakers(Yamaha) but other than that, works great.. They don't tip, but I don't have them high up.. about 48in. and I have concrete floors.I gave it 4 stars because it took a week for amazon to ship after I ordered, but only 2 days to arrive once shipped. It was free, so I can't complain too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, price going up.","review":"Guess the people who market this product are reading the reviews. The price has gone up about 50% in the last six months. That being said, these stands do the non-glamorous job of holding your rear channel speakers. why should you pay big bucks for a pole with a foot on it, made in China. That probably cost two bucks to produce? Is this stand a good price, or are the others just WAY overpriced? I think the latter. But these stands do a good job of holding your speakers, and not being a focal point in your sound system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfect with my Sony DAV-X1 Virtual Surround System","review":"This product gets 5 stars because it's only about $200 cheaper (that was before the increase to over $100 by Amazon - I paid only $33 with free shipping) than Sony's stands. The stands are sturdy and hold my Sony sattelite speakers securely. The stands themselves blend in nicely with my piano black Samsung 56\\" HDTV. Pretty easy to secure the speakers to the stands as Atlantic provides two screw sizes and washers to attach your speakers to the stand.The only flaw I saw was that one of the padding on the base was falling off. I had to flatten out the padding and restick. A minor nuisance that I can live with given the price of these attractive stands."},{"rating":"1","title":"These dont work with...","review":"..old Aiwa HTiB speakers! they are leaning against the L shaped brackets and its very easy for them to fall over! cant seem any way to use the screws the back of the speakers!! so no good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This product was just what I was looking for and I thought it was a good price.

I see now that as usual, you get what you pay for.I am putting mine out for sale and I would not be surprised if i have to give them away. Terrible product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap, work very well.","review":"Initially bought a pair these for my Energy Take Classic 5.1 speaker system. The speaker stands provide multiple options to accommodate different speaker types. I was able to mount using the provided two sided tape. The wire management works very well. The stands look good and are able to hold speakers weighing 2.8 lbs (2lbs is the suggested limit). My only complaint is that they are not perfect for a carpeted floor. They lean very slightly one way or other - no performance issues with speakers though. Over all worked very well so am buying another pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atlantic Speaker Stands to not work with Onyko or Energy Speakers","review":"They are a good idea and attractive enough but there is no mounting holes to work with older Onkyo satellite speakers nor newer Energy 5.1 speakers except for serious double stick tape which I have on order. Since the platfrom is small, I fear small bumps to the speaker will rip them from the double stick tape. I will see shortly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely Complements my Entertainment System, However---","review":"Delivery was quick and the stands look great with my speaker. The set-up was alright, but I wasn't that familiar with the process of spooling the speaker wires through the inside of the speaker stands. I could've used some pointers in the manual on how to do this -- I ended up attaching the wires to a coat hanger and spooling it that way. If there was a better way, I would have no idea how. Next time the manufacturer could possibly provide that information. Otherwise, set-up was fine and the speakers are fastened securely on the stands. Overall a B+."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price. Work with Bose 161's, but with one caveat.","review":"There are many thorough and helpful reviews here, so I am only commenting for those who have lower profile speakers like the Bose 161's. Two other reviewers mentioned they used these stands for Bose 161's and that was a major factor in my purchase. You are able to mount speakers like the 161's horizontally, but the wire mounting bracket is taller than the profile of the speakers when mounted horizontally. It's not as aesthetically pleasing as it would be if you could not see the bracket. Aside from that issue these are solid stands which are very sturdy even on my carpeted floors. They were easy to assemble and position. The aesthetic problem with my speaker model is negligible when I consider the quality of the stands and the price. I would buy them again in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work well for Polk RM6751 speakers","review":"Bought these to pair with Polk RM6751 speakers.

But the enjoyment thinned out quickly. I bought two pairs. In the first, I couldn't tighten one pole's height adjustment, and found a plastic friction fit inside the height knob had cracked. The other pole of the pair slanted slightly off the vertical, which made the stand look cheap. In the second pair, one pole could not be tightened in the base -- it spun around; the threads didn't engage.These might be pretty good value if you're lucky enough to get a quality pair; I threw the dice and lost twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I could Rate 4.5 Stars...Almost Perfect","review":"These are fantastic speaker stands, I purchased a pair for my front Speakers and loved them, the only gripe is the adjustments to get your speaker to sit in the frame at the top is not the best design and does not allow my speakers to sit completely flush with the frame, however that did not stop me from ordering a 2nd pair yesterday for my surround speakers. I bought the first pair for around $30 and when I went back to get another pair they had gone up in price significantly so I waited until they dropped to $27 before buying them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I like them a lot, my experience was very good.

There aren't any quick release tabs or anything of that sort, but those on a budget do not need frills.

The design is good, it's very sturdy and well built. The only fault (and the reason I didn't give it 5 stairs) is because it wasn't totally compatible with the Samsung speakers. The speakers are rounded at the bottom so they don't fit snugly with the stand. Nonetheless, the bolts are enough to hold everything together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent speaker stands","review":"These are excellent speaker stands - even at twice this price. They are sturdy, adaptable to a wide variety of speakers, conceal the wires, and attractive in a very simple/understated way. Haven't seen anything this good at anything close to this price. Bought 2 pair for my rear speakers on my Onkyo 7:1 system - after getting them found them suitable for my front speakers also - ordered another pair and a pair for my son. A very satisfying purchase - ordered on Sunday - rec'd on Wed - free shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speaker Stands","review":"What you see is what you get.

They hide the wires wonderfully and now my surround sound sounds much better than before, because I can have my speakers placed where they are supposed to be. I was a little disappointed that they weren't silver colored like the picture, but I will probably get a new sound system in the future which will probably will be black anyway, so in the long run it was kind of good that the stands are black.

Used plants stands w/small square top for $20.00 each! These stands are well constructed and worked great for our system. Small problem with attaching, but my husband used a double backed tape on the bottom of the speakers to where they sit on the stand and this is working well so far. Stands are on carpet and are remaining in place very well. I would definitely recommend them! They are a great value that you won't find with any other stands I've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price, good product","review":"These stands are very affordable, and that was what caught my eye. However they are surprisingly attractive, and well built (for the price). I'm definitely happy with them and will probably buy two more.The only down side was the lack of good documentation for setup, and the bracket to support the speakers is cheap and didn't really fit my speakers.

Also, one of the stands is a little wobbly despite my best efforts to tighten it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"I did not have a chance to open the boxes until three months after and when I did I discovered that the base of one had broken in half. Not sure if it was due to shipping as the original boxes they were shipped in seemed fine. Was too late to return it so as I purchased two sets just used the other two for my front speakers and the one good one for a back speaker. Not the ideal setup and will eventually replace these with tower speakers. I did try to glue the base together, but the weight of the stand plus a speaker was too much for it to support. Will not buy from this company again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice speaker stands","review":"I really like these speaker stands. Amazing for the price.We have a theater set up in our basement and use these for the two side speakers. The bases are heavy and sturdy, I don't worry at all about these tipping over. Plus they fit nicely underneath the couch so they barely stick out in to the room. Telescoping so you can adjust them to exactly the height you need.My speakers did not fit the mounting configuration on the stands. The stands can hold speakers that have low mounting holes. The mounting holes on my speakers were about 3/4 up the height of the speaker. I used the double sided sticky tape included to mount these speakers. I was a little skeptical but they hold great!Would highly recommond these speaker stands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money, but...","review":"Nice stands for the money, so far they seem nice and stable.

I am very satisfied with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect Stands","review":"I have 4 of these for a 5.1 setup and they are great. My speakers are attached using the double sided adhesives and are on solid enough that I can adjust them just by grabbing the speaker. Putting them together was fairly easy.

I bought the Polk RM705 speaker set. The stands sit on carpeting and are very sturdy for my set up. The only thing I had an issue with was that the Polk speakers didn't have a mounting screw on the back, their mount is on the bottom. This caused a slight issue since this stand is made to work more with back mount screw speakers as opposed to bottom mount screw speakers.

They are of very simple design, yet look very good in the room and don't break the bank. When I was ordering them I thought the bottom plate was made of plastic and was wondering how they would hold my speakers, which weigh about 3lbs. The whole thing is solid steel. A bit rough looking though.Although they weren't exactly designed for my speakers, which have a hole at the bottom, I managed to mount my speakers on the enclosed L bracket that I bent horizontally. Surprisingly the bracket, not the plate, holds them well even though they wobble a bit. I am not worried about them tipping over. They sit pretty well on it. Although L-bracket is of very sturdy construction and is flexible, I wish its legs were a bit thicker for my peace of mind.Instructions are pretty straightforward. They assemble in less than 5 minutes. For $40, they are a great value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atlantic Satellite 77305018 2 Speaker Stands (Black)","review":"Overall, I am very pleased with these stands. The bases are a little large, but that does add support for larger satellite speakers. They are somewhat triangular, with the rear section of the base having a small notch in the bottom for the wire to pass out of and be held down by. My speakers are very small, from a SONY HTIB system with wireless rears, so it looks a little much, but whatever. After a while, you aren't noticing them anymore, except by ear, doing exactly what they are supposed to do. The assembly is pretty easy. I had them both put together and speakers attached in 15 mins, including running the wires through the pipes.

We cut some wooden supports, painted them black to match our Yamaha speakers and drilled holes to line up with the holes in the bottom of our speakers--worked great a looks just fine.

The other issue was I wasn't able to get one of my speaker wires thru the stand but that may just require some finesse to correct the issue.Overall very good speaker stands; inobtrusive, easy to assemble, very cost effective.Only Cons: not very elegant, difficult to feed wire thru stand (if you are worried about hiding the wires)."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product for the price","review":"Product works as advertised.

The same with second album Shiny. KE's record company (RCA/BMG) didn't promote this album any way and even never released it in USA.The CD Single Strange World is in my opinion a great pop song with the unique voice of Ke Grivois."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's attractive","review":"The product is of adequate quality, but is not as sturdy as it should be.

I'm okay with my purchase buy now awed about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely delightful","review":"If you have any taste for nineteenth-century music for winds, this recording is well worth the price. Elgar's wind compositions are often considered mere juvenilia, but they are everything I wanted to hear--light, charming, graceful, full of good cheer and sweetness, elegantly performed. Listening to this music brightens my day, and I'd certainly be inclined to purchase more recordings from the artists, Athena Ensemble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit IS300","review":"The manufacturer states that this exhaust will fit a Lexus IS300, but when I had it installed, it was about 3 to 4 inches too long and had to be cut and welded. Also, the angles of the pipe flanges were a bit off to be a direct replacement for the Lexus OEM part. Not the easy replacement I was expecting it to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problematic, Offensive Film","review":"Stylistically this film was interesting. HOWEVER. This film is seriously problematic in its portrayal of a trans woman. I didn't even buy that Veronica was trans. Her identity seemed based around clothing and surgery as opposed to an actual gender identity. One reviewer talks about this being an accurate portrayal of a trans woman or representative of the trans experience? As someone who is trans and has many trans* friends, I have to strongly disagree. This film manages to hit every unrealistic stereotype about trans women. I wonder if anyone involved in the making of this film was even queer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass the Soap","review":"This wasn't a bad bit of film-making. It is a foreign film and it has a somewhat under-developed plot. The acting is slightly better than daytime soaps, but it is kinda cute in its own way. I wouldn't recommend it to someone seeking a good film on trans-related topics or drama. It is what it purports to be, a soap-opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth tracking down...","review":"This is a fantastic assortment of Tierney's \\"Simon Magus\\" tales, his heroic character based on the biblical Simon Magus. The stories nicely blend of swords-&-sorcery and historical elements, as they are set during Roman times. Fans of Robert E. Howard and Lovecraft are likely to enjoy these, as he is a mature and well-researched take on weird fiction. A must for serious fans of the genre! Find a copy now, before the prices shoot through the roof -- they are already getting up there.Also worth finding is the \\"Gardens of Luculles\\", Tierney's more recent novel-length Simon story, which is still available direct from Flint & Silver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Surf Movie","review":"I totally reccomend this movie for any one who surfs a longboard. or is thinking of starting It captures the essence of a new movement in long boarding.

To me, this about a psychological side to the \\"Rambos,\\" and other one man army type soldiers of war. It shows how deeply troubled they are with the world, and other dilemmas that have occurred with their private lives. I think this story is more of a tale between a son with a father who is mentally ill. I think the Vietnam War is just a story that occurred and had a part of the drama. It's something that just makes this man more interesting in his character. The fact that he was a former Navy Seal unfortunately makes him much more dangerous to the rest of societyI think people dislike films like this the most because they feel uncomfortable being in the face of mental illness. I assume it's much more comfortable for them to turn their back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distant Thunder","review":"I watched the movie because I am a Ralph Macchio fan as well as a fan of John Lithgow.

I was hoping to introduce my son to the pleasures of the Three Stooges that I had as a kid, but instead found myself having to cut it off before I soured him on the stooges. The bulk of the segments have \\"Curly Joe\\", not \\"Curly\\" and are from the 60s. To compound the offense, GoodTimes Video elected to present the collection on EP mode to save a few cents of tape.In its defense, there are several esoteric clips that the Stoogephile will want in their collection. But you most certainly will not want to use this to introduce your kids to the stooges.Personally, I would like to see any manufacturer that sells video on anything but SP mode taken out and shot(or at least given a 2 finger eye-poke). I was thinking tonight that at least this will be behind us with DVD, but then I realized that they'll just increase the compression ratio to get whatever they want on the disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"It seems to protect my computer alright.

This set transcends your typical gathering of dusty attic leftovers, lost recordings, and unfinished thoughts. A collective of mind bending proportions, that will dig deep into your psyche and fester for as long as own this album. If the packaging by Anti records is truly a limited edition, well then you better go out and get yourself one... today. Your subconscious will thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment with Orphans","review":"Tom Waits is such an engaging artist and writer, but this latest attempt at entertainment is so very disappointing. Too much shouting vs. singing on this group of songs. There are a couple of pieces on the Bawlers disc which are pleasant, but for the most part this is a mound of what comes out of the back end of the horse. I would prefer a reading of the poetry instead of this substitute for song. Come on Tom, let your voice make music, not road gravel."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG - What the #### is this?","review":"Wow, all I can say. I got this from my library and being a tax paying citizen of my city, they got ripped off.I am thinking about not returning it to spare others the pain but they will just buy another one giving Tom the false impression that peopl actually LIKE this! WTF is this supposed to be?My God, what record company listened to this and thought, \\"yeah, lets publish this with a big book\\" I think it was the person who thought up \\"New Coke\\". Wow, all I can say."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Confirmed Waits Fans only.","review":"Look, I'm a Tom Waits fan, but most of this album was pretty inaccessible to me. When you get to a certain level as a musician and song writer you get to do an album like this because your recording label probably has to let you. Tom has probably wanted to do this for a long time, but I think he is mostly talking (muttering actually) to himself here. If you are really, really, really into his work this may be signature stuff, but I think most people will not be able to get much from this.I don't regret buying it, because I like to look into his pretty amazing head, and if you have a copy it will no doubt be a collector's item in 20 years---but it will be because you will be one of only a few dozen owners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waits' Orphans - well worth it!","review":"This 3 CD compilation is great. each cd has a 'theme' - you may tend to like one more than the other - but all 3 are Waits at his best.

Raw and real yes, but that's the best I can say about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a singer, he's a good writer.","review":"Tom Waits as a singer is a fraud. His 'voice' is as contrived in the same way white women sing the blues; trying to sound different than their given voice. I have this collection on my music server and, almost always, when a song comes up randomly, I push the \\"skip/next selection\\" button on the remote. If you like fakes, you just might love Tom Waits, but then, isn't that why you're even reading this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks,but then again what do you expect?","review":"Tom Waits is the most overrated,undertalented jerk in the history of music.Every time my husband listens to this,I almost go into seizures,it sucks so much.I'm thinking about leaving him over this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd one out","review":"I've been a Tom Waits fan for over 20 years but he's lost me on this one, this is a big disappointment.

As usual, it comes with lyrics and notes, but the most amusing part of the booklet are the random photos. Things that look like pee stains, garbage, etc. It's odd but characteristic of Mr. Waits's sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not an Introductory Set","review":"If you already love Tom Waits, you'll love this like I do. If you don't, find some kindly friend to introduce you to him slowly. Most of us have our preferred eras of Tom, and this sprawling compilation is a Frankenstein's monster of multiple Toms. There's an even split here I'd lump into 3 categories: a) songs I never knew before i couldn't live without, b) songs I leap across the room to skip past every time, and c) songs I could care less about.i have to suspect that most other Tom Waits fans who purchased this have a similar breakdown. The thing is, probably none of them have the same songs in the same groups as each other. that's just the way of it, take it or leave it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this from this world?","review":"Tom Waits is probably the only Angel on this world who has seen the devil in the eyes. His Music is truely not from this world, not comparable to anything you have heard before, you just love to drawn in his cosmos and never face the bitter reality again. Nobody describes better the devistating nature of true love, the pain of saying good bye and the joy of sadness.In my opinion, this is his best album because you have never been closer to what really touches the soul of this great musician.I am deeply moved, astonished, inspired and thankful for his music and this album and I guarantee you to feel the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every facet of Tom","review":"What a treat for the Tom Waits fan and also great as an introduction for the new listener.

I liked the earlier version, but many of the things the older version had were either missing or less user friendly in 8.0. I couldn't load the files from version 2.0 directly into the new, (fortunately the old computer is still running so I could manually copy one to the other.) The entry process had a lot of unecessary steps which slowed down the process. Version 2.0 reminds you of missed date entries, the new one doesn't.The version 8.0 has a lot of bells and whistles, like fax/cell/watts numbers, direct connection to e-mail, and a few others. The technical assist to Anytime is non-existant, either by 3 no-responce e-mails or 45 minutes on the phone. I'd stick with version 2.0 if you can load it into your computer, otherwise stick with Outlook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy if you want support","review":"Anytime Deluxe 9.0 sounds good for the money. Mine quit working on WinXP after 2 days, and tech support did not reply to my complaint for over a week, when I was given the address to their FAQ page. It contained no helpful information. After calling them, the tech support person admitted there was a problem, and had me modify my registry. The software ran for about 2-3 days, and then stopped working again. I have called and written emails and tech support has not responded in over a week. Even at its best, the software is mediocre - so save your money and buy some software that works and that the company will support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"Have been using this (actually version 9) for a week or so.

To call this experimental wouldn't do it justice, because they touch on all corners, from sweet and watery ambience to the hard-edged distorted beats that have been copied in music by Autechre and Aphex Twin. Tracks like the too-short Seph, the chillingly great Lilith (w/Bjork ... god is she cute!) and the jazzy tempos of Headspin show off the varied forms that Plaid can shape themselves into. Their next LP will be highly anticipated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endless Frontiers","review":"Cynical aficionados of the electronic aesthetic may not be equipped to appreciate the whimsical dynamics presented on this disc.

The voices of Nicolette and Bjork do not eclipse the brilliance of Plaid's music... A music that keeps being something between trip-hop, progressive rock, trance and world music, without missing Plaid's originality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked cool!","review":"I enjoyed this book because I learned a lot about Italy by reading it. Kelly spends all summer in Italy, touring Rome, Florence, the Vatican, and other smaller towns. She learns about Italy's culture, food, art, and history by sightseeing, talking with locals, and painting. However, the characterization in this book is a little cheesy and stereotypical. Think typical high-school characters: there is a cheerleader, a gothic girl, and a crazy vegan/' activist. Still, I enjoyed reading about Kelly's adventures.

March 16, 2004 beat me to the punch. He said it all most beautifully and accurately. All I will add is that I and the women in my family have opted for natural alternatives such as diet, exercise, vitamins, herbs, good skin care and a very positive attitude. We are all healthier and happier than before the change and are not falling apart or shriveling up. Please do not buy into the belief that menopause must be treated as if it were a disease - it is not. It is just another life phase.

This book was recommended by a friend and has truly changed my life. Hormones play a big part in mood, weight, fat distribution and many other things. I learned enough in this book to ask my gynecologist for a prescription to give my pharmacist, who does compounding, for hormone replacement in a cream form. I use Progesterone and Testosterone and feel much better. I was the first person my gynecologist prescribed hormonal cream for that had not gone thru menopause. This is truly a subject that you need to learn and personalize for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discover the Hormone Connection","review":"As a compounding Pharmacist for 15 of my 30 years of practice, I can honestly say this is a book worth reading. I have purchased 20+ books to lend to my menopausal women so they can understand what they are going through accurately. It is written for non-professional readers yet tells all the true information on menopause. I have over 100 women who I take care of using the techniques suggested by Suzanne. They are all happy and their husbands send me gifts regularly for helping their wives. The best part about this book is Suzanne lets her readers know that their health is in their hands. Doctors and Pharmacist are helpers not the authority."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for every woman","review":"I borrowed this book from my mother and then bought the paperback version for myself.

Estrogen is estrogen, whether from a wild yam or a chemical. One is natural, but it still can cause blood clots and other dangerous side effects. Find an understanding and progressive endocrinologist and work out your therapy together. Does Prozac work for every person who feels a bit sad? Well, same with these \\"miracle\\" hormones."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best advice","review":"While Ms. Somers should be commended for trying to offer women advice regarding their health, the information in this book is sorely lacking some VERY important information.First of all, any woman with breast cancer who chooses to use estrogen should not be writing a book about women's wellbeing.Secondly, the \\"cutting edge\\" doctors of today do no use the estridiol hormone alone any longer, they use another estrogen which is breast protective.There are many other tests, aside from hormone levels, which need to be done and supplements that \\"cutting edge\\" and mainstream doctors are suggesting to prevent estrogen from causing estrogen related cancers.You just don't take hormones so you can feel \\"sexy\\" and young and I just think this book missed the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"spokeswoman for the pharmaceutical companies","review":"It sounds like Suzanne has become a shill for the pharmaceutical companies. Many celebrities get paid to praise prescription drugs in their interviews or books, so she's not the only one doing it. Suzanne claims that without prescription hormone drugs, women CANNOT get through menopause. I've also seen her on TV spinning the same advertising pitch. I'm very suspicious about her \\"message\\" and wonder why journalists aren't taking her to task. Don't be fooled by her use of the word \\"natural.\\" Most doctors will tell you--if they are honest--that prescription hormones are NOT \\"natural.\\" And Suzanne is wrong when she says diet and exercise alone WON'T work. She says women MUST take hormones--or they are losers! There is something extremely fake about her \\"agenda.\\" Wake up ladies and don't take Suzanne's word for it.

Perhaps it's to be used as a diary? I really don't know why it's full of lined paper. There are only 9 photos with witty captions which appear over and over and over throughout the book. Whereas the photos/captions are very funny, they are hard to see/read because they're not color photos, not even black and white photos - they're pale blue/green and white photos, the same color as the lines on the pages.

I personally can't see a reason to spend money on this. The performances come through as stiff as you or me trying to mimic the original Sweet songs. The vocals are poor old-voice attempts to re-create what had once been screaming, energetic vocals. Whoever from the original Sweet took part in this mockery ought to be truly ashamed for perpetrating this ugly knock-off. They've violated the legend and legacy of this awesome glam-rock band. This product shouldn't be called Sweet. It should be called Sour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not install with XP","review":"Could not get it to install on computer.

Indeed, it is hard to get my kid off the computer once she pops in Clifford. Last night she was playing this game and I asked her if she wanted to watch Liar Liar or Bruce Almighty (she's a Jim Carrey nut!). Normally she would drop everything and anything to watch either of those movies, but last night she didn't want to. She wanted to keep playing her Clifford game on the computer. That's when I knew I had to write a 5 star review for this software.

Although the story that goes on around the games is engaging, the actual interface is clumsy and complicated. For example in one matching game you must first click on one item. Then you click on the item that matches and then you go back to the original and click again. In another game, where the dog is supposed to hit the ball with his nose, I just could not make it happen. THe dog would not connect with the ball no matter what I did. We tried it with a mouse and with the touch pad. If I can't manage it there is no way a four year old who is just learning to manipulate a computer is going to manage. We had it on easy mode. If this is meant for the \\"four to six\\" age range, as the package says, then they need to do some more work to make it simpler to manage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Educational game","review":"Bought this game for my 4 year old granddaughter.

However, this log book is a complete waste of time. The information about why the power index and other things is repeated in the beginning and the charts are organized in a haphazard way which makes me completely useless unless you are someone who hates to make your own chart and print it out for use, this book could be useful although it might not pack along well in a gym bag. Who can write in those small charts anyway, the print would have to be so small. The authors need to come out with something more useful than just a log book.

Game play is super simple and easy for her to grasp. Play pieces are nice and large, no small tokens that can be lost or cause a choking hazard for my daughter's younger sister. Object of the game is get the most scoops of ice cream. Just put the scooper into the ice cream tub, push the button and vanilla, chocolate or strawberry will show up. Then you pull out a three scoop of ice cream and try to match it with your sundae bowl cards. Even if my daughter doesn't play it as a game, it makes for wonderful pretend play as an ice cream shop! My youngest has the Winnie the Pooh game by Fisher Price and we love that one too! I plan on getting more of these games! The whimsical style of play keeps them interested, the matching element of the game makes for wonderful observational exercises for them. It is a game that doesn't need any adult interference.

Suicide is not a word that often escapes our lips. There is so much stigma still attached to it. I do not think the stigmas will ever go away, and so much more education is still needed. I know for I have been there. Be forewarned, suicide is on the rise at all age levels. I know the pain that drives one to a desperation point. Being involved in mental health advocacy, both as a victim and a survivor of suicide, I welcome more of this kind of writing. We all need to speak out on this topic.

You have helped me enormously in my suicide prevention work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic","review":"Having been a grief educator with years of hospice experience, I found this book to be very basic at best. Having lost my father recently, I have turned to reading as a form of self help and this book was not helpful to me. I think I may have marked three passages in total. If you like the idea of reading the stories of famous people that have suffered loss, there is something for you here. Also, I found the poetic, Christian hymns, and prayer elements to not really speak to me at all... and I am a Christian. If these things appeal to you, then fine. If you are looking for a very personal, understanding, and insightful work on the loss of a loved one or friend to suicide, I strongly recommend the author Hsu for an excellent 5 star read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensitive and Informative","review":"This is an extremely well researched book what first sensitively describes the tunnel of despair that loved ones passed through before dying by suicide, and then focuses on helpful strategies for recovering from such a shattering loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just O.K.","review":"This was a good basic book. My problem with it is the large amount (nearly last 1/3) of the book that talked about warning signs. To be honest, dealing with the suicide of my father, I found so much on \\"warning signs\\" a slap in the face. Sure, I see them now, but I wouldn't have bought a book that is supposed to help me heal when so much made me feel like \\"Why didn't I see this coming?\\" The first two-thirds and last chapter were fine though and I found myself making a lot of notes in the margins and highlighting. If you're like me though you'll end up skipping the last 30% of the book and it's a short book already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Increased My Understanding of Suicide 10 Fold!","review":"This book was just what I needed to read after the unexpected death of a family member. It opened my eyes to what took place and what was possibly going through the mind of that missed loved one. I recommend this book to anyone who has lost someone from suicide and is struggling to find the answers to questions there will never be answers to. This book helps a lot in that regard and finally helped my mind turn off, or at least dial down for awhile, all those questions that kept me up at night. Suicide is a tragic, ugly thing but thanks to this book, healing can finally start to take place.I don't know what's keeping me from giving the book the full five stars except that I thought the personal stories at the end were kind of odd and unhelpful (at least to me)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Appreciated","review":"At a difficult time in our family's lives, it was comforting to read this book to maybe understand in some way what happened or what drives a person to this point.

I've read it more than once since, and it holds up to scrutiny. If you want a well-written, exhilarating, never predictable read, this is the thriller for you. It's my favourite Alistair Maclean, and that is partially because of the humour, but also because of his superb characters.

Maybe someday they'll realize they should play the music they started with instead of what MTV wants them to play"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor follow up to two excellent albums","review":"I was not impressed at all with this new release. In my opinion, Human Clay is Creed's best work by far and I was expecting this album to at least equal or better Human Clay. Unfortunately, this album is a disappointment. The songwriting is very generic and not very creative and Mark Tremonti's guitar playing is very boring. Nothing creative like on Human Clay and My Own Prison. It seems like the band ran out of good ideas and just threw something together just to put an album out which is what I feared would happen from a band which has set the bar so high for itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"More boring stuff for the masses","review":"It baffles me why groups like Creed remain so popular when they all (like System of a Down, Pearl Jam, Tool, Korn, Matchbox 20, Kid Rock, etc.) sound just alike--and they are not very good to start with.The music on Creed's latest artistic flop sounds just like all those other boring tracks on the last cd. Almost any song could be interchanged with the song \\"Higher.\\" Even the radio-friendly \\"My Sacrifice\\" makes my ears bleed. I wish these guys would just vanish from the music scene. It is really too bad that Fred Durst (who I don't particularly like either really) decided not to kick Creed's whiney, pretty boy butts."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can thank creed...","review":"...for inspiring people to give up on listening to the radio. Because of Creed, someone just stomped his radio to splinters and decided to seek out some decent music. He'll be a better person for it. I read an interview with Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age where he said something along the lines of \\"If you like heavy music and hate Creed, you need somewhere to go,\\" referring to his band. I sort of feel sorry for Creed. They're the perfect scapegoat for what is wrong with music today and take more verbal abuse than any other band, and now they are taking it from one more person. At least they can console themselves with the fact that they are one of the biggest-selling acts in music right now. Don't know how long that will last, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album after all if you like Creed","review":"I'm sorry people, but really, I think others are looking for reviews of this particular album...not of the band. If you don't like Creed, then obviously you won't like the album. Spare us of your bad reviews then! Otherwise, for those of us that do like Creed, I think this is a great followup of their last two albums. I especially like My Sacrifice, which doesn't get enought air play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I found myself rather disappointed with this latest effort by Creed. It seems to me that Scott Stapp has discovered repetition as a musical device, and, having found it, doesn't want to let go anytime soon.There were a few bright spots on the album, however. I found \\"One Last Breath\\" enjoyable, and I liked the title track as well. \\"Lullaby\\" is one I will probably sing to my own child when he or she arrives, but since it is one of the worst offenders in the repetition category, I will definitely cut it short.I realize that Creed was trying to go in a different direction musically with this album, and while that is commendable, I personally didn't want to go that direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore....","review":"I thought the last Creed disc had some interesting material but this one just bores me-REALLY bores me. The first time I heard this disc at a bookstore I could actually guess the direction of the coming chord progressions. So nothing really surprised me, and while I liked a couple of songs, it is very clear that Creed has a formula that they use every time. That formula is showing diminishing returns here. Not worth the $."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creed hits rock bottom","review":"Creed's first album \\"My Own Prison\\" was filled with great unpolished hard rock songs about personal issues and stands out as their best effort. I liked \\"Human Clay\\" for a while, but the constant airplay really made me sick of it and now the songs seem goofy. I was skeptical of \\"Weathered\\" before I heard it when the band compared it to U2's \\"The Joshua Tree.\\" And when I heard it I realized that the only comparison between the two was that they both have eleven songs. \\"Weathered\\" is just too polished and filled with lyrics that are just too preachy. I couldn't believe it when I heard the lyrics \\"you're my daily dose of reality,\\" I mean it sounds like it came from a bad commercial message. The backlash against Creed hit its highest point after this album came out and I can understand why it was their last."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hate crime on my ears!","review":"In these troubling times one must wonder if the continual success of this band does or does not indicate some sort of epicdegredation in American culture. This music is beyond bad, it actually chokes the U.S. with it's own shallow blandness and mediocrity. It is said that art can strengthen and enrich a culture, but this might be a sort of anti-art that does the opposite, much like waht Journey did in the late 70's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some cheese with your whine?","review":"I remember first hearing \\"My Own Prison\\" 4 or so years ago. My jaw dropped as I realized it wasn't Pearl Jam. Last week I went to my friend's bachelor party and watched an alpha-male jock get a lapdance to Scott Stapp bleating \\"My Sacrifice\\". This style of lukewarm grunge is as dated-sounding as hair-metal was in the early 90's. Actually, it's worse because even Winger had decent guitar solos. That makes Creed, and its army of sound-alikes (Nickelback, Puddle of Mudd, Incubus, Default, etc., etc., etc.) possibly the most boring and unimaginative music made since the first animal-skin was ever stretched on a log to create the world's first instrument. Tacky cover art, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"all aboard the grunge train...oops we missed it.","review":"who's sacrafice? i think it was mine, by virtue of spending fifteen dollars and one hour of my life, in a feeble attempt to grow respect for this band. unfortuantely, it was a waste of time for both them and i. as a fair music critic, i can safely say, a music aficionado would be better off purchasing either a Pearl Jam cd or Dan Defeo's Greatest Hits, both of which prominantly dispaly musical mastery and extensive vocal capabilities.

And to make matters worse, now there's a whole slew of \\"post-Creed\\" bands like Nickelback and Default. Someone get me a gun!An intelligent fellow remarked that Creed are today's answer to '70s Journey. Whilst you're at it, you might as well add in the likes of Foreigner, Boston, Kansas and all that other turgid pap that ruled the airwaves back in the day.

Creed are one of those bands that you get sick of hearing after the first time. It has to do both with what corporate america has done to music and also with Scotts arrogant, pompous, lyrics. I will give them credit however for the guitar player Mark Tremonti. He is really talented but i believe he'd be better off playing with a band that actually doesnt BORE you to death. Rock is better when its about REBELLION and AGRESSION. All Creed does is conform with todays Politically Correct swill. You would think Scott would be writing more about rebellion since he was basically shoved religion down his throat at an early age. Oh and Creed are not ripping off Pearl Jam.

Yes, weathered is chock full of ballads, but there are also your fair share of rockers on here. Some times I wonder if i'm listening to the same band. For one, no body can deny that this album is very DIVERSE, yes diverse. Aside from the fact that the singles or top 40 hits do sound alike, the rest go from very different tempos. And to the sheer fact that a band can go from a song like \\"bullets\\" to \\"lulluby\\" in one album is pretty good. Weathered, basicly has someting to offer everybody, and why reaching out to people is such a bad thing is beyond me. My only problem aside from a few songs on here(don't stop dancing,lullby) is the lack of bass that was so evident on the first.

He uses that same voice that PJ's Veeder uses, but only his sounds like a baby-retching. my frined made me listen to this cd, and i must say it is horrible. It is actually worse than anything from Linkin Park(another horrible band).

I'll relish the day when, after the 15 minutes have long-expired, Scott Stapp (or whatever his crummy name is), will pump gas into my car whenever I'm in the vicinity of the trailer park he'll be living in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best effort yet","review":"This is Creed's best effort yet. Weathered is a cohesive CD, moving effectively from one song to the next. It is best listened to as a whole and not in pieces. They've come miles from their first CD, and I'm looking forward to what's next.It seems like there are a lot of music snobs out there - lighten up! So Creed is derivative, what band isn't? Even Pearl Jam was accused of ripping off Zeppelin with \\"Given to Fly\\". Creed is attempting to forge their own path, and I'm impressed with their website and their offering of their music for free. Clearly they're in tune with their fans.But forget about instant gratification, this CD merits more than one listening to really appreciate it. So if you've got the time... believe me, it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This music makes me want to rip my face off","review":"I never have been terribly fond of Creed....their first two albums were mediocre and \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" and its ensuing video were absolutely obnoxious. However, this is the last straw. How \\"spiritual\\" dreck like this is popular, I'll never know. Most likely, it's because the public needs someone to be Pearl Jam, and Pearl Jam decided they didn't want to do that a long time ago. Actually, Weathered doesn't sound as much like Pearl Jam....it sounds more like Tool. Really, really bad Tool. Funny, before this CD I had no idea what really bad Tool could sound like.....better luck next time Stapp. Or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky weather","review":"They went Nu-metal and now they are just one of clones of Linkin park's.Limp bizkit's and Puddle of mudd's.wow,what a shame.they were writing some good songs now Creed is a trio of screaming puppets."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won this CD, and promptly gave it away","review":"Yo, man from the land of God, Stapp was a former pro ping-pong player! Come down from your rant against 'pansy' bands, unless you can imagine Stapp in short-shorts, t-shirt, and a headband, hitting the ol' ping-pong ball around every weekend, and consider that befitting his tough guy image!Expand your horizons, listen to more music, music that has a point (re: nothing you will never find on the radio). Soon, Creed will fade away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creed is brain-washing our youth","review":"Creed is not about God, love, respect or anything that most christians might believe their music is about. Creed is trying to brain-wash everyone with their particular brand of annoying music. The song \\"My Sacrifice\\" makes references to Creed being the second coming of Jesus Christ. The lyrics are riddled with satanistic ideology. DO NOT buy this CD. You will never be the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"An evolvement from Human Clay and My Own Prison","review":"While My Own Prison is still their best, weathered is by no means horrible. It combiines the sounds of their two previous albums in a great sonic collage. Bullets is by far their heaviest song; One Last Breath is extemely laconic, and the Zeppelin-esque My Sacrifice are the radio wonders from the album. But it's the rest of the stuff that make the album well rounded; stuff like Stand Here With Me, Weathered and Don't Stop Dancing make this album a great buy. Go get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CREED CD YET","review":"I first started liking Creed when they came out with Human Clay. I had no idea their 3rd album would be this good. Every single song is great. If I had to pick a favorite, it would have to be \\"Freedom Fighter\\", but all of the songs rock. I personally recommend this CD to any rock fan. You won't regret it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weathered is a Triumph for Creed","review":"Why has this album stayed at number 1 for so many weeks you ask? Because it's by far the best album to come out of 2001. Creed created a great album in Human Clay and with Weathered, they've mastered the formula that got them to the top. From start to finish, this album has excellent song. Cuts like \\"Bullets\\" and \\"Signs\\" rock incredibly hard and are filled with so much emotion. The more radio friendly tracks like \\"One Last Breath\\" and \\"My Sacrifice\\" are done well, showing that not everything meant for mainstream consumption has to be awful. The 8 plus minute \\"Who's Got my Back\\" stimulates lots of interest with a 70s style rock track that doesn't really get going until 4 minutes into the song. An appropriately acoustic finish \\"Lullaby\\", leaves you calm at the end of the cd after all the great hard rock that comes before it. Creed is on top of their game and even if certain other reviewers can't see that, this is as great as mainstream rock will get."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"In all honesty Creed is an extremely talented band. And because of what they offered in the past I was expectant of them to continue that trend. Unfortunately, that could not be done with \\"Weathered\\" which was an ultimately bland release. With the exception of a few songs such as \\"Bullets\\", \\"Signs\\" and \\"My Sacrifice\\" most songs don't seem to have much motivation behind them. I have one other gripe with this album, clearly written on the CD is Creed's official website. Honestly guys, lets keep it about the music and save the advertising for somewhere else. The only thing that kept me from giving this one star is the fact Creed is a stellar band and their talent goes far beyond what this release has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"AIRHEADS","review":"Okay, I've finally figured out where these guys came from. But for the life of me, I can't figure out which one is Adam Sandler."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"there is not much to say, except that i expected so much more from what i got on this album. i brought it after hearing \\"my sacrifice\\", but unfortunately this ended up to be the only song worth listening to on the album. i really enjoyed \\"human clay\\", creed's previous offering, but i think they are moving in a dangerous direction with \\"weathered\\". all the songs sound alike: like the band is trying too hard to prove something, and that they are stronger than whatever it is that they have gone through. gone is the earnest tone from \\"arms wide open\\", replaced by an in your face, here i am like it or not 'tude from scott stapp. this is just my opinion, but creed doesn't wear this suit well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same ol, Same ol","review":"This isn't a bad album. \\"My Own Prison\\" and \\"Human Clay\\" were different albums in their own right, exploring different areas of music and showing Creed's development as a band. \\"Weathered\\" might as well have been called \\"Human Clay II\\", except not nearly as good. I'm not sure what they were trying to do, or if some record executive weasel had some input into the album. But this album just doesn't get it right.Oh yeah and LAY OFF THE RELIGION! You say you aren't pushing religion on anyone or a christian band, so drop it already. Or is there money to be made there..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"This album is weak! Usually you find a couple of great songs on an album, and the rest are just ok. This album is no different, except it is missing the couple of really great songs. If you want to listen to a whole album of B-sides by Creed, this is the one for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, but isn't the #1 album usually awful?","review":"As i read in a recent review, Creed are the modern day equivelant of Journey. Low on substance, lyrically and musically trite, but ridiculously popular with suburban types who don't know any better. People who like their rock non threatening, processed and watered down. Pretty much aural wallpaper. These guys arent the worst rock music has to offer, but they certainly aren't very good. The drummer for this band plays the worst, most uninventive drums i have ever heard. Lumbering. And with this album, it is obvious all the giant leaps these guys have made musically(sarcastic). Talk about milking a sound for all it's worth. Anyway, these guys are harmless, the real rock will always be under the surface for those with a sense of what matters to find. Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd Rather Puncture My Eardrums With A Rusted Nail","review":"Let me start by saying this: I am no Creed hater. I thought \\"My Own Prison\\" and \\"Human Clay\\" were...alright...But \\"Weathered\\" is nothing if not hypocritical...How? I'll tell ya how. Stapp has, several times, said that his band is NOT a religious rock group...But they are starting to sound like that more and more. In \\"One Last Breath\\" he uses the line \\"...His grace...\\" Hello!Of this CD the only song worth listening to is \\"Bullets\\" and \\"My Sacrafice\\"Throughout this CD, (like the their last two) Stapp's syrupy poetric lyrics make him sound like a whinebag! The lyrics wrap around him and his wife and his son...(all you have to do is listen to them)...It's always HIM that's sacrificing something, and in \\"Bullets\\" someone or something wants something that he has....Something...\\"I THINK THEY SHOOT 'CAUSE THEY WANT IITTTT!\\" or something to that effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creed is horrible","review":"Creed have become the poster boys for hard rock. Too bad, it's nothing but bland, soft, wimpy, whiny, generic rock. No, Weathered is not a musical masterpiece and no, Creed didn't go downhill on this release. They stayed exactly where they were. The only difference is now they have no bass player. That is horribly retarted. \\"Bullets\\" is not heavy. It's dumb. Scott Stapp is not capable of making heavy vocals. He is capable of making whiny,... hick-like vocals and wearing gay tight leather pants and making dumb hand motions on the videos...The only song they've ever made that is even SOMEWHAT tolerable is \\"My Own Prison\\". This is just as dumb as all that nu-metal garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the 0 star option?","review":"Wow...I can't believe I'm wastin my time on reviewing a Creed album. I'll cut this short. They had nothing to say, they had nothing new to bring to the music world and that's exactly why they didn't have any reason to exist as a band. I bless the day they FINALLY broke up...too bad that stupid singer is going to go solo...they won't stop annoy me with this pre-chewed, seen-a-thousand-billion-times-before, made-for-radio type of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLAGERIZERS!!!","review":"THEY TOTALLY STOLE THE GUITAR RIFF FROM TESLA'S SONG \\"GETTIN BETTER\\" TO BE USED IN THEIR OWN SONG \\"ONE LAST BREATH\\" HOW DARE THEY DO THIS AND NOT GET AWAY WITH THIS. IF YOU DONT AGREE WITH ME, YOU HAVEN'T HEARD BOTH SONGS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creed Gets Wussified","review":"Say what you will about baritone signer Scott Stapp's religious views or his overzealous attitude, Creed's first two records rocked(Yes, even \\"With Arms Wide Open.\\")This record though takes their arena rock ambitions way too far. \\"Bullets\\" is one of the heaviest songs they've ever done, but that's all you get. \\"Don't Stop Dancing\\" and \\"One Last Breath\\" sound so corny that you think it's the 80's all over again. Wicked guitarist Mark Tremonti tries his best to rescue things with the cool Zeppelin-esque riffs of \\"My Sacrifice\\" and the title track, but he can't do it alone. The anger and agression of previous records is gone from Stapp's signature voice. Here he makes impassioned pleas for unity \\"Stand Here With Me,\\" that fall on deaf ears. This record is too slick and shows a big rock band pandering to the middle of the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still trying to sound like Pearl Jam","review":"This CD is not worth the money. It is a waste of space on a disc. Every song is trash and has no chords that you can follow. It's ok if you only know 3 chords, but please put them in the right order. Mark Tremonti plays like he has his fingers stuck in between the strings. I honestly can't see how they are a Christian rock band. There is nothing Christian about them at all and Scott Stapp's God imitations don't help. Whoever coined them as \\"The NEW LED ZEPPELIN\\" should be struck down by the mighty Robert Plant himself. I would avoid this CD at all costs and look elsewhere. Pearl Jam would be a good start."},{"rating":"1","title":"The gayest band ever!","review":"Creed really SUCKS! They are the biggest Pearl Jam rip-off ever! They claim to be Christian, but they still suck.Scott Stapp has the biggest rip-off voice of Ediie Vedder of all time! Creed sucks sucks sucks! Listen to Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice In Chains, Tad, Mother Love Bone, Mudhoney, Temple of the Dog, and Green Water for grunge and Living Sacrifice, Crimson Thorn, Zao, Extol, As I Lay Dying, and Vomitorial Corpulance for goos Christian music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beatiful Melodies - Nasty Voice","review":"First of all, I don't understand how they can sell 847,000 copies in the first week, the melodies are great in this album, but HIS VOICE is so nasty!, he sounds like he's mumbling. But, pop music is pop music and they are extremely overplayed and I really don't think that the lead singer has any talent, but the band is better...maybe they need to get the band players to sing. But, I give it 2 stars because they deserve some sort of recognition, but this album is just being over-played. This album will be going to the used CD store. Sorry, guys, maybe their next album will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scott Stapps side project? Or is Jim Morrison still alive?","review":"These guys are excellent.

Anyway if you want real rock with attitude and TALENT avoid this and get yourself some Zeppelin , AC/DC , or GNR ."},{"rating":"1","title":"MUSIC?!?","review":"How can people fall for these idiotic fakes that can't write music that true music-lovers can actually listen to? EVERY SONG ON THE ALBUM SOUNDS THE SAME AND IS ABOUT THE SAME THING: HOW HORRIBLE MY LIFE IS. It should take a little more depth and thought to write lyrics that enlighten, not depress, the band's fans. So when I see people with their stupid little candles, thinking that this will save their lives (just like Bono will save the world :), I think to myself: Has music really gotten that bad? Do artists now sing what their fans want them to sing? If that's the case, then music has now reached an all time low point. And this album doesn't help much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on...Really Come ON!","review":"I think the more melodic songs like one last breath are good, in the other case i really despise the horrible harder songs like Bullets and Freedom Fighter which i can barely listen to due to Mark Tremonti's so called headbanging music. I thought this was a very terrible effort put forth by this musician i thought had talent now he just disgusts me. Everything else on the album was \\"decent.\\" I would think Creed would put forth a better effort than this. It sounds like they banged this album out in about a month. Very very dissapointing. Try some other good bands and musicians such as Stevie Ray Vaughan or Nirvana. This is my opinion choose what fits your fancy. I suggest you dont buy this because its just another corporate machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated and overhyped","review":"This was a dissapointment.

I love the hard rockin sounds of Bullets, Freedom Fighter, and Weathered. However, while good songs, the poppiness of Don't Stop Dancing and others makes this CD slightly worse of a CD than My Own Prison. Nevertheless, I listen to it all the time. Ignore all the reviews by people who just assume that they are bad because it's cool to hate them and give it a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pencil","review":"Dear god this is a bore. Why am I put in a world where Creed is number 1.

But now that I have expanded my cd collection by a large quantity, this cd just seems lame. Bullets is the only half decent track on the cd, and the lyrics are just bad on it also. The rest are just the same musical structure, same lyrics, over and over again. My Own Prison was a great album, some of the stuff on human clay was decent (definitely not arms wide open or higher though), but this cd just conveys that they have fully sold out. Also, the fact that every other rock band is copying creed's style ticks me off, they are just trying to make money and not real music. I'm not going to buy creed's next cd because this one is proof that they have sold out for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crude!","review":"I'm disappointed with their third album. The first two albums rocked and I saw a lot of potential for them to move into the heavier land of rock but instead they took the softer route and now they're too mellow for my music pleasure. I think couples would enjoy this music for love making but I want something hard core.......like TOOL!!! How can the guitarist play the bass too in concert? I think Creed needs to step back to the Human Clay sound for their next album or they'll end up like Metallica.......and that's not a good place to be.........good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If Michael Bolton had a band...","review":"..it would be Creed! While not the worst music out there (anything mixing rap & rock is worse), Creed certainly takes the cake as being Rock's fruitcake group.

In truth, they are Air Supply with long hair and muscles. Rock has been dead, Creed is making sure of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"The first two songs are a bit \\"hard\\" for my taste, but the rest of the tracks are classic CREED.

I found the song \\"My Sacrafice\\" to be a bit lighter and \\"bubble gummish\\" than the rest of the album. I love Who's Got my Back, One Last Breath, Hide, and Lullably.

Why? Let's take a look:1. This is an EXACT copy of Creed's previous album, Human Clay. Want proof? Listen to \\"My Sacrifice\\" and \\"Higher\\" in sequence. They're the SAME song; same hook, same bridge, same voice, same quasi-religious lyrical bent.2. They're Matchbox 20 with a harder edge.3. The lyrics are facile and certainly not \\"profound\\"; a grade four might have written \\"My Sacrifice\\", for example.4. If you have ANY knowledge of music history, you'll know where their roots and influences lie, and how they blatantly ripped off all of their roots and influences (ex: The Grateful Dead).In Brief: The Creed Formula As Follows:Lyrics With Religious Undertones + Lots Of Guitar Thumping + Gravelly Voice = Human Clay, Weathered, My Own Prison."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Album Is Good, The Live Show Rocks","review":"I had the opportunity to see a rock concert for the first time in years. I saw Creed at a concert January 21, 2002 at the Compaq Center in Houston and they rocked. I heard this cd in its entirety once and the current hit song \\"My Sacrifice\\" which was the song that they closed the set with. Other songs that I heard live from this album were \\"Who's Got My Back\\", \\"Hide\\", \\"Freedom Fighter\\", and \\"Weathered\\". I've the other two albums also and this one doesn't sound as different as it been hyped. But it's still one the better rock albums this side of Y2K. \\"My Sacrifice\\" is a great song even though it seemed to climb the charts slower than \\"Higher\\" just over two years ago. It's about time for another song on the radio, MTV, VH1, etc. This album has at least three more songs worthy of that chance. Catch them live if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polished and Endurable","review":"This album is a surprise. I picked it up based on good reccomendations from the Radio station (before hearing a song) and just slipped it into the CD. It is the first Creed CD I have bought. The good sound started on track one and lasted the whole CD.What truly impresses me about the album is the tight playing of the group and the incredibly polished sounds of all the tracks and consequently the CD. Not one track came across as being one the producer or group didn't care for, so didn't spend time on. The music itself is a great balance of vocals and instrumentation. All of the songs are good. Coupled with the production, it yields a CD that you can put in the car and keep on the same volume and not have to fiddle with it to make each song sound good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Achingly Awful - Screetchfully Screed","review":"Putting religiosity aside and the same for rock credentials (something which no one can really dispute) this recording is mind numbingly noisy...My kids used to play it with great frequency, as I encourage musical exploration, and lyrically speaking it contains interesting messaging...That's not so much the case now...But as far as musicality - wow - this is awful stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best they've done so far.....","review":"When I finally heard that Creed were bringing out a new album I couldn't wait to hear it.

This has a good mix of radio friendly ballads, as well as more in-your-face rock. The bands album artwork was always pretty dire and this is no exception, cheesy layout and digital images don't do the music justice. \`My Sacrifice' is pretty good and \`Don't Stop Dancing' is probably the best ballad on offer, but the whole album is a pretty solid offering overall.

There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING REDEEMING ABOUT THIS BAND! I hate to be that bleak but it's true.Please skip. If your looking for introspective music that isn't pushy, preachy, or bland, try Guster.

They have tried thier best to sum up but they just cant do it. Scott Stapp is such a [bad] song writer. My Own Prison at least didnt aim for high school girls as fans.

After hearing the nonstop wall of distortion and prayer, I decided to call in a Jehova's Witness and discuss the importance of Jesus in our lives. Creed embodies all that is good in Jesus and is another tool of God to bring us out of the darkness and to Him. Creed's potent message is brought forth in the language of the common man so that he may understand His Word. Scott Stapp's vision is unlike any I've ever seen... he can redirect the lives of even the heathen souls like me to the Light. Creed is the voice of God!Yeah..."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGGHHH","review":"Don't waste your money on Creed, a Christian wannabe-rock band whose songs all sound the same and whose lead singer sounds quite constipated.

Sure they were a Pearl Jam knockoff, but they were a FIRST-RATE PEARL JAM KNOCKOFF. The kind of knockoff that showed potential. Sort of like Days of the New. They were a first-rate Alice In Chain knockoff and now look at them. Or I should say him, Travis Meeks. The RED album was one of the greatest albums of 2001. As for Creed, they have squandered their potential and chosen to make the same song over again it seems. Also, to the person whom said that current rock is better than early 90's rock, what are you, nuts. Or just some casual-minded simpleton. Most of what you hear now is just some rip-off of what occurred back then. As for Pearl Jam, they're not any worse. They just mature and add variety to their catalog, unlike Creed, where every song sounds the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"utter toss...","review":"I hate creed,they're yet another commercial rock band thats polluting our music-ways.The singer sounds like hes constipated all the time,the music is predictable and boring,very radio friendly,and their film clips have the lead singer splashing around in water with his top off..dont waste your hard earn cash everyone..and even if its not hard earned,i still wouldnt buy this.....i think thats enough said.P.S .Tool are the best band in the world"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album runs the gamut...","review":"...from the softest songs Creed has done (Lullaby), to the hardest (Bullets, Freedom Fighter).

Do you know about the BAND themselves? Not just the type of songs?I saw them live in April 1999, and they PLAYED hard and great. They didn't care about being on MTV or on 'Scream' soundtracks, or whatever. They cared about pleasing ROCK fans. Scott Stapp must be giving in to all the teenage girls listening to Top 40."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bow down to the best!","review":"I don't really care what other people think, or what people think of me for this, but Creed is one of my favorite bands. They have been ever since I first heard them way back in 1997 (yep, they were around back then!), and they still are today. I don't care how much MTV plays them, I don't even watch MTV! I can't even spell MTV! Anyway, this album is perfect. With heavier songs like \\"Bullets\\" and \\"Freedom Fighter\\", and softer songs like \\"Lullaby\\" and \\"Hide\\", you get a little bit of everything. The vocals are great, the musicians play well (Tremonti rules!), and the lyrics are meaningful. Not a bad song here at all. This is the best album to come out in a long time. Stop saying they ripped off Pearl Jam, and that they have no talent. Think for yourself, and you'll see why it's good. Oh, and I like Pearl Jam too. I am from Seattle, after all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wish i didn't get this (as a gift)","review":"first off...let me say that i do not like Creed as much as i used to...i first liked Human Clay when it came out, and then i became interested in other (more talented) bands. So when i heard Creed was coming out with a CD, i was not planning on getting it. In fact, i tried to avoid it. A good friend of mine called me afew days ago and said he got me a new CD for my B-day, and i had hopes that maybe it was one i actually wanted, but then he told me he got me this CD, and i was SO disappointed. The only songs i even listen to on it are Bullets and Who's Got my Back; the others (are) pretty (bad) . And they probably don't even deserve credit for those songs, the way people are talking about them ripping off other artists (i don't listen to Pearl Jam or Led Zeppelin so i wouldn't know). I would sell it to someone at skool, but i don't want to offend my friend who bought it for me.....sorry, i'll just stick to Deftones and A Perfect Circle...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cread Suck","review":"I hed thas cd for long time and I think it suck, anyways I think it isnt soundful, but anyways neither is Cread at all.

Remember when they were big and everyone liked them? Remember when every time you turned on the radio, you heard Scott Stapp's rough voice sing, \\"Can you take me higher...\\"? That got really old, didn't it? It was a good song, but I would rate it #1 on the list of the most played out songs in history. And then do you remember when \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" came out, and through badly written music, Mr. Stapp made the birth of his first child seem like going through depression treatment? My point is, that Creed could have been a great group, but we were overindulged and now I can't stomach them anymore. It's like eating too much chocolate and then vomitting. I have heard the new album, and it sounds just the same as \\"Human Clay\\" which turned rotten long ago. Nice try, Creed, but please, face reality and give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"about this","review":"This CD seems awfully more referential to 80s hair metal, than Pearl Jam. This guys seem to pretend they are in pain too much (as many DO), but don't make anything more of it.

The result is dull, unchallenging."},{"rating":"1","title":"only God can save us from Creed","review":"Arguably the worst band of the past 15 years. I'd rather be stuck in a locked room with Laurence Welk piped in for eternity than have to be subjected to one of Creed's songs again. The part of the 'My Sacrifice' video where Staph pulls himself out of the water into the boat has to be the most sickening and self-absorbed moment in video history. Don't compare them to Pearl Jam - it's an insult to that great and risk taking Seattle band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is there not an option for 0 Stars?","review":"Horrible Band, wouldnt buy the CD, I pitty the man that waisted their money. I'm just getting fed up with this processed uncreative poppiness of a band who has this incredibly flamming lead singer. Hey, I've got the same tank top that Strapp wears in the Higher video (and I am not a guy). I'm just wondering why you people think that record sales equals good music. I feel sorry for you people that think this music is \\"Christian.\\" What part of Christian do you see in this band. The hypocracy in everything they sing about, maybe? Creed is the same processed cheese as all the teeny boppers you seem to hate, they have no talent, and will leave no landmark of any kind in the music industry. I promise you when kids today grow up and say who they inspired to be like, Creed will not be one of them. Please quit filling your mind with the nonsense!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh.","review":"This was painful to listen. The album is one of the worst I have ever listened to and I have listened to some bad albums in my life. Everything about it is so bad. The lyrics are corny and cheesy, muscially it is the same thing you hear all the time. no originality, overproduced, glossy, boring, cliched and corny. The lead singers voice is annoying ( I don't think he sounds like Eddie Wedder that much. I like Pear Jam by the way). Not just that but the band members especially the lead singer is so egotistical and self-absored and indulgient that it gets so annoying by the minute. It is a shame because the other band members know how to play but they surely do not know how to write songs and the singer could easily sing differently and make something good out of his voice.I give them 2 stars because they obviously spent a lot of time in the studio making this sad exscuse for an album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creed is ...","review":"I'm not just given this album a bad review because I dislike Scott Stapp, it's because this cd was absolutey horrible. Sure, their 1st cd was not all that bad, and then their 2nd \\"Human Clay\\", wasn't either, but now it seems to me that all of their music sounds the same. After 3 albums,The only song I can listen to without me turning off the radio is one of their first big hits \\"One\\". If you're super religious, and like religious music, you might like this album, but you can count me out."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this garbage?","review":"Creed has got to be the most pathetic band I've ever heard. They are imitating every popular grunge band, and not doing a very good job of it. They sound a little too much like Pearl Jam. Scott Stapp is a generic lyricist.

Then Creed released Human Clay, and it was a huge improvement. Weathered continues the trend. As always, the lyrics are deep and meaningfull. The entire album has a smooth flow starting with the head-banging Bullets all the way to soft Lullaby. Creed successfully try new things such as an indian vocalist on Who's Got My Back, but keep the classic Creed sound on other songs such as My Sacrafice and Signs. This album is Creed's best release so far and I can't wait to hear how they top it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CREED just keeps getting better & better !!","review":"CREED is one of these bands that will be around for a very long time.

I had great hopes for this band at one time: the magnificent \\"My Own Prison\\" was a classic album. But, alas, Creed decided that sales=self-importance, and \\"Human Clay\\" suffered due to this new egotism. Now, Creed have truly fallen. The band is now an arena-rock scrub.

So, maybe my review is colored by that, but here goes. Track 1 (bullets) is definitely different from anything I have ever heard from Creed, much harder, but I think I like it. Track 3 (who's got my back) is probably my least favorite song on the CD. Track 4 (signs) is an OK song, but is just an average song. Track 2 (freedom fighter), Track 5 (one last breath), and tracks 6 through 10 (My Sacrifice, Stand Here With Me, the title track - Weathered, Hide, and Don't Stop Dancing) of the 11 tracks absolutely Rock and are the kind of quality I and many others have come to expect from Creed. Track 11 (lullaby) is a well sung and well played ballad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like a bad Pearl Jam tribute band.","review":"Pretentious christian guy, Scott Stapp (two t's, two p's) might have copied Eddie Vedder's voice, but it's harder to copy talent.

Music for the masses -- what can I say!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kings of New Rock are dead. Long Live Creed!!!!!!!!!!","review":"If you haven't heard by now, Creed has disbanded. They are no more and I am among the millions of mourners. So now is the time to buy their CD's if you haven't already. Weathered is by far one of the best CD's ever made. I have been an avid Creed fan since \\"My Own Prison\\" hit the radio waves and I didn't think their first album could be topped. Then I went out and bought their second album the day it came out and saw that I was dead wrong. When this album came out I knew that Creed was an entity all its own and that the Trio could not be stopped, save for their own internal turmoil. It was by far better than their first two albums, and that is almost impossible. It completely breaks my heart to know that I will never hear another Creed song again. So I urge you all to pay homage to the Kings of New Rock and show Creed just how much we care and always will! Buy this CD! Long Live Creed!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More safe, predictable music from Creed","review":"On their first album My Own Prison, Creed's raw, unpolished sound was a great compliment to their lyrics. They were really saying something and looked like they were going on to a great music career. However, after they found out what kind of rock music sells the most copies they latched on to that sound and won't let go.On Weathered, Creed's over-produced music is combined with simplistic lyrics. For example, on Stand Here By Me Stapp sings, \\"your my daily dose of reality.\\" It sounds like he got the line from a tv commercial. Other lyrics aren't much better and they are just too preachy on this album.So, if your looking for great music steer clear of Weathered. But if you love by the numbers music from a band that's trying their best to sound like Pearl Jam, any recent Creed, Godsmack, or Nickelback album will be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give this CD a try..","review":"I loved the other Creed albums, but was disappointed when I first listened to this CD. However, I must say that after listening and learning the lyrics, it is now my favorite CD. Trust me, give this CD a chance, and it will grow on you. The music is in-debt, with powerful lyrics. Not like some of the other [garbage]... that is out these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"different is good","review":"This cd is something different from creed, in that it explores somewhat of a harder edge then Stapp and Tremonti are used to. However, I believe that they pull off a very good cd here. Songs like the megahit \\"My Sacrifice\\", with sure hits like \\"Who's Got My Back\\" and \\"Don't Stop Dancing\\" will make you listen to this cd again and again. I say keep up the good work guys, and I can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful.","review":"I find Creed's music thoughtful. The lyrics are never ingenious or overly well-constructed, but they are thoughtful, intriguing, and most of the time inspirational. I do not feel you have to have technically perfect lyrics in order to move people.I am a bit disappointed that they geared so much of this CD toward radio airplay, but the messages in the music are still good. I also believe that they represent a movement away from the bands that feel that the only way to be artistic is to shock people more than the previous bands. As my musical tastes mature, I find that the most distasteful music is no longer the most fun to hear.All-in-all, a good offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its almost over","review":"TRACK 1:Lame.TRACK 2:Zilch.TRACK 3:Embarrassing faux Arabian chant and sound effects.TRACK 4:Revved up guitars.Still weak.TRACK 5:Wannabe ballad.More spiel.TRACK 6:A duet with Ed Vedder.Wait a minute.It's only Scott Stapp!TRACK 7:Tries too hard to be earnest and fails.TRACK 8:Not half bad,but still derivative.(Do these guys have one original idea?)TRACK 9:Awful singing.More failed earnestness.TRACK 10:O.K.Mellow.Nothing special.TRACK 11:Sweet but sappy.With a singer who over emotes every word of every song,a lead guitarist who has yet to come up with an original or interesting riff, or a band that as a whole has not improved one bit,you have little here besides a formulaic,totally derivative nonentity.I don't doubt Scott Stapp's sincerity but musicwise this band is the definition of mediocrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creed represents all that is wrong with rock","review":"Glossy production, vocal posturing, trite and uninspired lyrics, complete and utter lack of integrity, ingenuity, quality.Buy this if you have no desire to listen to good music.Recommendations for those drawn to Creed:Days of the New (Green album)Led Zeppelin (Anything pre-Presence)Pearl JamSoundgardenAlice in ChainsJeff BuckleyToolRadiohead (start with OK Computer)Trust me, listen to the above artists, and you'll never touch Creed again.

Out of all the crappy imitation grunge bands that took over pop radio in the 2000's, Creed is by far the worst. I swear to God that this sounded like Pearl Jam when I first listened to them. Seriously, why did Creed rewrite Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\" THREE TIMES? I mean, this CD sounds exactly identical to \\"Human Clay\\". And grunge died in 1994 after Kurt Cobain killed himself.

The more people start to realize how terrible this band is the better. I have their first two albums, I'll admit that. But I will never *ever* buy this one. And who is actually buying this? I've never actually met someone with a copy of this disc. Well, if you like your metal bland, self-indulgent, over-grandizing, holier-than-thou, and just one big cliche, here you go. This is the band for you. I find Scott to be one of the most laughable front men in the music business, besides his nemesis Fred Durst. Why does that man think he's God?

There is very little buckethead, and what IS there sounds heavily sampled. This is a dj album, NOT a buckethead album. All of the songs are similar, and 2 or 3 of the 5 songs even start out the same way! This CD is representative of bucketheads more annoying side. Only a few times does buckethead actually play rhythm, and when he does its boring (think of a steady 16th note rhythm on E.) His mindless shredding is cool, but at least preface it with a good groove or riff!PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS CD, ITS REALLLY BAD.

I purchased both eMedia as well as Guitar Coach, and now find myself learning primarily from Guitar Coach.

I suggest you do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lost hour","review":"This book is so bad...so very, very bad. Besides being completely cliqued, ridiculous, unentertaining and self-indulgent, Debutante Divorcees is an example of society's (especially New York's) preoccupation with itself. Vogue should save its commendation for a better piece of literature. Bergdorf Blondes was preposterous, but in comparison to Sykes' sophomore effort it looks Pulitzer-prize worthy. There goes an hour I will never get back..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indulge in name dropping and gossip and not much else","review":"Like reading page six? You might enjoy this quick beach read. Sylvie Mortimer is an uncertain newlywed in a group of recently divorced socialites. Lauren Blount, Sylvie's unofficial guide and new friend celebrates her recent divorce and makes it her goal to make out with five men by Memorial Day. In the mean time, Sylvie cannot help but think her husband Hunter is cheating on her with a well-known \\"husband huntress\\". The characters were shallow, weak, and self-indulgent. No one was really an interesting or empathetic character. The ending was quite feeble and unlikely. The social party scene is a fun part of chick lit. However the characters and pitiable narrative failed to create a memorable addition to that genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick but Unsatisfying Read","review":"I enjoyed Bergdorf Blondes -- obviously fluff, but a funny, lighted hearted chronicle of the pursuits of heiresses. Debutante Divorcees is flat -- an unending recitation of designer names, beauty treatments, party throwing, etc. -- with no characters or decent plot lines to relieve the tedium. In Debutante Divorcees, the author doesn't have any fun with her insanely shallow characters -- so it's difficult for a reader to have any fun with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks depth and wit","review":"Characters lack depth, existing only as broad stereotypes, and not very likable ones at that. The plot is incredibly predictable. A quick read, for sure, but lacking in fun, which is what chick lit is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Plum","review":"Plum Sykes deserves a standing ovation: her ridiculous second novel proves once and for all that you can have the talent of a fruit and not only get published (as she did) but HBO can buy the rights to your book and turn it into a series (as I read it was happening). So why should she care if her novel has all the plot of the phone book and the character depth of a kiddie pool? She's still rich! Plum Sykes should be canonized as the patron saint of all talentless, but well-connected, writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even finish it.","review":"I'm all about fluff and I love a good chick lit book, but I just could NOT get into this one to save my life.

It is what it is and Plum Sykes is a fine writer. I actually thought it was way better than her first novel. I had a hard time putting this book down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh, ugh, ugh","review":"I first heard of this book in Vogue, the magazine for which Plum Sykes is a contributor, through a first serial (ie, an excerpt from the book printed in a magazine before it is published) that was reprinted there. Thinking I would like The Debutante Divorcee (because I thought Bergdorf Blondes was excellent), I went out and bought Sykes's new novel.I hated it; I think I'm being generous with my two stars. As a previous reviewer wrote, Plum Sykes makes Paula Abdul look intelligent.The characters are shallow and vapid and lack substance, especially the narrator, who I couldn't stand. The women who appear in The Debutante Divorcee are completely and utterly forgettable. I know that Plum Sykes's connection to one of the most widely-read women's magazines in the world is what got her books published in the first place; but someone should give Sykes a reality check as soon as possible and tell her that writing is simply NOT the career she should be persuing."},{"rating":"1","title":"for the brain dead","review":"I enjoy a quick and easy read as much as the next girl, but this is just lazy and to put it plainly, dumb.

It was quite funny and delicously, unapologetically shallow. However, The Debutante Divorcee was utter dribble. The characters were boring and one-dimensional, there was no plot to speak of, and the book's attempts to be \\"funny\\" fell flat, almost to the point where I felt sorry for the author, who is undoubtably going to be ridiculed for having actually written this. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Absurd,","review":"Oh, poor Plume Sykes. She just cannot string a sentence together to save her life. This was an horrifying example of what passes for fiction today. Don't waste your time with this tripe. Thank Goodness, mine came from the library.Oh it's hilarious the author below me says this is no Davinci Code as if Davinci Code was some super serious book. NOT! However, this book makes Davinci Code look like War and Peace.If you want a good plot compared to this, try another book I read, called,The SAS Self-Defense Handbook: A Complete Guide to Unarmed Combat Techniques by John \\"Lofty\\" Wiseman. I am serious even that had a better plot than this one. (Actually that is a pretty good self defense book)Please Miss Sykes, stop writing and go get your hair done.I gave Miss Sykes a star to prove that she seems to know how to correctly punctuate a sentence here and there."},{"rating":"1","title":"childish, lazy and stupid","review":"The only people defending this trash are obviously friends of Plum Sykes. Trust me: no one who's read this book knows what quantum physics means, me included. A friend gave me this for my birthday. Thanks for nothing!

Or the decade. Actually, I nominate it as the worst book ever published."},{"rating":"1","title":"An embarrassment","review":"Plum Sykes should be embarrassed and so should her publisher. I read this in a store and I just cannot believe she's been allowed to get away with something as pathetic as this. She thinks she's a female Truman Capote but she makes Paula Abdul look clever. There is no story, just a collection of comments that are meant to be clever but fall flat. It's not necessarily her fault -- she's not a writer, she's a socialite and she's copying what her friends say in a pad and then putting it down as if it was a book. The thing we should all do is just to ignore books like this. They'll be forgotten in a year or two anyway but we shouldn't be filling the shelves with trash like this when there are better things to read, and better things to do with our time, like watching paint dry. I'd give it 0 stars, but that's not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"It only got the 2 stars from me because 1. The cute title and 2. The cover. The book took forever to peak and was focused more on dropping designer names than giving us a plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dropped it after 5 pages of reading.","review":"This book felt like a mindless chatter to me. I picked this book up after reading rave reviews about it. The first few pages talks about rich girls being divorced, it failed very terribly to hold my attention. I know I am being very critical here, but it just didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"*gag*","review":"What a pile of vapid tripe. Reading this book actually lowered my IQ. I quess I could've felt stupider, I could've actually paid for this book. If the overexcessive use of the terms \\"darling\\", \\"amazing\\", and \\"delicious\\" don't give you the douche-chills, then you might actually be able to plod your way through this refuse without wanting to take a hot iron to each of the characters' faces. Anyone who likes this vacuous load of landfill fodder probably thinks that Paris Hilton is a great musician."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes lead to disappointment","review":"Like most of the other reviewers in amazon, I loved this authors first novel. This book, however, was a huge disappointment for me.First of all, can any book be filled with more cliches and unlikeble characters who are so contrived? I rolled my eyes several times the first 20 pages or so. Not ver believable or likeable and all the characters thus far sound like poseurs trying hard to be what they think they are supposed to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAH","review":"I really enjoyed Bergdorff Blondes. When I bought this book at the airport I figured that it would be just as good as Plum's first novel. WRONG!! It really bothered me as to how she lacked the trust with her husband and would not communicate with him. The ending was also a bit cliche. I would not bother with this book. If you want a great light quick read, pick up Bergdorff Blondes, or Can You Keep a Secret."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Don't bother. Characters are lifeless, plot is boring, can't believe her first book is a best seller. Maybe it was just pure luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is an editor when you need one?","review":"Debutante Divorcee is possibly the most shallow, vapid attempt at chick lit that I have read in a long while. The characters are completely shallow and as other reviewers have stated, utterly forgettable. I'm not one for calling the moral police, but seriously- This novel is a slap in the face to the institution of marriage. Normally, I enjoy reading about NYC's powerful and elite. Usually, these types of novels are escapist fun. Sykes' novel, however, is just plain repulsive.The dialogue isn't witty and the narrative is pure fluff. How this novel was even published is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"This book was so incredibly vapid. The plot was contrived, and there were no likeable characters whatsoever. Sykes tries for social satire but this is as bad as sitting next to an person at a dinner party who claims to know the society you are in, but is instead an unlikable elitist. It is obvious she got this book published on her name alone which may be more shameful than the book itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries to be funny in a Paris Hilton way but falls short","review":"This book has unlikable characters and tries hard to be funny through outrageous characters and plot developments but falls short. This book is not funny or provacative. And, its certainly not enlightening in any way. Not sure what the author was trying to accomplish with this one, but this book is a snooze fest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute FUN","review":"What can I say, I like a little fluffy chick lit... This book is just that. As with Bergdorff Blondes, the main character is a little more grounded than the rest of her friends, but the outrageousness of their riches just makes it a fun, fantastastical, escapist read. Don't we all sometimes wish that the biggest decision in our life was what dress to wear?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Underwhelmed","review":"I read Bergdorf Blondes earlier this summer and highly recommend it if you'd like to suspend reality for a few hours and get a girly, humorous dose of the high-maintenance lifestyle of a Manhattan socialite. I certainly can't say the same for Debutante Divorcee - the story is far less engaging; the observations of manners, dress, and other details of society life are shallow and don't add much to the storytelling. Worse, the characters evolve from boring to saccharine - and their respective stories are tied up at the end in a very unimaginative, deux ex machina sort of way that will leave you rolling your eyes. Methinks PS could do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally ridiculous... and not in a good way.","review":"I agree with every review I've read above. The characters aren't developed, the plotline went in circles, and the conclusion is totally implausible. The ending comes out of nowhere, as if the author was trying to wrap things up quickly. Don't waste your time, it's not funny or fabulous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Paper","review":"This book was just horrible! The characters were shallow, generic, and cookie-cutter. This book gives the impression that the author wrote it in a month (or maybe I'm being generous here). I will never read one of her novels again. She has no talent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another vapid novel","review":"I agree with those reviewers who said this novel is little more than an endless parade of the young and fabulous, who care more about clothing than their own happiness, and who think that marriage is more about finding the man with the most money than finding love. It does a disservice to women who look for more in life than the next party or couture designer. I do enjoy chick lit, but this novel is a sad representation of that genre. I am only glad I borrowed this book instead of wasting money on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...","review":"I don't think I've ever purchased a more pathetic book than this one. I read the first three chapters before rushing to the bookstore to get my money back! Please, please do yourself a favour and avoid this waste of a novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and light beach read","review":"The characters are one-dimensional at best. The storyline was completely predictable (you'll see the not-so-suprise ending coming a mile away). And the writing is, well, just not that good (dialogue and description are not this author's strong suit). But it was a light, somewhat fun beach read. Totally forgettable, but a guilty indulgence that wasn't entirely regrettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect holiday vacation book","review":"Personally, I adored this book. It was light, funny, and had a great happily ever after ending. The descriptions were vivid and while it had the same guilty pleasure feeling as the first book, it was a bit more readable. Mostly because the narrator was a bit more settled and not swooning over some emotionally abusive fiancé for half the book. I'm giving the book four stars for the fact that it was just what it was intended to be. A light, charming book where everyone (that the reader cares about anyway) lives happily ever after in the end and the reader doesn't have to think too much on the way there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Debutante Divorcee","review":"I was a huge fan of the Bergdorff Blondes and ran out to find the new book by Plumb Sykes. I was so dissapointed to find that this book was not up to her normal writing standards. I was so dissapointed with the story line and characters. I hope that Plum can redeem herself with another wonderful book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"rediculous and hard to believe","review":"This story is just as ridiculous and hard to believe, which also just makes it another funny book that's easy to read at the beach. Don't expect anything too serious, you can finish this in a day or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bankrupt book, embarrassingly bad; she should blanch with shame","review":"It's not that Plum Sykes can't write. It's that she doesn't want to. Debutante Divorcee starts off well with witty descriptions about gorgeous women and their privileged lives and little anecdotes about New York life. Then after a good start, the book just bows out. In the worst, most embarrassing way. The story is incredibly bad, even for this kind of mindless, brain-dead fiction. I mean, really, what is masculine about a husband who plays matchmaker? It actually creeped me out. I've relegated the book to the bathroom; too unworthy of my shelves, and my bargain bin discount was still too much to pay. Yes, I bought and read it, and I am ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"No where near as good as Bergdorf Blondes","review":"If you have read Bergdorf Blondes and are thinking that this will be right up there with it, it isn't. I has character's that are whiney and believe they are entitled. It took me awhile to finish it because of how horribly written it truly was. This is a leave it at the store but if you must read it borrow it from the library book. The only reason i finished it was because i don't ever not finish a book, but this was one i seriously considered not finishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Plum Sykes is back with a delightful new comedy surrounding the exuberant lives of the rich...and single. However, in her newest release, DEBUTANTE DIVORCEE, the main characters have already been down the aisle and done the \\"married thing\\". Now they are actively pursuing the single life, and loving every minute of it. Sykes made a big splash on the Cartier scene with her first release BERGDORF BLONDES. It took the women's fiction novel in a glitzy, glamorous and high end direction. Sykes does not disappoint with her Sophomore effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Question...","review":"... How does this kind of garbage get published? Doesn't Sykes have an editor to tell her that, no matter the author's connections, a novel needs to have interesting characters and a good plot, or at least one of the two?Seriously. I want to know the name of the person who decided to publish this piece of %#@$*! Shame on him or her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than awful","review":"Insufferable characters, idiotic plot, boring story, terrible writing... Plum Sykes needs to find a new job, preferably one that doesn't involve her using a word processor. Whoever told this woman she could write is an idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck????","review":"Gracious, gracious, gracious. This felt like one of the LONGEST books I've ever read. It is so slow and I was determined that I was going to stick with it to the end. I just knew that it was going to get better............no such luck. I absolutely LOVED Plum's book Bergdorf Blondes and was so excited when I bought this book. To be honest, reading this book was about a week in my life that I'll never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Follow-Up","review":"Where Bergdorf Blondes was delightfully witty and tongue-in-cheek, The Debutante Divorcee picks up with a character who never quite develops a sympathetic narrative \\"voice.\\" At times cheesy and painfully laden with cliches, this novel fails to be fun. Half the time, I wondered if Plum Sykes actually had authored this novel-- it was so different from her debut! I hope she can find the delicious character \\"Moi\\" she invented for Bergdorf Blondes so her 3rd novel will actually live up to the hype!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I adored Bergdorf Blondes, and was anxiously awaiting this book. I thought the premise was interesting, and thought it would be funny, but after reading a few pages I found it it wasn't. The characters in BB were shallow AND interesting. The charactters of DD were shallow and not interesting at all. The plot (if you could call it that) was flimsy and, while it's a very fast read, it had none of the charm that BB had. It was a fast read, but unlike BB, I was actually glad to be done with it. Definitely didn't live up to my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not what you know","review":"Oh, I had been looking forward to this. Does Miramax get the advance back - it's pretty awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute cover","review":"The cover is cute, with its elegant and chic suitcases. That's the only good thing I can say about this novel. The rest is bad, bad, oh, so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Plum choice!","review":"Ugh! I picked this book up thinking it would be as much fun as Bergdorf Blondes and was sadly disappointed. The main character is completely paranoid by the thought of her new husband cheating on her and the paranoia is only made worse by her new best friend - the Divorcee in the title. I suffered through the book hoping it would get better, but it never did. The characters are horrible, self centered, shallow women with no redeeming qualities. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I loved Bergdorf Blondes and I was really looking foward to reading the Debutant Divorcee but I found it to be a disappointment and a terrible waste of time and paper.

It didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Poor quality, damaged started slowly as the weeks passed. In three months the phone was out of action.

I bought this USED expecting it to be the SOCIETY OF ILLUSTRATORS volume (#15) published in 1974 (as Products page detail states), but instead received a volume published in 1996 from a different Society altogether - AMERICAN ILLUSTRATION, on West 19th St, in NYC. So, if, like me, you wanted the 1974 Society of Illustrators volume, please NOTE the two used volumes still linked herewith are NOT it. * I did give the volume 2 stars because I'm not saying it's not also a quality volume of American Illustration, it's just misleading as described and want to save another from possible disappointment in purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Whimsical Wonder of Woody Allen Tunes","review":"This compilation of songs extracted from Woody Allen movies from the 1970s to today proves without a doubt that Allen makes the classiest and most unique soundtrack selections of any filmmaker. \\"Film Memories\\" contains the stand-outs from his films, ranging from popular hits such as \\"I'll See You in My Dreams\\" and \\"Fantasy\\" to the delightful surprises of \\"Tropical Mood Meringue\\" and \\"Tickle-Toe.\\" Although \\"Woody Allen's Movies\\" (currently not available) is the most comprehensive collection of Allen film tunes, this CD is a charming and more-than-adequate \\"substitute\\". It's essential for anyone who cherishes Woody Allen films and shares his own taste in music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great film, but a terrible DVD","review":"A minimally adequate version of this film on DVD would be (1) in widescreen (2) with the original Russian title cards plus subtitles. This version of the film is \\"modified to fit your screen.\\" The English titles -- with frequent typos -- are white on black with about 400% more contrast than the rest of the film. The result is unwatchable; as much as I love Eisenstein and this film's St. Petersburg settings, I've never watched more than ten minutes of this DVD. Hopefully it won't be too long before somebody (Criterion, hint, hint?) gives this another try. Until then, I suggest you wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah...","review":"I liked the other Eisenstein movies that I've watched. Alexander Nevsky is a classic and would probably be more of a classic if it were American. Battleship Potemkin is pretty good and has some stuff that gets ripped off by Hollywood. So I thought I would give this one a try.I really wanted to like this movie. It's about the Russian Revolution but for me it lays things on a little too thick. I could only get to about half way through the movie (as the horse is hanging off the bridge is where I stop). Excellent cinematography and music but I couldn't watch more of it. Way too thick for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impressionist Revolutioon","review":"Eisenstein's Tenth Anniversary recreation of the October Uprising certainly isn't designed to educate about the event, it is meant to stir the passions of remembrance. Someone unfamiliar with the events will be pretty lost as far as understanding how the events unfold. Eisenstein's montage style reaches nearly impressionistic levels as the sense of story, which was strong, if undeveloped, in \\"Strike\\", and faded a bit in his second film,Battleship Potemkin, is nearly abandoned for \\"October\\" in favor of impressionistic intercutting.

The mix of Hindu and Muslim is one cause for naming these religious as crazy--in a land where Muslim and Hindu are often at odds.The songs are played on the ektara (one-stringed lute), dougi (small, hand-held, drum), dutara (four-stringed lute), kol (two-skinned drum), bamboo flute, cymbals, and bells worn on the ankles of the singers.These are not for the person looking for jolly Bollywood tunes.

This album was the culmination of their best work. Guy Speranza's vocals are absolutely amazing on this and the previous two albums including Rock City and Narita. Fire Down Under should of put these guys on the chart but sadly did not. Mark Reales guitar work, Venturas song writing and this line up could of takin' the world by storm. If they could pull off a reunion with the late 70's line-up you would be seeing them in stadiums world wide. We need Narita remaster for CD. Buy this album and listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest H.M. recordings of all time","review":"One listen to this awesome recording is enough to justify the saying: What's popular ain't necessarily good, and what's good ain't necessarily popular. Those of you who were (and still are) into RIOT and their music since the early 80's belong an elite group of metal fans. To get to the point, this album ROCKS! I must mention that it is also impeccably produced. This is the kind of stuff that true no-B.S. heavy metal is made of, one of my absolute favorites, accept no imitations! Treat yourself and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reminder of what hard rock used to be","review":"I had this album on cassette in high school and absolutely wore it out!

I think that the latest albums of TD much more listenable and enjoyable rather than earliest. This album is a typical production of Edgar Froese with a little help of Jerome Froese. I can call TD as \\"soundtrack\\" group because by my opinion the soundtrack music is the strongest feature of this electronic group which always will be my favoriteamong others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fit!","review":"I wear this jersey all of the time.

Still this book is a great collection of some of her best photos - including the outstanding Demarchelier nudes. It's also spiced up with some great comments by Laetitia herself, although I was rather disappointed by the comments on her love life: darnit, and I hoped she was saving herself for me! But THE BIGGEST LETDOWN was the low quality paper it was printed on, and they certainly could have included a lot more great photos. I realize they probably wanted to keep the price low, but I'm sure that with as many devoted fans as she has they could have produced a $60 product a still made a mint.

I love to see pictures of models when they were younger or \\"off duty.\\" I guess I do this wondering how much of what I see is real and how much is done with make-up and the camera. What i found was that Laetita is just as alluring in her youth and without the aid of fashion experts. Her family photos were the most amazing. The Mediterranean back-drop and Laetita's haunting eyes seem to melt into one. For God sakes, put me on a plane and get me out of here!

My grandchildren (ages 4, 7 and 8) totally enjoy it. Yes, they do eventually play all the games and hear all the clues, but when they've not played it for a while, they enjoy going back to it. It's colorful and a bit challenging when they first get it. It doesn't take long for the older ones to master it, but they still enjoy playing it. I'd recommend this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sound skips with the sentences and I can't even finish the map whatsover!","review":"I'm stupendously disappointed in I SPY Treasure Hunt deeply! I have I SPY Treasure Hunt book, I SPY Fantasy PC, and I SPY Treasure Hunt PC. I liked the book better than the computer game for too many reasons to think up. First off, when I hear the sound when the girl or boy says the item to find it just skips! Secondly, I've never been able to complete the map findings because there's no item to find that I'm looking for! The third one, there isn't any fun or exciting music in the background when you find an object whatsoever. No offense to any I SPY fans here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Note: Mac OS 9 only","review":"Love the game, my 5-year old can play by herself, she can read the items to find or have them read to her when she has difficulty.One drawback, had to get out an old Mac, this game will not work on OS X native, it requires OS 9, will not play well unless the computer boots in OS 9."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another I-Spy favorite","review":"This is a favorite at home.

Even my parents enjoyed playing this game, even if it says ages 6-10 on the cover.It is just like the I spy books, except after you have solved all the riddles you get to find the hidden tresure. There is only one bad thing about this game. You can only play it once or twice because after a while you know where all the objects are. It is still worth it. Parents, if you get this for your child, I suggest you try it too. It is really fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Again and Again","review":"My 6 year old son got this for his birthday and it is the only computer game that he keeps coming back to. Its challenging, but not so much that kids give up. There are a list of items to spy...I like that you can read the list or, if you are an early reader, listen to the \\"speaker\\" tell you what to look for. It gives kids a little more independence. Nothing bad to say about this game. We really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & challenging","review":"My 5 and 6-year olds didn't seem to want to play, maybe too hard. I enjoyed playing and my 11-year old twins really liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 5 year old loves this software...","review":"As you likely know, the software challenges the child to find objects hidden in a picture. After all objects have been found, you're rewarded with a piece of map. Once the map is complete, you're to solve another puzzle based on clues from the places you've seen.My son has learned about new objects (hair pins and anchors)and new terms (a clock's 'face'). He's also challenged to think from a multitude of perspectives; e.g., when searching for a 4, the solution could be the actual number or a side of a domino or die. A plus for this program is that when the entire puzzle is completed, it can be started anew with new puzzle clues and a new map. As with any program of this sort, a child can simply click around a scene to discover clues, but I believe the intent of this program (visual and mental sharpness) is achieved with proper supervision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fun.","review":"This is a fun computer game and very similar to the I Spy books. We have I Spy Haunted Mansion CD as well and I think this one is much better. I would strongly suggest you choose this one over the the Haunted Mansion. Instead of one game as on Haunted Mansion, there are three games with this program. It is fun and I have found myself sitting up late playing it. THe graphics are neat and the sounds are clear and easy to hear. Well worth the time and money.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game, great graphics","review":"In the typical I Spy tradition, comes a game with great visuals, that encourages kids to develop their logic and attentiveness. The game consists of three separate riddles. Each of these requires the players to visist different locations and spy several objects. Once this challenge is compelted at each location, the player gets a piece of a map. After visiting all locations, the map is composed and givesd you more clues on where to find the treasure.The game is really fun. My 4 year old enjoyed finding the objects and putting the maps together with very little help. The graphics are very detailed and alaive.My only problem with this game is that it has a glitch in the sound. The voice over reading of the riddles is cut off one or two words before the end. This should not be a problem for older kids, but for a 4-5 year olds that cannot read might be a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mac Users Beware!","review":"The product description is wrong, this is NOT OSX software. It's OS9 and can only be run in \\"Classic\\" environment. Any Mac purchased in the last two years, at least, does not come with OS9. You would need to have OS9 installed on your computer in addition to OSX. This will definitely affect the performance of the software and your machine in general.I contacted the company - great_deals_software - and received a very unsatisfactory response. You'd think a company selling computer software would understand the differences between operating systems and be willing to correct the product description.As far as the game itself, I'm sorry I have to leave 1 star, but I was unable to run it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of Fun","review":"At age 38, I had a great time with this game...until my 12 & 6 year old children edged me out of playing! The younger child is starting to read, but not many words. This catered to her by saying the clues aloud on command. It is excellent for strengthening imagination & thinking skills, especially thinking \\"outside the box\\". The older child played for 5 straight hours going through several games consecutively. Ignore the upper age-range on this one. It's for all ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of fun","review":"I bought this game for my 7 year old son who loves I Spy. I think that this is the best one yet. Not only does he play, but my 11 year old daughter likes to do it, too.

There isn't even a detailed listing of the aircraft's dimensions.The book does cover a bit of the F-16s combat record with an account of an Israeli pilot's air-to-air combat kill in an F-16. The account itself however isn't very riveting.If I had looked through this book at a a bookstore, I would have passed on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice; lots of different aspects and games.","review":"I had learned how to type rather well a few years back, but didn't use my skills enough to keep them up to par. So I bought Typing Instructor because, first, it was a good price, and, second, I had heard it had gotten some good reviews. It was very easy to install and use right away. I really like it because you can set your own goals, so no matter if you are a beginner or just a little rusty (like me), you can easily adapt your program accordingly. There are a lot of different games and exercises, plus a program to properly use the numeric keypad. I would give this program 5 stars and recommend it to anyone in need of a little typing assistance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trouble from the start!","review":"I purchased this this program in order to brush up on my typing and to improve my speed and accuracy, but now ,unfortunately, I will be returning it. Here's why>Typing Instructor Deluxe from Individual Software gave me problems from the moment I installed it. The trouble I've had with it is that 1)The partial installation feature is broken and it gives you a cryptic error message before crashing the program. 2)If you attempt to get around this problem too forcefully, it causes Windows to crash. 3)The full installation works, but it gobbles up 500MB of disk space! 4)Customer service is non-existant: you can't get them to answer their phone, and their website is down.I can say that when fully installed it looked OK -- lots of multimedia stuff and games. But the exercises were strictly rudimentary, and there was just one for each lesson. This will bore you to death if you already know how to type. If you don't yet know how, you'll just be throwing your money away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great!","review":"This program is basically good for learning except that it is almost impossible to get to the lessons you want, especially if you want to review.

If I could give it 0 stars I would. The load times were horrible. The interface is impractical. The combat system is awful. You have to push 2 or 3 different buttons just to do a simple attack. If you haven't played the first game the storyline is very confusing. It is incredably difficult, the first time I played it, I walked down the road (after working through about a half hour of load screens) and got slaughtered by 2 goblins. Not just killed or defeated, SLAUGHTERED! I don't think I even hit them once. That is how terrible the controls are.Overall, it isn't worth $2.Morrowind on the other hand, is the same style of game, has far better graphics, better controls, better storyline, better everything (even better load times)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh???

He had recommended it highly and I put it on my 'to read' list. After reading it, I wished that I had gotten to it sooner.'A Table In The Presence' is an inspirational account about the horrors and heroism of the war. It is written from the perspective of a Navy chaplain serving with a Marine Corps battalion. Although it is an historical book, it has a spiritual focus.Lt. Carey Cash recounts many episodes of apparently divine intervention. Several of these stories defy any other explanation.This is a very touching and compelling book. It will be of particular interest to Christians and military veterans and their families. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian's who prayed for the troops in Iraq, read it!","review":"A truly moving book. The book starts its descriptions as the Marines are in Kuwait, soon to get the word to move into Iraq. It paints a portrait of the life of a soldier as they go into combat--the worries, what was faced in battle, etc. All throughout the author tells how prayers were answered in astounding ways. The last two chapters had me in tears--first, because surviving that last push seemed impossible, second, because God gave them His protection in such amazing ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book from someone who was there.","review":"This is a medium to smallish sized war memoir written by a Navy Chaplain who was attached to a section of Marines at the beginning of Gulf War 2. It is well written and relatively easy to read. The conclusion may leave you wanting to ask, \\"What happened next?\\" Of course, the war is still being waged at this time. I met the author and he is what you would expect of an officer, gentleman, and man of God. I enjoyed it and got another copy for my dad. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great first person account of the war.","review":"I usually do not write reviews of books that so many other people have already reviewed, but in this case I felt that I needed to.This is a book written by a military chaplain who has a strong faith in God, and is not afraid to talk about it. We need more like him in the service.It is also one of the first of no doubt many first person accounts of the second Gulf War and is therefore important to the history of the war.The fact that it is written by a chaplain is also unique. I have read many books about war and only recall one other that is written by a chaplian during World War II.The book itself is very easy to read, and is very much from a Christian and US point of view. If these points of view offend you then I would recomened that you not read this book.

He and his wonderful wife Charity are true blessings from God himself. Carey was not only able to minister to the marines and sailors of 1/5 during his tour with 1/5, but he is now able to further his ministry by reaching out even now through his book to touch even more lives.... as you read the book you may question or think the things he describes couldn't be possible, but all you'd have to do is ask any one of the approximate 1200 marines and sailors of First Battallion Fifth Marines who served in 2003 OIF and they'd be able to tell you of the many,many truly miraculous events that occurred where the hand of God himself was there protecting the men of 1/5. If you've ever questioned \\"is there a God?\\"... this book answers that question..thank you Carey"},{"rating":"2","title":"God's Presence","review":"Actually, I bought this as a gift for someone, who needed to understand that God is always near us, even when we wonder about that fact. This book is about the Iraqi War, of course, and our men and women, who face war head on.

I must do a great deal of technical reading and writing so spending an evening with Thomas Black is a particular treat---I think he's someone I'd like to know in real life. Emerson writes well (if a bit heavy on simile) and his plots are well crafted; he makes them more than just who-dun-its by weaving in thought provoking social problems such as homelessness, aides, and drug use. His settings are also great---I love following his travels around Seattle and neighboring towns since I grew up in that area and know right where he is most of the time.

Recorded by many, this song became a world-wide hit and the Linda family did not have enough money for nearly twenty years to buy a stone to put on his grave when he died as a pauper. Even I find myself singing the song that I heard many years ago as I child and then I think of Solomon and become sad. There is so many like him. It hit me tonight when I heard the Tokens on TV sing this and have a chance to finally give credit to Solomon Linda; they did not and instead talked about the key of F in which they originally \\"wrote\\" the song.

This clock is horribly overpriced. Not only that the alarm function didn't work on mine. One might say I got a bad apple, but $150 for an alarm clock made in China!!! That's right, the famous Swiss company makes these in China. I have a Mondaine watch and am completely happy, which is why I took a chance on this one. Don't make the same mistake, unless you don't need the alarm function and are rich. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mondaine Train Alarm Clock","review":"Agree with previous reviewer.

It is a sturdy necklace that still maintains a look of delicateness and class. There are some parts that show a little bit of crude craftsmanship (visible welding on the hollow crucifix) but I think that it mostly just adds to its charm. I would recommend this as a great deal and a really sweet piece for anyone to wear.

Rivaled only by Sting's Russians, Stewart's lyrics do not cry out but rather scold: \\"Russians and Americans maybe you ought to see into the heart of the world not its head.\\" Now, my cassette of this album has been long worn away.

All I can say is that something went wrong or somebody screwed up. Al sounds so....not like Al Stewart of YEAR OF THE CAT, MODERN TIMES or even 24 CARROTS. There are two high points to this album, it is not without slight redemption. \\"Accident on 4th Street\\" and the title track are worth spinning."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Should have Listened to Al, Al","review":"Oh my, how depressing. It's been twenty years since I was first shocked by how trendy this cd was. I still wince when I hear the synthesizers, the moronic beat of the drum machine, the thumping bass lines. I'm all for trying new things, but when it comes to following trends just to make money, that's when I say \\"enough.\\" Al Stewart is one of the most talented singer songwriters around, and to hear him - like so many others - try to prove he was hip in the 80's is just plain disheartening. A few of the songs are acoustic-based and therefore not too jarring, but most of this is drudgery to try to listen to. Even the lyrics - always a Stewart strongpoint - are lackluster. Maybe he can do \\"Russians and Americans: Naked\\" and strip away most of the layers of sheen and fluff. Here's hoping."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Soft-softcore, but fun","review":"Justine's a cute private schoolgirl who's got the hots for her archeology professor, who she often accompanies on his trips.

I recommend this often, and even purchased an additional copy just to loan out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trio","review":"I'm just about finished with this book and it's fascinating. The book starts with the three girls as teenager's and you soon realize that these famous women are very human just like the rest of us. They deal with love, relationships, children, and careers.

For that reason it is debatable whether it is krautrock, although it can easily be classified as such. As prog, I think it rightfully is considered one of the earliest and best records of the movement. Perhaps I have no sense of humor but I was not able to laugh at the electric piano on the first track.

I love Markevitch's conducting, but I was possibly a shade disappointed by him this time; it's the precision and balance that are \\"fantastic\\" here.This is not as wildly daring and exciting as Markevitch often is, and as I always expect this symphony to be. The Sabbath is a mite subdued. I have a feeling, though, that I'll appreciate this version more as time goes on. It's always interesting to hear a different take on a familiar work.

It's a mature version, and full of soap opera story lines that addict viewers like me. This OVA pushed the envelope a little more, which made it even better. The story is a little hard to grasp at first since it just jumps into the anime with no opening or anything. But once you get into it, you're hooked (and thankfully not up another 26 hours).And the small comedies at the end are so hysterical. They make the OVA worth every penny.I found the ending to be absolutely perfect, and a wonderful way to ease out of FY addiction. I have not seen Eikoden, but don't wish to. After the series and the OVA, I'm not going to ruin a good thing.DO NOT WATCH THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN THE FULL SERIES!!!

Most people I know even deny the existance of the first half. The second half is much better! I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who has not seen it but believe me, it is fantastic. You see a lot of new characters and one's mentioned in the series. The animation and music is really nice. Plus, between every episode there is a hysterical 'super deformed' skit involving the Suzaku and the Seiryu and a lot of inside jokes for Fushigi Yugi fans. I highly suggest this and the series.

Such factors as, internal versus external appointments, the use of a committee to make the selection versus a single person , the selection steps, what candidate qualities are most important for success, and much more have been examined using statistical methods. The book is not an easy read but fortunately it is short, 77 pages. Even when it may in some cases hard to understand, the findings are thought provoking, and the list of questions asked is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid, enthusiastic effort","review":"I have to agree with one of the previous reviewers: there is nothing like hearing a band that knows how to play together as a unit. I wore out a cassette of this album. While the second half of the album (after Stagger Lee) is a little weaker and less energetic, the overall album is a fine tribute to early R&R bands. By far their most consistent and well executed effort. The band, as I mentioned, sounds terrific, hitting on all cylinders. The \\"official\\" review seems written by someone who doesn't care for HLN very much, and although I am not a diehard fan, I recommend this one very highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Huey Lewis album ever","review":"This is by far the worst Huey Lewis & The News album ever.

While updating my theoretical framework I ordered the book as soon as it was made available (mainly because I knew Joiner from authoring many journal articles on the subject and thus anticipated expertise and scope in his work). I was not disappointed. Joiner takes the neofite and the scholar into a different perspective on suicide: understanding and learning from empirical evidence as well as professional (and personal) experience. Clearly, a well-structured effort to destigmatize the issue of identifying warning signs and being able to intervene effectively whether your are a concerned relative or friend, for example. Nowadays, where models on suicidal behavior have long overrun mere interpretation Joiner presents with one that captures features of the suicidal process that can be translated into psychological intervention parameters and even public health policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"i am a Chaplain and counsel many that are grieving.

The sex scenes are paint by number and objectable. The main star shows he has no acting range when he stuffs a doctors head into a dead girl.

The album cover is unmistakenly an echo of the covers M-G-M Records did for Joni James and Gogi was being aimed for the same audience. With her full, rich voice; riveting attention to lyrics; and impeccable musicianship Gogi emerged a full-fledged major talent from this first effort on. Bregman was one of the best arrangers in the business and did Ella's early songbooks. He loved working with Gogi.

Soami corresponds to the Satguru. Like the Ramasita movement of Ramananda, the teacher of Kabir Sahib, it has nothing to do with Rama and Sita; Rama corresponds to the Guru and Sita corresponds to the soul of the disciple/initiate.

But the essence of the Exercises is acknowledging the reality of Sin, evil, Hell, etc., realizing the unimaginable Mercy of God, and the fact that every sin deserves eternal damnation.So, in the hopes of helping a relative, a lapsed Catholic who was attempting addiction recovery and needed both spiritual and psychological help, I purchased this book.What I found when it arrived was just the opposite of what I'd hoped for he: this jerk waters down the entire Catholic faith to psychology and teaches the lie that Satan is nothing more than a metaphor.Where he *ought* to be elevating the psychology with religion, he's doing just the opposite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good only as a fire starter.","review":"If you're getting this to help you understand the text book, look else where. This guide expects you to hunt for certain keywords in the text book and fill in the blank. It is formated exactly as the book and it is useless. None of them sample problems in this guide is solved, so you're left with wondering if you did the problems right."},{"rating":"1","title":"unplayable","review":"crash all the time cant fly and plains unflyable .shuld be able to use joystick.to many keys needed to play.game to comlacaded!!!! Truth is its a wast of good money."},{"rating":"2","title":"can it get any better?","review":"If you like World War II aircraft simulations, look no further. There is none better. The aircraft handling is closest to flying a real WWII fighter or bomber as a arm chair jock can get. I fly real small aircraft, and the games stick inputs and responses are close to real as one can get from a computer game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on what you're looking for","review":"Personally I found this book tiresome, repetitious, self-righteous, incoherent, and boring. What worked well for me in Ice Shirt didn't work at all for me here.I recommend this book for people who are interested in experimental literature for its own sake, who find their entertainment value in reading as an abstract intellectual exercise.If you like the inchoate disconnect of cyberpunk you'll like this, and it's very good for what it is. Just don't expect to be engaged, entertained, informed, or enlightened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible edition","review":"The terrible quality of the edition of a great philosophical work (Die Phaenomenologie des Geistes)I've purchased is beyond belief. It is a bad photocopy of a 1923 edition barely legible. I thought that Amazon would have some quality control mechanism in place. Obvioisly I was wrong."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],M={key:0},x={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",x,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(O,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-024007bb"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/60.md","filePath":"quotes/60.md"}'),R={name:"quotes/60.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
