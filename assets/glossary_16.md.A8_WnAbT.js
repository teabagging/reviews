Ella is found here at what I think was her most instinctive and exciting setting; a small jazz Combo swinging for their lives. None of that big band excessiveness here at all! Ella's treatment of 'a night in tunisia' was supreme in every sence, I felt like I was lying on those exotic sand dunes, looking at the starry tunisian skyline. The best track on here for me however was her rendition of that old haunting Monk anthem 'round midnight', I simply cannot put into words...

Indeed not, sir.","review":"I once heard it said \\"There is a thin line between a hug and a choke.\\" Just the same there is a thin line between bluegrass and, well, what isn't bluegrass. While I respect the musicianship and traditions of bluegrass, I am not a fan of the genre.What bluegrass lacked all along was challenging song-writing and melodies that were creative and unpredictable. Chris Thile remedies those shortcomings.Thile has produced a completly instrumental work (I hate it when killer musicians defeat their purpose by trying to write lyrics that are horrible) that is anything but predictable and monotextured. Each song gives a different emotion and association, and therefore, a different feel.Great for driving, cooking, watching rain, just about anything. If you love jazz, new age, classical, or yes, even bluegrass, you will love this cd. Great work, Thile!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some who wander are lost","review":"No doubt, Chris has truly mind-boggling talent, as you'll hear again on the latest Dixie Chicks release, and I have really enjoyed his work with Nickel Creek. But he's really a great vocalist and you'll miss that here. Plus, though some of the tunes are catchy, some seem to wander a bit. If you like that \\"jam\\" sort of feeling as you might find in \\"Strength in Numbers\\" and such CD's, where the chord progressions and melodies seem at times like an arbitrary framework to show off their many-notes-per-second style, then you'll like this. Otherwise, I would first start with his outstanding work in Nickel Creek, and also check out some other nice melodic mando work such as Aubrey Haynie's \\"Doin' My Time.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome solo debut","review":"At first, I either didn't comprehend or appreciate this album. Thile has a very commanding talent on the Mandolin. At first, I thought the songs were just stretches of vigorous mandolin playing with no real sense of stucture or balance. But the more I listened to it, the skill of the compositions and different styles shown though like the sun breaking though storm clouds and illuminating a huge landscape. It is very impressive. He plays with the very best \\"newgrass\\" players on this album and it shows. Playing with the skill and ear of someone twice his age, he makes everyone step up their game. This is just the beginning of his solo albums, The Punch Brothers and his duo with Edgar Meyer are also fantastic. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mandolin Overdose","review":"After having loved Nickel Creek's first album, adoring Chris Thile from the back row of a N.C. concert and digging mandolin music from the likes of Ricky Scaggs, I thought this CD would be a sure favorite. And the music is beautiful, and skillfully done. But after about the third song, my ears seem to close up and I get mandolin overdosed. I guess maybe I'm just not the hardcore mandolin lover one needs to be to fully appreciate this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"Chris has put out one of the best acoustic albums in years. I haven't enjoyed an album this much since Bela, Edgar and Jerry teamed up with Sam Bush and Mark O'Connor on \\"Telluride Sessions.\\" Chris is both a talented writer and musician, and I hope we hear more from him in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangerously Genius...","review":"Since the early 90s, you can't even mention the mandolin in a paragraph without some reference to one of it's most current geniuses, Chris Thile. Though the album is lush with experimental textures in Prog-Grass, the single jazz cut Club G.R.O.S.S. offers a tantazing glimpse of Thile's dangerously potent jazz capability.Does his proflic melodic creativity ever stop? From listening to this CD, one would think not. Exploring the rich tradition of Bluegrass and Celtic, Thile takes us into the 21st Century now, with a whole new slant, a fresh harmonic vocabulary, a treasure of new acoustic textures, all armed with an arsenal of Nashville's most competent veteran studio musicians.And despite his youth, he fits in like he's been there all along. Keep an eye on this one has he redefines the instrument, and develops a whole new role for the mandolin in contemporary music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't get lost with this one","review":"I can only ditto the previous review who said, just because one can play an instrument, doesn't mean one SHOULD play it. It goes without saying that Thile can make a mandolin do things that no-one else can, but unless you are looking for jazz-jam session music - as opposed to the Nickel Creek that brought notice to Thile, you will be grossly disappointed. I wish I had my $$ back. As it is, I tossed the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Strong Return From A Lost Band","review":"After not having a new Hothouse Flowers album for several years, it's nice to discover that these guys haven't forgotten how to play. However, their time off has changed them. Nowhere are the sounds that make \\"Songs from the Rain\\" the snoozer that it is. Instead, the band has shed two members and adopted a harder edge to their music. At times, they veer dangerously close to U2 territory (especially on the title track, which could've come off of \\"Achtung Baby\\"). But, songs like Learning to Walk and Turn Up the Reverb have a unique energy that use to only be evident in the band's live performances. Overall, the album is a welcome reminder that these guys still have a lot of music in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best BBQ tool!","review":"I love this item! I use it all the time on bacon, ham, steaks, sausages, chicken, and vegetables too.

The argument is that most of the Bible can be best interpreted as if it were written as stage dialogue.This book takes the Bible and sets it in stage dialogue and stage direction.

It was one of the original \\"midnight movies\\" and probably worked better in that setting. El Topo (more interesting for its imagery than plot) comes off as a stoned, somewhat campy film highly derivative of Luis Bunuel, Arrabel (Viva La Muerte) and is similar to the early experimental films of Werner Herzog (Even Dwarves Started Small, Fata Morgana). That said if you've heard of all these films and are in the mood for a surrealistic, sacreligious western that drags on for a long time, then El Topo has its moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"EL Topo","review":"I could have given the product no stars.

I suppose that in 1970, the violence and fake blood, gender bending, homosexuality, physical deformity, religious symbolism were big stuff! Shocking! But in reality the film is probably best appreciated by artsy, stoned out movie goers tripping to a midnight movie in 1970.

Then you get extremely tired of it for about a year. Then you never want to see it ever again. But honestly, this is as bad as it gets. There's no decent clothing or decent styles for rooms in your house, and you can never find furnishings that you like. So on my free plays, all my houses looked similar because there was only a few house options I liked. You can't build two story houses, and your Sims stay the same age always. When you have a family, you can't have younger kids, just adults. In story mode, there's only one house that's interesting, and even then, it gets boring.

I've played every version of this series from PC, to PS2, and onto Xbox, and havent been really upset with its rough PC to console translations. This edition though has three vital changes from the PC version. First, sims do not age. Secondly, no building of two story homes. Lastly, the sims work everyday, unlike the PC's 2 days off per week. These arent features that make or break the solid innovation of the series but the game should have been promoted as a stand alone title, and this console version leaves little to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Money well spent","review":"This game is a blast!

Once locked on, it holds signals well, and the data screens are intuitive and easy to navigate through. Map detail on the included basemap is pretty good, although exit data is a little odd (sometimes it will refuse to give you data for a road you are on, or give you the exits for an adjacent road). As a hiker's unit, it's good to know you can still get a bearing with the digital compass and know your approximate ascent rate with the barometer even without a clear sky view.Now, the downside. Locking in is sometimes tediously slow, both on foot or in the vehicle. An external antenna would help, but there is no provision for one, and keeping the unit properly orineted is a bit of a trick. Once locked in, though, it is not much of a problem.All in all, I am very satisfied with this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good selection","review":"You definitely want to keep out from under trees or get out of your car if you want to make certain you don't lose the satellite signal.

Also, it have sent back to garmin twice, once within Warranty and the same issue the screen failed 6 months later. The cost out of warranty was 3/4 of a new garmin.

The road maps that come in the unit are only of large streets. I bought a CD from mapsource(roads and recreation) which was supposed to enhance the etrex maps to give more detail. The problems are that the maps are 5-10 years old. The cord that connects the etrex to the computer is a 9 pin (female)connector which required numerous trips to a local computer store in order to buy adaptors.

Perhaps if you are in an open desert or a similar terrain it is reliable, but even with light tree cover (20-25%) or hills nearby it sadly reports \\"weak signal\\" and cannot calculate your position.

Well after three years of use I've found that I'd rather know where I am than see graphics on the screen. I still use the vista but not for hiking or 4WDing, signal lock under trees is just not good enough.

Ok, I have been around, I will try to figure if it is me, but I have used GPS before and this does not seem right.Luckily, I always terrain navigate with 1:24K maps I produce from Natl Geo, so a non-functioning GPS is not a big deal, just thought it could help.

I have a four year old Garmin that works much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vista is great unit","review":"Being in the military and deploying all across both the US and Europe, I have found the Vista to be a great help. The small size, great reception and ease of setup and use by far outweigh the monsterous battery consumption.If you tend to get lost, need pin-point precision, or are just your average gadget freak, this item is a must have. Just be sure to have a supply of AA batteries on hand or a few sets of rechargables near-by.The carry case, car charger and car mount are great accessories which allow you to protect and use the Vista just about anywhere. The charger is a must for vehicular use as it saves you from draining while driving as well.Though I'd have hoped for a suction mount of the vehicle mount, I found that a good piece of velcro on the dash and on the mount works just fine (since I put it in my personal car as well as military vehicles I'm in)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst unit I have ever used","review":"I bought this unit a couple of years ago based on its features, but soon discovered that it can't normally do the one thing that all GPSs should, tell you where you are. I used my e-Trex Vista for about a year and half and would estimate that I spent 10% to 15% of the time staring at some type of lost signal message. The unit is totally useless under any type of tree cover and often has trouble holding a signal anywhere on overcast days, which means about half the time in the Seattle area where I live. I would not recommend this unit to anyone but my worst enemy."},{"rating":"2","title":"US Marines","review":"This is my second Garmin product in 8 years. It will be the third deployment with a Garmin since September 11th. It has been used to report our position to higher to launch airstikes and receive supporting fire with 81mm mortars. Another plus is the digital compass which gives direction without the interference from metal. Garmin GPS products rock and are very user friendly. My only change would be to make the display for the MGRS a little bigger. I will always have a Garmin by my side and look forward to using it again this March."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best all around GPS","review":"Being a member of the service, it is crucial that I know where I am in the world. I decided to purchase the Garmin eTrex Vista after much consideration of other handhelds on the market. It is one of only a couple in the $200 price range with a build in electronic compass, so you don't need to move around to get a bearing (a big plus when you're trying to sit tight, like hunting). Setting waypoints is easy, and changing pages on the fly is just a button punch away. The compact size is also a bonus (smaller than my digital camera). Along with a variable contrast display and backlight, it's even easy to read at night. Finally, the Amazon price was about $50 below MSRP. All in all, a great purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"It turned on great but took about twenty mins to find anything. then when it did i had me about 2 miles from town. i was in the middle of town, not two miles.

Bottom line I have owned several Garmin products and been quite pleased but the Etrex is not reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent GPS for Hiking and Hunting","review":"I bought this GPS over a year ago and have been pleased with it's performance in a variety of conditions. I've used it in conjunction with the Mapsource US Topographic maps for Hiking, Hunting, and finding my way through Boston's confusing streets. I've used it in 30-100 degree weather, in the Adirondack mountains in the rain, and just for saving locations of places I visit.Combined with the topo software, the Vista makes planning and getting to a destination easy. The detail on the unit and the number of features is fantastic. The 24 MB's has been adequate for all my uses to date. I enjoy the accuracy, backlight, click stick and it being weatherproof more than anything else. Battery life is decent and I find it quite user friendly. Be sure to check out all the available accessories.After purchase, go to [website] to upgrade to the latest firmware."},{"rating":"2","title":"hikers delight , eTrex Vista GPS","review":"Great little GPS for hikers and climbers. Couldn't be any smaller or lighter, yet the display is hi res and easy to read in sunlight. Software is easy to learn - I hardly used the manual. Antenna is sensitive enough it works INSIDE my house & away from windows (we have no metal in our roof). WAAS works in US and also in Australia - where its not supposed to! WAAS does not work in Europe, yet. However, WAAS is slow and you really need a good view of the sky, so I only use it for hi accuracy fixes. GPS altimeter is very accurate regardless of weather. Could be improved if the user could choose between barometric and GPS altitude - the GPS altimeter is weather independent. The only other criticism is the slow serial cable - REALLY! USB should be standard! This is my 3rd GPS. With WAAS disabled, it is as sensitive as a Garmin II+ and far superior in every other respect. Software configurability is fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"shwing","review":"this is my first gps so i can't really compare it to anything but the others i used in the stores. this ( eTrex Vista ) does every thing i would ever want and more. i use it for hiking and jeepin. and this thing is awesome. it does every thing from setting way points to tracking you back to where you started to telling you when the next full moon is. the mapsource software is great and highly detailed. the battery life is ok. 2 AA will last you for a long day hike or so. if you have the money and you are an outdoors kinda person i would go for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Playground","review":"Very enjoyable album. Mostly upbeat pop; a melding of British Invasion with an R&B influence. Think early Style Council/late-era The Jam, the Joboxers, the Rascals, the Temptations, the early Who and a little Stevie Wonder. George Michael fans might like this, too. Well-written songs with a fairly light touch; the guitars get cranked up on occasion, but mainly it's a smooth ride. The focus is on vocals and they are solid as are the harmonies. My only beef here > production is a little heavy on the reverb and it casts a garish tone to the music, but that was prevalent in the 80s. You might find yourself wondering why a bunch of these tunes weren't radio hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"God-exalting worship","review":"Sovereign Grace music has a certain type of sound. This is it. Big vocal choruses and emotive Christ-honoring, God-exalting lyricism. You can tell it is a live album. That's not a bad thing. It's reflexive of the Sovereign Grace style of worship. It's good; you will enjoy and worship God along with this album. My faves are \\"Endless Praises,\\" \\"Count it all Joy,\\" and \\"Jesus, Thank You.\\" Powerfully stirring worship appropriate for an Almighty Savior.Only because of grace,--Jeffrey"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Let me say that this cd is so good that it prompted me to leave my first ever feedback on Amazon.

Since I'd been to the Badlands with a group of friends on my way to Montana, I wanted my parents to be able to see their beauty in HD. I wasn't impressed with the quality of the footage or the content represented. It just felt a bar below professional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I know this is like $5 but I expected a decent movie. Very poor film (there's even footage where you can see sensor dust spots that were not removed) not appropriate for Blu-ray, erratic editing, not a very good narrative, I definitely do not recommend this movie. This is elementary level movie in any case, maybe kids would like it. This could have been much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"a documentary that downgrades the incredible sites it describes!","review":"Could have been done much better, both technically and artistically. I was, before this, looking forward to seeing this, as I was amazed when I visited the Badlands. The movie does not do them justice. Also, no subtitles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for insomnia","review":"I was looking for an interesting program about things to do in the Black Hills and Badlands. While there was some beautiful footage, it did not entice you to vacation there. It barely touched on things to do in the area. They focused on the fossils found there and the different types of animals that USED to roam. That has nothing to do with what's going on there now. Way too much history on Wild Bill Hickock. Nothing about what you can do in Deadwood now. And of course, way too much Native American religious beliefs. I'm not being intolerant. It was just not relevant to your typical National Park exlporation video. I couldn't wait for it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"This Blu-ray is boring and misguided. How such incredible country can be depicted in such a lackluster way, takes talent. Or maybe anti-talent.The \\"stunning high-definition\\" was neither. The subjects, the shots, the angles, the cinematography in general, was amateurish and unspectacular.Speaking of subjects, they chose to waste a significant amount of time on the human history of the region. Recreating Custer's Last Stand and Wounded Knee has nothing to do with the grandeur of these parks. Then they threw in the life and murder of Wild Bill Hickok. I am not joking.These parks are vast enough to fill over an hour of a \\"stunning high-definition\\" Blu-ray, with a tour of the best features. This is what I expected. That is not what I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative but not pleasant to watch","review":"This Blu-ray is very informative but its footage failed to showcase the natural beauty of this National Park. The video could have been done much better, both technically and artistically. It is not the quality of BBC documentaries such as Planet Earth, but of course it is also a lot cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unengaging","review":"I was hoping for another beautiful and engaging documentary, after having bought: \\"Yellowstone - Battle for Life\\".But this is not well done. Unengaged guides repeat information in flat voices, and somewhere in the middle a man that sounds like a school teacher reveals shallow information about a bone collection for what must be at least 20 minutes. None of the interviewed people really has anything to say, and it has too little of photage from the actual places it is supposed to be about.It's like a bad infomercial that runs nonstop in a souvenir shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tales from OSU Sports","review":"If you're a Beaver sports fan, this is a great book to own.

An enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jammin'","review":"I do like this one, but the other rave reviews make me wonder if I'm listening to the same recording. Were it a live concert, it would be an all-star cast & worth being there. As a studio session, it seems more like a parade of solos rather than a cohesive band. The mastering could be better; I had to tweek the volume/EQ to even hear Ray Brown's (always stellar) bass solos. And it seems like Bud Johnson shines best of the three tenors, despite Hawkins's talent & it being Ben's session. Still, I agree with one reviewer in that \\"Time After Time\\", with Ben being the sole soloist, seems the quintessential Ben ballad, with all of his tricks & licks that show up in other songs put to best use in this one. Jam-session CD otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"CUTE.","review":"I bought this because, I wanted a very BASIC pendant that I could wear with something nice OR with jeans and flip flops and ITS EXACTLY THAT. HOWEVER... the color says blue and it's not really. It's more of a milky lavendar. Definately more of a purple hue but, muted. Still, perfect for what I wanted it for.The size isn't huge either. I wanted something small-medium, so, it was perfect. About the size of a quarter but, stretched into an oval shape. the slide is about half an inch too.In all: no bigger than a silver dollar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Dimension","review":"This is without doubt a very inspired album that carries you into another dimension. Relax and enjoy an inspired album; very well recorded as if you were at an intimate night club where you can feel the music.

The bass and drum musicians complemented her style beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peaceful lessons for a challenging world","review":"One of the profound challenges the author makes is to see everything as a reflection of oneself. In a society and world that often prefers to point fingers and blame, this offers revolutionary and mind-expanding possibilities for us all and our relationships.I commend Ricchetti on her many examples that help ground book, giving a glimpse into the years of her personal transformation using the Course in Miracles.

That Was A Crazy Game Of Poker was an immensely popular song at my school when I was in 9th grade. It has pretty generic lyrics that all the kids thought were brilliant and pensive, but it's got upbeat, exhilarating music that is quite enjoyable. Other mentionable songs include Black Rock, Conquering Fools and About Mr. Brown. If you're going to get an O.A.R. album, this is the one to get. The others exhibit abounding tedium that becomes intolerable, but this album has just enough panache and flow to keep listeners relaxed and appeased."},{"rating":"2","title":"scott from lansing, mi YOU ARE WRONG AND ANNOYING!","review":"OAR is plenty talented as dave matthews, they are so much more unique sounding and to say you are glad you didn't buy the cd just makes me sad for you..because you will spend the rest of your life, liking people like dave matthews and not embracing the different styles of music out there who are so much more amazing than you care to find out about. what's your problem with ska anyway, it is a cool mix if it works"},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst cd i've ever heard","review":"this cd was sitting in my apartment one day because a friend of mine had just driven like 14 hours to see them or something and had picked up the cd. being a huge music fan, i put the disc in to see what all the hype was about. at first i thought they were a college band that played in different frats around here or something. even with this misconception i have never heard a bigger pile of ... in my life. alot of people who like oar also like dmb. i personally don't like dave at all, but i can at least admit that he has extraordinary talent, as do all the members of his band. this cd is just horrible. the guy can't sing and they are terrible musicians. i can not put into words how awful this cd is. i hope noone wastes their money and especially their time by listening to this disc when they could be listening to something good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vanilla ice cream anyone?","review":"Emotion?!

The old boyfriend was not in the movie long enough to even show some reason why he would suddenly think the girl would marry him. Predictable from the beginning (basically as expected) but nothing in between to even make it interesting.

Sometimes his work evokes the theme music for soft-news television shows such as \\"Entertainment Tonight\\" (surprise!).

It was, unfortunately, worse than I expected. I'm sure that Mr. Tesh is a very nice man, but his music is seriously lacking in originality, compositional craft, or anything that would draw a serious listener back to it for repeated hearings. The fact that his music makes some people \\"happy\\" is all very nice, but please don't confuse this with musical quality. There is a reason that truly excellent musicians and discriminating listeners have such a negative response to his music. It is all vapid emotionalism with no substance.I realize that a lot of people listen to his music, but a lot of people also watch Jerry Springer.

The only people that knew this band heard them in a bad movie or a mediocre video game. It's a shame the PR team a TVT could not be bothered to get this band on the radio. They were eclectic and varied a good bit in style from song to song which worked against them to some degree because of a pathetic music industry that wants to be able to label and neatly package everything. Admittedly, they were not earth shatteringly creative and they didn't break any new ground. What they did do is put out quality music that showed the range of their influences from Soundgarden to Radiohead. The lead singer had a great voice, but unfortunately, they really didn't fit in with the nu-metal BS that record labels were slamming down our throats at the time. In short if you like 90's hard rock/grunge/alternative, and you do not have this CD, then get it.

Yes, they sport a much different new metal sound from the mainstream one you're used to hearing, but that doesn't neccesarily mean that it's any good.

I think to get a proper sense of how big Source Tags & Codes is, how much terrain, the broad sweep, the emotional depths it plumbs, its' completeness as a single cogent work of art, we have to go back to Beethoven. That big. And that great. This is what our kids will refer back to when they look at \\"classic rock\\" of this era.

Source tags is long and meandering with little to no in the harmony and structure catagories. It sounds like a punk band free-jamming on a Sunday.

I finally got a chance to hear the album thinking that he was just a bad live singer. I was wrong, he is even horrible on the album. I also don't like the fact that his vocals are not a a reasonable level. It seems like the band is embarrased by him and try to drownd him out. I will have to say that besides the vocals, it is pretty good, but never good enough to get passed the singer. This band should either be an instrumental band or they should find a new vocalist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trail of Dead Is a Sad Chapter In the History of Music","review":"And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead is the absolute worst when it comes to making music for the ages. I personally do not own their either of their albums, but a vast majority of my coworkers do and they have forced me to listen to them every day on the way to work for about a month now. I have noticed that the band struggles to sound produced and accessible all the while losing all of the rawness and energy of their sound. It's a pathetic display. Walls of guitar effects and tense, heated vocals should provide the band's driving aggression, but instead, they are soft as a baby's butt and can only provide bouts of dark melody, even adding strings and piano in places. The Album should please fans of musical geniuses such as Lil Bow Wow, Britney Spears, B2K, and Willa Ford, but Source Tags & Codes weighs in as softer, quieter, and, in places, more cheerful and asparagus than those bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"more overhyped silliness","review":"there are probably 10 bands in whatever city you live in that sound exactly like this.

There are a few moments that sound almost too Teenage Riot, but it's still really well done, well played, and well produced. Other moments hint at uncharted future territories.

If you break even one of these delicate clips, you also can not get it to stay in place. Finally, if you bump the chute with a bowl, no matter how minor, the clips are not sturdy enough (even with all of them intact and fully secured) to hold the chute on the bowl and allow you to continue to use the chute.

The online aspect has been really buggy so far, with unacceptable lag.My biggest disappointment, however, was with the level design and the overall feel of the game. Whereas the levels in BF1942 (and its expansion packs) were brilliant and really conveyed a sheer sense of epic conflict, the levels here are 1)WAY too dark, 2)Too cramped and 3)Boring. I realize that the battlefields of vietnam were different from WWII, but all the levels end up looking exactly the same: hilly jungle.

Be cautious and check some forums before you purchase this, or else you might be in for a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"If you like Medal of Honor or Call of Duty, this is the game for you. Fight the NVA and Viet Cong or fight the Americans or South Vietnamese. The M60 & M16 are the best weapons. This game has GREAT graphics, but is much harder than the first 3 battlefields. Vietnam is also much faster than the older ones. If you are NVA or Viet Cong than you can create booby traps, giving you an advantage. That is what this game is about. If I could give it 10 stars, than I definetly would. I strongly recommend this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great multiplayer, but singleplayer sucks!","review":"I must agree with everyone, IT SUCKS!Alot, and I mean a lot of bugs in the game.When it first came out, I thought this is gonna be the best.But was I wrong.The only good thing in the game is the graphics, and multiplayer.Wait when the price goes down, then buy it, and play only multiplayer cause thats the best.I am realy disipointed at this game, and they could have done better, a lot better!Hope this helped. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I got this game recently and was amazed at another great step that EA has taken. The games can get a little laggy at times, but not as bad as battlefield 1942. Awesome intro to the game... Nice customisable in-game music. I got mine at Circuit city for 29.99... it said 39.99 so i was surprised. Umm... what else what else... o yea. Get a joystick for the helicopters. You are very skilled if you can master it without a joystick. The overall gameplay is kind of repetative. But it has a pretty good fun factor. The map is more user friendly.. more interaction. Hope This was helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Unplayable FPS. Gameplay is very jerky, long loading times (two minutes or more when beginning a new scenario...you have to sit through almost an entire song while waiting), annoying/distracting lag when trying to go from stand to crouch to prone, awkward control/feel when attempting to pilot aircraft which I couldn't get the hang of despite endless attempts; overall a big disappointment... traded in to EB for ten bucks after a few days. Reccommend Call Of Duty instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated graphics and game play","review":"I purchased this game expecting everything that gamer magazines and web sites promised. What I saw on my computer was a game with graphics at least 2 to 3 years behind other games. Sure the maps are large and you can drive vehicles but other games now do a vetter job of this. The landscape is very repetive, the AI is terrible and the interaction with objects and targets is very poor. Try Far Cry, Painkiller, Vietcong or UT 2004."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggy, Laggy, not finished yet","review":"Put simply, this game gets old fast and is very laggy no matter what you do in the options menu.

Apparently they are just \\"PC Gamer Snobs\\". Anyway, I bought this game and the online play is amazing. I really can't imagine a better game to play online with others. The graphics and functionality are great. The only drawbacks I have are: (1) hard to organize people to attack and hold bases(flags), which is probably difficult in most online play games like this, (2)the learing curve isn't too bad, but it takes a while to figure out how to successfully fly planes and helicopters.You'll like this game, unless you're the type to find issues with everything and complain.NOTE: If you are one to not play multi-player online, this game is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"All I ever do is get aggravated at some point when playing this game. Nothing better than shooting someone 3 times with a sniper rifle and not only do they not die, but they run full speed at you unhindered and kill you. I would say that at least 80% of the time that I die on this game it is after I shot the other person first. I ended up throwing this game in the garbage. Stick with ravenshield if you expect someone to die when you shoot them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The personal Critics of this game have NO idea","review":"The people that have problems with there copy not working is only because they are willing to spend a little money on a state of the art game, are the people that just want something for free. If you buy the finest graphical game that is made at this moment, you must be willing to keep your computer at the same level There are cheap places with a white and blue sign that sell games for $9.99 everyday to serve your needs just fine, but if you want to hang with the big boys. Then be willing to keep up with a computer that is not purchased for $499.99. Study and find a computer that is capable of being UPGRADABLE, The most important thing to look for is can you upgrade the Memory, AGP slot for upgrading Video Car, and capable of upgrading the CPU (Processor). Then you will not have a problem PLAYING THE REAL GAMES of Technology."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great concept poorly implemented","review":"The idea behind it is great, it does have a great intro movie, and music is top notch; However, the actual gameplay is very poor and the graphics dated. There is no point to trying to sneak around in the foliage, the only way to be successful is to charge at the enemy, die 50 times and maybe finally get through. I was bored with this game after 2 sessions and glad I borrowed it and didn't buy it. If you haven't checked out Call of Duty yet, it is a MUCH better gameplay experience, it may not have the fancy movies or music but the gameplay and graphics more than makes up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent","review":"I bought this game with much anticipation, and after reading all the other reviews, I thought to myself that these reviewers dont know what they are talking about. So I buy the game, confindent that PC could run the game smoothly. Surely it would, right? WRONG. C'mon now, I am running an AMD Athlon 3400+ (64 bits and faster than any P4 chip out right now), 1 gig of DDR PC3200 RAM, a 256 MB Geforce FX 5950 Ultra and the game lags offline and even worse on.

It also supported 64 players and it was awesome how you could play on a team with 32 other players.All that is back in this game...BUT THEY MESSED IT UP!!!!First of all the level design gives the Americans 2x the vehicles of the NVA, and they're guns are stronger. Second of all you can go rambo and run along by your self and kill everyone so team play is never used. And last of all the vehicles aren't fun to drive anymore because you just go off a cliff or smack into a tree every 5 seconds.

MY wife said to me as we driving home from Vermont this winter and needed to find a place to eat \\"finally you bought a toy that comes in handy\\".

When Garin says you need a clear, unobstructed view of sky it really means it. I had to hike till there was a clear unobstructed view of the sky to receive a signal strong enough to find my current location but could not plot my path nor will the unit work in a belt carrying case and hold signal. I tried freash batteries and another unit but same results. The signal is also very weak in the car. It is possible that the mountain ranges were to blame but really! I would not recommend this unit for anyone who will not have a completely unobstructed view of the sky and car roofs seem to matter. The Garmin GPS MAP 75 has a better antenna so I would consider this unit over any of the eTrex units which all use the same antenna. I hope this helps Brian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch your wallet","review":"Amazon had this item priced at $134.99 for several months, then on the week of 9/20 it shot up to $169.99, $157 on 9/29, $146 on 10/1 and as I'm writing this (on 10/27) the price is $144.94.Unfortunately Amazon does not have a policy where you can get credit if something you buy from them goes on sales for a lower price within 30 days (like most brick and mortar stores do). My husband bought this for me as a gift on 9/23 and paid a hefty $169.Plus I had to spend an extra $100 for the software. The Legend basemap doesn't have detailed street maps, it just shows major streets and highways. So I ended up buying the Mapsource Metroguide North America Version 6. (Amazon doesn't stock version 6 yet but they have version 5). This software cost anywhere from $80 on up, depending if you go to Ebay or an online retailer.Besides having to buy the extra software, the Legend is a decent GPS unit.

It's usually the recommended device for geocaching beginners and it does its job well. After having this over a year, I have added higher end units but this is still my wife's staple and she loves it. It has just enought memory to get some good maps of your location and those can be a life saver.Complaints of accuracy are unwarranted because that includes variables such as satellite locks, weather, trees, ect. You have to remember that when you are looking for something with coordinates given to you - those coordinates were created by another GPSr by someone who may not know what they are doing. In other words, the GPSr gives you direction to a target and then a 20-30 foot radius in which to search.I would recommend this unit to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG BASEMAP buyer beware!!","review":"My family and I were extremely disappointed Chistmas morning '04 when we realized the Pacific basemap was installed on our Garmin eTrex Legend 8 MB GPS with PC Cable purchased through Amazon.

I've had this little gadget for about three months now and I take it just about everywhere. There isn't much more praise that I can give this gadget that hasn't all ready been said in other reviews. It's one of those devices that I could (and did) do with out but it makes traveling and hiking even more fun when you can see your position moving down the road in real time with all the stats. It's just a real fun toy that actually does come in very handy. I like it better than my cell phone!My one complaint is that it loses signal in tree cover much too easily. What's the point of making a tiny GPS for hiking if you can't keep or acquire a satalite lock your entire hike through the forest? Bring a compass and map for back-up if you anticipate tree canopy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a pretty nifty gadget!","review":"I bought one of these for my boyfriend's birthday present this June. He travels a lot for work and he takes it with him EVERYWHERE.

Thanks to the ETrex Legend, his laptop and some additional software he purchased for it, we were back on track in a matter of minutes. He loaded in where we came from and where we were going. The eTrex told the software where we were and the laptop told us (yes, it spoke...voice recognition software is really cool) where to go to get back to civilization.I think this is the best product I've ever purchased and I paid a lot more than what Target has it for now! A MUST HAVE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Legend is a great GPS... BUT","review":"I bought my Legend and used it moderately for about a year (I've changed the batteries 15+ times) and took good care of the unit when I used it. It was a great GPS. But one day I turned it on and the screen was flickering and all messed up. I immediately emailed Garmin. They were very nice and prompt but informed me that if it was more than a year since the purchase date, it could be sent in for repair for $99. It was a few months past a year, and since the original cost $152, it didn't make much sense to send it in. So now I have a GPS that I can't use. I haven't purchased another Garmin product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly worthless","review":"This is a nice compact unit with pretty blue plastic and a lanyard so you can hand it on your neck. That's the end of the positives.The big, really big, negative is that this thing has such poor sensitivity that unless you live in the desert and no bird or plane ever fles over you, you will have problems getting it to work because it will not find satellite signals.OK, mild exageration. I live in mid-Michigan and it actually has found enough satelites to work if there was nothing above it. However, the moment you go under a tree, any tree, you will lose your signal and you will not get it back until you move out from under the tree. I think that if you put your hand over the Etrex Legend you will lose your signal.This thing is well named because a legend is often a myth and not based on fact. It is certainly a myth that the Etrex Legend is a useable GPS.Garmin should be deeply ashamed for selling such junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"So far, I've been very happy with this unit. It looks and feels well-made. The LCD is extremely sharp. Navigating the software is intuitive. There are endless ways to customize the unit to your tastes.

It's quite dim, and so is not really helpful unless you're in pretty dark conditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you tend to get lost often...","review":"Getting lost all of the time can become very frustrating. I speak from experience! On a recent trip up north, I was in the car with a few friends and as a matter of course, we got lost. I pulled the car over and the person who was acting as navigator reached for his maps. While he was unfolding and searching, I typed in the address of the hotel (I installed the mapsource software) into the GPS and clicked on \\"Go To\\". The GPS told me that I was 0.11 miles from the hotel and displayed the fastest way to get there. This magic blue box saved us about an hour of wondering around. I have been reccomending this thing to everyone I know since this happened.The GPS knows all!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginner hand-held GPS","review":"Not having known anything about GPS units, I did a little research and this seemed to be a good starter unit for the price. I wasn't looking to spend a lot since I wasn't sure if my daughter would enjoy Geocaching. This gives us all the features we need for our purposes. We have been out caching quite a few times and have found everything we looked for. Not to mention that the PC cable is a Godsend when you have to load all the coordinates into the unit. If anyone is looking for a good GPS for geocaching, I recommend this one, especially if you don't want to spend a fortune."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising -- NOT WAAS compatible","review":"This product is consistently being advertised as having a high degree of accuracy because it is WAAS-compatible.It is not.Quite some time ago, the WAAS satellite protocol was changed. Garmin has not updated the firmware for the etrex Legend, and since that time, having WAAS compatibility enabled will cause this unit to lock up after 15-40 minutes of usage. This information is directly from Garmin tech support.Since the change occurred quite some time ago, and it is a relatively simple fix, I can only conclude that Garmin has no intent of upgrading this product.DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT WAAS-LEVEL ACCURACY.

It never lost signal during my entire 3 day trip through the foothills of the Apalachian Mountains in NE Alabama. I simply mounted it on my backpack and forgot about it. Each night at camp, I would turn it off and then restart it the next morning.

We have gotten hooked on the geo-caching and a GPS is important to have. My husband has a Garmin 350 and what is bad with that is that it is a touch-screen, so when you are walking with it in your hand, you will most likely hit the screen. So it's really a pain. With the Garmin Etrex, that won't happen. You have to push a button in order to move from one screen to the other. I have used it now eight times and the coordinates were right on the money!!!

The screen would stay frozen and the only way to unfreeze it was to pull the batteries out and restart the unit. I was told by Garmin tech support that I needed a software upgrade, even though my unit was less than a year old. Unfortunately the cable supplied with the unit didn't mate with my 2 yr. old Toshiba laptop, so now I'm supposed to go out and buy an adapter. Garmin refused to take the unit back and update the software at their factory. I don't have much confidence that the software upgrade will fix the problem, so I don't think I'm going to try it. I'll probably just have to run it with WAAS disabled, which is a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"eTrex is not a trail model","review":"Very disappointing unit and I returned it immediately to purchase a a Garmin GPSMAP 60.

This poor little GPS works only if you are out in an open field with no cloud cover. I originally purchased the unit to do a bit of geocaching, but quickly learned that it was of no use in wooded areas...at all.I thought I would give it a second chance and take it trail running and it proved to be another fail. On my last run it only tracked me for 11 feet before losing the signal under trees and picked nothing else up on for the entire 6 mile run (I did happen to pass through an open field too).I now run with myGarmin nüviin my bag it works a ton better although a bit larger.A redeeming feature, when it does actually get reception, is the ease of downloading the .GPX data. I actually purchased a USB adapter cable for the data cable that came with it separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I've had this GPS unit for about a year and have found it to be completely useless. It works fine on a clear day with no clouds in the sky in an open field, but other than that it's no good at all. And even on a clear day, it only works if you hold it. Forget about sticking it in a backpack.I previously owned a Magellen of a similar price which worked great (until I busted it climbing up the side of a waterfall) but the Magellen contained no ability to upload or download maps or waypoints, so I was looking forward to this unit's additional features. The unit comes with a serial port cable so an additional converter cable is necessary for anyone who owns a computer constructed in this century, but as a Mac user, I've found that to be a completely useless feature even with the USB cable adaptor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"This is a great entry level GPS with reasonable features for the weekend user. I might have overlooked it, but my son bought one last Summer and loved it. My conclusion is that it is a great value. The serial cable (included) may be a put-off to someone expecting USB, but it works reliably and set-up was a snap. Startup scans are pretty quick if the view is unobstructed. The 8 MB memory sounds a bit short compared to the $300+ models, but I found that's more than adequate for most trips. The display resolution is good for the price; it's not the super-crisp color, but it's fine for a day in the field. Like every electronic system, it takes some getting used to the controls, but after you do, I found it instinctive to use. Are there things I'd like to improve, you betcha. But for the price, it's great. Couple this with a program like EasyGPS and you have a great system for the casual-to-semiserious user."},{"rating":"1","title":"etrex failure","review":"This is a toy, not to be confused with a real GPS device to be used in any situation where it would realisticly be depended upon for direction or location. It consistently could not reliably pick up the signals in little or no cloud cover in Banff National Park even near peaks on a recent trip, and is useless with any substantial cloudcover. It also has cumbersome, slow software that is anything but logical. It's a waste of money and not a serious instrument."},{"rating":"2","title":"This e-trex is legendary!","review":"I like the Legend a lot. It's perfect for geo-caching which is why I bought it. Much easier to use and enter coordinates than the yellow model. Map features are nice even without the software program option. My only complaint is that the computer cable is an outdated serial port adapter, but my (and probably your) computer uses USB connectors. It's worked well for me on all of my adventures and is very easy to use. The instruction manual is helpful and there are many features I haven't even used yet. So far so good. I love the product and you can't beat the price on Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bang for your buck!!!","review":"Least expensive unit that you can download coordinates, pretty, too!!My husband uses this in teaching classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced","review":"I don't understand why this item is priced $80.00 more than anywhere else I've found it. You might as well not even carry it. It's a disservice to your customers. Target usually has good prices, and I do a lot of shopping there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asia/Pacific Basemap","review":"We, too, had a bit of confusion about the basemap. The unit will auto-acquire your location after a few minutes of sky-searching. I think the Asian basemap is a result of a factory test that is done in the factory in Taiwan. The unit will start up with its last known location.Kudos to Garmin for testing the product. Take off a few marks for not including a brief section on this in the user's manual. Otherwise, it is a good lightweight and compact tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for walking in a forest","review":"I have mixed feelings about this unit. The software is friendly and it's not too expensive (I had a $50 rebate coupon). Unfortunately it really struggles to pick up a signal when there are trees overhead. This is particularly true if you hang the unit from your neck. Putting it under a shirt so it doesn't bounce around helps some (as does holding it flat in your palm). The Garmin folks tell me the same receiving antenna is in all eTrex models. I'm not ready to scrap it but I have been tempted from time to time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect choice for casual use","review":"My research had come down to the Garmin Legend and the Magellen SporTrek Pro. The map was a bit better with the SporTrek Pro but the display was definitely not as good as the Legend. With the price premium on the SportTrek, I chose the Legend.I've had the unit about a month. I wish Garmin had included a 12V car power adaptor since this is almost a necessity. I was pleasently surprised with the sensitivity of the antenna and the life of the batteries. The ClickStick has proven to be quite acceptable for complex input into the unit. The provided map of Marine navaids is good but not great--boaters will need the greater detail available with BlueChart info. 8MB of memory seems just about right. I have no buyers remorse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good GPS for simple nav needs","review":"I bought this GPS last dec when I was going over seas and was planning to do some hiking/off roading. Since I didnt need the mapping function too much, the waypoint marking and trail tracking features of this GPS worked very well. Even though some websites say that the WAAS function is only available in the US, the unit almost always found WAAS enabled satellites to give pretty accurate tracking information. Battery life also seemed to last pretty long, even with night use and frequent backlight usage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Came in time for Christmas! Does not include trail software, though. That must be purchased separately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does everything it's supposed to...accurately","review":"Hello all,I have to say that I am a little bit surprised at some of the negative comments I have seen about this device. I just got mine, and it does everything it's supposed to. The accuracy of my location is super, it can definitely be used while driving (but keep your eyes on the road while moving), it works great under tree cover, and features are fantastic. The Garmin Legend is easy to use and a great little gadget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsolete in 2011","review":"This shouldn't even be for sale in 2011. It's 8MB memory is too small for the new Garmin software. Unless you can find the old Garmin software, you should pass on this. Even then, it is grossly overpriced for 2011."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good under tree cover","review":"I bought this unit for Geocaching. I have grown tired and frustrated of losing satellite signal under any sort of tree cover. We are finally decided to sell it for a better unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"I purchased this unit as a gift for a male friend. He really liked it and was excited about using it. He loves it and says it's very accurate for use around his home area.

Its not easy to manage without learning it first. Its not a \\"duh obvious\\" operating system. I am trying to figure out still how to map where I have been but not save the whole thing. I want to save just legs.It is almost one hand useable, but some of the buttons are hard to press with one hand. It is a nice size and very easy to read. It does not come with any computer software and I am not sure how to get other maps on it yet.I guess I need to buy additional software. Its been fun playing with it since I bought it yesterday, now I need to learn the nitty gritty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garmin eTrex Legend","review":"When setting up the Legend I dropped on the kitchen linoleum floor. Instant crack and big dark spot on the screen. Can only see the bottom half. Have sent 2 messages to the company requesting service with no response as yet. Not sturdy at all. Probably worth the money for a better system with some sort of guarantee of sturdiness. Worst part is I bought this for my husband for Christmas and was setting it up for him. He at least opened before I broke it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reception; okay interface","review":"I am not a GPS guru or a geocaching fan. I bought the Garmin eTrex to help me to roughly map out real estate coordinates.I know other folks really love the eTrex, but I did not. The reception was much poorer than I was expecting for a middle-of-the-road unit. In the car, forget about it---terrible reception.I returned my eTrex within a day after purchasing it. Instead, I think that I'll be purchasing a higher end unit from Magellan.As a newb, I found the user interface okay, but not great. The control stick is a nice touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin etrex Legend","review":"I purchased etrex to measure acreage of farm plots and transfer these plot tracks to map. I am pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Etrex Legend","review":"This GPS is a great little handheld. The interface may not be as fluid as more expensive models, but it works for what I've needed, Geocaching and sailing. All in all I think it's a great handheld and I would recommend it for anyone who wants a decent GPS with minimal cash outlay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, inexpensive GPS","review":"This is a large improvement from the cheaper etrex models as it has a built in map, much more memory, and comes with a serial cable to enable downloading from a computer. The map is not fantastic, but it does give you a decent idea where you are within a mile or so. Geographic features are recognizable at that scale.It picks up satellites reasonably quickly, but seems hard on batteries compared to other handhelds I've owned. On 2 fully charged NiMH AA cells I can get about 12 hours of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great GPS for Geocaching","review":"I got the Garmin Etrex Legend for my birthday a few months ago and I have had a blast geocaching! The Legend is small enough to slip in your pocket but is accurate enough to lead you right to the cache. My only complaint is that the screen is small and I have trouble seeing the details - but maybe that's because my middle aged eyes aren't what they used to be. I haven't added on any street detail software because 8 MB is just too little to try to fool with downloading any expensive mapping tools. I'm just happy with what it does and it suits my purposes quite well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great navigational tool","review":"I bought the etrek legend to use as a basic navigational tool while prospecting. This one has all the bells and whistles I need without clutter. Anyone that wants to get into the \\"wilds\\" will appreciate the simple operation of this unit.I did not purchase the optional \\"mapsource\\" software. I really don't like to rely on electronics too heavily so I use the National Geographic topo maps in hard copy form in conjuction with the lat/long from the GPS unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless if you live near trees","review":"The interface is nice, and the built-in maps are better than I expected (in and around Seattle, WA). However, the Legend isn't very good at telling you where you are. Getting a reading consists of a) finding a clearing, b) holding the receiver at arm's length away from your body, c) holding it parallel to the ground, and d) praying that it finds satellites. The Magellan SporTrak that got after my first miserable Legend experience had no problems holding satellite lock on the same trails, regardless of tree cover. The next day, I got my money back on the Garmin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geocaching with eTrex Legend","review":"We have been geocaching 9 months now now with our Legend, and have had no troubles at all. Accuracy has been great, down to 3 feet, in some instances. Battery life is as advertised or better. The unit holds up well to minor tumbles and everyday abuse with out a scratch. Our only complaint is the size of the display, wished it was a little bigger. A great entry level unit, would buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"WATERPROOF--YOU BET!","review":"I recently went on a fishing trip with my e-trex legend andone of the guys I went with dropped it in the water. I thoughtit was lost for good because they do not float -- they sink like a rock -- however we did recovered the unit a half an hour later and after drying out the batterys the unit worked flawless. So if you plan on using this unit near water it is great however I would suggest a floatation device on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hidden problems","review":"i was given this as a present to use in my car while traveling. this is definitely NOT what it was designed for since it requires close attention to a very small screen. there are also additional costs associated with owning this unit. first, you must purchase maps to upload into the unit and they can be expensive. second, you may have to purchase a cable to connect the unit to the computer (they do not supply a USB connection so i had to purchase an adapter). the cost of the adapter from garmin is 2 to 3 times the cost of other manufacturers. in the end, this \\"present\\" cost me well over $120 and isn't really satisfactory for car use unless you have someone with you to operate the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reliability Problems with the e-Trek Legend","review":"Bought my e-Trek Legend in March 2002 for geocaching; initially it did ok, tracked well but lost signal often when under leafcover in the woods. Started noticing power shutoff problems when first turning it on; thought it was the battery connection, I'm beginning now to think it was poor/thin soldering in the manufacture. Now the click stick will only work in two of four directions. For what I paid for it, and as little as I used it, I doubt if I'll replace it with another Garmin e-Trek, they just don't seem substantial enough for hiking (to think, I cradled that thing like a baby in the woods, being careful with it!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one Alton Brown (Good Eats) recommends, it does work better!","review":"Saw this on Good Eats and had to have it. It is different from most silicone brushes in that it has a mesh \\"net\\" of silicone between the bristles. This allows it to hold more liquid, making it less messy and faster to baste items. I have used to baste beaten egg yolk onto cookies and melted butter onto pastry. Easy to clean, pop into the dishwasher.Comes in orange, green and red. The colors are not my favorite (would have liked an nice bright blue) but not a big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"an american who wanted to be grey","review":"From outside the USA this film is rare. Isn't perhaps between the best, but usually these country is seen as the cradle of big heroes, brave cowboys, tycoons and the in general most rich or poweful people. However here Gregory Peck plays the figure of a common man who is, and it's intended wants not only to dress a grey suit, but voluntarily wants to be a ordinary, grey man, possibly possesing the qualities to get more. Perhaps this is truly wisdom and difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very narrow Male dominated movie","review":"Comparing the theme and story to Revolutionary Road would be unfair to Man in the Gray Flannel. Because even though both ponder the role of man in modern society, Revolutionary Road has two things that Gray Flannel doesn't: actual conflict (not just existential BS) and a sentient wife character.Gregory Peck's acting is wooden, and his character never actually develops or reacts to the changes around him. The movie is also too long. I have never seen more unnecessarily long scenes about his time at war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long....But Entertaining","review":"Very intriguing, multi-layered drama starring Gregory Peck as a simple man trying to deal with life's problems. Stellar cast features three of my favorites---Peck, Lee J. Cobb, and Fredric March. How can you go wrong with names like these?!A tad on the lengthy side (at slightly more than 2-and-a-half hours), but worth the excursion.Mr. March is a standout here (IMO), as the head of a major TV network which employs Peck. March's role here puts me in mind of a similar character he portrayed two years earlier in \\"Executive Suite\\". He is much more likable, however, in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Man\\"...

Excellent DVD transfer is a bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Film At A Fair Price","review":"I had never watched this film before ordering it, so I took the chance. It turned out to be a smart buy! As usual, Peck is just awesome. He seems to fit this role well, as if it captures a true part of his persona as a family man. As the movie continues you realize that you can relate to the character on a personal level. I enojoyed the flashback sequences and thought they were placed well throughout the film. Overall, this movie supplies drama and action for the viewer. So, if you are considering purchasing this dvd, I'd suggest you buy it.

Sorry Maria and Heidi; all schools are NOT the same, all teachers are not the same, and your cookie-cutter solutions won't work most of the time or in most places.

What happens if the groom is getting married for the first time and he wants the big wedding with all the trimming?

I was never a Chicks fan, but I did recognize their talent, and liked a few of their songs. Whether or not what Maines said about about W was right, what the band got from their so called fans,the right wing, and Top 40 Country radio, was atrocious.I am a performer of country music,and I have not listened to Top 40 Country Radio in years. Now I know why.I'll just bet that over half of the top country performers felt the same way as Natalie. We are living in a country of idiots.

I thought that the candid moments showed a strong group that will stand up for themselves (and each other) come what may.

In the documentary Natalie references the band to Bob Dylan and Springsteen and then quickly and humbly makes it clear that she does not hold the chicks in the same regards... I think shes selling herself and her band mates short. Time will tell, but I think these chicks are the real deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go the Dixie Chicks","review":"This DVD is brilliant.

The fact that the public is finally realizing what many of us have always felt about what's really been happening over the last six years and those five Grammy wins must both be sweet, but I can't imagine anything making up for death threats and fear for the safety of one's children and family.

(Even if the author did this in reality, it doesn't add anything to the story. A good editor should have told them so.)4) Weird geography.

I tend, as most women, to have one or two close friends. When I read this novel, I was amazed at the way that Ms. Berg captured those friendships into words. After readng the book, (in less than a day) I then reread it, and passed it along to my best friend. She and I both saw ourselves in the main characters of the book. And, a few months later, my friend was also diagonsed with cancer. During her treatment, we both lived the closeness and love felt by the characters of the book. Her story, thanks to prayer and a wonderful medical staff, has a much better ending. She has beaten pancreatic cancer and is living and laughing with us today. Thanks to Ms. Berg, we did not feel ashamed at being scared, crying, laughing, and praying together during her terrible illness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read on the power of women and friendship","review":"I found this to be a deeply moving book. It accurately portrays the power of friendship, and the way women think, and talk. The voice of the book was very true to me.

But, her death is handled with caring and compassion. Will you cry? Yes...unless you're made of stone. But, you'll smile through your tears at the caring, humor, and warmth of these women as they help their friend die. I'm a breast cancer survivor and, I admit, parts of the book were difficult to read. But, the book didn't depress me...it left me feeling enriched. The only criticism I have, is the negative way in which the men were portrayed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful story of friendships between women","review":"I heard about this book from a friend who belonged to a book club whose members were all Hospice nurses. After reading it, I recommended it to all my friends. I've since read all of Elizabeth Berg's books, but this one is still my favorite. The characters and their reactions to a terminal illness are so real. This is one book you don't want to end. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about women, their friendships, and how they cope with loss and change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good storyline","review":"This is a very good book dealing w/a woman dying of breast cancer and a very dear friendship that must travel down this sad path.I highly recommend it as it is a well written book; the storyline is well done and it is not cheesey etc. but very touching and uplifting."},{"rating":"1","title":"She has done better","review":"Even so I read the book in two days and was touched by it, I have to say that Elizabetz Berg has done better. Unlike in 'Range of motion' or her 'Katie-books' for example, the dramatic moments in this one often feel forced and tasteless. The character of the nurse remains flat and lifeless, the other characters often seem very exaggerated. It almost feels as if Berg tried to fill the story with life by adding different stereotypes, like Sarah, the efficient, pretty, petit businesswoman and L.D., the baseball cap wearing, bulky lesbian with a crew cut.So all in all it was a disappointing book, especially since one is spoiled by Berg's previous excellent work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read; tough subject","review":"This story will make you think about a subject we really don't like to.

Worth reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't expect to but I loved this","review":"I wasn't in the mood for a depressing book. When I first started it and realized the subject matter I thought of putting it aside. However, I hung in there and boy am I glad I did. I just love Berg's character development. I felt that I knew each of these characters. They were all wonderful yet flawed, just like real life. I didn't find this depressing. I found that it made me appreciate life even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching Story about True Friendship","review":"Elizabeth Berg tells the story of true friendship between two women Ruth and Ann. Ruth is dying from Breast Cancer and she is being taken care of by Ann and some of her other friends LD, Sarah, and Helen. I really liked the character of LD who wouldn't give up hope until the end no matter how much they told her that Ruth's death was inevitable. But the best part of the story is the friendship shared between Ruth and Ann, a friendship that strong is very rare to find today. I truly enjoyed reading this book and has to be one of Ms. Berg's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries way too hard","review":"This book is just way too pretentious and makes too much of an effort to be wise and poignant to actually BE wise and poignant, or make any real observations about life, or convey any real emotion. It's so pro-female that it's sexist, anti-male, as though men are a lesser creature instead of an equal partner here on earth. I want a book that can make you cry, make you think, make you feel like you are going through an experience with someone, but this book does none of that - the author WANTS to convey something, but it all feels very artificial. The characters were weak - Ruth was self-centered, cynical and narrow-minded and Anne was a pushover and had such low self-confidence and inability to see the good in her life you hardly have hope for her at all. Overall, it was really quite mediocre."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXQUISITE PROSE","review":"Given the subject matter of \\"Talk Before Sleep\\" this book could have been a maudlin account of death through breast cancer. However, Elizabeth Berg's prose creates a most insightful tale that touches the very heart strings of the reader. It is witty. It is gritty. It is prolific. It is truthful without too much clinical detail. Mostly, it is loving. The loving friendship of two friends, bound together through thick and thin. A wise story, the book leaves you uplifted even with the inevitable ending. Yes, tears spilled from my eyes, but they were in profound respect for Berg's well written characters, and the exquisite beauty of her words. I was so genuinely moved by this read, I wrote my dearest friend an email emoting how much I loved her. Well done prose affects it's readers, and that, to me, is the crux of good writing.

The women, especially Ruth, seemed to all have self-indulgent lives. Their lives could have been ennobled through the heart-wrenching struggle of letting someone go who is fighting cancer. Yet they bicker, they debase one another while idealizing a life (Ruth's) which has been wasted in her own self pursuits. The dialogue is offensive though it might seem realistic to many women. I read this book as a favor to a dear friend, but I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"friendship we all long for","review":"I loved this book! The bond between the women resonated from the page. Ruth's stoic outlook on her malady and the way Berg gave her qualities that we all wished we had made me look at my own life and wonder if I could ever be so brave. Additionally, the rallying around Ruth that the friends diplayed was both touching and vivid. Again, I felt the longing for such a bond--for friends who would carry me if I could not walk and bring me french fries and lobster when death looked me in the face.

When the inevitable does come, you'll cry for Ruth as you would for any of the women you hold dear in your \\"real life.\\" This is a truly moving story, made even more satisfying by Berg's exceptional writing.

By all means I am no prude, but I don't know any friends, neighbors, or colleagues who would act like Ruth, Ann, or L.D. Thank goodness my pals are a bit more mature and settled. And couldn't the lesbian have enjoyed the music of someone other than K.D. Lang? Predictable, trite, and an ill attempt at a tribute to all who have past away from breast cancer.

They start off by meeting over cheeseburgers; move on to martinis, pizza, lobster, and repeated orders of French fries. Then they consume fudge, garlic bread, beer, potato chips and ice cream.

With lyrics like \\"an SDI like a gun at his hip when he meets you\\" on the title track, you are not sure if this album is aiming towards a joke in Spinal Tap/Bad News territory or if the album is just going into the really awful album realm from where no comedy can be derived. The playing is top notch, the song writing varies from one or 2 good songs, to the bad, to the absolutely insipid.

It is muddled in minutiae that is too time consuming to read and causes the reader to lose interest and focus. The book is choppy and does not flow well, partially caused by too many characters that are superfluous. Donna, the main character, is frustrating.

I watched it and thoroughly enjoyed it.I don't care if there were no extras. I got what I wanted.MACGYVER!!!!Roll on season 2"},{"rating":"2","title":"And great for the kids too...","review":"One of the best things I like about it is that the kids think its cool and don't even realize it is not a \\"shoot-em up\\", or vulgar, or depressing. It is all about using your wits, and \\"whatever you find along the way\\" to get yourself out of whatever jam you are in.So glad I found this on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad It's On DVD","review":"I'm glad MacGyver's on DVD at last. This season set is pretty good, except that the episodes aren't top quality transfers which is dissapointing. Also there is no stereo or surround sound soundtrack. Again dissapointing.But the only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars Is the lack of any kind of Bonus material whatsoever.If anyone from Paramount is reading this Please put bonus features on future season sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"most mentioned old TV show","review":"This was the pilot for a show I never saw in it's first run.

Yes, I finally have my favorite episodes together, but it's sad that Paramount released it like this. Looking at the box art, you feel that some college student produced it from his dorm room. I can even look past the fact that there are no special features. What I can't look past is that there are no original air dates. Every television show I have on DVD has at least the original air dates. The navigation menus offer no motion or music, something I've never seen done to any DVD. Again, Macgyver will always be one of my favorite all time shows. Too bad, it gets such poor DVD treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks","review":"Fast service and before Christmas thanks!

It is also more intellegent than a lot of action shows of today are. They don't rely on gory bodies, car chases and gun battles to fill in time in lieu of a story. This is a show well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mac Doesn't Quite Have His Groove On Yet in Season One","review":"Dana Alcar guest's in Pilot as a completely different character other than Pete Thornton, whom he'll come to play later already in Season One. The back-story (lore?) for Mac was not yet quite in place and so is a bit uneven -- and, frankly, Richard Dean Anderson hadn't quite gotten the rhythm of his character until about half-way through the season. By pilot of Season Two -- THAT is the start of classic Mac. But unless you are a MEGA-Die Hard Mac fan, you'll be quite satisfied to skip Season One and go right into Season Two where the first episode gives just enough back explanation about Pete's role at Phoenix to get you off and running. (Wish I'd known that before I bought the set!)Though, I must say, the first episode with Penny Parker, the first episode with Mac's Grandpa Harry, and the episode with the Fire Ants are among my favorite of all-time Mac episodes, and they are in Season One."},{"rating":"2","title":"MacGyver the magnificent on a meager DVD","review":"I tend to agree with most reviewers on the MacGyver DVD. I grew up watching the show during its run on Network Television. I yearned each week for the next great adventure. But, the DVD's are lacking. Nothing is included with the episodic content. Nothing adds to the value of the series. In this day and age of special features, director's commentaries, and Easter Eggs galore, the makers of the MacGyver DVD have failed.Lucky for them the show's greatness bulks their rating to 4 stars. This is still MacGyver in his earliest adventures. This is MacGyver pre-Phoenix foundation. This is still a joy to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"MacGyver back! Amazing!","review":"The MacGyver series had a big impact on my life. I can still remember the first episodes and tell myself: I wanna be like that guy.

Then I got the DVDs for birthdays and holidays. I was psyched (yes, child of the 80's).I got these as a gift, so I'm quite greatful, but so far (Season 1), the quality of the DVD is HORRIBLE.I don't much care for the extra frills (behind the scenes, actor bios, etc.), but Paramound didn't even bother to fix any damage to the master film/tape that they were using. I agree with user D. Mok's review, they did a horrible and lazy job of putting this beloved series to DVD. Makes me think that at times I'm watching a film in class on the vintage high-school reel-to-reel projectors.I bet if I go out and get the original 1979 Battlestar Galactica on DVD it won't be anywhere near this bad in quality.For now, save yourself the money, buy a DVD recorder and record it on SpikeTV... it's probably better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Show That Still Holds Up!","review":"I was musing to my brother one day that it would be neat to have \\"Macguyver\\" on DVD. Lo and behold he hunted this one down for my birthday. Honestly, I figured it would be nothing more than a big slice of 80's nostalgia, and that I would barely make it through watching it.Wrong.This show holds up well. Looking at so much of the cheesy crap that falls out of the corpse of 80's culture, it's hard to remember that some shows in that era took themselves seriously. This is one of them.MacGuyver was obviously written by a big Indiana Jones fan, you can tell that almost immediately, and the pilot episode, (which is usually the worst) is one of the best.This truly is a loveable, charming character placed in believable, high-adventure tales. This is America's James Bond....too bad he never got any movies, eh?I can't speak for any additional volumes as of yet...but this one is definately a buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"we r in 21st century & what we get?","review":"very disappointed. we are in the 21st century. every major production companies have digitally remastered their old TV series and movies except for one studio: Paramount. seriously: Audio - Mono??? and obviously there was no digital remasterization of the picture. also there is no special feature which there is enough space on the last disc for. the \\"closed caption\\" logo is there but there is no subtitles at all. what's even worse is that these are dual-layer discs: i've seen movies on a single-layer disc that are better featured (most of the old movies now on DVD from MGM, meaning a whole movie on one side with some special features: MGM put on one side widescreen, the other side fullscreen and all remastered. well some of them). who the hell were the people in charge of this project of putting MacGyver on DVD? sure they did a damn bad job: i'd never hire anyone with \\"MacGyver DVD project\\" in his resume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple review...for a change","review":"* The video and audio quality is not stunning, but there are no glaring problems. Very watchable.* No bonus features...disappointing* Even though I was expecting it to some degree, the show is more cheesy, kid-oriented and far-fetched that I anticipated. I don't mean the swiss army knife and duct tape inventions; those are still great fun to watch. I am referring to the plot lines...at least those in this first season."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am The biggest Mac Fan on the Planet, BUT........","review":"I was very disappointed in the quality of the season 1 DVD box set. There is absolutely no bonus materials, no enhanced/restored video and audio, and the packaging job was cheesy as all hell. This TV program is a cult classic and it should be treated as such. I certainly hope the season 2 set has more features and better picture and sound quality. I think I'm going to write to Paramount Television and tell them what a bang up job they did. And by the way, Bilbo Bayonets is a shmuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"The series really suffered because of acting and, in later years, writing. The first season is alright, though. MacGuyver doesn't grow a social conscience (e.g., jump the shark)until later in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"The concept of the show was tolerable at best but inately sophomoric.

I used to love this series, but as an adult, I can see that the plot devices are a little fantastic, that is a little hard to believe. Come on, sliding down a sand dune on a small wall map?

I would send it back again but at this point I am going to spend more returning it then I would have on the product.

This thing doesn't have enough suction for that to be an issue.* Upon the second use, the fine mist stopped spraying.

This thing just kinda yanks and tugs on your skin without removing any dirt.

I agree with most of the earlier reviewer it doesn't do much of anything besides giving you the feel of a light suction on your skin. Which is not enough to suck out any clogged pores.

After three weeks of using it 2-3 times per week, I'm not really sure. The suction cup looks like it's taken in a few blackheads(ew! but better there than in my pores...), so it has to be doing something. But when I look at my face, all I can think is that I'm better off squeezing them with my fingers!Oh, and even though there's a mister, if you fill it up with hot water, it still comes out cold and closes up your pores.

I immediately turned on this device and rolled it over my face (nose/chin/cheek/forehead area) as it was sucking away the black heads.

I barely feel the suction on my face, and didn't notice any difference after use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time/money","review":"After reading all the reviews I decided to give this product a try. Used it immediately after a shower, and it really does NOT work very well. The suction is minimal and it doesn't remove blackheads. I does scrape off a little of the dead skin...but that's about all. I seldom return a product, but after a half dozen uses I boxed it up and sent it back. Don't waste your time/money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I came across this and it sounded like it would be perfect for getting some annoying blackheads out and making my pores look smaller. Maybe I had too high of expectations, but this product sucked. I have pretty nice skin from the start but this didn't seem to do anything but squirt water on my face. This has already made its way into the Goodwill donation pile. I'm glad I didn't spend more on it, but hey, at the very least, the suction does feel kind of cool and more relaxing than anything. It might work for you, but don't spend much money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice beauty tool.","review":"I first saw this product at The Sharper Image and it caught my eye. I found one here at amazon.com for half as much as the price in the store. I bought it for myslef as a gift to myself for xmas. I got a little worried when I read the review here saying it could only be used on the nose but after reading the intsructions I found it could be used on the whole face. The first time I used it it felt slightly sore while using the pore cleanser. I used it after I got out of the shower and washed my face. It made my skin very soft but afterwords I used Murads toner, liquid exfoliator, and moisturizer and my skin has been great. I only use it once a week but boy does it make my face look and feel clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute junk! The old model (EH2501) works better","review":"One hopes that later models improve on the prior models. Not here. The old model was bigger and more powerful.

I was so excited about trying it to help with my blackheads. I followed the instructions and tried this 3 times, each time thinking maybe this time it will be different.

I will never use it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work!","review":"honestly, I have a lot of blackheads on my nose.. its starting to really bother me therefore, I purchased this pore cleanser. OK, this product doesn't take out my blackheads. It does open up my pore and make it easier for me to use a stainless steel blackhead remover to scrub off my blackheads but this suction doesn't remove the blackheads. That is why I think its a total waste of money. Let me suggest you all to take a facial steam for 5-10 minutes and then use a metal (professional blackhead remover) and start to scrub off the blackheads. That works much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"skin cleaner","review":"with the suction it creates you would think it would suck out your blackheads but it didn't for me. It also irritated my skin more I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"You definitely feel the suction. As long as you don't use it too often, I'm sure it wont irritate your skin. So far, I think that it works quite well. Don't stay at one spot for too long. If your white/black heads don't get removed on some places don't force it - It will come out eventually. Good product, relatively easy to clean, and make sure you air dry the product when you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this thinking it would be a solution to just using my fingernails to press blackheads out. However the lack of power is so obvious that even after a long hot shower when blackheads are almost popping themselves out it doesn't work. It's the same as doing nothing. It's just ridiculous, apparently was never tested on anyone before releasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes it Does Work but Don't Expect Instanly Clean Pores","review":"It does work but it's going to take regular use to work everything out. It's definitely sucked notable stuff out of the pores on my face each use. It works best if your skin has just been washed in hot water to soften it and open the pores more. I'll leave an update of how it's working over time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"First of all, I would like to thank all other reviewers, they helped me to figure out whether to buy this product and what to expect. I am very glad I bought this pore cleanser, it works great! But don't expect immediate results (although you might see the effect right away). I started using it everyday for the first 2 weeks, and it doesn't take much time or energy at all! And my skin became wonderful! It is much cleaner, smoother and the pores look smaller. One thing I have to say though, I only liked the small side of the suction cup, the large one didn't do anything for me. Or may be I just didn't figure out how to use it yet... But I highly recommend this product if you have oily or combination skin that breaks out a lot and large pores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work, Don't Get It","review":"I saw this product being advertised on TV. They were showing the cleanser actually sucking out all the blackheads/sebum/dirt/etc from someone's pores. I thought it was amazing.I found out that someone I knew already bought the cleanser, and she said that it didn't work at all. I ordered the Panasonic anyway. Big mistake.The vacuum on this thing is way too weak to suck out anything from your pores. All it does is irritate your skin, usually leaving red marks that may last over a week.Don't buy this product. It's a waste of money and time.Some of the reviewers made suggestions on how to use it correctly. I tried, but no luck.One good thing came out of this cleanser though. My brother used it on a pesky pimple on his nose. The Panasonic popped it, and now it's gone. According to the instructions, you're not supposed to use this on pimples. I guess he was just lucky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless junk","review":"This is a totally useless piece of pricy junk. The vacuum is so weak that it will have little or no effect on your skin besides irritating it and making it red.As for removing,i.e. vacuuming up excess skin oil and opening clogged pores,it is a complete joke. No effect whatsoever.Don't waste your money on this ineffective infomercial toy.Take a look at the Ansr skin care system(also from Amazon) if you want an effective skin cleanser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suck-tion","review":"Even when the pours are open (just out of the shower) the suction is only enough to leave red marks on the skin. If the Pour cleanser had more focused suction, it might actually clean the pours out."},{"rating":"1","title":"What mist? This thing sucks!","review":"I was too embarrased to return this. The mist thing spits out some water at your face. They should call it \\"the underpowered face vacuum that spits at your face for being an idiot and buying this machine\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bought this thinking it would be a good way to routinely clean my facial pores, however the suction isnt ample enough to do a good job. The misting feature does create a better seal with the suction cup tho, and it does make it a little bit easier. Overall I would just suggest a good facial cleanser and cloth or Biore facial strips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"I should have paid attention to the other reviews that said this doesn't work.

This item just doesn't do much on its own. The only way to get anything with it is to use the head just like a cheap blackhead scraper like the one above. In fact, you will get better performance from the blackhead scraper.I don't know why this thing has positive reviews. My wife tried it too so it's not just me.The only reason it gets 2 stars is because it's the first product I've ever seen with built in induction charging, and for the geek in me, that's cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Careful","review":"Be careful. It isn't strong enough to pull out building clogs or pimples. It doesn't help with ingrown hairs in the sideburns/ beard area. It won't pull out any build-up around your nose.But it WILL give you a hickey in ALL of those places. So when you feel it's under-powered and spend more time in an area, you may realize too late that you have a hickey on your face."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"This recording represents one of the biggest dropoffs in quality of any group I can remember. Heck, at least the Stone Roses took five years to work up a stink before releasing their marginal followup to the debut. The Woodentops \\"Giant\\" album is easily one of the highlights of the 1980s. Quirky, melodic and fun. It's still an album I play 20 years later with hardly any face-scrunching due to clunky 80's drums & synths.But with \\"Wooden Footcops\\" it seems that all sense of what made The Woodentops click on earlier albums simply vanished. The songs are dull and sound dated. Scott Litt was nailing REM production duties at the same time so I doubt it was all his fault. Anyone who has this album and thinks it's good should immediately go back one album and find yourself amazed by the difference.The only reason I hold onto this CD is because of the first track \\"Maybe It Won't Last\\".

I thought I knew as much as anyone could know about Elvis. I was dead wrong. Pamela Keogh's fresh and insiteful look at Elvis Presley's life and career had me entranced. From the minute I read the first page I knew I could not put this book down. Her take on Elvis and the incredible impact he had on the world is compelling. I would highly recommend this book to everyone whether an Elvis fan or not. And to Pamela Keough I say bravo \\"a brilliant writer who gets it\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis Presley: The Man. The Life. The Legend.","review":"Pamela Clarke Keogh's biography of Elvis is quite witty and insightful. I think that the greatest accomplishment of the author is her ability to respect Elvis and present him as a human being. In doing so, she doesn't overemphasize either his great sucesses or faults but instead she writes about his enduring character traits. Also, she adequately discusses his life story through the narratives of people who actually knew him. I really enjoyed this book and I'm sure that other Elvis fans will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful book","review":"There is obviously a lot of Elvis \\"product\\" out there, but this book is special.

Drug involvement is all but brushed aside. Organization leaves something to be desired, and there is no subject index. Captions for photographs are listed in the back. Chronology is very loose; it was difficult knowing when some events took place. References to Jackie Onassis, Audry Hepburn, and JFK, on the whole, added little.Priscilla's voice seemed loud and clear. While that helped in understanding her relationship with Elvis, it made the book appear one-sided. Still, Elvis' intense relationship with Ann-Margret was acknowledged.There were some interesting new details, but very few. I wondered what compelled the author to write the book. Perhaps hearing the old stories in a new publication, or by a new author makes them fresh again. There are always new books on Elvis, and I find myself buying one more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific purebred dog info and selection guide","review":"Telemark's Guide to Dogs is a very complete guide to all the different purebred dogs. I am an instructor in a Veterinary Technician program and am considering making it a class requirement! The thorough descriptions of all the different breeds seem to be very accurate and include the positive as well as negative traits of each breed. This would enable a person looking for a puppy to make an informed decision. This is important when one thinks of all the dogs being abandoned due to breed incompatability with owner lifestyle.My students need to be able to identify the top 50 dogs as registered by the AKC and this CD-ROM has terrific pictures of all of them. I would highly recommend this CD-ROM to anyone with an interest in learning more about dogs, selecting a puppy, as well as any students who need to research the breeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Don't Make Me No Saint, Baby\\"","review":"I read this lengthy story many years ago. In the meantime I was privileged to meet one of Mahalia's former pianists, Rev. J. D. Strawther, who is so listed in the book. Hearing Strawther's chronicle of his experience with the powerful singer made the book come alive to me. I am a very strong admirer of the late Clara Ward, and enjoyed reading, from Mahalia's viewpoint, about the relationship of the Ward Singers and Miss Jackson.It is extremely admiral to see how that Mahalia pulled herself up by her own bootstraps in a day and time when that was very difficult, and given her problem with timing in regards to her vocal singing. It must have taken a lot of courage for Laurraine to write the good, the bad and the ugly; and some instances were rather disappointing.

Not one character is fully realized and the narrator's passion/obsession with the title character is never well developed.Jorge Franco is a very talented writer and has an amazing reputation in Colombia.

His links to other texts, etymologies and traditions is quite substantial and his application of this learning to modern day times in the Western world is still appropriate today, even though this book was written in the 1970's. The only drawback is that he advocates the use of violence in activism in order to get the gay/witchcraft point across, and although this may just be a sign of the time when this book was written, it does put a bit of a dampener on the rest of the text, especially when taking into consideration the wiccan rede. However, this book is a must read for any witch studying history, or any lesbian, gay or bisexual person trying to trace their historical roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This little book is full of amazing and interesting material. I highly recommend it to any LBGT person that is interested in Witchcraft, alternative lifestyles and religions, and historical accounts.Although some of the information is dry and dated, the overall presentation of information is excellent.

Axis and Alignments is their most consistent album to date. There are no sporadic ventures off into lala land, otherwise known as \\"avant-garde\\" here, it is just pure magic. Seriously intense jazz mixed with a bit electronica. The individual songs on this album do lack some of the punch that has been present on past pieces, like \\"Blue Sparks...\\", but overall this is a much better effort than anything the boys have produced. Jazz is not dead and the Chicago Underground prove it. This is essential listening for both jazz fans and hipster college kids who have Davis in one hand and Tortoise in the other (although this will make you put away your Tortoise album and eventually lead you to some real jazz, as apparent on this album...let go the post rock, embrace the real product)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to look at, but no clue game to play","review":"This is a sturdy paperback lift-the-flap book that features Blue and her friends (no Steve or Joe).

Farewell is the best COX release in years and this follow up feels like it was more of a side-project that Ronny worked on in his basement with his laptop. There are some decent tracks here, but it is marred by 3 or 4 duds at the beginning and towards the end of the album. I've come to realize that if I skip 4 tracks on this album, it sounds much better, like Farewell actually. If this had come out 5-10 years ago when COX were putting out much worse stuff, I would have been happier with this album. But as a follow-up to Farewell, this comes off as a rushed catalog-filler album.I tried to like it as much as Farewell but I just couldn't. And to try and compare it to Medusa is just rediculous.

Invest in rechargeable batteries.2: the display plate is thin ABS plastic and I'm worried about a sharp object or a good crack shattering the glass;3: The LCD display is also hard to read in poor light (specifically by car dome light at night), but there is a backlight;4: It is complete BS that you can't enter your own data via a PC interface without buying that Garmin map software.None of these beefs are particularly troublesome.

This watch is advertised as having a leather strap (calfskin to be exact). When I received the watch and opened it, I noticed that the strap was hard manipulate. It was tough, and much shorter than I would have liked it to be. When I flipped the watch over it states right on the strap \\"Synthetic leather\\". Which of course explains why it was so difficult to maneuver the strap. Very disappointed in the false advertising and quality of the strap. The watch face itself is not bad looking, but the strap ruins the whole watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch","review":"I've had this watch for a long time, probably about 6 years. I really love it. I've had to change the battery once or twice, and I'm currently looking into getting a new watch band, because the current one is getting frayed. But overall, it is an excellent watch and has lasted much longer than I had expected it to. I wear it at all times, and I even forget to take it off before showering most days.

This is undoubtedly Roach's greatest accomplishment to date. I was blown away by this 2-cd set (4-cd's if you order Part II from Projeckt Records). There are no tribal elements (drums, etc) in Roach's latest work---just pure synthesized music-scapes that take you from darkness to light and back again. The first disc is heart-achingly beautiful as another reviewer has said. The sounds are rich, multi-layered and goes beyond anything I've ever heard from Roach before. The second disc is similar but different in superb ways to the first. It is earthier (but not tribal) and more varied. After listening to both discs I was blown away by the sheer magnificence of what Roach has presented us with. If you have any desire to travel through vast expanses inside your own mind---find lost parts of your self or just enjoy the wonder and beauty of it all, buy this disc, turn out the lights, relax and go deep within as you listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"missed potential","review":"It was a nice idea, and the box is very pretty.Unfortunately the name of the game bears no relation to the subject matter of a good proportion of the questions set. Someone seemed to have a real obsession with 'gansta rappers' and thought that anyone who had been killed was obviously 'goth' even if there was no corrolation whatsoever.Because of this I think their markets are going to be severely mismatched - the people who buy this game are going to have no interest in half the questions and those who would have been interested in the questions won't pick up the game in the first place.A real shame - not least because now no-one else can do the job properly, because the name has already been associated with this missed opportunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it","review":"I've played alot of board games, but this one takes the cake.

They have taken my meditations to a whole new level. They are also great for power napping or doing creative work. I feel that the Awakened Mind System discs are better than many of Thompson's other discs for two reasons. First, AMS uses combinations of all brainwave frequencies (beta, alpha, theta, delta) which makes you feel both relaxed and energized, peaceful and creative, dreamy and focused, all at once. This makes AMS useful for many different activities. Second, they are outstanding for meditation because the music is purely ambient and abstract. Many of Thompson's other discs, including the Theta Meditation System, use some ambience interspersed with repetitive melodies which can be quite distracting while meditating. If you're looking for music to deepen your meditation, enhance your mental functioning, or even help you sleep, try the Awakened Mind System."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not watse your money on the MP3s...","review":"THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF THE CD ITSELF, only a warning...

Although it was a humorous book, at some points it was just a little bit scary and the end almost didn't belong. Why would so funny a book have such a \\"tragic\\" ending? When I finished the book I was confused by its sad and half-scary conclusion. It being a children's book, I was expecting a happily-ever-after type ending. But when I thought about it, it made sense. The reason Aunt Sally was sympathetic towards PeeWee was because he reminded her of Robbie. And after they gave Robbie to the trolls, the family changed forever. I love what Aunt Sally said, \\"I guess knowing that your own trusted family could give you away, even in jest, well, it changes things.\\" This book made me want to hug my little sister! \\"The Trolls\\" is very imaginatively written, and definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teacher/Mother","review":"This is a wonderful book that can keep children occupied for hours on end.

It does explain very cleary the rudiments of professional cookery, and has many sequential photos to cleary demonstrate the methods being taught.

I bought the album (remember albums?), then lent it to a friend in the late 70's and never saw it again. For 25 years I've tried to find a copy and was amazed when I saw Epic Forest available on Amazon. As soon as I received and played the CD it brought me right back to the 70's. Yet the sounds of this band are timeless. I hear shades of Moody Blues, Pink Floyd, Stevie Winwood, Steely Dan and Jethro Tull in the unique style of Rare Bird. The vocal harmonies, acoustics, and hard licks are in great diversity, but make the listening very easy. I realize that I had pretty good musical tastes 30+ years ago. I just wonder why the band wasn't a greater commercial success. This was a purchase that I will cherish for a long time.Epic Forest"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare Bird pure class","review":"Epic Forest is a fantastic cd from a superb band.This band can rock with the best, but also has a melodic side, and with the fine vocals of Steve Gould and the sublime keyboards of David Kaffinetti the quality of the music is sustained throughout.This Album was first released in 1973, but such is the quality of the music and the musicians ,it easily stands the test of time.This CD is highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic Forest/A Classic","review":"I purchased this album back in the early seventies on vinyl and it came with a bonus record which includes the bonus material on the CD.

As a fairy tale fan, I first came across Goble inThe Moon Maiden and Other Japanese Fairy Tales, where all the color illustrations are in the middle of the book. Here, they are sprinkled throughout the book, more closely accompanying the story, and adding that much more to the reader's enjoyment.

I like that the lid doubles as a little tea cup. Note: as the instructions state, you need to put hot water in it, wait for 10 minutes, dump it out, and then add your hot liquid. It works great if you pre-warm it like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great thermos, terrible sticker","review":"Great leak-proof thermos for on-the-go hot coffee. No complaints there. But a big complaint about the large promo sticker glued to the side. I spent an hour soaking it, using De-Solv-It, and then gently scraping it off with fingernails... only to discover that the finish underneath had darkened under the hardened layer of glue. Call me vain, but I'd like the thermos to look new for at least its first few months of use.My thermos may have been an unlucky onesy from a back shelf somewhere, I suppose. Whatever, I returned it for the Thermos 'Nissan' bottle (16 oz.), which is virtually identical but arrived with a clean finish--and no darned sticker. (Update, almost 10 months later... I've taken my 'Nissan' to work daily, and it's been a champ. Hot-to-warm coffee all day, no leaks, easy cleaning.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This thermos worked pretty well for about a month. My coffee was still hot enough after about 2.5 hours. That's about what one should expect for a small thermos like this. But now the bottle gets hot to the touch and the coffee is cool after just 1 hour. Clearly it lost its vacuum between the inner and outer layers. Why doesn't Thermos make glass lined products any more? Glass liners never lose their vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Built to last","review":"I received one of these 15 or so years ago as a gift. It's beat up worse than a cage fighter, but still works well. I've lugged it every where, dropped it, ran over it, etc. Left it somewhere once and drove close to 100 miles round trip to retrieve it. I can't say how tough the new ones are, but mine has been museum worthy. Some day I know that it will die, when it does, I'm gonna give it proper burial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light, effective and really useful!","review":"This is a fantastic little guy. Keeps my tea hot for about 5-6 hours and pours well. The little cup on the lid is the perfect size and it's all very easily cleanable. Overall, a really deal for the price. Could keep things hot a little longer, and be a little bigger, but there are of course other, more expensive models that do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work!","review":"The first time I tried this, I put in really hot tea and drank it about 5 hours later. By then it had already gotten cool. So I further tested this product by putting in really hot water (steaming) and waiting. In as little as 4 hours, the water had already turned luke warm. This is definitely not designed for drinking coffee/tea hours after you make it. You have to drink it probably within a couple hours of making it. And if you have to do that, what's the point of a thermos?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Got this for a Gift","review":"My Dad asked for this book and so I got it for him.

Nothing is mentioned about the basic grip on the sword so beginners can see how to hold it properly. None of the stances or sword cutting moves are properly explained. The advanced technique shown involves rolling over on the floor still holding the sword which to me is asking for an accident to happen. A large portion of the dvd is showing basic techniques useing a jo staff which look good, and I must say was properly shown and explained slowly. This part of the dvd was very good, but I did not learn much from this dvd with regards to swordsmanship at all. would not recommend it for swordsmanship.

Having read it I can say that he's obviously a good judge of his own writing. It's about 3 spoiled sisters, their spineless brother, their whining, greedy father and a libertine friend. I only liked one of the characters, and he had a very small part. The only way I could get through it was to do lots of skimming. I like how Moore writes, so I'll be happy to try other books of his, but this one's a flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manttra Electric Pressure Cooker","review":"I tried two of these ... returned the first due to a screw head from bottom heating element protruding not slightly ... but enough to crease the bottom of the stainless steel pot. Felt this could be a problem in the future for a pot that undergoes pressure. Also, this unit would not seal. Top did not fit bottom of pan, regardless of gasket.Second unit I tried would, also, not even come close to sealing. Top turned too far and had to stand there and apply pressure to get my meal done. Luckily, could return this one also. Done with this model!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fully Progamable Controls ? Don't think so.","review":"First, we have been using pressure cookers on a regular basis , for 20+ years. They are great, but you need to be able to trust that the are going to work correctly.I received this item without any documentation. Still, I filled it up with water and plugged it in. First thing I noticed was that the electrical connection seemed exposed and not of a very robust design. I then progammed the cooker. That is selected the number of min to have the heat on; and pushed the start button. A light flashed, but nothing else happened. Then the timer began to count down towards zero. I moved the pot back and forth a little. Jiggling the pot must have improved the electrical contact, because pretty soon you could hear the water heating. After the set time of 5 min, the sound stopped. That's it. No control of the temperature at all, other than \\"ON\\" / \\"OFF\\"Nice Idea for a multi purpose cooker, but not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design, bad pressure cooker","review":"I really wanted this pressure cooker to be the multi-cooker it promised to be. The first one I received spewed steam all over the place and the pressure relief valve did not stay in place. After using it one time, I cleaned it and the very messy counters and decided to try cooking something else. It didn't even turn on. The second one I received had similar problems, basically with the pressure relief valve. Water also built up behind the led light display. It heats unevenly, only has 1 temperature and you cannot submerge the pot. I've used pressure cookers for years and this is by far the poorest one I have ever used. That said, the customer service was great and the company refunded my money. I don't think Manttra is making these anymore, which is a good thing because it is a really bad piece of kitchen equipment. The only good thing about it is the capacity."},{"rating":"2","title":"good deal","review":"This is a great price for an electric presure cooker!!!!

Jazz is about the immediacy of the creative process. No other music allows so much personal freedom and no singer takes advantage of it like Betty Carter. Her improvisations are far-out, her phrasing almost unbelievably laid back. She soars, swoops and dances, creating bold strokes, often sounding like a sax or trumpet. Her voice isn't what most people think of as beautiful. She's not gonna sing you a pretty song. Go elsewhere for that. This is a jazz singer's singer, an original, a woman who does it HER way. Listen to learn about phrasing, note bending, scatting, and especially about courage, conviction and sheer freedom of spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clear evidence Jazz died in the 1960's","review":"I love Jazz. I love the Blues. I love raw Jazz and Blues singers. I love gutsy experimentation. But, by the time this album came out, Jazz vocals had been developed as far as they were going to go. Betty Carter attempts to innovate in much the same way the Serialists tried to innovate in Classical music--and the result is just about as attractive. This screeching is unlistenable in the 21st century and is only valuable as a historical record of how hard a Jazz vocalist had to try to do anything meaninful after the rise of Rock & Roll.

A week later, they sent another of the same box. After calling the company, they had no advice. They realize that this is a design flaw, and have taken this TV off the market and discontinued it. So those who bought it, on sale, got stuck with something Viewsonic knew was a lemon. The noise is so loud at times, that you can hardly hear the TV.

Although Ferber's portrayal of blacks is dated and condescending, readers who can overlook this fault will find a plot and characters that grab their interest from the start. Curiously, although her Indian characters generally are flat and unpolished portrayals, those whites who speak up for the displaced Indians are quite eloquent in defense of those same Indians. The story of the Sooners, the Cherokee Strip, the impact of \\"Oil!\\" and the eventual statehood of Oklahoma is sure to provide an entertaining--and perhaps even informative and enlightening--selection for readers who don't mind the occasional purple prose paragraph.

Daredevil archeologist Indiana Jones (Ford) has been sent on an exciting adventure to Europe in search of the mystical Ark of the Covenant, known to give eternal life to anyone who has it in the palms of their hands. But Jones and a stubborn independent archeologist named Merrian (Allen) find themselves in a race against nazis who want the lost Ark for themselves. The heat is on... An awesome adventure that's fun and entertaining to watch. Great work, Spielberg and crew!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST EVER","review":"This is without a doubt, the best movie I have ever seen. I recomend it to the old, young, even the stupid. It's just such a great movie.

Thumbs up to Harrison Ford and Denholm Elliot."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know.","review":"I've watched this film about 4 times. I don't really know what it's about.

Although when the bad guy gets killed, it gets kind of dramatic. Kind of bloody and bone-chilling, but maybe not as much as Temple of Doom. Now that's a scary movie! Harrison Ford is acceptable as the famous two-fisted, whip-lashing daredevil!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Raiders\\" - a classic film in every way.","review":"Raiders of the Lost Ark, starring Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones and Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood. The story of Raiders is, in my opinion, one of the best in film history and the acting is excellent as well. The story deals with Indy being assigned to an important mission- to obtain the Lost Ark of the Covenant from the evil Nazis. Indy moves from continent to continent, running into old friends (and thousands of poisonous snakes!) along the way. The film's best part is a fantastic chase in which the Nazis try to steal the ark away from Indy who has driven away in a truck which is carrying the ark. The film's conclusion, Nazis being wiped out by the power of the ark, is classic, as Indy and Marion escape disaster narrowly.\\"Raiders\\" is on my list of the Top 10 best films of all time and is one that you will enjoy over and over again.P.S. Go George Bush!-Indy fan in Connecticut"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Money Maker strikes again","review":"Like my predecessor in his review,i just have to say that George Lucas always mess around with DVDs,Special Edition,Exclusive Special Edition,Original Cut,and Limited Editions.One thing is clear his Cash Cow Indy Jones will always work on Dvd but this Editions are for nothing.The original release is awesome the Specials ok,so why put them away and buy another disc.It's a shame that real fans will consider to buy the new editions,but they shall be warned,it's a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible but flawed","review":"The opening scene is an incredible blend of excitement, the unexpected, and even humour. The scene in the Mongolian bar is equally good. And that's the problem. No other scene is quite as good, and at least one just doesn't make sense. Indiana Jones is riding a horse and chasing the Nazi convoy which includes a tank. Why is that convoy running away!?!? They're reasonably intelligent Nazis. Why don't they just sort of, you know, stop? What would Indy do then?No other movie involves the viewer so quickly, but the rest of the movie drops off by comparison. I always watch the first few scenes and skip the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transfer's Looking Good!","review":"We all know the 'Indy\\" movies, so this review is more astetic based than a storyline critique.\\"Raiders\\" will always be the best, and offered here in a single movie purchase rather than the three disc set.Sound is better than good, picture is great on this anamorphic widescreen [2:35:1] DVD.It far exceeds the VHS version I previously owned.Movie transfers done right are always a worthy purchase.Also highly recommended to anyone with an upconvert player and a 40\\" or smaller LCD TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"skimpy info","review":"I purchased I.J. hat/whip set and a canvas bag- hoping to go along with a I.J. movie- this was not the movie --only out takes and production stuff-this should have been spelled out in the info --grandson was looking forward to watching this Christmas day now waiting to dvr it"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best cliffhanger movie of all time!","review":"What's to be said?

No matter how many times you see it, you'll hold your breath every time! The acting is superb, especially in Harrison Ford (of course) as the whip-wielding archaeologist hero. I'm putting the boxed set coloection on my X-mas wish list...Widescreen, baby! The two sequals are also five-star entertainment (\\"Temple of Doom\\", not as much). The theme song is one of the best in motion picture history! This is, if you'll forgive my expression, DA BOMB!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Call This Archaeology?","review":"The film that single handedly changed the image of archaeologists from dull, dusty Dons to handsome high adventurers. Personally I just loved watching Harrison Ford switching from bespectacled Professor Jones to the whip wielding Indiana. I had no trouble at all understanding why his class was almost all female, (I wish my college professors had looked like that!). What I've never understood is how the villain could have been so stupid as to *open* the Ark. Biblical accounts make it quite clear that thing was *dangerous* and best left lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"All these years later it's still great","review":"Anyone who hasn't watched this movie in some time should take the time to watch it again. And if your kids haven't seen it then maybe it's time to introduce it to the younger generation, presuming they're old enough to follow the plot and withstand some of what they would perceive to be the scarier scenes.This movie, in whatever format it now appears - Blu-ray, Special Edition DVDs, the older DVD, even VHS, is still worth the time. The story is still great. Harrison Ford, who looks young in this movie now that I'm about 28 years older than the first time I saw the movie - clearly deserved to accolades the movie brought him all those years ago. This is just a super movie that provides pure entertainment - the kind that removes the reader from reality for a few hours. And sometimes that's just what a movie should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"grrrrrrrrreat","review":"great film, goes well with the soundtrack.

The first scene is probably the coolest, but the rest is action-packed as well. The adventure never stops, and even the 10th time seeing it is enjoyable. This is the original and definatly the best Indiana Jones film, and not one to be overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Fun","review":"This is a fun roller coaster of a movie. I realize that it is not an acurate portrayal of Archeaology. I tell my Anthropology professors that I became interested in Anthropology because of this movie just to bug them. This movie has on the edge of you seat action, especially the scene where Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is Climbing on the truck. The special effects at the end are very good.My only complaint is that the movie does portray Archeaologists as being grave robbers. That is not the case. Archeaologists are dedicated people. Grave robbing is a crime against culture, because it robs them of their history and heritage.I gave this movie five stars because it is an excellent action/adventure film not because of its accuracy. Of course the score is fantastic as well as the cinematography."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Asps...Very dangerous.....you go first.\\"","review":"I love this movie.

The solid structure of the songs and the lyrics impressed me. Question was my favorite, along with Cyrus Gore. Chris Trujillo is great with backup vocals and drums.

Sure, the addition of the newest Pokemon is great, and I loved Earl's Library, but why bother putting it in this weird new format? Here's a hint: take the original Pokemon Stadium. Add new features. That would've been good enough! But here, Nintendo has gone overboard with souping up a children's game! You can only take this concept so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as P1 in some ways, but better in others.","review":"This is a good game, but there are many things that are different that I do not like.

This is a really good game if you also have Gold and/or Silver Gameboy too.I also have Pokemon Puzzle League which is a very good game. Overall, P2 is my least favorite of the 3.

I tried having this shake once with bites of fresh fruit, and it was still barely edible. It's low fat, packs a ton of protein, calories are almost all from protein, it's low sugar, and all that.

It is very well done and presents itself that way as well.The ONLY ISSUE is there is no back to the pendant. The inner area of the pendant bows outward from the border and due to the light wait of the pendant, it'd be nice if the back looked a little better.Also, the PACKAGING wasn't the best. It's just about a 4x4 inch white box with a foam insert that is incorrectly cut too small. Then in a large microfiber pouch is the necklace. It could have been presented better.Overall, it's a nice, inexpensive gift that's worth the price.

I found that book extraordinarily helpful in my earliest studies. This book is full of helpful information as well.

I highly recommend the work to anyone working in landscapes in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"A valuable book for me","review":"I had checked a number of painting books out of the library and was so impressed with this one that I purchased it. I didn't rate it 5 stars because I could imagine there being a more complete and sophisticated book. However, she appears to be a solid painter and she deals with more than just a couple of color wheels. She also offers up her manner of mixing colors. It's always nice to know how someone else approaches these matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of Kessler's books give solid information you can use!","review":"Highly rated because the material is able to be applied by artists.

This is a book to keep by the easle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Color engraving is not color harmony","review":"The theoretical part of the book is well written and useful for the beginner. But you can find similar descriptions also in other books. The main challenge for an artist is not to mix colors to create a new colour but to combine a lot of colors that looks pleasant. In this book you can find not any hints and examples to combine colors in different ways. The author informs you instead that it is your task to find out the colors you like. Apart from few paintings all paintings looks like the painting on the cover of the book (colorless and with colour engravings, in most cases: brown). The author confuse obviously colour harmony with colour engravings. If I made such pictures with my camera, I would trash them. In case you would like to learn something about colour combinations or get some ideas and inspirations: do not buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"molly hatchet flirting with disaster live","review":"one of them that you put in and you have watched over half of it withoutrealizing it.good sound"},{"rating":"2","title":"good reference","review":"After borrowing this book from the local library, I decided to purchase this book as a reference.

It was difficult to picture what was actually going on in the book. I think she was trying to hard with the characters role in the book.

Upon first listen I absolutely loved this cd, but now after many hours of listening, this cd has seemed to have lost its charm. Many of tracks get boring to listen to. The beginning 6 tracks and tracks 12 and 14 are very good, as for the rest I just skip them. I would definitely get this album if you are a Krush fan or an abstract hip-hop fan in general, there are many strong tracks on this mix, that is definitely worth it. I can't wait for Krush's next album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So good it's almost scary","review":"This Cd, for lack of a better word, is amazing. Krush is the premier trip hop DJ, nobody does it better. He is also an artist in the truest sense of the word. I just picked this Cd up yesterday and I probably won't take it out of my player for a long time to come. Not as dark as his last, this has almost a playfull feel to it, like he's challenging any other DJ to try and top him, which I don't think is possible. Krush may not be the fastest, but he is definitely the most artistic and aesthetically rich DJ I have ever heard. Any fan of trip hop must have this Cd. Any fan of the turntables must have this Cd. Any fan of Krush probably already has it. If you're new to Krush, this Cd will make a dedicated fan out of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atlantic City NJ Fire Dept.

The user interface is pretty simple to operate, and there are some neat built-in features, such as an audio recorder, that expands the camera's versatility. The pictures I've taken all look very sharp and vivid. You can use preset scene options or manually adjust EV, white balance, ISO, and metering to your preference. It even has rudimentary camcorder abilities and can display your photos or movie clips on a television with the included AV cable. The video frame rate is 30 fps and is very smooth in appearance. Maximum resolution for clips is 320x240...good enough for basic purposes. The built-in two-inch screen isn't the sharpest display I've seen, but it does get the job done. All things considered, the DXG 518 is a great value for any casual photographer."},{"rating":"2","title":"a neo-classical classic","review":"Richard Andersson suprised the prog metal community with brilliant melodies on this neo-classical prog metal thriller.

WELL THIS BOOK SHOWS DIFFERENT> Brad Steiger - well known in the paranormal world - does much to prove that eons ago intelligent humans lived on the planet, and were in fact capable of creating a higher form of technology then we find ourselves with today. Supposedly, the overlords of Atlantis assisted in the construction of the pyramids,had space travel and may even been in contact with extraterrestrials. It was a wonderful world until mankind became too materialistic and destroyed itself with weapons of mass destruction...evidence of which can be found many places around the planet. This is both an adventure book as well as a book that can teach the reader a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this book quite disappointing (and not just because the text contained grammatical errors and typos in places). The back cover claims \\"...archeological proof...indicate that the Great Pyramid was constructed with the assistance of the High Priests of Atlantis.\\" However, there is no proof offered in this book, just theories and hypotheses. It's like a very long episode of \\"In Search Of...\\" where you never actually get an answer. I also found the photos included in the book useless for the most part. Many were of the author standing in ancient ruins. Big deal. Some drawings of maps of the ancient world would have made much more helpful companions to the text. The research talked about in the book is very interesting, but it proves nothing. In fact, some of the research studies contradicted each other. Very very disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very technical but well written","review":"This is a pretty technical book on theoretical statistics based on measure-theory.

However, the biggest problem is that this book is not technically correct. Many proofs pretend to be complete, but actually there are many gaps and many important propositions are left unproved. The book should be honest about what they prove and what they do not prove.The only advantage of the textbook is clarity in statements, not in proofs.

Very little emphasis is placed on statistical thought or ideas. It is easy to get lost in this sea of analysis and mathematical trickery. The reader is left with the impression that the author is more interested in demonstrating his mathematical prowess and ability to pointlessly abstract concepts than teach. Consequently, this book is unsuitable for teaching--unless the reader has at least a MS level mathematics education and plans to do research in mathematical statistics. Even then, this book is, at best, a good reference.For advanced textbooks in measure theoretic mathematical statistics, I highly recommend:Theory of Point EstimationLehmann and CasellaTesting Statistical HypothesesLehmann"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amateur boater to engineer will find this book useful.","review":"This is an extremely readable book for a technical subject tome.

I got the Medium (and my hands are in no way Medium), and lo and behold, it is too small, a struggle to get them on, and doesn't allow me to grip well, so I'm going to have to get large! Just absolutely ridiculous. If you could see my hands, the idea that I could be a Large in gloves that are presumably not sized for children is pretty much inconceivable. I don't know how it's possible to screw up the sizing this badly. The sizing chart is not accurate.

At the least, red discoloration and irritation on the side of my palm facing my thumb, at worst, after wearing these gloves for 1 full session (and ignoring the pain from them) my hands turned a slight blueish purple from loss of blood flow.

The straps work great when your forearms or grip strength is weakened after previous intense workouts and you still need that extra edge but can't rely on your hands alone. However, just like any Harbinger gloves I've ever used, they only last a few months before tearing and wearing down. I did, however, order these for my dad for Christmas since he's not nearly the hardcore weightlifter as I am but just in case he ever has those days to lift more than his hands could handle.

Such as the soldiers with no grenandes hanging from their web gear (they magically appear during the battle scenes), or only one BAR in the entire company, and no one wearing bandoleers of ammo for their M-1 rifles. And one of the biggest faux's was the use of German MP-40's (9mm subguns) by both the Americans and Japanese (In the Pacific War?).A cheaply made movie (technically speaking) for only the psychological impact. I guess I'm just used to more realism than was displayed in this movie.

I read one of the earlier reviews where someone left a cup on a table overnight and it didn't leak. That is because the cup remained upright. However, these cups leak tremendously when left on their sides. I can't tell you how many milk puddles I have cleaned up on my furniture and carpet. I thought I was doing something wrong until I read all of the other leaky reviews. Stay away from these cups and the baby bottles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKS LEAKS LEAKS!","review":"I should have know better because I had problems with Avent's baby bottles leaking fluid out the side of the lid. I read some other reviews and thought I'd give the training cups a try thinking they would be different. I was wrong. I discovered one of my son's cups that he had while playing and it was on its side with almost all the liquid on the carpet. The cap was screwed on so tightly that I almost couldn't get it opened so it wasn't user error. I will never recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKY BOTTLES","review":"I bought these bottles because my year old son was having trouble transitioning to the bottle.

Then you'll love these","review":"These Avent cups are very, very durable and put up with a lot of abuse from any overactive toddler. They've fallen off the roof of my car, rolled down stairs, etc. without incident. The parts are interchangeable with other Avent products, which is a big plus.But they leak from time to time where the cap screws onto the bottle. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to this pattern of leakage, but having milk/juice/tea/water run down a toddler's hands and arms is no fun to clean.And cleaning these things can be a real pain. The caps are composed of 5 parts that are nearly impossible to remove once they or your hands are wet. The tapered clear caps are especially difficult to pull off unless your hands are made of sticky tape or sandpaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE These Cups","review":"They leak everytime we use them. My son thinks it's cool because he can smear the liquid all over the floor. It's not worth the money. I bought another brand and they have not leaked once. I'm not sure why the avents leak, but they do and there's nothing I can do about it. I'm very disappointed. I just wasted a lot of money on something I will never use again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate These Cups","review":"The whole point to having these cups is the prevent the liquid in the cup from coming out. Well these cups do not do their job at all. They leak everytime. I hate them! I will never buy another Avent product again. It's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKY CUPS","review":"I too liked these cups until they leaked everywhere, what a mess. The diaper bag, car, couch,they leaked from the time I purchased them. I have called avent they sent me some replacement valves, they too did not work.

Dont but AVENT products, you will have milk puddles everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"They leak","review":"Initially, when they were new, I didn't have any problems (except not knowing that the pieces come apart and must be cleaned separately until I saw mold)!

Well, I was VERY disappointed! They do leak all over the place. They are hard tog et apart to clean also. I would not recommend them thats for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Clean","review":"As I was removing the soft 'bladder' for cleaning, the hard disc also came out. It wasn't until this accidental discovery that I realized bacteria had been building up beneath the soft bladder and the liquid my daughter was drinking from the Avent cups was contaminated by months of buildup. Disgusting.Okay, I've got a closetful of these cups so I decide I'll take each cup apart and clean them. At this point, the cups are so dirty cleaning them takes quite a bit of effort. As I'm trying to cleanse the cups for future use I realize that each time my daughter uses one I'll need to go through this extensive process.End result? I dumped every Avent cup into the trash and replaced them with Playtex cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best of a bad lot !!!!!!!!","review":"I first bought these cups probably for the same reason most people will buy them The Avent bottles are fantastic and are I think by far the best on the market so my expectation for these magic cups were high, however I was soon to be dissappointed for the following reasons.They leak from the rim but not from the spout so spill proof would not be a phrase I would use for themThere are so many parts which make cleaning very difficultThe valve system works then doesn't for no apparent reason and frustrates my son no end and the cup ends up being thrown away in frustration.However in this cups defense I have then gone on to try many other varieties of cups and have found that the perfect spill proof easy drink, easy clean cup is just not out there. Gap in the market anyone who can design the perfect cup !!!!!! So come on Avent have another go and get it right this time !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They leak everywhere!","review":"I do not like these cups! They leak inbetween the lid and the cup and it does not matter how much you tighten them! I got cheap ones for $1 that work better than these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"These cups stink, there's no other way to put it. The first thing that I noticed when we got one was that they have so many parts to remove and clean. Our daughter also has not taken to it at ALL. She will drink from any other brand of sippy cup that I give her (Gerber, Playtex and Take n Toss) but not this one. I think the spout is too long. We have an assortment of all of these brands but I would recommend the Take n Toss anyday. They are cheap, durable (we've been using the same ones for over 6 months, including washing them in the dishwasher everytime), and best of all, there are no valves to clean or have make sure they don't get moldy. My advice is avoid the Avent unless you miraculously have tons of extra time on your hands (with a toddler? yeah, right!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Leaks & Compatible with Other Avent Products","review":"I actually came across these sippy cups completely by accident. In the midst of all of my bottle testing, I was against Avent, mostly because they do cost a bit more than most bottles. I thought that I could test a bottle and cup, to see if Avent was really telling the truth when they said all the parts were interchangeable. Well, they are. I like how some of the newer ones have little stars. The colors, even when mixed and matched don't look tacky.I set one of these cups, fully of water upside down over night to see if they would leak. In the morning, there weren't any water droplets on the table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avent leads the way","review":"I highly recommend this product. My son was very stubborn minded about giving up his bottle (it took us til he was 20 months old to finally get him off it !) .Unlike most sippie cups, the spout on this cup feels the same as an ordinary bottle and the shape allows baby to suck juice out of it without sliding off. Little teethers can bite without scratching the spout. It is spillproof (other than a couple of drops here and there). Cleaning is a doddle with avents wide mouth, and the best part is if you were wise enough to invest in avent infant bottles, you dont have to go out and buy a huge amount of cups, because the sippie cup spouts can be sold seperately and fit perfectly on your old bottles which needless to say can save you money. My advice is go with avent throughout your child's first years you wont be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best there is...","review":"I have 3 kids and have tried just about every sippy cup out there. While Avent has its drawbacks (leaks somewhat and does have lots of parts to clean and keep up with), it is still by far the best sippy cup there is. Because of all the parts, it is the easiest to clean (the others have valves that you can't get into to clean). And while it does leak a bit when on its side, I haven't seen any that don't. Also, with many other brands, if my BOY decides to throw his cup like a ball, the valve will pop off, but not with Avent. The fact is, there is no perfect sippy cup, but if you want to get as close as possible to perfect, this is the cup you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST sippy cup!","review":"I am so surprised at how many people do not like this cup...My daughter likes these the best! She likes the rubber tip,(to chew on) and I like that it is SPILL PROOF!! GREAT CUP!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait a pain!","review":"I tried these cups as a transition away from bottles with the soft top. My baby refused to use them and with 6 parts, it was a pain to take apart and clean.

She hated it. I thought she was just an exception until I learned that my friends had had the same problem with these Avent sippy cups. They're just too hard to use. Save your money and go for the 1st Years cups. They're much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong item shipped","review":"I received the toddler cup with the hard mouth piece.

Unfortunately I had already dispersed them out to family and schools."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not waist your money","review":"I purchased the Avent bottles after being told that they help with colic.My daughter had colic very bad and the bottles seemed to help. After a few months the bottles started to leak terribly!! I had recommended these bottles to a friend and I am now embarressed that I did so because their bottles are now leaking as well. When my daughter turned 1 I thought I would give the sippy cups a try since they had the soft spout and looked a bit easier to suck from than others. My daughter took to the sippy cups quite well. Again, after a few months they started leaking. The whole Avent system is a great concenpt how everything is interchangeable. BUT THEY LEAK ALL THE TIME!!!!! If these bottles/sippy cups would not leak I would give a definite 5 stars. I would not recommend these bottles/cups to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Leak Sippy Cups","review":"We just started using the avent sippy cups with our 6 month old. He was bottled fed from day one, but has adjusted to the sippy cup wonderfully. As far as the leaking issues, there has only been one time when it did leak, but we didn't have the lid screwed on correctly. Other than that one time, it hasn't leaked since. We highly recommend the avent bottles, bottle warmer, pacifiers, and the NO Leak sippy cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy","review":"I loved my Avent Bottles so I thought I would love the sippy cups as well. Not the case, everytime my toddler climb up on my couch he left a big wet spot where his cup had been leaking. I now have stains on my couch that can not be removed by a professional steam cleaning company. They work great in the beginning but after a couple of washings they will start to leak. Try Playtex or Gerber. We have had great success with those two brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds cool...but not worth it","review":"The vent system on this cup sounds like a great idea, but it is not worth the hassle. My daughter sucks wells on sippy cups, but with this one, the liquid flow is very inconsistent and she is often sucking on air. In addition, they are much too difficult to clean.In all honesty, the best cups I've found have been the ventless ones. The liquid flow correctly and they are easy to clean. In my eyes, the vent system provides no benefit."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I purchased these cups because I had been using the Avent bottles and was pleased with them. The only thing I like about this cup is the soft spout, which is nice for teething babies to get them to start trying a cup instead of bottle. The top of the cup is so flat it smashes my daughter's nose when she tries to drink, which she basically has to do with her head tilted all the way back. It should be angled like other cups. Also, the anti-spill valve is nice but irritating to clean since it is 3 different pieces including the spout. Heaven forbid you should try to put this cup in your diaper bag WITHOUT using the valve, though, because even with the clear travel lid on it spilled all in our bag. Yuck! I will buy other cups in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"leak cups","review":"These cups should be named leak cups instead of magic cups.I am so tired of cleaning mess in my diaper bag because of these cups all the time.I have no other options as my baby doesn't drink from any other cup.Only best thing about these cups is that spout is pretty soft for teething babies .I called the company they have send me some rings and spouts but they still leak.I am helpless , my baby doesn't take any other cup so cleaning up the mess is part of my everyday work.I will not reccommend this cup to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible! save your money","review":"these cups are terrrible. i used the advent bottles so I thought i would love the cups. boy was i wrong. not only are they a pain to clean and take apart, but they leak everytime they are on their side. no matter how careful you are about putting them together, they leak. i bought the playtex sipsters and love them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst than Worst","review":"I have twins, so I need several of one thing.

I have been using this cup since my son was four months old. When I discontinued the bottle I replaced it with this sippy cup. To my surprise, they leaked. I didn't notice before because I would only give him water in it and not very much at that. I hate the avent sippy cups. I threw them all away and used another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT LEAKS!!!","review":"I experienced the same problem as other reviewers - it does not spill or leak through the spout, but when it is left on its side, I am left with a big mess! Also, I did find that all the parts were overwhelming as far as trying to clean. The reason I bought them was because of the soft spout (trying to get my son off the bottle)."},{"rating":"1","title":"These cups are the worst!!!","review":"I also bought these cups because I liked the bottles and Avent is supposed to be one of the best. Yes they do leak everywhere. I don't care how tight or perfectly you screw the top on they leak in your car and all over your house. And yes they are leaking from the lid but also if there is any liquid trapped in the suction part. They are also a pain to clean because you must pull and pick apart several pieces otherwise the cap will get moldy.I have contacted Avent because I am so upset I want to return all of them but I am still waiting to hear back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product for the money and potentially dangerous","review":"My son loves these cups. However, I am not as impressed withthem.First and most frightening, the plastic screw on top shattered one of the first times it was dropped on the floor leaving broken plastic pieces everywhere - very dangerous. The cup is no longer useable.Second, if the cups are left on their side, they leak. This leakage has happened since the day they were purchased, so it is not a problem with the valve.Third, if the cups are dropped on the floor, milk squirts out.For the cost of the cups and and an Avent product, I expected a better cup. I sent mail to the company and was told I was using the product wrong - great customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely horrible","review":"Don't waste your money on this product.

First of all they are impossible to clean and when i finally did get the plastic cover off to clean it it wouldn't go back on. So i went out and bought another one thinking that I did something wrong! Well I was wrong this one did the same thing and they way to over priced to keep buying them! I should have know because I used playtex bottles for the first year of my sons life switching to avent was such a huge mistake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In the garbage","review":"I purchased these cups for my son when he was 13 months old. I was quickly disappointed upon using them. They leaked from time to time while my son was drinking from them. As you might imagine when these cups leaked with milk or juice in them my son would quickly become a wet and sticky mess. They are also very difficult to clean. They actually break down into 5 seperate pieces which was a real pain in the neck for me. If you do not beak them down completely before cleaning them they simply just do not come out clean. I kept these cups for 3 months before I got fed up enough to throw them in the garbage. I have since purchased playtex and gerber cups both of which I recommend, they are easy to clean and no more leaks. Save your money and skip this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"More negatives than positives","review":"I bought 8 of these cups. My son has been using them for 10 months. I have finally had enough and am going out to buy another brand. They leak around the collar if not tightened properly. They leak at the spout when dropped. There are too many pieces (cup, collar, spout, rubber gasket, hard plastic disc and handles)which make them a chore to clean. Sometimes when my son tries to drink from them, you just hear an \\"air\\" sound and he is getting no liquid. He must tilt the cup straight up in the air to get the last ounce of fluid out. However, I have not had any mold growing in mine (as other reviewers had happen.) They do have a soft spout which is what drew me to them in the first place since my son was teething at the time. I am very disappointed in this product since I only used Avent nursing bottles and was very happy with them. It seems that Playtex may make a better sippy cup, so I will be purchasing some of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"no OSX support","review":"I just purchased your firewire iBOT webcam, and I'm very unhappy that I have to pay more for OSX support.OSX is no longer new.

Didn't look too bad when I received it either. The problem is that it is not Near Long Enough. You can't just leave it like it's shown in the picture. It blows off continuously. It's like throwing a sheet over the grill. You must tie the string that comes with it. When the string is tied, it makes the cover come up about 18 inches. There's a great deal of your grill that is not covered. Only the top of the grill will be covered. The lower half of your grill is left bare. My old cover completely covered the grill. This is supposed to be the same size. It's not. It's also a little thinner than I thought it would be, so won't last too long. It was a cheap price though, so it will get replaced as soon as I find a decent one. It's small enough to be used as a chair cover & might be useful that way.

I am lucky in that my mother has a copy of it, because since as early as I can remember, I've heard the stories and loved the pictures. Kay Nielsen was a brilliant artist, and the stories are beautiful in and of themselves - this book definitely needs to be back in print. None of that paperback nonsense, either...I'm talking the original way, hardback (green cloth cover with gold embossment), and the dust jacket in green as well, with one of Nielsen's brilliant watercolors on the front (I forget which it is).This is by far one of the most beautiful books I have ever had the privilege to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"only a marginal reproduction","review":"This 1977 book is not the beautiful book people remember from their childhood, but only a mediocre reproduction.

And that's BARELY what it is worth. It is not like the wonderful description. I can't put my phone in my pocket or it doesn't work, constantly breaking up and muffled. The phone has to be fairly close(a foot or so) to the bluetooth or the voice breaks up. I am totally disappointed with it. I had previously owned two motorola bluetooth devices, and they were far superior to this. I lost the last one in a house fire and was trying to replace it. Poor choice. It is much larger and not as comfortable and stable as the old one. The regular price on this is about the same as I paid for the other(the motorola), and the quality is far below. I was going to return it, but there is no return choice that lists poor quality as a reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headset","review":"I've tried other bluetooth headsets and the biggest problem I've had is not being able to hear others from my car with all the road noise. The Plantronics 665 is great. In fact I actually had to turn down the volume a bit. I also noticed it connects instantly to the phone where my old Motorolla had a slight delay. I would have given this 5 stars except a lot of background noise is picked up by those on the other end of the line. Overall a very clean design. Other than the road noise, people on the other end didn't know I was using a wireless headset. Nice small design fit my ear well. The DC charging station/dock for the car is great. Charges as well from your PC USB. I'm using this with my Palm Treo 755p."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good headset, could use better ear pieces.","review":"The earpieces don't go as far into the ear as my etymotic earlpugs, so I have to use the wire hook it came with to stabalize it. I wish the in-ear part gripped my ear a little better. Also, the hook falls off easily when it's in my pocket. I wish there was a more permanent way to attach it. Also, there are some CRAZY big ear gels in there. I have big ears (har har) and I use the smallest one. WHOS ears are big enough for the large attachments?Having said that, the headset is a winner. It's LOUD! I actually have to turn it down. Reception is good and it pairs with my L2 quickly and easily. No problems hearing other people or them hearing me.Last thing... it pairs up with my Mac G4 no problems. System sounds go through it and that's pretty cool!I give it a 4 out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"I have owned 2 Plantronics headsets -- The 665 and its predecessor, the 655. Both have suffered the same fate. The little rubber ear tips are flimsy and keep breaking. When I pick up the headset, the ear tip falls out. I purchased the ear tip replacement pack, which costs about $10 and you get 3 ear tips -- 1 small, 1 medium, and 1 large. Given that I only have a need for 1 size, I basically had to pay $10 for one ear tip... which broke after 30 days. The headset sounds pretty good, fits in my ear OK, and people say they can hear me pretty well. Despite all of these positives, I will be replacing it with another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of many BT headsets I've owned","review":"This headset is the best I've ever had.

When I first got it, not so much. I had to remember to turn the darned thing off because I was used to the Motorola head sets where you just flip it closed. The buttons are tiny but you get used to it.On the plus side: the thing sits comfortable in my ear with no need for an uncomfortable ear hook. I also can hear very very well with it.

Since many people do keep the bluetooth in their pocket, I can't understand why they would design it so the earpiece detached so easily instead of a permanently-attached ear loop like on the Motorola's.

In fairness, before condemning the Discovery 665 I would have to try it with other phones and/or try my phone with other Bluetooth headsets. But I don't have time for that. So I am only comparing this experience with past ones involving older phones and Bluetooth headsets, all of which worked much better.Using this unit with my Curve, during any call in progress (from initiation onward) I heard a subtle, but noticeable sound like a resonant hollow tube; I heard bad, deep distortion or choppy audio on my end; and the people I spoke with heard my voice subjected to heavy audio compression artifacts (like the swooshiness you hear in very low resolution mp3 audio.)The Discovery 665 seems to work well for others, but I am returning mine for a refund.

When I was stopped at a traffic light, outgoing sound was very clear and nice, but unfortunately even the slightest road noise was a big issue.I really wanted to keep this headset because I still have some older accessories that are compatible, but unfortunately I will have to return it.

The first a lost because it was so light that I did not realize it had fallen off of my ear. By the time it was found, weather conditions had destroyed it. The second was my fault that it was destroyed. I did like the product enough that I purchased a third one. I had it about six weeks when the ear gel piece fell out and would not stay snapped in. I replaced that one and my ear became so sensitive that it was extremely painful to insert or remove it, and within about six weeks that ear gel unit fell out of the body. Because of the apparent allergenic nature of the ear gels and the fact that they tend to fall out of the main body of the unit I have opted for a different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I CAN'T HEAR YOU!","review":"I used the Plantronics 665 for one day and returned it to Amazon.

But the new pair had the same design flaw: the earbud connects to the headset by way of some flimsy plastic nubs - or perhaps they're better described as nublets. Once the bud is positioned inside the headset socket, it must be turned an 1/8th turn to 'lock' into place. The trouble is, the thing never really locks in, and over time it just defaults to the neutral (unlocked) position. So fairly frequently the earbud pops out of the headset socket and flies off somewhere. The over-ear clip flies off too, though not usually as far. It's just a poor design choice to have a crucial mechanism hanging on by such a tiny thread. Nevertheless, if you can keep the 665 in your ear long enough to make a phone call, it sounds pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voice sounds muffled...","review":"I have had this Plantronics Discovery 665 Bluetooth headset for two days and everyone I call tells me I sound very muffled.

Frantzis and his water method provide the only chi gung I would ever dare to learn from a book, and it is because of a combination of his explicit instruction and the gentle nature of the water method that this is so.Beware: Frantzis is disparaging towards other systems, and he often shows them in their worst light.

The veneration for Jefferson that Dumas Malone puts on paper borders on outright worship. Jefferson seems not to have been a man, but an infallible demi-god.According to Malone, if Jefferson was wrong about something, he didn't really mean it. If he made a mistake, he had good reasons and it was actually someone else's fault. If he lied (which he did A LOT), he did it to protect the integrity of the country and it was completely understandable under the circumstances. I've never read so much double talk in all my life. By the time you get to Jefferson's presidency, it gets pretty tough to gag down the copious amounts of praise that Malone spews from his pen.This is basically a massive kids' book, showing us the guy on the two dollar bill through rose, white, and blue glasses.

Attak/Reload is an awesome opener, and has some of the coolest music I have ever heard. Dirty and Skurk were both nice driving anthems, and Sturm and Drang is quite the rocker as well.Now the bad:I thought Urban Monkey Warfare had all the potential to be a great song, but the lyrics were very weak. Save me, even though I love skold, was very trite, and very simplistic, and Risen was pretty retarded.I agree with another reviewer that Yo Ho Ho was pretty cool.All in all, this album made me go purchase WW3, and unfortunatley I didn't enjoy that album very much.

I was embarrased to listen to \\"Risen\\". It was just lyrically horrible I don't know what's wrong with them. Now in Skold's defense, he is a badass, his voice is cool and he's a good writer his solo album is good. But we had him in Symbols, Adios, MDFMK, and Attak it was just a bit much.

But the fact still remains that KMFDM died when En Esch and Gunter Schulz left the band, and in my opinion it needs to stay dead. Adios was a great farewell album, hence the name Adios. But this just ruins it for me. KMFDM would have remained a legend had it not been for this album. Now they're just another group of people who failed to make good music independently and have fallen back into the safety net that is now KMFDM. ...

But it was fun rock music by crazy Germans, and it didn't reek of stale guitar riffs and big hair. A friend, knowing that I owned every KMFDM release from day one, got me this CD for my birthday. I wasn't going to bother. I wouldn't have been missing much. The irony and iconic bigger-than-life image is gone. Now Sascha is a 40-something rocker who's convinced himself of his own seriousness.

KMFDM and other projects from Sascha have been going down hill since KMFDM originally broke up, Sascha has become mean and disgruntled towards ex-members work and has become quite hostile. This has affected his work and made this album less then stellar compared to older albums prior to their original breakup. Sascha should have refrained from trying to bring back KMFDM, that way he could have left us with a good memory of the greatness that KMFDM once achieved.Just a note, this album does have a few good tracks, but those are the ones that Raymond Watts worked on, so you might as well save your money and buy a PIG album (Raymond Watts band) instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old junk from German band KMFDM","review":"More bleeps and bloops.

I have to say, Attak is by no means a disappointment or a let-down; it shows an evolution of sound and interesting progress for an equally intriguing band. Most of the songs on the record are powerful, begging to be blasted as loud as your stereo and ears can stand, and even the lyrics compliment the heavy music style.

It said that I should expect my first issue in October. I actually got it in the middle of November after I had to inform them that I had not recieved it yet. That was the issue that came out in July. Now it is March 2011 and I have not recieved any more issues. I should have recieved another one in January and then be expecting another in April.

Save your money and buy the less expensive cups, at least until Advent fixes the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice","review":"I bought this cup because the spout is soft but then I found out it is difficult to get the valves out and they are a two piece thing which makes it easy to loose or misplace.

But they leak. First I thought it was a defective one so I exchanged it but the new ones do the same thing. It is not from the spout, it is from the part where the top and bottom screw together. It is ok if it is upright but if it gets knocked over and is left on its side or upside down it will leak.

I tried using these cups for my son since he was 6 months old with no success. He's now over a year and drinks well from a cup, but not the magic cup. The magic cup leaked for me many times, when I called Avent customer service they told me I was putting the valve in too tight, but no matter what I tried, they leaked. Also, my son never got accustomed to the spout. Instead, he has been using the Playtex Straw Cup, which he uses very easily. My son prefers to drink from straws, or even the cheap Rubbermaid Take Along sip cups. Maybe you'll have more success, but in my opinion, the sippy part of the magic cup is too hard to suck on (yes, I've tried it), and it was not a match for my son. Other than this product, I highly recommend other Avent products."},{"rating":"1","title":"these cups leak!","review":"I am lucky - I have a 14 mo. daughter who will drink from almost anything. However, having used Avent bottles and pump early on, I stuck with the avent brand cups. Using them at home as fine, except for the fact that the top is in 5 pieces, including the lid! (Lid, spout, ring, and two-part valve). A lot of chance for losing parts. When we started toting them everywhere we went, I noticed they really leak. Not from the spout, they are spill-proof in that respect. It is where the ring screws onto the cup. It doesn't seem to seal well. My husband and I joked that we should wrap the threads with teflon tape like for a leaky plumbing problem. I am not the only one to have had this problem, another mom of a toddler at the library said she had the exact same problem.

There is no telling if the cup is ever really clean. For the money I paid I expected a better model. Work work work! I can barely take a sip from them- it's more like a suck cup.

I was suprised that people didn't realize that the spouts come apart, as mine came with instructions on how to clean them that clearly showed how to take them apart and put them back together. I love that they're completely interchangeable with the bottles and breast pump.

The spout is shaped SO weird, it's hard for babies to \\"latch\\" on to. I also don't think the drink comes out fast enough for the babies.What I do like about these cups, though, is how you can interchange with the Avent bottles. For example, I took the sippy cup handles, and put it on the bottles when my baby was learning to hold a bottle. Or, I'd put the sippy cup spout on a bottle. Or, I'd put a bottle nipple on the sippy cup. The interchangeability is pretty cool, but my kids just won't use the sippy cup spouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many better cups out there","review":"The only good thing to say about these cups is that they have rubber spouts which can be easier to little ones learning to first use a cup.

Playtex cups are by far the best I've found."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked and too many parts","review":"This cup leaks all the time. Nothing we could do would stop the leaking.

They were the first sippy cups we tried when my child was 5 months old because we loved the Avent bottles. My child is now 21 months old and we have used several other brands of sippy cups. The Avent brand is my least favorite! There are so many parts and they are difficult to clean. Fluids get trapped in difficult places and they become disgusting! The soft spouts also become stained easily. The only positive points to these cups are that they don't spill easily, are interchangeable with the Avent bottles, are clear, and the handles can be moved to different potitions in relationship to the spout. But, please don't waste your money. I'm throwing all my Avent cups out because I dislike them so much! Buy Playtex or Gerber and save yourself the hassle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This cup stinks!","review":"I got this cup for my 8 month old daughter. She won't drink from it at all. I tested it myself and found the water inside had a very bad plastic taste that almost made me throw up. No matter how I wash and boil this cup, it starts to stink whenever I screw the ring and sprout on. Plain water tastes terrible after staying in it for half an hour. I ended up throwing the cup away and using an Avent bottle body. Why waste money on it? Just buy a sprout to go with an old bottle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great feeding system!","review":"I used the Avent bottles when my baby was born, and now that she's 5 months and we're starting solids, I tried the cups. She loves them! She holds the cup without the handles and drinks. It's so easy to pump breastmilk right into the cup for her to sip while I feed her.As for them leaking, I have never had a problem with that - bottles or sippy cups. Avent does say that if it's tops are over-tightened they will leak, especially with the bottles. Also, the leak-proof spout should be replaced every 3 months and taken apart and cleaned after every use. If you put that little silicone ring on backwards, or stretch the center hole too much i'm sure it would leak.I think Avent has created an extremely useful feeding system that's also easy to use. I love the way every part interchanges. I can't wait to try the new Avent Sport cups!I'm giving it 4 stars because I believe they are too expensive...especially replacement parts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Durable, but they leak!","review":"My son used Avent bottles and we were very happy with them so I bought the sippy cups! Expensive but I thought they would be worth the money because I loved the bottles so much. Okay I finally figured out how to cause the leak from not happening out the sides, by not putting it on to tight. But, if my son tips the cup over it leaks. Yes I do have the insert in correctly. I ended up tossing them in the garbage! There goes $20.00 out the window! I don't to be constantly wiping up the mess.

I recommend using another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"We hate these cups!","review":"These cups are AWFUL! Black \\"stuff\\" (I'm assuming mold) accumulated in the drink spout and I could not get it out. We only had 2 and they both went in the trash.

When my daughter held the handle the cup spun since the handle's aren't permanently attached. Also, after washing I didn't realize that between the two layers of plastic there was water, so when I got it out a week or so later there was mold in there. And, to top if off the 2 plastic pieces are almost impossible to get off! I guess I will keep trying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much trouble!!","review":"I bought these cups because I was having trouble getting my child to take any of the other cups. He actually started taking these cups really well so I loaded up on them. OH WHAT A MISTAKE!! I now have $20.00 worth of cups (which is only 4 cups) that are ruining my diaper bags. I have to unload the diaper bag all the time and clean the sticky juice off of everything. They leak everywhere!! I know people say its error on my part, but it shouldnt be this hard to put a sippy cup together!! I also agree on the fact that the inside ring gets soooo nasty. I find stuff caught in it all the time!! It scares me that I might have given my child that cup with the ring like that. Also my child is almost a year and has 8 teeth and when he has actually bitten holes in the spout.

Water/juice gets trapped in the rubber thingy...that is also part of why it leaks. I too wrote to the company about my bottles leaking and they said it was user error. I'm putting them on too tight.

They seem to leak no matter how tight you screw on the top and also through the spout. The spout also stained after one use with dinner. The shape seemed easy to hold when I bought them, but I learned they are somewhat hard to clean, especially the several small parts in the valve. These cups also molded after every use, which really upset me. I contacted the Avent company about these problems and found their customer service to be extremely unhelpful and unwilling to offer a refund or exchange.

This movie is a true wake-up call for everyone. When I first read the title, I thought that it was probably another one of those \\" high school kid \\" movies about gangs, etc.. and I wasn't planning on watching it; however,I did watch it with my daughter.

I was at once reminded of klezmer, of Stephane Grappelli & Django Reinhardt, of Italian film scores, of Eastern European contemporary chamber music...and yet this music is totally individual: mysterious and playful, charming and engrossing.I recommend it to anyone who wants a totally accessible musical adventure---even with that vocal during the final moments which, had it gone on any longer, would have spoiled my good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best new contemporary jazz records in recent memory","review":"\\"Memory is an Elephant\\" is filled with challenging compostions, haunting melodies and virtuoso playing.

At the end of the movie not a whole lot has changed and the script ends where it should have been about 2/3 of the way through the film.If you are in to indie flicks that pull this type of half hearted attempt at a plot all the time by all means check it out for AAA acting but I can't give these kinds of scripts a free pass especially when it could have been a really memorable flick.Bottom line:acting greatstory solid and interestingscript is a suck with slow development and very little in the way of climaxpretty piss poor ending"},{"rating":"2","title":"Story Undermines Great Performances","review":"See \\"Half Nelson\\" for the terrific acting on display. Ryan Gosling is superb as the inspirational inner city middle school history teaches fighting personal demons, not the least crack addiction. Shareeka Epps gives one of the two outstanding juvenile performances (Abigail Breslin in \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is the other) to be seen on the large screen in 2006. I don't know Epps' personal backstory but you believe that at her tender age she has attempted to navigate the pitfalls of growing up on the mean streets. My problem with \\"Half Nelson\\" is that I didn't find a sufficient explanation for Gosling's extracurricular behaviour other than as a plot convenience. Why is this man with so much going for him taking crack? The film doesn't offer to me a satisfactory explanation.

When he starts with the \\"holla back\\" and such to his young charges, it's galling. This main character seeks the lowest (un)common denominator and wallows in it. Surely, it will appeal to all those types who revel in uninformed fantasies of \\"conquering\\" inner-city demons and performing some misguided sense of social charity.

It is such a train-wreck that you can hardly believe that all these reviewers loved this one. I am sick of movies about people near my age trying to figure out what their life means, or why they are here on earth. The main character is someone who has accepted the responsibility of teaching inner-city youths. That's good, but he fails to meet his responsibility to teach these students. He is too absorbed in his own concerns to provide these students with the instruction they deserve. At one point, he claims that his problems stem from the state of the world, so George w. is too blame for his problems to some extent, but mostly its just his own inability to deal with life. So, if you can't handle self-absorbed liberals failing to meet uphold their responsibilities don't get this one.

Every pass I throw gets intercepted, and every rushing play becomes a loss. This game is a reason to get anger management classes! I have never played a more frustrating game in my life.

Fast paced and huge hits just the way I like it. There are some improvements here since 20-02: the addition of create-a-player, updated rosters, and little things like the ability to turn on auto-icon passing (instead of having to hold down an extra button). This is a must have on any console. Grab a few friends and you're in for a guaranteed good time! If you missed 20-02 definitely pick this up. If you did get 20-02 pick this up as well you'll find the things that were lacking in 20-02 were done right in 20-03. I have had the most fun playing Blitz 20-03 than any other game. Way to go Midway!"},{"rating":"2","title":"blitz 20-03","review":"This game is great. The players in the game are 3-D, and features are easily seen! The hard hits, trick plays, and icon passing make it great! The all-new create-a-player option is awesome. You can put in name, number, character (there are some non-human custom characters), height, weight, equipment, and attributes. On offense, it is pretty good. The plays are usually 20-25 yard plays. But players fumble way too much and the interceptions come across way too often. But defense is the ultimate arcade part. Bonecrushing tackles, late hits, and QB sacks are easy to get. It never bores me. The videos are great. It is a great game when you want to have multiple friends over. BUY THIS GAME!!! Even people who dislike football should like this game!! However, my create-a-player file corrupted, and it did NOT have anything to do with the memory card. But everything else saves just great."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, BUT CAN BE A LITTLE BETTER","review":"I BOUGHT THIS GAME IN LIKE 2001, AND IT IS REALLY HARD TO BEAT THE COMPUTER IN EVEN WEHN IT IS SET TO EASY AND REGULAR EXIBITION.

HOWEVER, the storyline wasn't to my liking.Be forewarned, \\"Boynton Beach Club\\" isn't geared for anyone under the age of 50 years old!

I suggest if you are really interested in learning theory to read more in depth on the theorists he covers in the book. This is a wonderful book for anyone who has children, works with children, or anyone interested in psychology.

The mature Morse pitted against a gorgeous girl \\"on the game\\" who is half his age? We have lots of sidelines (all of which fit nicely with the plot) like the political correctness of university fundraising, a teenage hoodlum in love, drug dealing, a terminal illness, spousal abuse, and the Ashmolean in danger of being burglarized! This one is sexy and cool, expertly delivered. And no one can express disillusionment (and touch our hearts) like the forthright Sergeant Lewis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This Immediately!","review":"Tveitt will soon become a phenomenon like Gorecki. But his music is better. Unique. Conservative and radical. Highly sophisticated and naively primitive. I was bowled over by Tveitt's orchestrations, and the depth of his simplicity.The Suite #2 is the best, an absolute must for lovers of the rough outdoors. Tveitt's depiction of a waterfall in one number must be heard to be believed. The performance and sonics are superb. At Naxos prices--this is a free diamond.Do not hesitate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great but uneven","review":"This is an excellent collection of Elis' music.

The fire and emotion, the intimacy, the great brazilian vowel sounds. Sometimes you get all of this in the same sentence. There are a couple of slow parts, like the medley towards the end, that I just skip over. The rest is great. Also try Elis and Tom and Acquarela do Brazil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compilation CD of a wide period of Elis Regina's Recordings","review":"This a compilation and I am not a fan of collections which distorts the real meaning of the originals.

Sarah Brightman I can't wait til' the new cd is here!!! Please NO more show tunes! UNLESS THEY ARE NEW RECORDINGS!!!! THANKS, KEEP IT UP,SARAH!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster","review":"I am a fan of Sarah Brightman, but feel this CD does little to showcase her awesome voice and there is no particularly noteworthy track on it. I thought it strange that this CD was marked down within days of its debut at my local store. Could it be that the mediocrity of the production was so readily apparent? All that aside, who's brilliant scheme was it to produce an Arab-influenced CD at a time when American aversion to things Arab is probably more prevelent than it's ever been since 9/11?"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I have tried to like this CD since i am a great fan of Sarah Brightman . It is just disappointing . The songs are very forgettable for the most part and the \\"whisper\\" singing makes very little use of Sarah's incredible vocal talent and range ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harem","review":"As I listened to the title track I started to feel that I had wasted my money, by the time track 2 came along I was sure this CD was garbage that only the dogs in the neighborhood would appreciate. Anyone who buys this CD trying to get a taste of the middle east will be dissapointed. Attempts by Ms. Brightman to give songs that have nothing middle eastern about them a middle eastern flavor have resulted in failure. I laughed when I read some of the reviews where customers found Harem (the title track)to be beautiful. Actually the original song (Ms. Brightman so cleverly destroyed) is called \\"Song of the Sea\\" and is sung by Dulce Pontes on her CD \\"Lagrimas\\". The version sung by Ms. Pontes is so hauntingly beautiful it ended up on a Richard Gere movie called Primal Fear. Ms. Brightman should stick to what she knows and should stop trying to be so darn ordinary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I am a huge Sarah Brightman fan. I love all her previous work, but not this one.First, the mastering is done just like any modern pop album - dynamic overcompressed. That means everything sounds equally loud. There are no quiet or loud passages. Everything is constantly loud, which makes this album unpleasent to listen to.Second, most of the music contains monotone pop/techno rythms, which probably makes this album very suitable for MTV. But not for my taste.If you like modern pop music, you might like this album. But be warned that it is very different from her earlier brilliant work."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor - losing her focus","review":"This is very poor indeed, especially if you see her singing any of it.

Overall, however,I have the impression that everyone involved is just going through the motions. There were no songs or moments that gave me the urge to hear them for a second time. I have a lot of CDs I want to play repeatedly. This production is not one of them.

Sarah Brightman's forte is an \\"easy listening\\" bridge between opera and pop and she should have continued in that genre. Instead, Harem is a miscellaneous hodge-podge of styles with a strange dance club beats. Brightman's vocals are a waifish, high pitched warble that neglects to demostrate her vocal agility. I anticipated her CD for months just to cast it neglected onto the top shelf of my closet. If you're looking for a Sarah Brightman CD, buy anything but this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Her worst CD","review":"First of all, I'm a huge Sarah Brightman fan.

Yeah, that's Jeopardy. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah is a top performer, but...","review":"Sarah Brightman has developed her talent for singing in a grand way. Her video performance is equally great.She will never probably have any idea how many nights she has sung me to sleep ;).I look for a performance and a live concert to come near me soon.I would like to see her, however, embrace the more artistic and less of the skimpy clothing side.There is a delicate line between flash, art, and trash, and some footage and photos of her cross the line with me.Nude and semi-nude do not mix with song and expression. Sorry, dear, my beloved Sarah, but I am only in this for your singing talent, not to be made to long for your bod in my arms.Keep it cleaner. Skimpy or revealing clothing, photos, and videos does not enhance your talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diversity is best","review":"I rushed out to buy this CD since it was a long three years of no new sounds from Sarah.At first, I didn't like about 4 of the songs because I was expecting a follow thru of sounds, similar to those of Eden and LaLuna. After I realized this was going to be more like FLY, I had a different perspective. I love this CD. My all time favorite Sarha CD is FLY. This CD is blend of Eden and Fly, with a middle eastern flair. I look forward to the concert tour, and I hope it's not another three years before another CD comes out. Sarah or Frank: if you are reading this, how about some more Blues/Jazz like Gloomy Sunday?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Brightman, Her best CD.","review":"Sarah is just the best, she can hit any note and her individuality shines on this CD.

Amazing! A master piece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I wish I had my money back on this one, and I'm a fan. I expect to hear that voice lift me, and sadly on this CD it did not.

The Middle Eastern theme is masterfully developed throughout, and even Mr. Armstrong's What a Wonderful World, envisions the beauty of the east and the world in total. Sarah's beautiful clear voice permeates all songs especially It's a Beautiful Day and Arabian Nights....and the inclusion of Ofra Haza, Nigel Kennedy, and Kadim Al Sahir add cultural authenticity and beauty. The blend of dance/pop/ballad beats makes the CD upbeat and happy and varied. The many orchestras and choirs take this CD from just a pop CD to way beyond that,and I am looking forward to the Harem concert, as it should be an unbelievable experience in audio and visual delight. I recommend this CD to music lovers everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminiscent of Dive and Fly","review":"Sarah has taken a step back in making a cd that is reminiscent of Dive and Fly. Mostly in English and mostly with the distinctive rock disco beat that made her famous in the early London days. Its also a soft and sensual collection of her wonderful voice. I especially enjoy her experimentation with voice-over, exotic music sounds and different themes blending into a single melody. Its a break from Sarah's beautiful Italian music, although thats my personal favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms Brightman should be ashamed!!","review":"Being a Sarah Brightman fan of the highest magnitude, I was thoroughly disgusted with the girl for allowing herself to put out such a dismal, low quality and frightful CD as \\"Harem.\\" I'm afraid that I will have to [throw it away] and take the loss...Ms Brightman has either lost her voice[], is lazy []or has let her ego get the best of her.I implore you....DO NOT WASTE YOUR FUNDS OR TIME ON THIS ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Stand The Test of Time","review":"I originally wrote a 5-star review extolling this Cd's virtues, but since then (only 3 months ago) I just realized I have not listened to it again...There's nothing I really need to hear on Harem, nothing here holds up like her previous work...If you must spend $14.00 right now, buy Eden if you don't have it.. if you already do, pay a bill or go out and get a nice seafood dinner"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does she makes original songs sometimes?","review":"Just to help you.. From the album Eden, the song with the same name is from Hooverphonic, a great band you should listen. And if it wasn't enough, the song Beautiful on Harem is from a another band: Mandalay . Don't tell me she's making music, it's so easy to make covers like she do. And the worst thing is to sell is new album with others stuff. A Great Musical MAchine..Sounds like S**T..Best regards,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Middle Eastern CD - No emotion at all.","review":"This is by far Sarah Brightman's worse CD to date. I have listned to it 6 times and each time the songs get worse. I trully believe Sarah choose the wrong songwriters and maybe she should use a different producer besides her boyfriend. Gone are the lush Enigma like productions from Eden or the New Age/Classical beats from La Luna, instead we are treated to over a dozen songs of Middle easter influenced garbage.And I only see 2 of these songs translating well live. And whats with her recent covers? Louis Armstrong, Celine Dion, and Dido. I dont recommend this CD to anyone, none these songs will get played on the radio. Classics and Eden are million times better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sarah Brightman yet!!!","review":"A turnabout of her previous releases, this album is tremendously invigorating with an intense soulfulness. With it's middle eastern rhythms and affecting melodies, it is sure to please and endure.

A must have for any Sarah Brightman fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah does it again!","review":"\\"Harem\\" is a great album. Perhaps a little 'different' than what one would expect in a Sarah Brightman album, but none-the-less, it is a masterpiece. It's hard to sit still while listening to some of the songs in the album, as your legs want to get up and dance.By the way, be sure to get the album that includes the Harem DVD. It shows how the album was put together, and the places they went to record it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best","review":"I agree with \\"music fan\\" about this CD. Eden is a good album, and she's a good artist. But either this album was poorly produced or something, because this does not show her best. I wouldn't classify this as world music at all, because the instruments aren't used and it's more classical pop; if that's a genre. It seemed rambly to me with many of the songs sounding similar and lacking originality. I love her, she's unique in her genre. But she really shines as a classicist, with Classics, her work by Andrew Lloyd Webber (who she married) and operatic albums. This is what she's best at, so her collaborations on Eden and La Luna, which are classical in nature but still allowed her to branch out musically, turned out good. I have a lot of her albums, but I wouldn't buy this one. It's more something to listen to once. A few of the songs are good, the album isn't terrible, but it's not very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"One of the best Albums of Sarah Brightman, I love this CD in particular, has a lot of combination of rythms and styles, after this CD I love the music of the middle east, this CD is a magical fantasy, I was in a Harem Concert a days ago and I love more and more and more this CD!!! Sarah you are the Best.Alex Garnica."},{"rating":"2","title":"This woman is awsome!!!","review":"It's so clear now that Sarah Brightman has officially put her mark on the pop music world with all these albums. I am fascinated by her story. A no-name opera singing ballet dancer gets a small part in the original company of CATS, marries the composer who gives her a lead in his next hit, and after a few West End and Broadway appearances, launches this huge solo career in a conteporary pop style. How many British singers can sell a concert in these big US arenas in St. Louis, MO, for example!!! \\"Dive\\" and \\"Fly\\" are two great underrated albums. I really hope she becomes even more popular. I'm listening to \\"Dive\\" as I type this. \\"Harem\\" will be a very poular album I thing and the tour will help sell it of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"No voice like hers in the world","review":"I own this cd. I saw her in person at the \\"Harem\\" concert. Never had I heard or seen any voice like this. What a performer, best concert I'd ever seen.

Thank you Sarah Brightman for giving us your beautiful gift of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"This is my first Sarah Brightman CD.

I like her a lot, but I don't like when she sings pop songs. She doesn't have the voice for it. Too airy, too soft. This is an album of pop songs. Not good.I like pop music. I like Sarah. But I don't like the two together. It's not that I feel Sarah should only stick to the music she usually sings, that classical/opera type music. But I do think she should stick to music she can actually sing. She's just not a pop singer. It's like Britney Spears, it's not her songs that are bad, it's her voice. Same thing applies to this album, it's not Sarah's songs, it's her voice. Doesn't fit. I will say, however, that her re-make of \\"What a Wonderful World\\" was a bit out of place. That was a bad song and a bad voice.If you're thinking about buying this cd, don't. You'll be mad if you do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Attempt at Fusion and Singing","review":"About Eastern/Arabic Music Fusion: Not very well done at all. Entry level stuff. One song is a copy of an Indian movie song from the movie \\"Taal\\".Regarding Singing: Ms. Brigthman is just an average singer who sings in a muted voice which is covered up in the synthesized sounding music.Wasted $14 on this CD. Try Peter Gabriel - Last Temptation of Christ, if you want to hear world class fusion"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, its bad....","review":"Let me preface this by saying that I am a female vocalist affecionado and that Sarah is right there at the top of the list of female vocalists I rush to get new work from when if comes out. This one was bad...I agree with some of the other reviewers who indicate that this CD is all over the place. It lacks vision, coherence, and by trying to be multi-ethnic Sarah falls on her face. I know many think she is a phenom (and in many ways she is), but a middle east tonality she DOES NOT have. I one really wants to get into a frsh blend of Middle Eastern music and pop, just listen to someone like Ofra Haza or something, not Sarah...A good attempt however, but will appreciated by those who do not really want to delve into the voices of real Middle East...A C for effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR, MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!","review":"Sarah Brightman is a phenomenal vocalist who's career I have followed since the beginning. This release is a scrambled-up, unfocused, peculiar effort. Her magnificent voice is definitely NOT suited to the material chosen. I think she may have gone off of the ethereal cliff with this CD. I will always love Sarah Brightman and appreciate her true talent but this HAREM release is shockingly poor for someone of her caliber. PLEASE, SARAH! Take a poll of your fans and I'll bet WE can suggest some incredible songs to which you would do justice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money.","review":"This album is ridiculous, the singer is terrible, and whoever really buys into this lady's interpretations know little about music.

I think this CD has some of the best Music I have herd, however Sarah brightmans voice is very weak and just sounds like she is not interested in the songs.

This could of been really great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haren-Not the Typical Sarah Brightman","review":"If you enjoy Sarah's other albums, this is a major departure. And it may be a disappointment to you. I found the orchestration overbearing and heavy handed in comparison with most of her works.

I own all of her albums and this one is, in my opinion, not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH NO!","review":"Tisk Tisk Tisk.What happened? Sarah Brightman was one of two current english speaking artists that I would listen to. I stopped listening to Americam / English music because it all sounds the same and I'm not interested. I always looked forward to her new music even going so far as to order it from overseas. With this cd all I hear is really bad gay disco, none of the otherworldly sounds of her previous none ALW work. Eden, La Luna, Dive and Time to Say Goodbye can transport you to a place where all is peaceful and calm.This cd will be put away and most likely won't see the light of day again. I will still be a big fan; I know in some careers the will be a dud and to me this is hers. I do hope with the next one she returns to the sound of her previous none ALW work."},{"rating":"1","title":"?????","review":"like saugages, brightman keeps churning out \\"stuff\\" from her factory. none of my business except my local [stores] keeps playing this cd while i drink coffee and read the newspapers. the noise gets in the way of my daily routine, and gets me out of the place sooner than usual. it'll end one of these days, right?0 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"I really have enjoyed listening to her past CD's. La Luna and Eden are incredible! In both, you get a taste of adult conetmporary, new age (think Enya) and her opera sound. I even enjoy Dive but to a lesser degree -- too much banal pop but over all not bad. But Harem? Very bad. All very weak pop songs with poor melodies drowned out by an orchestra of background musicians and instruments. These poor pop tunes do not warrant such big productions. Really now! But the CD cover of Sarah is fierce and she looks great, but in the end who cares if you hate the CD. But hey, Sarah's recent Luna and Eden are kick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First-Time Disappointment","review":"As an ardent Brightman fan, I never thought I'd be so critical of her, but the timing of this middle eastern themed CD suggests a political nanabooboo aimed at both the USA and the UK.Perhaps a wiser choice would have been to postpone this theme until the whole world isn't hurting so. A low rating for this CD is all I can muster because of the poor timing of the theme.I've listened to the CD twice, and theme aside, I am disappointed in the vocals and the production. Ms. Brightman's whispery voice is sometimes overwhelmed by the demanding orchestra and combos. Mr. Peterson tends to prefer heavy-handed arrangements. I best stop, lest Ms. B write a review about me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy, hyped creation","review":"Who buys this stuff? I cannot say that she has no voice, she does have a voice. I can say, however, that the overdone arrangements and the lack of character in her performance make for a silly fantasy with little to appeal to sophisticated audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like EDEN, don't visit HAREM...","review":"Sarah Brightman is my favorite vocalist without question. Her \\"One Night in Eden\\" DVD concert is her ultimate performance & best song selection she has to offer in one place.Brightman has offered many different styles of music, from Classical, Opera, New Age, and even Dance/Rock. 'Harem' doesn't fit anywhere, unfortunately.\\"Mysterious Days\\" is a fabulous song. 5-Star in my opinion. But the rest of the album is below the high standard that Brightman has previously achieved.Where are her soaring vocals? Unfortunately, Sarah has fallen in love with those 'Little Girl' style vocals on 'Harem'. I love her uptempo \\"New Age\\" & Dance/Rock songs -- the ones where her vocals soar, such as \\"Only an Ocean Away\\", \\"La Mer\\", \\"Captain Nemo\\", \\"Eden\\", \\"First of May\\", \\"In Paradisum\\", \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\", etc. Those songs really show off her voice.So, if you enjoyed EDEN, FLY, DIVE, or even LA LUNA (to a certain degree), you may be disappointed with HAREM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good sounding CD","review":"I did not know what to expect with this cd but I really like it.I like about almost all the songs.Sarah has a great Soprano voice.It is also nice that she always does not do the same kind of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah Brightman - Harem US Edition","review":"I've read many good reviews of this CD and some not so good. It's not my favorite; however, I think this is still a good buy.Those who criticize that this is not a completely classical release are really in the dark. Sarah Brightman started out as a pop singer with a British group called HOT GOSSIP. The big hit was \\"I lost my heart to a starship trooper\\".I'm actually glad to see some pop and dance music mixed in with this release.How many people have the talent to sing in so many different styles? She can easily move from a pop dance track to an aria! Each release by Sarah Brightman is a journey. Take the magic carpet ride and enjoy!The reason for not giving this release 5 stars is that the US record company decided to recycle a release on the FLY CD (not released in the USA). Other editions have a different bonus song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah Brightman's Harem CD","review":"I own most of Sarah Brightman's CDs. This one is my favorite by far. I am a fan of light and ethereal sopranos, Indian, Middle Eastern and club (dance) music. Harem has a combination of these elements. I also love the orchestrated background. This music definately brings me joy. My favorites are \\"The Journey Home\\", \\"Arabian Nights\\", \\"Mysterious Days\\", \\"You Take My Breath Away\\" and \\"Harem\\". I was very excited to hear \\"The Journey Home\\" sung by Sarah. I have heard the original Hindi version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent","review":"This is absolutely the most beautiful CDs that I have ever had the opportunity to listen to and enjoy. Sarah has a true voice of an angel. Sheer musical ecstasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harem, Sarah Brightman","review":"My wife and I are both Sarah Brightman fans and have been looking forward to her new CD with an advance order.But, the anticipation was far better then the actuality. In our opinion, Harem lacked both the orchestrations and utilization of Brightman's terrific voice of past CDs and, thusly, has our opinion putting Harem at the bottom of all her CDs that we currently have.Classics, La Luna, Best of Sarah Brightman, even Dive are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another masterpiece! Highly recommended!","review":"I loved this album right from the first listening! It literally took my breath away. Standout tracks were Harem, It's A Beautiful Day, The Journey Home and The War Is Over. I can just imagine the wonderful and fabulous remixes that will embrace the powerful songs such as Harem and It's A Beautiful Day. The only track I didn't care for was It's A Wonderful World and it was placed as track #2. If you have been a fan, Harem won't disappoint! I just wish she releases more quality studio albums like this than countless compilations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this one!","review":"I am a huge Sarah Brightman fan and back in 2003, I eagerly awaited the release of Harem. I was not disappointed. The cd is a slight departure from her last 3 cds with virtually no opera on it. So if you want Sarah Brightman opera than Time to Say goodbye, Eden, or La Luna is a better choice for you. As the title is Harem, the whole cd has a Middle Eastern sound to it and every track is fantastic. I love all the songs but here are the songs that I play the most: Free, Harem, Arabian Nights(I love the middle of it), It's a beautiful day, Beautiful, The war is over, and Mysterious Days. If you want to buy Harem, I suggest you get the version with the DVD in it. The DVD has a little inside look on the making of the Harem album and it also has the Harem video, although that is also on the Harem: A Desert Fantasy DVD. But if you like Sarah Brightman, you should buy this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a new Sarah Brightman fan","review":"Sarah Brightman's Harem CD was a gift I recently received and I was told that it contained jazz. Much to my surprise, I listened to a fusion of pop and mideastern music. I absolutely love this CD! Sarah Brightman has explored this genre with courage, given the times we've been living in. I was especially happy to hear Kazim el-Saher's guest performance in \\"The War Is Over Now\\"-I'm a fan of his. He has such a rich, strong voice. Plus I can't stop myself from bellydancing in some of the other songs, like Harem, A Beautiful Day and Mysterious Days. I recommend this CD to anyone who likes to explore new and exotic frontiers, for those of you who are curious about eastern music. Harem is a good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Fay Sweet","review":"Fay Sweet has authored a lot of remarkable modern design books. More Space is no exception. She has found, and photographed, some of the most interesting home additions I've seen to date - all of them unique. I especially enjoyed the basement and attic additions/expansions. This is not a practical how-to guide, it's a book about what's new and innovative in home additions."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Drama","review":"I expected this video to go into the lives and games of the greatest womens players of all time, but it didn't. This video was more of an instruction video using these women to demonstrate how things should be done. It also dissected their best shot. There were very few highlights and no drama all in all a big dissapointment. The best part of the video was at the end when they showed little 9 or 10 year old Venus and explained that she could one day be a great player. It was funny because this is an old video, but this segment lasted maybe only 30 seconds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing and Extra Songs","review":"I own Gran Turismo 2 for the Sony PLaystation, and its an awesome game with a great soundtrack. As I was reading through the description of this title, I noticed there are a few missing songs, like Sex Type Thing by Stone Temple Pilots(the best song in the game, mind you), and a few songs added, like Hey Man, Nice Shot by Filter and Cars by Fear Factory and Gary Numan. Other than the missing songs, this is a great album that I plan to buy. If you get this, get the game too. Its great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book.","review":"If you like WWII thrillers with the good guys struggling to overcome long odds to defeat evil personified in the Third Reich, this is the book for you. I do agree with some earlier reviewers that the book takes a while to build up steam, but then it holds your interest, non-stop.The endearing character of Mouse goes through a change of heart because of the responsibilies thrust upon him and the love that he finds along the way.There's lots of action and suspense. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evocative WW2 Tale","review":"Gregg Keizer's first novel takes us back to the territory that Ken Follett, Greg Iles, and Jack Higgins used to explore so well in their earlier novels: Nazi-infested Europe. The Longest Night has no spies, just a guy nmaed Mouse, who is a Meyer Lansky employed hit man from Brooklyn, and who just happens to be Jewish. We follow Mouse on a mission to Europe in which he is charged with helping to liberate a train-load of Dutch Jews who are headed for concentration camps.The writing is very good,especially the description of war-time Europe, and the story is well-told. The only thing holding me back from giving this 5 stars is that the pacing is slow to build up momentum, and this kind of book should be more tense.I will read Keizer's next book, and hope he delivers on the promise shown here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meyer Lansky sends his regards","review":"A first time author with an original premise. Mouse is a charactor who impresses. The author has a flair for the dialect of the different peosonalities involved. This is a must read that doesn't let the reader catch his breath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"The hero of this story Mouse Weiss,a hit man for legendarymafia leader Meyer Lansky,messes up a hit on a rival of Lansky's.Lansky has to get him out of town so he cannot be identified.Lansky is approached by a group of Dutch Jews to help them rescue Jews being shipped to concentration camps and their deaths.They want Lansky to provide muscle and cash to rescue atrain of Jews and call attention to their plight.Lansky volunteerthe services of Mouse Weiss and puts up $100,000 to finacne theirmission.Weiss joins forces with some incredible characters tosteal this train.One of the main characters that he meets is Rekawhom he falls for.Mouse originally intended to steal the $100,000and flee.His plan is thwarted and he has to carry out his mission.He ends up showing character and bravery.This is a very good book that you will enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fix for one problem","review":"We are big Maisy fans around our house. But I wish I had listened to the reviewer who said that the tabs and flaps are cumbersome on this book (and we've got dozens with which to compare it). Also, the story line just doesn't work. She's in winter clothes and takes them off to go swimming. I guess if she's going to an indoor Y... Here's a solution for the obvious problem though. So you don't have to go back through the book yourself to put the clothes back on Maisy before your child reads it again, just read the book back to front with your child and put her clothes back on. That actually makes the experience a little more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maisy the Swimmer is Great","review":"Maisy captures a child's attention. Maisy is going swimming. Most preschool children love to play in water. This book teaches children their colors and the names of articles of clothes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unhappy!","review":"The book I ordered was rated in good condition...this book was not in good condition.The flaps were missing or taped, the book was torn and in VERY poor condition. I bought this book to use in a center at school. I wasted my money.Maisy I will have to order another book, it is not in any condition to use in my classroom. I will never order a used book again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck! Did 'Undies' Have To Be Included?","review":"Lucy Cousins has a great idea with \\"Maisy Goes Swimming\\" but did 'undies' have to be included? But as gross as the book was, the illusrations were quite good, so I gave it another star. Let's just hope that the subject of undergarments are not mentioned in future books. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Guitar Album with Excellent Compositions","review":"I came upon this album almost randomly on the Rhapsody service because I was looking for records with Frank Gambale. I'm very glad I did! I believe most rock or fusion guitarists would find this album worth checking out. The tunes \\"Marbles\\" (Gambale), \\"Train to Willoughby\\" (Steve Stevens), \\"Noah's Ark\\" (Steve Vai), and \\"Sasquatch\\" (Michael Landau - check out his Hendrix sound) are all great compositions and make this album very worth the price. But make no mistake, there's not a weak tune on this album. There are also a couple pop tunes any Beatles lover would appreciate. Gregg Bissonette is a very crisp drummer - listen closely to \\"Marbles\\" for evidence. And his brother Matt on bass is also first-rate. I almost gave this album 5 stars, but I reserve that rating for the rarest of albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"This toy sucks","review":"I got this toy for Christmas, and I hoped that it would really suck up all my brother's junk on the floor! But I was really disappointed when it didn't work. SO I got Mommy and Daddy's vacuum while they were out and my brother was outside doing homework, and sucked all of his things off the floor. Boy, did my bum roast when he came inside!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed!","review":"My 4 year old daughter had her heart set on a vacuum cleaner for her birthday. She had picked out the red Hoover vacuum which really works and picks up small trash off of the floor but is a Barbie freak so instead of buying the Hoover, we purchased the Barbie one thinking that it would be perfect for her. Much to our surprise, it only makes real vacuum noises. It does not really clean. We returned the Barbie vacuum and purchased the Hoover for several dollars less."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a keeper!","review":"This is yet another one of the books that was required for my Arts & Humanities class \\"The Horror Story\\"...I must say that I'm quite glad that I was introduced to this novel.This book houses some of the greatest horror stories since the genre came into existence. I have a new appreciation for Edgar Allen Poe. Algernon Blackwood is an AMAZING writer, quite possibly my new favorite. There is even a story written by O. Henry!This book could easily be considered a bible among those who are horror-genre fans. I can't say much else about this book other than IN MY OPINION it is worth the money you will spend on it and the time you will spend reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book!","review":"This book was in great condition and more than i had expected. We bought it for our daughter to read to our first grandchild! Many great memories to be made!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a follow-on from the Sawtooth","review":"A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain. The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank, and the Tigertooth does not. I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe.By the way, I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia. The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake. The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking. I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upper holds up well but the sole wears unevenly and way too quick","review":"I purchased these 3 years back but rarely wore them. Recently I figured out why I didn't, the sole wears unevenly toward the back first and while the tops looks near new the bottom looks well used like a regularly worn everyday shoe. I've worn another pair of shoes purchased at the same time nearly every day the last 3 years. While the top is worn pretty good the bottom is still in better shape than these trail shoes. I know these replaced another model but it sounds like every one wants the old model back because they were much better than this \\"new version\\". I'm guessing this is why no one sells them on amazon anymore but they are available if you want to try your luck. Personally I can't recommend buying these unless you like to throw your money at something you can wear short term at best unless you only use them on grass..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid practical advice","review":"This book has great advice for new managers that can also be used by anyone working in an organization. Experienced managers will want to have it on their desks (as I do) to remind them of why it's important to start meetings on time, how to deal with office politics, putting people first--all 25 are gems. It also would have been great when I was starting out to help me recognize why some managers were so great to work for. A great gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD in Perfect Condition","review":"I was happy with how quickly I received my order. The DVD case was wrapped in plastic, but it seemed like the cover was a printout that was glued onto the case. There was no booklet inside, and I have to assume it was not the original case for the movie. The DVD itself however was in excellent condition. There were no scratches and it looked like a DVD you would buy in a store. The movie played perfectly. Since I really only care about the movie and not the case, I was happy. I know some people would like the original case, so I gave it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sleeper Hit!!","review":"Here we have Harrison Ford, as the typical executive on the rise who suddenly walks into a convenience store to get some cigarettes and \\"behold,\\" a robbery takes place, and he is injured to the point where he has amnesia and doesn't remember who he is or what he did in life. From here the movie really takes on a character of its own, and Ford is totally believable as Henry, and Annette Bening is also marvelous as his wife, who has deal with much of his history prior to the tragedy, because Henry was unfaithful to her before, and he was engaged in dirty corporate tricks.To watch the transformation of Henry as he begins to \\"find himself\\" is a very revealing one, and in particular how he handles the pain of not only his own loss, but the losses of those around him, and we see a gentler, kinder Henry appear before our very eyes. Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't watch it!!","review":"I received this very quickly, but I am unable to watch it on a DVD player made in the US. It appears this was made overseas and is not set to up play on equipment made in US. This DVD is no good to me and I am trying to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regarding Henry","review":"The movie was formatted to play on DVD players manufactured in Europe and not in the USA, therefore I could not view the movie.

I am very very disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was really good, people!","review":"Regarding Henry is about a man who does not suffer either a stroke or loss of memory from a head wound. His loss of memory is from the lack of oxygen to the brain caused by loss of blood from the chest wound. (Check out that scene more carefully and you'll see)It's a really good movie. Please see this movie. I only had time to see it once while it was out from the library, but I would have seen it more if I could have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiradora!!!!!!!!","review":"Una de las mejores peliculas de drama de Harrison Ford, una pelicula que nos dice que podemos cambiar lo que no queremos en nuestra vida!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what do I want in life?","review":"Do I want money, power, sex, what? What's going to make me happy? There are many movies on this theme, this is a good one. Harrison Ford is a high powered, successful lawyer, who's life takes a sudden turn, and he doesn't remember (think \\"Samantha Who?\\") A very different role for Harrison; I think he played it well."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Adversity Becomes Grace","review":"Big fan of Harrison Ford. This is a story of Henry Turner and his family overcoming a debilitating handicap caused by a traumatic injury during a robbery.The irony in Henry's transformation is a lesson for all of us... Forced to start over or (reboot) so to speak he rediscovers the simple pleasures that really matter.. Made me laugh, cry and feel outraged. Love the tender side of Harrison ford in this. Bought the DVD for my collection of personal favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT LITTLE KNOWN FILM ONE OF FORDS BEST!","review":"This a really good film that has not received it's due. Ford plays a very successful work-aholic lawyer that gets dealt a pretty bad hand.....at least so it would seem at first.

Coming out knowing the true value of love and life as it should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm...WHAT?!","review":"Two stars only because the first 15 minutes or so is pure Harrison Ford brilliance. The rest of the film left me scratching my head. What is the message here? Insensitive workaholic-types are capable of an emotional transformation only if they're lobotomized? I imagine the original pitch went something like, \\"Harrison Ford as ruthless lawyer gets brain injury and has to start his life over; the rest will write itself!\\" Well, it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was extremely disappointed when I starting watching this movie. Nowhere on the movie description did it mentioned that the closed captioning WOULD NOT go away. There was absolutely no means of getting rid of the closed captioning!!!!!! I refused to watch a movie with words on the screen the whole time. I am sending the movie back to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Regarding Henry","review":"Hans Solo and Indiana Jones aside......This is my favorite Harrison Ford movie ever. He should have received an Oscar for his portrayal of Henry. The other actors are also fantastic. And Mike Nichols direction is stellar. There are lessons to be learned here about what really matters in life. And Henry learns them. His daughter turns out to be his best teacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost In The Mail","review":"Saddly we never received this movie in the mail. We tried to find out where the break occurred, but could not. Will probably order in the future.

However, when finally we sat down to watch the DVD...SURPRISE, it will not play in any of the DVD players in the house, each time we received an error message that the disk wasn't authorized for play. Upon further investigation the DVD was intended for release in the UK, not USA and will not work here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harrison Ford's worst film -- until \\"Random Hearts\\"","review":"I'm sorry to be the contrarian, but really, was there any scene or role in this film that wasn't totally predictable? The unhappy high-powered New York lawyer and his equally unhappy wife; the African-American physical therepist; the high-powered mistriss; the unhappy-at-the-boarding-school daughter; the poor plaintiffs in a civil case who get the shaft from the high-powered, unhappy New lawyers? The characters are recycled from other characters in the same film, for cryin' out loud. Show some originality. The only thing that makes this film at all palatable is the premise that if you shoot a lawyer in the head, it might make him a better person. But wouldn't you agree that the film is too long just for one lawyer joke?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hazardous!!!!","review":"I bought this bike for my 6 year old daughter and she loved it.

I tried switching the positions of the sticks, placing only one stick, and using one of the new sticks with the old sticks...same results. I had a local tech come by to give me his opinion. He believes that either they're defective or noncompatible and should be returned. He also said that I should probably go with a more trusted memory maker like Crucial or PNY.

Though many fans will always be searching for the next \\"Porcelain\\", this effort is not quite equal to that one. But the soulful, funky feeling established on \\"Concrete Love\\" dominates, making tunes such as \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" and \\"That's Life\\" winners. \\"Downhill Sunday\\" is classic Julia, with great lyric twists and irony. The band on this is again fantastic - how could you go wrong with these session (and live) pros? I continue to wish Julia would be more well known to a broader audience, but take pleasure in the fact that I've loved her stuff for years (thanks Eileen!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing album","review":"Amazing. They have truly outdone themselves. The Main Event was an excellent album (though a shame it didn't include the track Drunken Master, which is superb track to truly show off sneaky's bass plucking skills), but this surpasses the first by far. If you haven't heard any of fingathing, here's the deal: Two people. One on turntables, and one on the standing bass. You might call this instrumental hiphop, but it would not do the cd justice.

Most of the tracks appear in alternate versions, it doesn't matter really, just adds to the mood. The mood on this record is so dense you can almost cut through it. Miles plays with such conviction, as if he has finally found his own suberb sound. Its spare and stark yet in a very sophisticated way.The teaming with with Kenny Clarke and the 3 french musicians is great, Barry Wilen the saxophonist makes the best of the opportunity, dancing along with Miles, making this essential listening. Tracks like \\"Chez Le Photographe Du Motel\\" and \\"Au Bar Du Petit Bac\\", will forever leave memories in my mind of quiet sunny days just pondering on the subtlety of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Buy It!","review":"This is a great cd, one that you will not forget. The music is melodic and pensive and you can not help but be taken by it. I am not a huge jazz fan, but after one listen, I knew that this cd was one that would be a favorite in my collection for many, many years. If you have the opportunity to see the film, it is even more fun. But don't wait to see the film first- buy this cd. You will not be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heard but not seen?","review":"I have not heard the Louis Malle film which this soundtrack is based on--nor do I have any desire to, but like the soundtrack for Angel Heart, this is an atmospheric masterpiece that grows on you after repeated listens.I'm no expert on Miles Davis' considerable talents, much less his extensive catalogue, which I couldn't afford if I wanted to. But this is the type of LP that screams Europe from afar, and while some of the 'takes' may get repetitive after a while, the whole album actually gels together quite nicely.Not a classic Miles Davis LP by any stretch of the imagination, but well worth the investment for it's understated beauty and serenity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This CD is essentially one or two tracks with variations and alternate takes, for 75 minutes or so. And Miles' playing is rather uninspired, relying on hackney little blues phrases over and over on just about on every track. The only thing that stands out is the bleak vibe and the spontaneity of the session. If that means anything to the reader. But not an essential Miles purchase. Much of the music is available on a budget Polygram CD called COMPACT JAZZ, which contains other sessions with Charlie Parker and some others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of this one","review":"I love Miles too, but this CD is mostly just sounds for the film plus a couple songs. You will hear a drumbeat and that's all for long stretches. In fact the excellent reviews for this CD are an ugly reminder of what wacky people walk among us. The song Generique, one of Miles' best ever, is here, but is best purchased in another collection. It's on The Essential Miles Davis, for example."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great soundtrack!","review":"My son watched this movie a few times. After about the fourth time he said to me, you know why I watch this movie, it's because of the music. It's so incredible that I can't get enough of it. So I purchased the soundtrack for a Christmas present and I have to say it's one of the best CD's I have ever heard. I had no idea who was on this CD because I never watched the movie. When it arrived and I saw it was Miles Davis I said well that's why it's so great. We suggest to whomever is a fan of Miles to purchase this CD and find out for yourself. Peace to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother with this book","review":"I can't imagine anybody charging money for this book.

I read reviews of the product at other sites which were mostly positive. I saw some complaints about taste and loss of sleep. But, mostly the reviewers said that they made gains in size and strength. They claimed an increase in sexual potency as well. So here are my opinions.Pros:The taste kind of reminded me of real maple but not sweet.Cons:I did notice some sleep difficulty but it went away if I took it earlier in the evening usually after eating.I did not feel more energetic. I did not have any gains in size or strength. I had no difference in sexual potency.So, it did not work.I gave it two stars only because \\"hate\\" seems a pretty strong term. The definition of 1 star is \\"I hate this product.\\"I say spend your money on a good whey protein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Telephone Theory Principals and Practices","review":"This book was first copyrighted in 1973... and has not been seriously updated since.

Oddly enough, it comes with a filler tube and nowhere does it mention that there is no acid in the description.

The same battery with a different part number cost $2 more from Powersports and comes with acid! Have not tried it yet but will report any quality issues. Also, despite living in the digital age, Powersport is unable to provide a tracking number or shipping information and items tend to arrive at the end of their estimated; i.e., if the estimate is 3-6 days, assume it will be 6 days, and delivery estimate email typically comes 2-4 days after you placed the order.

Those that believe in Positive Reinforcement training consider her techniques and ideology to be cruel and unnecessary. For instance: holding a dogs head in a hole filled with water to stop the dog from digging. There are other methods that can stop the behavior without using such barbaric methods. Her techniques should not be used, and notice, the aggressive dogs she deals with are never rehabilitated into mainstream doggy life as it were. They are never trained to the point of being trusted. So much for her methods."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ultimate pit bull defense that most pit bull people are too illiterate to read","review":"Hearne's beautifully written book is, oddly, never referenced by people who loudly defend the 'fighting' breeds of dog from scrutiny. Hearne was a skilled and charismatic writer who can almost sell the utter malarkey that pit bulls have been unfairly maligned by 'the media' and 'hysteria.' But apparently, her complex, elliptical writing style and fascination with philosophy are a 'downer' for people who just want outrage stories about beaten dogs and biased media outlets. How very revealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author does a poor job and spreads misinformation about dogs","review":"I was deeply disappointed in this book. The only good thing about this book is that at least it does not blame the dog.

I had a Sony HTIB set up that I was not too crazy about but had to compromise because my wife is particular on how things look and will compromise perfomance. I decided to upgrade my system, but I wanted to do this without spending Bose money. I went with a Yamaha RX-V663 receiver and paired it with the Klipsch speakers. The results were beyond my expectations. The clarity of the sound was outstanding. The lows really come thru these speakers well. My wife's jaw dropped when she heard the results. I recommend people to do the research and check out these speakers. Most people see the name \\"Bose\\" and buy into the name because of there exposure on TV and magazine adds.

I can't say enough about them.I have it connected to the Yamaha rx-v361 receiver, and the combination is great!!

I do think my 20 year old speakers sound much better than these Klipsch speakers do; however, given the small size and light weight of this speaker set, I would rate them highly. They definitley do need a subwoofer to be used with them for deeper, lower frequency sounds. Overall, based upon positive and negative qualities, I would rate them 4 out of 5 for sound quality (what can I say- I have top quality speakers that are 20 years old and still going strong- it is just that they are so large, bulky and heavy.

At least that made me laugh because of the jokes. This book made me laugh when I think I should have been frightened.

I've felt that way for years! You have to listen to this album.All the songs are great. My personal favorite is India, but it doesn't really show off her voice as well as some of the others - - I just happen to get lost in it. To really hear what she's capable of doing with her voice as an instrument, listen to the full track of Meu Nome é Gal (not just the clip on the site).

A potential drawback I encountered is the tendency for the soles to squeak when on polished floors.

Serious use of color film was a rarity (due to low ASA numbers when compared to black-and-white) during the steam-to-diesel transition era, so I appreciate the nice collection of color photos included in this book.

It also includes some racial slurs that pop up out of nowhere--standard for the time, I'm sure, but startling and offensive nonetheless.Despite this, the book is a fast and interesting read, and provides a good deal of color for scientists whom most of us previously regarded as dry and distinguished. I don't know how much liberty he takes in building these characters, but I will now never forget Leeuwenhoek.The book ends with Paul Ehrlich in the early 20th century, so the past hundred years of infectious disease research obviously isn't covered.

This is a beautiful cookbook focusing on the history of french cooking, with the regional origins of many dishes and some of the recipes dating between the 14th and 19th century.The recipes are also scattered with beautiful artwork centering around still life and domestic scenes from Chardin to Monet, and many other old masters from different french musuems. Even tapestry details and manuscript paintings illustrate seasons and animals and medievil cooks and harvesters. It's hard at the end of it all to know which is the most appealing - the paintings or the recipes.I haven't attempted any of the recipes yet (so I shouldn't really be giving this book five stars,) but it's such a fun cookbook that I thought it was worth it.Highly recommended for anyone who likes art or traditional cooking and particularly as a fun way to approach french cooking if you've never tried it before."},{"rating":"2","title":"The title says it all","review":"This is definitely the most unusual book I have read about Marilyn Manson, rather than looking at the group's exploits, it takes a very indepth look at what makes MM tick.

It does exactly what the title says, dissects him and many other people in the music scene. This is a book for Manson fans who have read all the usual stuff, and want to dig a little deeper, it clearly explains his ideas and points of view on his music and what he is trying to express.

Not only is it incomplete as a \\"hits\\" collection, but it is also downright boring. Compared to the chaotic sound of the Mick Ralphs-period Mott The Hoople, or the burning rope that was Paul Kossoff and Free, these guys were so tame. After all, \\"Can't Get Enough,\\" \\"Movin' On,\\" and \\"Ready For Love\\" were all Mott rewrites. If you enjoy this set, you'll need to exercise rigorously, eat more fiber, and get out of the house more often. When you return, seek out the notable Mott The Hoople and Free sites on the web, and observe. There was a time when these guys, save for Boz Burrell, ripped, but this was not it.

W. Smith takes his time and takes near forever to determine that you are not in London or elsewhere in England but in fact in S. Africa. I did like once you acutaly got to the \\"historical\\" viewpoint of the book but the rest was overly predicatable and many avenues never lead anywhere.

However, this book reads like a cheap romance novel at times, one of the lead characters is extremely handsome and brave and strong and .... Another is an extremely beautiful woman, the other a phyisically deformed genius. Some of the dialogue made me wince - the constant references to the Lo's handsome features, the constant references to doctor Kazin's intelligence.I will definitely not read any other of Wilbur Smith's books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misogyny and typos","review":"I bought the kindle version of this book and couldn't be more disappointed. As a I wandered my way though the typo-littered text I was astounded by the blatant misogynistic attitude of the book. The female characters of the book are constantly described as childish or child-like and must be guided by the greater expertise of the men.I've read many of Wilbur Smith books but I was seriously disappointed by this one. Not only was the editing for the kindle edition exceptionally poor but I am not interested in reading a book that lacks any serious female lead while the two male leads are busy showing off spectacular feats of strength at every turn.

The lost city? The treasure?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Least favorite Smith novel so far","review":"An interesting premise to begin with. But halfway through the book I started wondering \\"where is he going with this?\\". The material is a bit dated for today's reader. The characters are typical for Wilbur Smith: men are manly and women are damsels in distress.I just felt that if Smith was really trying to draw some kind of parallel between the two worlds, it stayed parallel and never came together. It seemed sometimes that it was a gratuitous adventure in blood, killing and testosterone. It simply did not have any of the political intrigue that I remember from River God (still one of my all time faves) and Warlock."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sunbird","review":"Written in a somewhat different formatt from previous Smith novels, but as always well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sunbird basically substandard.","review":"I love Wilbur Smith's novels, but this one must have been a high-school project that he resurrected for some immediate cashflow.

My daughter has just reached the age where it would be appropriate for her and, while feeding her hunger for books, I remembered how good this book is. The second time I read it in a single sitting following a party where I didn't drink and I was waiting for everyone else to wake up. They woke, got on with the day and left me there reading. It is that gripping. It's a big book by the way, must be 8 hours or so of continuous reading.

My second favorite is \\"Rage of the sea\\" which I have read so many times I have lost count. Its strong, boisterous, sweeping and very easy to read.

If I hadn't been stuck on a plane and had nothing to do, I would have happily left this book in the airport club or the hotel wastebasket. I would not have wasted my time reading it.It is very hard to get wrapped up in a story about the two main characters when their only interactions include meeting at a school for a few minutes and several quick visits to a skating rink. Less than 20% of the book is devoted to them. And while the story of Giselle and Garek is somewhat interesting, way too much time was devoted to them. There really was no plot. Just conversations of Giselle and Garek. Even the characters mentioned in the beginning of the book, Val, Edward, Melissa etc. melt to nothingness by the end. My first Stone book and certainly my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"Being a Katherine Stone fans for years, I had high expectations for this book. I was extremely disappointed. I knew the ending by page 50, character development was poor and much of the character dialogue was confusing. Two love stories evolved and a missing person mystery solved in less than 300 pages. Characters were mentioned at the end of the book that I didn't recognize (due to lack of character development). Ms. Stone's books were always a guaranteed buy for me in the past. However, after reading this book, I will think twice before purchasing another one of her books especially at a hardcover price."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed after many winners","review":"I eat up everything Katherine Stone writes.

I did not hesitate to pick it up (at full cover price) because I have all her other novels and have loved everyone. She missed every opportunity to develope the characters and their relationships to say nothong of the storyline. There were a few too many easy coincidences for me. I found it to be more like a lengthy synopsis than a fully developed novel. Having read the entire book in about 5 hours, in desperation I am re-reading my favorites of hers. Katherine, please don't forget the reader in a rush to get the book out. I look forward to your next book and yes, I will buy it but it better be up to your former high standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a keeper","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. Katherine Stone spent too much time explaining and narrating. The story obviously couldn't stand on it's own. There was no development of passion. As soon as the characters Pierce/Liam meets Anastasia he is \\"suddenly\\" in love with just a short conversation. As soon as Giselle meets Garek she opens up and tells her whole life story. Where was the magic? Anastasia is always just \\"cold\\". I liked that there were actually two romances but that just left more explaining and narrating. I like much more interaction between characters. No action here and NO steamy love scenes to be found. Save your money. This is definitely not one I will save to read again later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Island of Dreams","review":"This should have been listed in the fantasy catagory. It was ridiculous. What a let down after reading so many of her other books and enjoying them so much. Any character that has their entire head of hair change color overnight all by itself \\"twice\\" in their lifetime is definitely unbelievable. This book seemed as though she couldn't really make up her mind about the main storyline. Either a sequel to a past book or a new story based on a new characther. The character she had. Any real story about him she didn't. Definitely wait for paperback if you're that desperate to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointed","review":"I've been a Katherine Stone fan from her first novel.... and have so looked forward to each new release. This book, however, was extremely disappointing. I felt as though Ms. Stone has discovered a \\"formula\\" and just wrote this book to fit the formula. Man meets woman - one or both have tragic pasts - they fall instantly in love - and basically the rest of the book is padding. The story was disjointed, and I felt the characters were \\"forced\\" on the reader, and instead of letting the reader \\"get to know\\" the characters and fall in like with them. This is not one of the romantic, spell-binding, touching stories Ms. Stone is known for."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I am not a very picky reader. I like anything that is written well. This book was not. The shift from the present to the past was not done well and left the reader with guessing games to play. The summary on the back of the book makes you believe that there is a bit of magic and mysticism to the book, but that is not the case.The characters are likeable characters, but the author should have focused the story on the interesting ones, Garick and Gigi rather than Anastasia and Liam/Pierce. I was intrigued when I saw the events that led Liam to become Pierce, but it had no bearing on the actual story.Such a shame-- this book had potential but blew it. This was my first Katherine Stone book and likely will be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't read the whole thing","review":"I usaully love Katherine Stone books. However, this one was terrible. I got to page 100 and realized I was wasting my time.

Her earlier works are far superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent -- even better on the second read","review":"Ms. Stone's books are to be savored. But, as usual, on the first time through I read it quickly, wanting to find out what was going to happen. When I read it again, the beautiful writing really struck me, as did the depth and richness of the characters. Terrific book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Island of confusion","review":"I love Katherine Stone's books, that is until I read this one. This is a story that did nothing but bore me. Again do not get me wrong I do enjoy Ms. Stone's other works but this one is a real stinker. The was no plot or character development, she never gives you a chance to care about any of these characters. The only character in this book that I appreciated was the glass sculptures. Ms. Stone does have a way with desribing surroundings that makes you feel like you are there or want to be there. (That's why I give it 2 stars). If you want a book of Ms. Stone's that has everything a good story should have, characters to care about, a plot that drags you in, and a world around you that seems to good to be true, I recommend two of her early works- \\"Pearl Moon\\" or \\"Rainbows\\".

This is really, really obvious and you should be embarassed!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading 'Thief of Hearts' and loving it, I couldn't wait to read Island of Dreams. What a let down! There are two sets of main characters whose lives bisect over a long ago mystery. There was plot but no pizazz. The characters instantly fall in love, then fight it until the last 6 pages of the book. I don't understand what the attraction is as the charcters weren't developed well.The opening chapter was so compelling that I thought it was going to be another 5 star winner but it spiralled downhill quickly. It had so much potential! It's as if Katherine wrote the first chapter and then someone else with little writing talent finished it. It was so inconsistant with other books I've read of Ms. Stone's.

There are too many missing pieces in the storyline to make it work.

When I travel someplace new, I want to learn about what I am seeing and Footprints does not dissapoint. With few exceptions, the book gave much better information than the guides we were with.

Having said that, I am ashamed to say that I JUST bought Promised Land a few days ago. I concluded that the album wasn't worth getting based on several negative reviews I read over the years. This release is absolutely fantastic! Mindcrime aside, this is thier most inspiring and creative release EVER! Promised Land is a showcase for QR's incredible musicanship. GT's vocals are breathtaking and the guitar work (classic DeGarmo)is so masterful that I weep when I think of Q2K.

Good stuff.I thought Promised Land was the weakest song on the album,its not a bad song,but if I skip a song its the only one I skip.This is the last great thing Queensryche has done.This band absolutly blows now big time.Its a shame that they have to keep playing Operation Mindcrime to draw a crowd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Direction - A Great Album","review":"Be warned - this isn't mainstream Queensryche so people coming into this album expecting it to sound like Empire will probably be disappointed and think that this isn't the same band - but it is. The fans that didn't like the mainstream sound of Empire will feel a little more at home with this one. This album is heavier overall than Empire, but still shows that the band is progressing and stands on it's own. The first two songs (after the 9:28 intro that is)really bring down the house! The title track is also one of the best on the album with it's haunting lyrics and guitar solo. My favorites on this one are I Am I, Damaged, Bridge, Promised Land, One More Time, and Someone Else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing, lousy editing!","review":"Keith Hartman is a national treasure--I love his view of the near-future, I love what he does with characters, the details and sly cultural references make 2025 Atlanta feel very real to me.There are some frustrating things about this book, though.

I mean, it has all the little special features if you want them (and I wanted them), but if you don't, it's just point and shoot. Then, plug in the attached cord to your computer, click the copy photos button, and you're ready to print or email or whatever.

Minus extras, it runs 80 minutes. I wish there was more detail but it certainly hits all the high points of the season, and in fact begins the story with the crushing defeat in the 2003 ALCS. It concentrates for obvious reasons on the 2004 games against the Yankees, and because of that minimizes some other great games and performances. There are some good interview snippets with Terry Francona, Curt Schilling, Jason Varitek and all the key members of the Red Sox executive staff. The extras are moderately interesting, and although the background music is only ok, at least it's not annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"One of the most boring World Series.

Unfortunately, this calendar did not meet my expectations. First, it's three dimensional which I hadn't realized. It fits together with two notches and is not very sturdy when set up. I was expecting a wall calendar style which I could just put on the fridge. This tree shaped style is nice to look at but something that my toddler wants to play with all the time. It's really too flimsy to play with since it's just thin cardboard. Also, the thing is loaded with gold glitter which comes off on the hands whenever you touch it to open the windows. This is very annoying to me, a contact lense wearer, and it gets all over clothes and everything! Third, the pictures inside the windows are not very interesting (granted I've only seen two so far...) and the illustrations are all a bit fuzzy and muted in style.

Que Alegria was the second (and last) album of the trio and was less melodic and exhibitionist (naturally, being a studio album), but it had great harmonic structures and brilliant bass player, Frenchman Dominique Di Piaza.

And, in the formulas section (which was the main reason I bought the book) the formulas just list the herbs and not their proportions! WHAT!?! How unhelpful.To know that herbs are in a formula is great, but it is not a formula without the proporation of ingredients.

On \\"The Last One to Know,\\" her third studio album in two years, Reba's vocals and emotional delivery shine like never before. From frail to feisty, the little red head with the big voice takes you on an emotional rollercoaster that will leave you breathless. The album contains two #1 hits, and 8 other songs that could have been. This is the album where Reba also begins to tackle \\"issue songs\\" such as \\"Just Across the Rio Grande,\\" about a Mexican longing for the better life in America, and \\"The Stairs,\\" which is a haunting portrait of a battered wife. There are also two, strategically placed up-lifting songs to keep the listener from total depression.

Two years after the initial three season run the cast and team reunited for a fourth season, with one change to the group of six.For the most part, the energy, wit and raunchy humor are up to the same level, but, as good as he is, the new character cannot match Richard Coyle's manic verve as Geoffrey.Otherwise, 'Coupling' Season 4 remans one of the peak achievements of TV comedy, even if, ironically, it spawned the very worst American version remake of all time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"From great to crap","review":"I loved season 1-3, but was terribly disappointed in series 4. Why would they try and add a character who so obviously trying to replace Jeffery? You just cannot immitate that character. Richard Coyle is one in a million in that role. They would have been a lot better off with a fresh start adding a totally new character, but they didn't.

Jane vs the Truth snake is a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best sitcoms around.","review":"Coupling is one of my favorite sitcoms. Don't be put-off by the dopey American imitation. This is the real-deal. YES it is similar to Friends, but with a healthy does of Seinfeld added in.The second season is the best currently available on DVD. It has the classic episode where Jeff unfortunately tells a woman he has an artificial leg. It also features appearances by Captain Subtext and The Melty Man.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"Let me start off by saying I loved Seasons 1-3. I have watched them again and again, but I resisted buying Season 4 because of Jeff's absence. Finally, I caved. After all, while Jeff was a great part of the show, he was not THE show. How bad could it be?Bad. Painfully bad.I do not exaggerate here when I say I didn't laugh once. Not even a chuckle. Whereas before I would laugh until my sides hurt, Season 4 left me feeling uncomfortable. Dismayed. Wondering what had gone so wrong where everything previously had gone so right.It wasn't just Jeff being gone. The writing was off, as was the acting. The feeling of camaraderie was gone. The characters had lost their depth, and the actors delivered their lines in a way that seemed forced.I should have followed my instincts and avoided this season. Now I need to watch 1-3 to get the bad taste of season 4 from my mouth. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oliver cannot replace Jeff - and ruins everything, trying to","review":"I was dismayed to discover early in the first episode of Season 4 that Jeff was aparently already en route to Lesbos (!) and wouldn't be seen for the remainder of the Series!Instead we get this inserted look & sound-alike, called Oliver, who Moffatt gives all the Jeff-like lines & situations to, but the poor Newbie just can't handle them, and anyone who has got as far as Season 4 with the wonderful (so-far) 'Coupling' will be just left cringing and WISHING Jeff could be there delivering the lines in HIS inimitable and wonderfully zany and accomplished way!The rest of the cast are Wonderful, as we have come to expect & love, but each time the Oliver character appears, one is left feeling like fingernails have been dragged down a blackboard, and the whole scene is ruined by it.Stick with Seasons 1 - 3 !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this show.","review":"This is one of my favorite shows. Season 4 is great but isn't the best. I really missed Jeff. The introduction of Oliver was slow. At first I didn't really like him but by the last 2 episodes he really began to grow on me. Then it ended. I wish their seasons were longer. 6 episodes just wasn't enough. I would give it 4.5 stars if it had that option, but I'll stick with 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Coupling lost its mojo","review":"If all the other reviews didn't make it clear enough, let me state once more: No Jeff, no mojo. Some of the best moments of the previous three series center around Jeff's crazy concepts: The \\"giggle loop,\\" \\"sock gap,\\"nudity buffer,\\" and \\"melty man\\" to name a few. It was bad enough that they lost this vital element, but they made it even worse by trying to force the new guy, Oliver, into becoming a copy-cat Jeff. A ploy which failed. Miserably. Let me suggest that you adopt C.S.F.A.T. or Coupling Season Four Avoidance Technique with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better than Season One","review":"If you liked season one of Coupling, you will love season two. The situations are even more hilarious, the neuroses of the characters are more fully explored, and the viewer will laugh even harder. We get new \\"Jeff-isms,\\" find out what is in Patrick's cupboard (closet to us Yankees), and watch Susan and Steve's relationship reach new depths of passion and absurdity.There are two discs with a lot more episodes than season one, and the special features are vastly improved over season one.

Mead claimed that women were dominant in the Tchambuli tribe, without causing problems. This statement was used as the intellectual cornerstone of the later Women's liberation movement. However, reliable modern references such as Encyclopedia Britannica make no mention of female dominance or power in those tribes, except for infrequent taboo ceremonies by female witches. (That tribe is also called Chambri or Chimbu in modern references.) Mead also described the Arapesh people as pacifist, cooperative, happy folks, and that was used by later Columbia University students such as Kerouac and Ginsberg as the philosphical basis of the Hippy Revolution. Modern references describe the Arapesh as having been just as competitive and warlike as other primitive peoples.

This is a story about a man who did not just do HOMEwork to find a working dog, he went to Scotland, to the roots of the Border Collie, to find the right dog. As he tells his traveling tale, we also get some history of shepherding, of sheep and dogs, and of the Scots who made the history we see today in movies.The \\"right\\" dog isn't necessarily the ultimate \\"best\\" dog. The \\"right\\" dog is about chemistry, the needs of both parties, and the mutual satisfaction of those needs. \\"Relationship\\" is too pat. \\"Synergy,\\" while apt, misses the art and mystery. Journey, companion, respect, dependence and regrets: those are good words for the \\"right\\" dog.Plus, it's a good read. I've read \\"Eminent Dogs, Dangerous Men\\" twice in print and once on CD.

This is a good place to commence a collection; for it features a decent cross-section of the styles and musical tastes on which Ms Dearie established herself.As other reviewers have noted, the highlight of the whole disc is Blossom Dearie's French translation of \\"It Might As Well Be Spring\\", full of delicate piano and Dearie's sensual, longing vocals. Other delights to be had include \\"More Than You Know\\", \\"Now at Last\\", \\"Wait Till You See Her\\", and \\"I Hear Music\\". The disc concludes with three never-before-released bonus tracks (\\"They Say It's Spring\\", \\"Johnny One-Note\\" and \\"Blossom Dearie's Blues\\").Pop this disc into the CD player, sit back and unwind with the one and only Blossom Dearie!

Misty, romantic, drenched in ennui and melancholy, but a light touch maintained with that clear, pure voice. It makes me go weak at the knees. Like Billie Holliday only optimistic. Blossom can carry a torch, but make it seem like a light burden she might toss away on a whim. Jazz fans, get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"That Voice!","review":"This woman's talent is far too under rated. Her voice should place her 'superstar' quotient among that of any top vocal superstar of the twentieth century. Miss Dearie should be filling huge concert halls and charging hundreds of dollars for admission. Don't pass on this CD. Who else could give such contrast to the disturbing lyrics of the amazing \\"Everything I've Got\\" with the most brilliantly sweet (yet totally unsentimental) vocals imaginable? This CD also contains three additional tracks that were not released with the other medium format releases of this title; a definate bonus. I listen to this CD so frequently that my friends think it is the only CD that I own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT debut!!!","review":"This is the first in a long line of wonderful albums Blossom Dearie cut for Verve; like many of her later albums it features her on vocals & piano with a swingin' small group (Ray Brown on bass, Jo Jones on drums, and Herb Ellis on guitar); four tracks also add a vocal chorus(which in only on the extra bonus tracks, not on the original LP release). The album is winsome & bright, and is consistantly enjoyable (some of the many highlights are a fine \\"Lover Man\\" and a hilarious \\"A Fine Spring Morning\\"); an enjoyable sung in French (\\"Comment Allez Vous\\", \\"It Might as Well Be Spring\\" & \\"Tout Doucement\\"), and her pronunciation is exellent: in fact Blossom Dearie's perfect diction is a highlight throughout. Every track a gem.

But not far there is a zombie \\"Bill Hinzman\\" that is waiting to drink the blood of the young kids.One thing that I like about this one that you dont find in alot of zombie movies is, most zombie movies start out with a whole cemetery full of zombies.

Lian Chu is formidable and kind and Guizmo really has everyone interests at heart and Hector, their little dragon that lugs everything around for them is great comic relief.

It covers a variety of topics, from preference maximization through existence and stability of eq'ia, to optimal control and growth models.However, I'm not sure what its niche is -- what this book provides that others don't, or that it covers more thoroughly. If you want math, read Simon and Blume or a math book. If you want micro theory, read Mas-Collel or Silberberg. If you want neoclassical macro theory, read Sargent. For optimal control, read Kamien/Schwarz or Seierstad/Sydsaeter. This book covers selected topics from each. Though it covers them well, much is left out.Noticeably absent from the book is any uncertainty, randomness, or probability. There is also no game theory. These seek huge omissions for a book which seeks to show the usefulness of mathematical techniques in economic analysis.Notation is also a bit unusual. I was a bit confused by some of the author's own notation for partial orderings and Cartesian products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getz gets it","review":"I love this album.

I'm not sure what Frederick the Great didn't like, but...Bebop cutting sessions like this strike me that way, \\"too many notes\\". Each musician trying to play as fast and as complicated a rif as he could to prove that he could lose the other people in the group, totally losing all sense of melody or harmony. Much technique, little memorable music.Stan Getz, who could play anything and everything, consistantly tried to prove that he was \\"not a feather-light stylist\\" but rather a \\"stomping tenor man\\".There are many better more representational and truly Stan Getz recordings like \\"Anniversary\\", \\"Blue Sky\\", \\"Spring is Here\\", \\"Nobody Else but Me\\" \\"Ballads and Bossa\\" \\"Focus\\" etc etc. See my list on this page."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome debut from an awesome band","review":"Though this album is not as good as their latter albums, The Distillers debut still is one of the best CDs in my collection. A genuine punk album with heavy influences from Hole and Rancid, this album showed the punk world that The Distillers really have something special.Standout tracks include the explosive opening song, 'Oh Serena', the cover of Patti Smith's 'Ask The Angels', and 'Gypsy Rose Lee' featuring Brody's sexiest vocals.If there is a better example of true punk rock, I've yet to hear it."},{"rating":"1","title":"you're not seriously considering this music are you?","review":"Punk has reached yet a new low. Grab some random girl off the street, make sure she looks and sounds like a man, and let her sing or whatever it is she does. This is tied with Anti-Flag for the worst punk band out there. The music may be fast at times (wow it's punk!), but it's bland and really quite horrible. The second you hear the singer's voice, you'll know where it's going. She sounds like the guy from Rancid, only more like a man. I've seen comparisons to Hole on here. They're pretty accurate. They ... bad enough to be compared to Hole. I can't understand how people see talent in these kind of bands. They are completely talentless.

Comparisons are odious, but to my mind this is least attractive of the three volumes available on Vocalion, for three reasons. First, it includes several novelty songs, which do not bear up well under repeated listening, neither Al Bowlly nor Alberta Hunter is represented, and by the middle to late thirties arrangements were becoming more homogenised. Having said which, it is still well worth seeking out, but I'd suggest you secure the other two first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fly Line Backing","review":"Excellent for the usage.

We took it out of the box and put it together when we were doing our nursery. We tested it a couple of times and it worked fine. Now our baby girl is due anyday and it doesn't work. The gears inside are all jammed up so we can't even use it manually. We can't take it back because we don't have the box anymore and we received it as a gift so we don't have a receipt.

We had previously tried a popular diaper pail that did nothing to stop odors. This one does the trick with keeping the room smelling not like a diaper, but lacks in the design area.First of all, it should have been designed to be at least twice as big. We use size 4 diapers, and this pail barely holds two days worth of diapers. If I wanted to change the pail that often, I would use a regular garbage pail.Secondly, when it's full or the batteries die, the pail is useless. Therefore, you're left standing there holding a steaming diaper!And finally, the materials used seem flimsy for the amount of use the pail receives.I'm hoping for an improved version soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not clearly described!","review":"We purchased this diaper pail because all descriptions, and even the video on the Graco website made it seem like when you drop the diaper in the pail, it falls directly into the bag and has the filtration system to contain the smell. This is NOT the case. This pail has a similar system as the Diaper Champ, in that there is a \\"ball\\" that catches the diaper, then it spins and drops it into the chamber below with the bag when the lid closes.We were hoping to use this for cloth diapering, so we were looking for a pail that has a filtration system, but none of the special bags, crimping or chambers that catch the diaper and drop it into the pail. With this method, we'd have to constantly clean the \\"ball\\" that catches the cloth diaper, and we just don't want to deal with that. I guess we're stuck using a standard garbage can or pail for our cloth diapering. I wish someone would invent a great filtered pail for cloth diapering!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just because it's Graco, doesn't mean it's good.","review":"We returned one of these right away, because the hands- free option did not work. After exchanging it for a new one, we discovered that it, too, did not work. However, as a parent of a newborn, you just don't have time to run to Babies R Us all the time for a new diaper pail, so we decided to just use the manual lift option and be done with it.Fast forward 8 months: the manual lift option no longer works either! The lid sticks all the time, and you have to open the stinky pail and fiddle with the inside bowl to get it to open. Back to Babies R Us, and this time we got a Diaper Champ. So far, so good, and the Diaper Champ can use any type of bag as well.I will say that this pail does hold the stink in. However, if you have to go into the stink zone to fix the lid all the time, what does it matter?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This pail is a piece of junk!","review":"And \\"junk\\" is too nice a word for it. The hands free thing never worked, and the part that flips over for you to put the diaper in when you open the lid doesn't come up all the way, so I have to cram the diapers in just to use it. We've only had it a couple of months too! A pail that costs this much should work more than two months! On top of that, those little filters are a joke. This pail stinks worse than any we have owned to date. Fortunately, my son has quit wearing diapers, so we just have our daughter's to deal with, but still...this pail is NOT worth the money and we are really upset that we wasted our money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"We had the diaper champ with our first and I wish I had bought another. The \\"touch free\\" worked with about as much frequency as those hand dryers in the public restrooms. And the gears inside jammed up everytime the pail got full.

I thought maybe places were out of them or something and was able to get them via Graco directly. Now I sent them a message this morning via email and got a really bizarre response that if I want to buy any product from them or their sister companies, I can get a $20 rebate? That doesn't help me with my diaper pail! I'm about to have my second child and am stumped for what type to get now. This was a great product, so why they stopped making them is beyond me - there is NO diaper pail that gets rave reviews across the board, so why stop making this one? Just shaking my head. Maybe more reviews on amazon will help some poor schmuck from buying one off another site. I always come to amazon for product reviews, so maybe this will help someone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never had so much fun...","review":"...listening to a Christian album!

But it doesn't just appeal to me-my 12-year-old son loves it, too. The band does an excellent job in reproducing the sound of the originals.

The movie shows the good with love interests, the cleanliness of the society. It shows the bad with actions that can have people killed from beheadings, boiling in oil and crucifixion. The movie teaches some Japanese and a culture that is still partially relevant today in understanding today's Japanese society.It was also a time of the Catholic Church beginning to have an influence; a time of gaining power and gaining great wealth for the Church through a monopoly on trade with the rest of the world. The church at that time had both very godly men, and those that were in it for the money and power. Just like any time in history, including today, there are people that will gain notoriety and power through unscrupulous actions.Shogun is well written and both entertaining and educational. I highly recommend it for anyone that is interested in Japanese culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHOGUN","review":"Based on the real life diary of Will Adams ( very boring) , the real Anjin san, Clavell makes the tale come alive!

This 10-hour epic follows the exploits of John Blackthorne, a navigator on a Dutch ship in the 1600's who finds his way to the Japans through the Magellan Straight. In Japan Blackthorne is confronted by a culture strange to him and Portuguese traders and priests who have monopolized trade with the Japan's because of their heretofore secret passage through the Straits. Blackthorne finds himself thrust into the middle of a political struggle that works against him staying alive, much less getting back home.

I approached it with a little trepidation, worrying that it would not live up to the standard of the novel. I needn't have worried. I spread it out over four nights and enjoyed it thoroughly. The only complaint I have is the portrayal of the Japanese characters. With the exception of the translator Mariko, none of the Japanese characters ever speak for themselves. The film has instances of untranslated Japanese (irritating) and whenever something vital happens, the English narrator tells us what has taken place. This, I think, cheapens the Japanese players, reducing to them to secondary characters. In the book, they are as vital to the story as Blackthorne and the other \\"barbarians\\" and this doesn't come out as much in the film. It would have been better to allow the Japanese characters to speak with their own voices, providing us with subtitles. That being said, it is a fantastic series and well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Editing woes","review":"The color and sound are excellent in this new DVD set.

The 2-star rating is not for the mini-series, because that was one of the greatest shows ever produced for television.The 2-star rating is because there are no subtitles available for the Japanese speaking parts. If you set English subtitles to ON, the only time they work is with the English speaking parts!!!

The one major problem with the DVD is with the subtitling. I was hoping they would include english subtitles for the lines spoken in Japanese, however, they have english subtitles for the lines spoken in english! What good is that? I can understand if it's for the hearing impaired, but why not have the subtitles for the Japanese lines. It would help a lot towards understanding the story better.

This is understandable at the beginning. We are confused as was Blackthorne. However, as he learns Japanese, he begins speaking it. Subtitles would have been more than appropriate at this point, they are essential.

Promised Land and Hear in the Now Frontier are decent albums but from Warning-Empire were their best days by far. Empire is a close follow-up to Mindcrime, not quite as good but almost equal. It's a bit more commercial and less heavy. It's not really a metal album, it's more hard rock. The songs are slower and more melodic, lyrics are great too. It includes their ballad Silent Lucidity which you're probably familiar with. Some of my personal favorites include The Thin Line, Della Brown and Empire."},{"rating":"1","title":"What went wrong??","review":"I started listening to 'ryche with Rage for order, which is outstanding.

My mother, who is in her sixties and remembers Simon and Garfunkel from when they were popular, listened to the Queensrche version and said that it was impressive; \\"they did a really good job.\\" As to the other tracks on this CD, they are guaranteed to take you back musically.

But great rock, rock of a high caliber! And this album Empire is the best Queensrche ever came up with!On vinyl, this is a double album even though there are only 11 tracks. But they're all pretty long, and the filmic sound effects introducing and extroducing every song must've provided inspiration for bands like Therapy? and Zyrk.The highlights are Jet City Woman and the ballads Anybody Listening? and Silent Lucidity. And, oh, by the way, this album title was taken as a title for a German prog rock magazine too... because of the greatness of the album... which is not prog rock but pure ROCK."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong re-egalisation.","review":"Empire was probably re mixed by the musicians with ther damaged earing, so the midband and hi frequency are on the brighter side of reality and became verry agressive at high volume.

I don't like Pink Floyd, so I don't like this song. I also don't like \\"One and Only.\\" Outside of that, this is one of Queensryche's more intelligent offerings despite the obvious commerciality of the songs. However, the best songs on this album remain the more thoughtful efforts, like \\"Anybody Listening?\\" or \\"Empire;\\" the ones that have something to say if you want to stand up and take note. \\"Jet City Woman\\" was something of a hit, as well, and it is a pretty excellent track. My own personal favorites are \\"Jet City Woman,\\" \\"Another Rainy Night,\\" \\"Empire,\\" and the superb \\"Anybody Listening?\\" I recommend this album, but not as much as, say, OPERATION: MINDCRIME."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"The sound is incredible.

It's an outstanding representation of their music when it was hard and tight. Their image scored points, their tour was awesome, this earned them their \\"Thinking man's band\\" reputation due to the complexity of the lyrics and hair raising quality of Tate's vocals.

I'm sorry to any Queensryche fans that I may offend, but I listen to bands like Metallica, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains so to me, Queensryche's \\"rockin'\\" songs sound like fraggle rock to me. And I also listen to bands like Pink Floyd and Guns N' Roses so this music doesn't seem very emotional to me either despite what some of you have said. This album came out the same year as Metallica and Guns N' Roses released great albums, and I think only 1 year before Nirvana released \\"Nevermind\\" so this album just doesn't cut it. Some of you say that Queensrych sound like Pink Floyd. Sorry, but they don't. If you want a band that sounds like Pink Floyd, buy Pink Floyd.

I agree that the actors weren't so bad but that the script makes for wooden characters. It focuses so much on \\"evil Carol\\" that it doesn't make for very cheerful watching.

I won't go into the plot, since everyone pretty much already knows it, but what I will say is that this is about ten times better than any movie to feature the killer doll released since, and surprisingly the film hasn't aged too badly.

But this time, the plot involves a doll. Child's Play is a disguise of Friday the 13th at its best. How pathetic is that: a spoiled kid that gets what he wants? No wonder why I am rooting for the bad guy. Chris Sarandon gives a nice performance which helped Child's Play from being a total trash. Probably the worst part about Child's Play, when it comes to annoying characters, Chucky the doll tops the odious boy from Problem Child. I am surprised and disappointed there was much profanity in Child's Play especially when there is a young kid actor in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reveiw from Mr. Entertainment Lover","review":"This is without a doubt one of the worst films ever made. The plot very simple, a little boy gets a doll from his mom that is evil because of the spirit of a deranged killer inhabiting it.

There are so many plotholes in this film that I can't type them all in one sitting. The acting is terrible at best. The premise is preposterous & stupid. The devices that made Chucky look like he was real are faulty at best. Worst of all,even thought the cast saids that Chucky's body is becoming more human,he can still move & LIVE without a head,with one arm and with only one leg. They to shoot it like a million times before he goes down for the count for good. Overall,while it is scary for some people,it's dated at best.

I know that sounds really really bad but it'smuch better than it sounds. The movie has a slow beging but gets really good.

I hate to sound negative as I talk about something but I just can't stand this movie. I believe that the whole of movie's about evil dolls are becoming so stupid because they have been overdone. I mean what is the premise for a movie like this. It is a horrible plot and leaves nothing to the imagination (If you would just sit down and think about it).

The volume can be adjusted loudly to wake the heavy sleeper or softly for the light sleeper.I purchased this clock to wake my husband since he gets up at 4 am and I get up at 6am. It's nice to be awakened gently instead of jolted out of bed by a buzzer or beeper which makes it much easier for me to get back to sleep once my husband is up. The only thing I wish this clock had is a dual alarm, although I use a dawn simulating alarm for myself so it really doesn't matter to me. This really is a nice alternative to the jolting alarms of regular alarm clocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"really shouldn't be called an alarm clock","review":"Ok,this item is very well made. It is not heavy, but the workmanship is nice. I got the optional ac adapter, so don't have to worry about batteries. I thought it would be nice to wake to something different in the mornings, but I guess I'll have to keep looking. The volume is low, so it never rouses me. I don't know for sure if the alarm repeats for a period of time, or just goes through the card once, because it hasn't waken me up once this entire first week I've tried using it. The speaker is in back, so it isn't projecting any sound forward. I would not buy it as an alarm clock if you aren't going to add it to a collection of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it used to be","review":"I had this same bird clock for many years. When it accidentally fell off my nightstand and broke, I decided to buy the exact same clock since I was so pleased with it in the past.However, it is not the same, and not just in appearance. This one, though it looks similar, is more cheaply made. Compared in weight, it is must lighter and more \\"plastic\\" looking. The casing on my previous bird clock was a silver color, whereby this one is a dark gray lightweight plastic.To advance time or alarm times, you cannot just hold the button down to scroll to the desired hour or minute. You now have to hit the button individually for each hour or minute desired.So the price has remained the same, but the quality has deteriorated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries are not working for this clock","review":"Although the appearance of this alarm clock is attractive, and bird idea is interesting, the clock does not worth to buy, because it is not working from any batteries. The owner has already included additional page with information that not every batteries will work for the clock and added instructions of how to break plastic separators between the batteries'' placeholders to make better contact for the batteries. I fallowed the instructions, and it did not help at all. It looks like there is bad design from inside and batteries just cannot make the right contact in their placeholders. I was very disappointed, because I ordered this alarm clock both, from Amazon.com and from Identiflyer with the same result. I returned both alarm clocks. The owner contacted me and promised to send me working one, but I am not sure I will do any business with this company anymore.Svetlana Plummer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Requiring starforce is the least of its problems...","review":"You did need to install Starforce!

It was version 1.4 when I installed it so I figured they would have most of the stability issues worked out, apparently I was wrong. The game also uses StarForce copy protection, which has inspired several boycotts among gamers. In Sea Dogs II there was a hotkey to speed up the passage of time while maneuvering your ship or waiting for your cannons to reload, there is no such hotkey in this game, very annoying because sea battles can get long and drawn out especially when you are trying to run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Age of Pirates","review":"I canceled my order for Age of Pirates because it contains StarForce.

Leather and mesh are of a really nice quality and very soft, yet durable. Two gripes though: one, the cut is a bit odd, with no velcro strap and with this pointy thing instead, which (for me, at least) hits right at the bump of my wrist bone -- can be irritating. Two, the seams on the palm are a bit thick and rough, to the point of giving me blisters on my left hand.

The breeder that I purchased my Grey from was a cynic as far as books on parrots were concerned, but I brought him my own copy as he had urged me to subscribe to Bird Talk magazine. I gave him my copy which he read and found to be the best source of information for Greys outside of Bird Talk.

Try the Guide to a Well Behaved Parrot for general information, and African Grey Parrots, by the same author.This book was an utter waste of time and money. I feel the title is misleading.It was also upsetting that the author outright discouraged adopting preowned parrots, and encouraged play with dangerous toys - nuts and bolts and rope.

An unconvincing excuse. There be other authors who have left a lot less, and that didn't stop hordes of biographers.I think Yardley found it easier to surmise than actually do the legwork.

A Fan's Notes is a terrific read and deserves the accolades it has received from Yardley and others. But Yardley is the wrong guy to write a biography of Exley. He is so obtusely literal and middle-brow that he does something I would have thought impossible: make Exley boring. Maybe Nick Tosches should have a crack at this subject.

Instead we get the standard biographer's suppositions that just hang there without justification. That people loved Exley is obvious. That he was self-destructive has been documented by his writing.

Having recently read the Bell Jar, I was fascinated with Sylvia Plath. The author simply talks about how she talked to various SP biographers and what they thought and did.

How can you state in the title \\"Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes\\" when essentially nothing of any substance is really written about them? This book follows no chronological order and is awful. What a lazy excuse for some nouveau (?)kind of biography. It comes off like a very trite, poorly written yet pompous piece from an off-issue of Vanity Fair.

I particularly did not like the retelling of petty complaints, such as \\"slvia helped herself to food in my refridgerater.\\" If the author in deed thought these remarks were not worthy of being in a biography, then why give a second life to them?

The exploration of the effect of Sylvia Plath's suicide on those she left behind is what makes this book so worth reading. The universals here go way beyond who was the victim and who was the demon. I don't really care about Sylvia Plath. I don't care about Ted Hughes either. It's Malcolm who's the main character here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice feel.","review":"Loud and natural sound, comfortable cups. These are rather large, but that's what I like about them.

First, the item is bulky and the cord is too short for the huge unit to fit in a side pants pocket. Second, the \\"active noise reduction\\" actually just increases the volume a tiny bit; it does not reduce outside noise AT ALL. The cheap rubber fittings are difficult to insert in your ear, and don't seal very well which greatly reduces the passive noise reduction. Also, the sound quality is on par with $3 disposable headphones. It is muffled and just BAD. My advice: pay a little bit more for good-sounding earbuds, and definitely don't opt for the \\"active noise reduction\\" when buying earbuds, as it is worthless, requires batteries, and is very bulky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as blue as the picture presents","review":"Amendment to below review (Mar 07): My wife really likes them and wears them all the time.

Now today I can say that this really is a good album.Sure, it's no \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\" or \\"Empire\\", but songs like \\"Sign of the Times\\" and \\"The Voice Inside\\" are very well written. Queensryche was always a tough band to categorize, and I think this album was just another attempt by the band to be different.The extra tracks on this version are good ones.

The music sounds nothing like Queensrche has ever produced. Sure the lyrics to most of the songs are great, but how Geoff sings them, and the guitar parts. . .well. . .just did not live up to the band's reputation.

The characters who think they're smart are actually the dumb ones and the characters who think they're not smart are actually the smart ones. It reminds me a lot of my own family relationships. Family Guy and the Simpsons try to use the same format, but they are just not as good as the old fashion All In the Family even though they are more successful financially and have younger generations relate to them.

Just seven years earlier the show's were \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" \\"Andy Griffith\\" and \\"The Lucy Show\\" . All are funny and clean cut humor. But nothing like \\"All in the Family\\". The acting And expressions are simply great. The only reason this dvd is not getting 5 stars is because the first disc produces a very slight clicking noise about every 2-3 seconds. Must be from the transfer or something. I Just wish they would release these seasons more often. Why the wait?! The show is totally dated but at the time people did have these connections with these characters. The black and white episodes of Andy Griffith are timeless in a sense that the show doesn't focus on any real event of the day, just good ol' Barney and Andy shootin' the breeze in the court house. I recommend this and all previous seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gets better every season","review":"i would like to say that i dissagree with the last review i think the episodes get better all the way up till season 8 when Mike and Gloria Leave for California....but still loved the show beyound that would like to see them all out all the way through Archie Bunkers Place"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why so long?","review":"Why is it taking so long to release this series? Not only that but why would they release Season 1 of \\"Archie Bunker's Place\\" before the rest of the \\"All In The Family\\" series is released? \\"Archie Bunker's Place\\" is more or less a continuation of \\"All in the Family\\". I don't get it. I remember when the first Twilight Zone DVDs started coming out. They released the first 12, then all of a sudden they stopped production. It took something like five or six years before they resuemed production. After buying them though, I found the reason: The first 12 DVDs were released by Panansonic and apparently they lost the release rights until another company, \\"IMAGE\\" bought the rights and started production. Who knows, maybe Michael Jackson bought up the rights to \\"All in the Family\\" the way he did the Beatle's master tapes, in which case, we'll never see them released."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's still good!","review":"The show, in my opinion, is the best all-time show ever for American TV. (You know it was based on a British TV show called \\"Til Death us Do Part.\\") My husband who was raised in Britain absolutely howls with laughter at Archie Bunker. I introduced him to the show when Carroll O'Connor died in 2001 (I think). He also thinks Edith is a wonderful character. The show just reminds me of my grandmother's house in the 70s. The fabric calendar on the wall of the kitchen, the furniture, the colors, etc. What Gloria wouldn't have done with a good straightening iron for her hair like we have today.As always the show is peppered with Archie's mispronunciations: one good one is his saying \\"menstrual\\" instead of \\"minstral\\" for which Edith must translate for the listener.I think the quality of the images in this season is better than the last few seasons where there was always a green line through the center of the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Archie & his Dingbat","review":"How can you not laugh while watching Archie Bunker espousing on the \\"good ole days\\" when girls were girlsand men were men.

In fact, prior to putting up the shade being in the courtyard anytime after mid morning was uncomfortable. That has changed with this shade.I think this shade sail is a bargain. The material is thicker and stronger than I expected and the hardware provided is very good quality stainless steel. I expect this shade will last a long time.I installed the shade myself. It was not difficult. I used some cargo pull straps to pull the canopy tight so it did not sag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool!","review":"We installed this on the western side of the house where the afternoon/evening sun was beating on the french doors to our dining room. We attached two corners to the house, and the other two to 4X4s put in the yard at the edge of the patio, and painted black to match the iron fence nearby. It looks very nice. We now have a very attractive awning on that patio, and the house is cooler in the afternoons. It is noticeably cooler under this than the rest of the yard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do your homework and you will love it","review":"If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive way to create shade, this is the way to go. One thing we figured out is that the measurements are from corner to corner, which means that the actual body is slightly smaller. We ordered the smaller size first and exchanged it immediately for the larger one. We used four poles set in concrete as anchor points. We also attached two connection hooks on each pole...one about 1 1/2 feet higher than the other. This gives us the option to raise or lower the shade on each corner for optimum shade during any time of the day. We love the fact that the material breezes and lets moisture through for our planters. It is amazing how much cooler it is underneath this shade sail. My husband was very apprehensive at first...now he loves it. We just had an outdoor party and everybody commented how nice it looks and how effective it is. My main suggestions is: measure properly and make sure you pick the best way to anchor it."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love the Sail!","review":"Length:: 0:35 MinsWe purchased the sail to cover our side yard. After reading many reviews on many different products we chose the Coolaroo Square Shade Sail. It comes with all the hardware you need to install it *IF* you have the perfect 11 foot space to fit it in, otherwise you will need to buy straps or wires to connect it to your tie down spots. We ended up using automotive tie downs that have built in ratchets to tighten the straps. They work great, very easy to adjust as needed and also something we found out by mistake, the tie downs make it easy to take the sail down QUICKLY if the winds get to high.Its amazing how much the sail cools down an area without making it seem you are in a tent. I highly recommend the Coolaroo Square Shade Sail. Great quality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Customer Service","review":"This company doesn't respond to phone calls or email.

The edges are curved inward. It's 11 1/2 feet wide at the corners but only 8 1/2 feet wide in the middle. It says square, I expect it to be square. A 12x12 shade is 144 square feet. They take off several inches on each edge for seams plus another couple for the attachment rings, then the sides curve so it's only 95 square feet of shade. Getting returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hanging it is a difficult process!!!","review":"While it looks good once it's up, it sags. We've made several attempts to make it as tight as can be without much help from the instructions, and are very disappointed in that aspect. If better instructions were given, we'd be giving this product 5 stars! But the directions are vague and do not help with information on how to hang it, no dimensions, no recommendations on pipe width, which hardware to use, etc.Now we are stuck with pipes cemented into our lawn at the incorrect distance and width and will have to remove them and purchase new pipes. Not happy.Also, do not expect this to protect your from the rain! Just a side note. It does great for shade, but nothing else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value","review":"I Received the shade sooner than I thought. The stainless steel hardware that came with it was of very good quality and really helped in the installation. I attached this shade to the side of my aluminum awning that was on the back of my house, because the sun was shinning under the awning during the afternoon and evening hours. This shade looks very nice, and worked exactly like I wanted it to. I can also unhook it from the poles I put up, and let it hang down the side of the awning to block all the sun and keep the rain from getting under the awning when it's raining. I can tell by the way it's made, that it should last a long time. I paid more for this shade than some of the other's on the market, but I'm glad I did. It's top notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable Shade Sail","review":"Totally love this product!!! Purchased the triangle shade sail while in Australia.

It does a great job of blocking the sun and still letting the air circulate in your space. Only advice I could give is to install it as tight as possible with the turnbuckles opened as far as possible. After several weeks of sun and rain the sail seems like it stretched out a bit. If you start with the turnbuckles fully opened then it is easy to tighten up the shade.I would recommend this product highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gimme shade","review":"We needed shade on our west facing deck after our gazebo blew away.

We used it for a small business and it was a pain in the neck. It wasn't easy to use like TurboTax. One example: Our business didn't require one of their forms to be filled out...because of that form being blank, it wouldn't let us continue. Therefore, we ended up printing out what we had, filled it out by hand and then we got our money back. Oh, and the local H&R Block was not willing to help us even though their product wasn't working right. Next year, we use Turbo Tax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only software that makes TurboTax look good","review":"For several years up to 2002, I used TurboTax from Intuit - both the business and personal editions. Using TurboTax has been a pretty sucky semi-manual process that I've never been happy with. Believing some erroneous reviews (thanks for nothing Walt Mossberg from the WSJ), I vented my frustration by using TaxCut this year. It is horrific. It probably would have been easier to do my business returns by hand (even with having to look up calculations for depreciation). The other reviews cover most of the probs: it starts with trying to update the program and having it crash, continues through worksheets where you have to manually enter info that has already been entered elsewhere and a completely unintegrated (nonexistent?) help system, and ends where I had to go to the IRS and CA FTB sites to find the addresses to mail the reurns to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I bought Tax Cut Platinum Business version. The help system is really lousy. Very skimpy. The interface is not intuitive. And worst of all, fter spending 20 minutes figuring it out and filling in the information (without much help), the software failed with a \\"runtime error\\" message.I assumed it was some sort of fluke, so I rebooted and tried it again. About 25 minutes into typing my information, I got another \\"runtime error\\" message and my computer froze up. I then went out and bought Turbo Tax Business Edition; I cost more, but it was very nice.

However, in the end, only three of the authors are from South America.Perhaps I'd hoped for a more activist approach, or at least, a ground-based examination of current environmental practices and potential strategies.

Nevertheless, based on the contrived and banal nature of \\"Lock-Sport-Krock\\" Nikola Sarcevic planned to cash in on the marketability of the name he's created for himself through his successful Swedish Punk Rock outfit. Mr. Sarcevic seems to have forgotten one thing; copying lines from his diary he kept as a middle schooler and passing them off as lyrics is not going to earn him any dignity among the critics.

This is what is so charming about this book - the sheer delight of finding a bear and seeing what it is doing - is it eating cake? Climbing a tree? Falling asleep?

Stan, your playing is as astonishing as ever but I can't get past the annoying organ. Organists have multiple keyboards and sounds and electronic effects. Please tell me why all organists always sound the same - every note, every chord, every song, every player. All I can think of when hearing \\"jazz\\" organ is my home-town roller rink.

Think a bit on the John Lennon song, \\"God,\\" written as the Beatles were breaking up. Even the Beatles -- who shared a love and inspiration most of us will never know -- could not hold it together. Like several other avatars through history, they gave those who were there an experience of the eternal and then shattered from the pressure of the demands made upon them. The thick apostles then ruin it. All they could leave us is the music -- lyrics and melody together than synergistically capture a certain energy -- but it's only a small taste of what they offered and what they meant. Mr. Lange's presentation demeans that experience -- he took his preconceived self-help template and squeezed Beatles lyrics and quotations into it.

Examples: 1)It drags a mistake in my address intput from screen to screen even after I corrected it in the address input form. 2) I had to use Google to find the latest update on the H&R;' website. 3) It bugged me with request to input the SSN for my \\"second child\\" (while I indicated that I have only one).

I remember turbotax providing so much more help whenever there was a term I didn't understand. This software only includes the IRS instructions and many links to call a tax advisor for explanations. The second problem is the user interface. It was NOT TESTED. There were screens in which the text wasn't completely clear (covered by other text and not scrollable). This is completely unacceptable and I will be buying Turbotax to redo my girlfriends taxes and begin mine.

Unfortunately, I've so far spent two hours trying to convince the software that I do NOT owe $$$ in ATM (an apparent problem with their worksheet). The software also missed the Capital Loss carry over. A little poking around and I discovered that I was required to enter last year's data in order for it to know this. Guess they could have included that in the \\"interview\\" . It also turns out they they have made no provisions for self employed health insurance deductions. They have the worksheet, it's just not tied into the 1040 form. And once you make an override to any form, TaxCut will not allow you to E-File your return to the IRS.

The handle is plastic, not metal. The top cup is plastic. Not metal. It can't be washed in a dish washer. Which for a supposed rugged vacuum bottle is odd.

Throughout the series there are somewhat vague references to Wolfe's life before coming to the U.S. This novel fills in much of that back-story, and gives the avid fan a better idea of what makes Wolfe tick. However, I would have to agree with reviewers who don't recommend this book to someone new to the series. It is not consistent with the rest of the novels in the series in setting or tone, and is best enjoyed by those who appreciate the difference, as well as the additional insights into Wolfe's character and background."},{"rating":"1","title":"Away from the comforts of home, Nero not quite as interesting","review":"It takes the murder of his closest friend to get Wolfe up; not only out of his chair but out of the country.

The reversal of Archie's role is incredibly ineffective and this one once again proves that Wolfe is best behind his desk."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Wolfe","review":"I'm an avid Wolfe fan, but this sucked. Even though Stout dashed off a few that were marginal, there was always an impossible mystery to be solved and the conflict between the rascal Archie and the egotistical Wolfe to keep it lively, while Stout worked the old formula. There was none of that here. This was a revenge plot that he tried to make happen with his familiar, decidedly non-vengeful, characters. And he sends them to Italy and Montenegro, but gives no evidence of even having bothered to look those countries up in an encyclopedia to give us some description of the foreign locales. Bad as this is, it's not as bad as \\"Under the Andes\\" (a non-Nero Wolfe tome) in that it's much shorter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wolfe's Silly Season","review":"Don't bother unless you've read all the good ones. Wolfe goes to his homeland (Montenegro) on a ridiculous mission.

In this story, even more than usual has to be thrown out the window.That Nero would be loyal to Marko Vukcic is understandable. That he would personally endure the events of this book is a lot less easy to swallow.It's almost hard to read (or listen to) this one. While you appreciate Wolfe's passion and commitment, the setpieces Rex creates for him are beyond Wolfe's described capabilities.So, OK, even if you accept these sudden shifts, you then have to cope with a really hackneyed plot and very contrived and stereotypical situations \\"behind the iron curtain.\\" If you wanted that, you could read John LeCarre and get much better writing.Skip it.

Nearly half of the book is calc 2-3 + diff eq. This book is really just an engineering book, your learn how to plug numbers in and get your answer.

While most of the text has not been quite as badly garbled, they layout (it is not visually apparent where one chapter or section begins or ends, what is a chapter heading vs example text, etc), makes it impossible to locate specific information and very difficult to read.If you want this book, spend the extra money buying an edition upon which a modicum of editorial effort has been exercised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gayle Donham","review":"The best all purpose glue on the market.

A very seamless operation, indeed.To those who are skittish about switching to Tax Cut (i.e. afraid of change or the unknown) let me assure you, Tax Cut works just as well as Turbo Tax, but without the added problems of installation and operation. I say this, as a former Turbo Tax user from way back when it was part of Parsons Technology.I give Tax Cut a big Five Stars! And the Turbo Tax people need to take notice here.

It then wouldn't allow me to log on to check on my re-submitted return. Live technical support was worthless, as they will not acknowledge or correct this major software error. I have used Turbo Tax for the previous several years without a glitch, and even saved money by using it. I didn't care for the spyware they have installed, and thus didn't use it this year.

I suppose Symantec's idea was to annoy people using the product to Ghost multiple machines into buying the Enterprise version.

This book might not stand the test of time today.. for it is often thought of as overly romantic, and out of touch with the tone of the day.But, if you're 16, or 96, and you want to revel in the lost pleasures of youth, then you will want to read this again, or for the first time.So, sit back, forget you're in the 1990's and read a bit of romantic fiction.. from an exceedingly tall author who wrote standing up, using the refrigerator top as his desk."},{"rating":"1","title":"It may be a Southern classic, but I'm crossing it off my list","review":"Sadly, I don't get what the big deal is about this novel. It is boring and plodding and pointless. It just goes on and on and on, and I kept asking myself, \`What's the point?' I kept waiting to be wowed, and instead I found myself wishing I'd never begun reading it.Quite honestly, I think Wolfe is overrated. He's nowhere close to being a Hemingway or a Faulkner. The entire novel is just a bunch of nothing, really. There's no substance to the \\"story\\" at all. In a way, he reminds me of Stephenie Meyer. She can't write either, and she takes forever to get to the point too.I've finished it and I'm still not sure what the \\"story\\" was about. It just seemed like this rambling mess with no plot. The only thing I know for certain is that the entire Gant family was crazy. That's about the only thing I got out of Look Homeward, Angel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Howeard, Angel","review":"So far I can't seem to get into it. The initial guy seems odd to me, Oliver, though I keep waiting and maybe the theme isn't so much him as what he goes through. He just seems to lack much smarts or wisdom as I see it. Then he wonders why life is beating him up? He definitely needs a strong woman to keep him in line and maybe I should feel sorry for him. I'll stick it out though I am reading it nightly and maybe it will turn around.......ask me about 3 weeks from now I may have to eat my words. My brother highly recommended it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look Homeward, Angel","review":"A well written and interesting book.

Wolfe can be a little boring so one must be in the right mood, but I'm glad that I have this in my library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ma & Pa Kettle meet Walt Whitman","review":"There is some undeniably fabulous writing in this book...the opening sequence had me in love and I anxiously looked forward to the rest, but instead it lead to an overworked tedium of mundane antics punctuated by moments of brillance. It seems to me he would have been more effective in getting to the heart of the American experience in poetry rather than novel. And more concise too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Homeward Angel","review":"While I am thoroughly enjoying the book, this particular edition is awful!!! I don't know who if anyone edited this, but the rules of word division are totally ignored. Words just go to the end of the page and continue on the next line. As for paragraphs, they, too, follow no known rules. All of this, makes this edition very difficult and frustrating to read. I highly recommend buying the more expensive edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I could not read the book. The product was defective and it could not be read, it would not line up on the page correctly. When speaking with someone at Kindle they told me they were not able to fix the problem and would have to send it back to the book company. I was sorry because I really wanted to read Look Homeward Angel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Read","review":"I realize a number of reviewers think this is a great book. Not me. Compared to real literature, it is boringly repetitive with endless trite descriptions of EVERTHING. I read that Wolfe was enormously proud of his ability to write pages a day. Well, if one used every possible adjective to describe EVERYTHING I could certainly do the same. Writing quantity is easy; writing QUALITY is another matter entirely. Dickens, Thackery, Austen, Bronte, Capote are all far better writers and address much the same subject. If you insist on wasting time reading it, at least borrow it from the library...don't through your money away buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and dull","review":"This is a book about Wolfe's boring southern life. It's cliche to the extreme: \\"romantic\\" young man goes to university, laments the fact that he is so much more intelligent than others, wishes people could understand him, returns home and looks down on everybody there. Unfortunately Wolfe is not close to being intelligent or interesting (and he certainly is not a genius as he himself said!). Wolfe obviously thinks that everything that has happened in his life will be of interest to the reader, after all he holds himself to be a genius, but one immediately sees how self-important he is, and how seriously he takes his ridiculous outlook. This is a nostalgic book; if you want to read a nostalgic book, read some Proust or Nabokov, who both soar above Wolfe, and let Wolfe be forgotten as he soon will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype - A Dull Read","review":"Of all the supposed American \\"classics\\" I've read, this is the dullest of the lot, and, given the overtly racist observations, a poor suggestion for young readers. While the characterization of the family is unparalleled, the book, at 500 pages, is about 200 pages too long, and Wolfe takes way too many liberties with his flowery anglophile prose, repeating ad nauseum the same pithy poetic quotes. The book also serves as a painful reminder of our not-so-distant past, with numerous insulting racist commentaries regarding African-American and Jewish peoples. As a slice of history, and a gripping family portrait, this book is worth a read, but in pure story-telling talent and artistry, Wolfe pales in comparison to the other writers of the era (Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Faulkner). Thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Someone from my book club selected this as their recent choice. Out of 8 people not one person liked the book. We found the writing to be tedious as well as pompous and the storyline to be dull. Our interest was not sparked and most of us quit before we finished. Life is too short to read bad books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Homeward Angel","review":"I was keen to read this novel, as it inspired many authors, including Pat Conroy...It was written many years ago, the author deceased in 1938....However the writing is inspiring and will stay in my memory as a special novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crude, undisciplined subject AND style","review":"This book is so hard to read and so many parts are incomprehensible that to give it one star is a gift. Its only saving grace is the way it conjures up late 19th and early 20th century America, with all it's charlatans, hucksters, get-rich schemes, and its often cheap and crude quality of life. It helps you understand why Charles Dickens hated America! But Wolfe has an undisciplined, crude style (matching his subject) that is painful to read. I swear he's made up many of the words, and one can't decipher them from the context. My book club read it, and not one of the nine attendees read more than 300 pages of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Guys, I'd Have to Disagree","review":"I rarely stop reading a book in the middle of it, but I couldn't take any more of Look Homeward, Angel after Part I (about 1/3 of the way through). It was long, rambling, and most of the passages did not add anything to the story, not even in the way of atmosphere. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original textual notes have been carefully revised .","review":"This volume in its first publication in 1874 was an invaluable compendium of information that bridged the gap between the ancient world of the first century and the modern era. The 75 full-color photos and illustrations plus the carefully revised and updated textual notes have only added to this value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting details","review":"The book 'The Temple' offers interesting details of Herod's Temple in Jerusalem...This is important because it would have been the temple that Jesus, his disciples and Jews in general saw and related to, and It was this temple that was destroyed by Titus in 70 C.E.I do have a couple of issues with some of the descriptions of various sacrifices and temple services. The way Mr. Edersheim and Bimson wrote and edited the book often makes it hard to really understand what is being done and why...but if you have OTHER references books to fall back on when you hit one of these little snares this book is worth adding to your collection of reference works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed with the detail and research","review":"This is a classic work done from research with opinions called out and expressed. I appreciated the scholarship and research of the author, his knowledge and opinions are well laid out and the clarity between the two is refreshing, compared to much of the recent works published (where opinion is put forth as fact).I recommend this book if you are interested in the blending of the Jewish traditions with and into a disciplined worship of Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, Love it, Love it!","review":"The pictures are amazing, the detail descriptions of all of the things are awesome. I LOVE this book. It makes it fun to read about the old testament!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not recommend","review":"I bought a whole block of these \\"silverpoint\\" wustoff knives thinking I would be getting a fairly decent knife considering their reputation even though it was their lower end. My husband and I are very disappointed. The knives are thin, flimsy and bendy...not good when you need to cut a very crusty slice of bread or anything else a little tougher. They aren't as sharp as I was expecting either. I would have been better buying a cheaper brand with a thicker, more solid metal part. I guess if you're going to go for Wustoff...go for their expensive knives, because in their case, you get what you pay for...and less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many years with Wusthof Trident","review":"I own most of the line of knives made by the company. This set is nice, but the large bread knife is not terribly good at cutting (surprise!) bread. Now, the smaller knife is my very favorite, constantly used knife. I had used the tomato knife regularly before (with multiple cuts to prove it), but this little one cuts anything you give it (it just sliced raw beef into dandy cubes) and is maintainance free. Can't get better than that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wusthof bread knives good purchase","review":"Received the knives very quickly. I was very happy with the price as I was planning on purchasing them at the regular price anyway when I found them on sale costing about a third (of the normal price). We have made good use of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"A bit Poison Ivy, but with more subtle realism and less structured suspense. It's unique in that most scenes aren't just focussed on what's happening to one character. No one is just a supporting character, they all have multiple stages of character development. Dot reminds me so much of the character Allison from The Breakfast Club that this movie could almost be taken as her backstory. If you wanted to be completely stupid about it. Which I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I went to see this in the theaters because Elisha Cuthbert is HOT! Sadly, this movie was anything but. What could have been a taut erotic thriller or even a serious look at a rather dark side of humanity just wound up being dreck. Probably the only thing that could have redeemed this movie would have been Elisha Cuthbert's 'other father' and Edie Falco's 'other husband' lock the movie's dad in a room and 'show' him the error of his ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"There is a family of three - a mother, father and a daughter. They adopt a deaf girl who has just lost her father. The deaf girl is struggling to mix in at the high school and with her new family. The family is dysfunctional and not even one character in this movie was likeable. The mother is an alcoholic, and a pill popper, the father sexually abuses his daughter and the daughter is following in her mother's footsteps and experimenting with drugs. Some issues are covered such as how life would be for a deaf person, and incest. The acting is ok, the storyline is average and the movie goes at a slow pace. Overall it was a pretty boring movie and I didn't walk away with anything. I forgot all of the characters names after the movie was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stinker!","review":"This movie was so obviously a stinker. Hey guys, were we watching the same movie?? Between the virtually non-existent plot to the incredibly poor acting this movie just never got off the ground for me. Like some of the other reviewers, I was attracted to the movie because of Elisha Cuthbert who is stunning and can act (I loved her work in the 24 series) However, even her dialogue is purile in this bomb. While these themes could have been the basis for an interesting movie, it fails in almost every respect. I am being generous with the one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"NY Times Expert Melvin Gold","review":"This movie was so bad that the dialoge was actually comical. I can not believe that the filmmakers can make an honest living taking money from the people who pay their hard earned money to hope to get a chance to see their favorite actresses and actors in such a bad movie. Save your money and watch something that is a true work of art instead of some junk put out to capitalize on the names of the performers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punked, but still enjoyed the flick. Tense, slightly erotic. Psychological thriller.","review":"Ok, I was suckered by the previews and the cover. I thought (or hoped) this would be sort of a step daughter gets freaky kinda movie. Perverted, yeah, but...wait till you learn more about the family!I became caught up in this film, despite my original expectations not being fulfilled. Ironically, I came to care about the characters, and rooted for closure. This movie is difficult to review without giving the good stuff away, but if you can set aside your preconceived notions and roll with the story you are in for a wild ride.Even the slow scenes are full of tension, and I consider this to be a Psychological thriller. This movie is full of teenage motifs, family psychoses, action, and revelations that unfold into a great climax."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one doesn't 'cut it'","review":"The cutter looks like it should do a good job, but when in use it falls short in many areas.- cutting edge catches at the top and you have to pull the handle to the right to free from the catch, then return the handle into the base to continue the cut- it cuts crooked on all but the thinnest papers- the cutting edge does not handle even slightly thick paper such as glossy photo paper stock thickness. It pushes the paper instead of cutting it- the cutting arm pivot mechanism is not smooth and it has halting movement as you lower the armSave your money and buy a commercial grade cutter. If I find one that works, I'll edit this review with the model I bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really love this trimmer","review":"I'm really happy with this trimmer. I cut out a lot of paper products and have always used rotary blade trimmers but when my last broke I purchased this one and love it. I get much cleaner cuts than the rotary trimmers and they are more precise. The blade really does cut through the cardstock like butter. The plastic guide is useless to me - it slips off easy and just isn't that helpful so I just removed it. You still have to be careful to hold the paper down tight as you trim or else the paper will slip. I cut 100 lb cardstock and can cut two sheets at a time. Overall, I'm super happy with this trimmer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark of the Gods","review":"This collecton of books, the first being \\"God Stalk\\"was written/published in 1982. Having missed this author the first time around, I found the volume compelling,imaginative, and fun. However the last book in the 600 page plus series \\"Dark of the Moon\\" was choppy and not as coherent. P.C.

It was five years later when I finally found the first book \\"God Stalk\\" and I loved it more than the sequal. In the quest for her books over the years I've annoyed bookstores, dealers (who sell out as fast as they get them), various publishers and some poor woman in N.Dakota I woke up at 6 am whose unfortunate number was mistakenly given to me as a source for Hodgells books. I never been able to find even a used copy of \\"Seeker's Mask\\" on the internet. If you need any proof of how good Hodgell's books are just try to get someone to part with one! So read it!

The pieces are designed by the composer as if they are not concerts for piano and orchestra, but symphonic works for orchestra and piano. I regret buying this CD.

Not long ago I saw \\"Getting Employees to Fall in Love With Your Company\\" between bookends atop the credenza in a friend's office, who also sang its praises.I look forward to Dr. Harris's next book.

Great sound quality for recording and just listening to music and movies on my laptop. They keep out a decent amount of noise. i watched movies on laptop while the other half of my house was being remodeled and I was not bothered by the racket. I find them very comfortable, however after a long time I notice they feel a little heavy, they squeeze a bit to keep out the noise so after an hour or so they start to push on your ears. They are not completely around your ear, they squish them a little bit. But the sound quality outweighs the anything bad. I would buy them again in an instant for even more.The Range is great and the quality remains at high volume. I use them when practicing my electric guitar and it sounds amazing. Great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional sound quality.","review":"These headphones provide a mix of sound clarity and moderate bass. If you are looking for headphones with heavy bass, this one isn't it. It has clear bass but not over the top. Aside from that the sound is rich and the quality is fantastic. When it comes to comfort, these headphones are a little above average. After a couple of hours of use, they get a little tight on the ears. The cons for these headphones are easily forgotten once you turn up the volume and enjoy professional sound. I strongly recommend these headphones for aspiring d j's as well as pro's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but flimsy","review":"I liked these, but stored them in a camera bag that received scant abuse.

For example, in describing Calhoun's indebtedness to the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798, Niven says that neither document contemplated action by an individual state. To correct this impression, one need only consult Jefferson's draft of the Kentucky Resolutions; how anyone who had even read this five-page document could see it as anything other than a threat to interfere with enforcement of the Alien and Sedition Acts within the boundaries of Kentucky is beyond me. The book is full of similiar evidence of Niven's failure to acquaint himself with even the most basic sources.

The author traces the history of the regiment from its pre-war militia roots, to its founding in 1862, and to its assignment to the VI Corps. The book offers a good summary of the goings-on of August-December 1863, a period that is often overlooked, and of the battle of Salem Church, during the Chancellorsville Campaign. The work gives the Civil War reader what (s)he is generally seeking: regimental monographs that offer specificity and primary source material without too much modern day prostelizing. Thanks for the book, Hr.

Despite the age of the recordings, Arc Music has remastered these so that you are hearing Griot traditional music and not some dim field sampling of this great musical tradition.

Listenable, yet of historical value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still in Competition","review":"When Deben Bhattarcharya made these field recordings back in 1978, I doubt if there was any music from Mauritania available in the West. Now there are quite a few discs to buy, some of them studio recordings of excellent vocalists or groups. I am pleased to report that this cd holds up very well against the competition, not only in terms of artistic appeal, but of sound quality. It is always a pleasure to hear the distinctive and alluring style of Mauritanian music, and to compare versions of the same song from now and then.

The book rambles on quite a bit and has an extremely different tone than something like Illusions. Still made you think a few times, but I definitely didn't feel at all enlightened when reading it.

I recommend these knives to everyone I know who enjoys cooking even the least bit and I feel it's better to have a few well-selected quality knives than one of those \\"sets\\" of cheapies (most of which are filled with blade styles you'll never use anyway)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied customer","review":"I bought the apron to hold teacher items (scissors, hole punch, pencils, etc.) to save me steps as I walked around the room.

It often did not enter my corrections, crashed repeatedly, and left me with the feeling that I have no confidence in its accuracy. Final insult is that it would not print properly.

It includes easy navigation to return to sections of your return not yet completed. TaxCut is better than the popular TurboTax since TaxCut doesn't install resource-wasting spyware and because TaxCut is cheaper. My one complaint is that TaxCut prompts you to \\"update\\" the software before u file the return. This is a mjor problem if your internet connection is 56k dial-up since the update is 14MB.

Also, I had to be sure to delete any forms I decided not to use on review - answering No to use the form during the interview will not erase answers previously entered. TaxCut really let me down. The only positive thing I can say is that it did import my TurboTax information and as a whole ran well on XP.

Moreover, the tech support is not provided through a toll-free number. When I sent my questions through e-mail, the feedback that I got was just to uninstall and reinstall the application. It was not even for my specific questions.Furthermore, the software was not user-friendly when I intended to revise~~~~ information that I had inputted previously.

This was a mistake. The TaxCut software is simply unable to cope with a home network and with a proxy server and a firewall. I had to perform updates manually by going to the TaxCut website, and when I had successfully finished my return, I simply could not e-file and had to file the slow and old-fashioned way -- with a paper return.

What a mistake!! I've spent more time fixing the errors that this program created than all of the time that I've spent doing taxes using Turbo Tax in the last several years. It does not bring over all of the information when you import from last year's return. If you uncheck a question, it does not automatically uncheck the rest of the items that are related to the question. It does not give you all of the correct options that the forms have. If I had not been familiar with doing taxes and had no idea what my end result would be, I would have paid $$$ in taxes instead of getting the $$$$ refund that I was supposed to receive. The software is faulty and there are too many glitches in the program.

Let me preface my review by saying that I have an IT background. I had trouble navigating through the steps and ensuring all the appropriate steps had been completed (when I actually filed, many checkboxes were still blank on the outline of steps to complete, but we felt confident the ones that were still blank did not apply - nevertheless it was very disconcerting). Navigation was also difficult when trying to find a specific form and the questions that populated that form.At one point, I found myself in an infinite loop & multiple copies of the same form were being developed. I called technical support (a number they make it very hard to find) & did get to speak with someone who helped me resolve the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better hope you don't need tech support!","review":"TaxCut provides support via a long-distance number (Dallas, TX) not an 800 number.

I wanted to return this for a refund, you'll also find they make that difficult.On a side note, if you were leaving TurboTax because of the spyware/spam associated with it, TaxCut may not be a good choice either.

My only complaint is that it is not straight forward to go back and make changes to sections that you have completed -- it can be quite confusing. I will pay for it again this year, but you would think that software used by this many people would have more than two competitors.

After I installed Norton Internet Security 2002, none of my computer could access the files on the server or see each other. I called support, and the only way each computer could share files was to take off all the security settings. This defeats one of the purpose of the software- internet security.

I'm a software engineer with 20 years of programming experience and am often asked by my friends for computer help. This is by far the worst experience I've had to deal with. Removing viruses and adware is easier than attempting to remove Norton Internet Security (NIS). I've wasted more time with NIS than I have with adware for the past 12 months!

(Improves the bottom line, you know!)

Unacceptable performance when the primary reason for buying the software was to protect children from inappropriate content. The only thing worse than the software is the technical support.

But best of all, they come apart and go back together with extreme ease, yet stay together for use. Contrary to the description, it is not necessary to use the cap and screw to get them apart.

I bought them because of percieved quality of the Wusthof name, and the near 5-star reviews on Amazon. I really don't know how people can write about cutting apart a chicken with these things. The steel has way too much flex, making them lousy performers and dangerous during heavy tasks. In fact coming apart is pretty much the only thing they do well. Mine did not come especially sharp, and what meagre edge they had they sure didn't hold. There also seem to be some quality control issues with the hinge. After a year or two of moderate use mine became much too loose and developed a noticeable wobble, making them more prone to come apart when I don't want them to. These are the kind of cheap shears Wusthof adds as filler to their block sets that people get as wedding gifts. They are not adequate kitchen shears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice to Look at","review":"I just received these scissors. They are of high quality and made in Germany. There's only one problem.

It was highly recommended, and that was the reason I purchased it. Over time, there has been occasion to look up movies for background, obscure actors, etc. This book is a poor guide for movies. Many of the movies I looked up (Waterhole # 3 Comes to mind) was not even listed. The actor (James Colburn - star of Waterhole # 3) was not listed either. One of my favorite movies was \\"trashed\\" (The Sound of Music). This book reeks of elitism. This appears to make judgements on the reader based on a belittlement of their likes and dislikes. If I had a bird, I wouldn't tear this apart to line the bottom of the cage. Other than that, it has a style, just not MY style."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Time Out\\" strikes out!","review":"Many folks rate this above Maltin's m0vie guide. Why? It has an overall tone of snotty, over-intellectualized condescension that grates on the nerves. Plus, it delights in reviewing obscure, third-world flicks no-one's heard of, nor would want to see. It doesn't have a rating system, doesn't show availability in any format, doesn't show MPAA ratings, nor does it tell you where films are available for purchase or rent. In contrast, Maltin supplies all of these. Even if you don't always agree with his evaluations, in all, he provides much better info for decision-making."},{"rating":"1","title":"these get rusty","review":"I am long time wustof user and have many sets of these. bought these and several cheaper sets. these are great knives but 3 times the cost of cheaper sets. nothing wrong with the knives but I now know what I pay for brand name.After washing these in dishwasher several times, I am getting rust on these knives. Since they are stainless, this amazed me. I found you have to prewash to get all the grease off or you will get rust. because of this I had to drop the rating to 1 star. Interestingly I have another full set of wustof on my butcher block. they do not get rusty so I think the metal quality in these cannot be as good as their other knifeware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gourmet knives are stamped blades","review":"In reading the comments on these knives I noticed that there was a different type of metal in the Gourmet vs the Classic. I checked my knives and then contacted a friend of mine that is into knives. He said that Molybdenum is put into the steel for forging purposes only thus it has no effect on the sharpness or finish. Because Gourmet is a stamped knife it does not require this type of material. I have the knives and they are great. They are not the quality of the Classic but they don't carry that price either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product for the money","review":"You get what you pay for. I have a growing collection of Wusthof knives, all of which are forged, one piece blades; but; I so rarely use steak knives, so I decided to purchase this set. They may be made of \\"stamped\\" steel, but as with all Wusthof products the quality is outstanding. They come razor-sharp and I have not used them enough to need to touch them up on my whetstone.

Used them when they arrived and found out they were not cutting steak very well.After looking at them closely, I noticed they did not have a good edge. I used my steel and brought the edge back up.

I would not recommend these to any one."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWesome!!!","review":"When I wanted to purchase new steak knives, I felt that I needed the serrated-edged style, thinking they would be the best in cuting through meat. In my house, items must be versatile. A professional chef will cringe as I admit that in the past my children have used our steak knives for cutting apple slices one-by-one while sitting and doing homework or watching the tele. These were put to the same test. So when these arrived, I had to give them a lesson on how to use these knives appropriately and I attached a warning. SHARP!!! Sharper than the serrated knives we'd all been using previously. So far no casualties. I love them so much that I use these knives for slicing and cutting everything! Great knives are a must in any kitchen. These are versatile enough to use them as a parry knife and although we do not have steak every night, they are earning their price tag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these knives","review":"We ordered these as a set of 4.

I checked it using several movies: Monsters Inc. (which looked incredible), but films like Forrest Gump, Sweet Home Alabama, The Matrix, and Fellowship of the Ring looked so bad compared to my Toshiba SD-4700, I had to take the Sony back. The picture looked overprocessed with noticeable artifacts to the point I couldn't even watch it. Especially tried the lobby scene in the Matrix - all the marble made a dizzying effect of inaccuracies on the screen. I really liked the player overall, and the video mode looked great, but film mode was just too bad to bear. I'm going to try the Toshiba SD-3900 next, which should be comparable to my 4700.

For awhile tapping the case a few times causes the player to work again, but once the grinding noises start, it's downhill until the player fails completely.Maybe Sony high-end players are more reliable (I wouldn't know) but the low-end players are a RIP-OFF.

I noticed it alot on \\"The Shield - Seasons 1 and 2\\" and on DVDs burned from Tivo content.I know its not a bad player because I have 2 of these each bought at different times and they both have this exact same problem. I have a feeling that it has a hard time with interlaced content, since all hollywood movies (film, 24fps) plays just perfect.I could not find any settings on the player to help alleviate the problem. I am using the S-Video output. I have since switched to the new Philips 642 and this DVD player plays everything great, even divx discs.NOTE: The flicker I mentioned was caused by an incorrect setting.

The bad part is the service. Sony says my product qualified for its \\"replacement\\"program, rather than repair, under the warranty.

While this series was on, my colleagues would discuss the show the morning after at work.

So while the Concerto may seem not quite a concerto, the clusters, open spaces, punctuations, prepared piano sounds do indeed showcase the performers concerto-style. The composition also achieves a sense of motionless that is kin to Satie. The Suite for Toy Piano makes an even stronger connection to the Sage of Arceuil.This is a superb collection. Margaret Leng Tang brings just the right combination of committment, detachment & wit to the music. Dennis Russell Davies stays out of the way as much as he can, allowing whatever happens next to happen next. The players are enjoying themselves - Cage's scores are realized well only when everyone cooperates and has a good time.

After receiving ours and trying it out, we found that the exterior immediately heats up beyond what is comfortable to touch and leaves you with cold coffee within 2 hours. At first I thought we got unlucky and that we should try getting another one, but after reading reviews I have noticed that these thermoses aren't what they used to be.It seems when Aladdin Stanley was sold and manufacturing went to China that quality control really took a dive.

During these two days, all I have been doing is pouring hot water into it and keeping the bottle in my bedroom, since I've been down with some sore throat. No rough use, even remotely.

It still fit into the top of the stanley lunch box he uses. He prepares it just as the old one - pour boiling water in it and let it sit awhile before dumping it and pouring in his coffee. The old one honest to god would keep coffee hot 24 hrs. This new one only keeps coffee hot for about 2 hrs. I didn't realize Amazon had such a short window to return things.

It has never been dropped, dinged or used in any unusual manner. The customer service rep said \\"lifetime\\" is not the customer's lifetime but the product's lifetime and their policy is that older products are not covered since their lifetime has expired.

As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI, the people that bought Aladdin, really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place, but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty, I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last.

I then learned Stanley thermos are warranted for life, and went to the distributor in my country (Uruguay). I must say they behaved like gentlemen and exchanged my defective unit. No questions asked. But...the second bottle...is more or less the same. So, I bought a THERMOS floating bottle. No problem. It keeps beverages very hot FOR WAY MORE THAN 24 HOURS.

Now three years past, I think I have enough experience with this item for a review.First, it does not do a good job on keeping water warm long enough. This is due to its design. It has a steel inner shell, which itself is highly heat conducive. You can clearly feel the \\"mouth part\\" of the item hot or warm. This rapidly dissipates heat.Second, its build quality of low.

The songs all have a unique perspective on each's respective subject. A few previous reviewers have called this album preachy, and have given one star reviews based on that fact. The last thing on my mind when I hear lines like \\"Does my life suck as bad as yours?\\" is preachiness. The truth is, they can't stand bands that use words or phrases like \\"Jesus\\" or \\"Word of God\\", and they really hate anti-abortion songs. The lyrics obviously come from the heart and thus are not meant to be preachy; they are simply the writer's deepest thoughts on a particular subject. That's how great artists make great art, by putting their struggles and emotions into their work. But I guess that's only allowed if religion is left out.

The artwork is the best thing on the album.It sounds like they recorded this album in seperate studios, not even listening to what the other member was playing, and then tried to make it fit together. It just didn't work at all. I was a fan of Derek when he was inDream Theater, so I had high expectations from him here. I can see why they got rid of him for Jordan. His solos sound drunk and everything else sounds like synth from a casio.I hope their other albums are better than this. From the samples I heard on Amazon they don't sound any different.

This is book has no plot, and it is very confusing. It is confusing, because the settings change rapidly, so it is hard to know what i going on. Also, the tenses change from present to past in each chapter! This book really only has one main character, and that is Mr. Chips. He has the most boring life. The book tells about Mr. Chips's life as a teacher at a place called Brookfield. Brookfield is in England. If I were you, the reader, I would not take the time to read this book, unless you want to have a short book with pictures in it.

As a fervid fan of all Weezer had done previous to Maladroit, I stopped listening to Maladroit after the first time I heard it, and I refused to discuss the album with friends. Unused to its sound, I chose instead to remain in my adored world of Blue and Green and, of course, Pinkerton. However, I by chance slipped Maladroit in my CD player three months later. And I fell immediately in love with Weezer all over again! The powerful guitar riffs of Maladroit are consistently much stronger than they have been in albums past, and the lyrics continue in the style so characteristic of Weezer, expressive and ungarnished. A CD for all moods, Maladroit is an absolute must for anyone who thrives on the beatitude Weezer inspires!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Weezer","review":"Maladroit is a good CD in its own right, however, for a Weezer CD it's just not that great. The Weezer I know is the Weezer of the Blue Album and Pinkerton. Their new form of poppy punk powerchord rock is just not what I fell in love with so many years ago with the Blue album. I think most die hard weezer fans would agree with me in the fact that Weezer really isn't as awesome as they once were. This CD is good, but it's not my Weezer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Green","review":"Although I liked \\"The Green Album\\", This CD has much better songs.

It sounds like it, songwriting is a craft and this collection is severely lacking in any of that... He seems so intenet on erasing the memory of Pinkerton, that he's now creating garbage which sounds like all the other garbage out there. Weezer used to be special, not any more, not if this is the direction the group is intending to go... The guy has the right to make the music he wants, and I have no problem with seeing an artist experiement and grow, but this would be like John Lennon saying \\"No more Strawberry Fields, from now on I'm writing stuff like 'Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Bikini\\".

Songs like 'Death and Destruction' are ace, and different with some great arrangements of the drums and bass and guitars. And rivers voice seems more interessted now and more comfortable too.

It's the hardest stuff they have made and it is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Mix","review":"This album is a good mix of Weezer songs with familiar sounds. Dope Nose sounds like a song you would hear off of the Green Album, except much more powerful. Keep Fishin' is a track that could fit on Pinkerton well, and is one of the best tracks on the album, if not THE best. The song Love Explosion caught my attention, and it is definately a song that could fit on the Blue album. Most of these songs are catchy and unique, like most Weezer songs are. Basically, if you enjoyed all of the previous Weezer albums, then you will like this one. I can't help but be biased and give Maladroit 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's so nice.","review":"it's so nice to get something so great so soon after the release of the last one that wasn't really all that great. dont get me wrong, green was fine. solid. but, it wasn't even a half hour long and it all basically sounded the same. i'm the most die hard weezer fan there is, and i'll tell you that this is way up there. i love the whole thing. december is the worst song and even that one's great. if you haven't heard weezer, then download keep fishin' and love explosion and you should be set. slob and burndt jamb are mind blowing. another great release by my favorite band."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"The Green Album was a little disappointing, but still quite enjoyable. But I think Rivers Cuomo's ego has gone to his head, meaning that he thinks he can write any [song] he wants, put the Weezer sticker on it and say it's a masterpiece. I love listening to every song Weezer has ever put out (not counting Hash Pipe), but I don't think Maladroit has even one song that is anything special at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick of Being the Rock Geeks","review":"Weezers back, and check this...they're trying to be cool! No more geeky band pictures or crazy songs like Undone(the Sweater Song), although Rivers still has the glasses. This CD is a little different from other Weezer-its harder and tries to be a little more serious(although I'm not sure anyone can quite take Weezer seriously). But I love it. It's five minutes longer than their last disappointing Green Album, and I love all the songs on it. It has some tight guitar solos, and like all Weezer, its catchy. It has its cute funny songs(if you've heard Dope Nose...well) but also some sort of serious songs, and it has a good mix. It's a little harder, but it doesn't blast in your ears. In short, if you like Weezer, you like this. If you're not a Weezer fan...give this a chance, at least. Because I think it rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really 2 1/2 stars","review":"So Weezer releases there second album in a little over one year, and it's more of the same boring drivel. This album drones from one song to another, trying to be 80's heavy rock and then light and popy. But the album never chooses which way to go and so heavy guitar riffs are mixed with sappy harmony and lyric after lyric of being left alone. Had the album gone all heavy or all light and popy, it might have come out better. If you liked the green album, maybe you'll like this, but I was very disappoited. Weezer hasn't inspired me since the Pinkerton album; the lyrics, which are so essential to the songs, have became cliche and thoughtless. One interesting note however, this c.d. has 13 songs intead of the usual ten, and the lyrics have been printed in the liner notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weezer is unpredictable","review":"The 1st 3 songs are moderately good. The 4th song has an excellent guitar riff but is otherwise bad. The 5th song is of bad quality. The 6th song is entitled \\"SLOB\\" and is in my opinion is the best song on this album. The 7th song has another great guitar riff and O.K. lyrics. The only other decent songs are #10 \\"FALL TOGETHER\\" and #12 \\"LOVE EXPLOSION\\" which are almost reminiscent of classic =w=eezer. Overall this album suffers from bad song structure and is very insincere. Also, There is an overemphasis on heartbreak. Altogether there are only (in my opinion) 4 good songs on Maladroit. =w=eezer is a very talented band and have underachieved on Maladroit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weezer Is Gone","review":"I dont know what to say, all hope all weezer fans once had of another Pinkerton is gone, its perfectly clear that weezer has definetly abandoned the old days. Maladroit is a poppy MTV appealing record with meaningless lyrics. Its worse then the green album i cant honestly say i like one song on this album i'm sorry its horrible. It seems to me that Rivers is very confused after Pinkerton flopped his main focus was making an album that people liked but the ironny is that if u goto a weezer show the songs from The Blue Album and the songs from Pinkerton are the songs everyone loves and goes crazy to. I sincerely hope that weezer will go back to there old ways but all weezer fans know after two disasterous records that another Pinkerton will never happen, today is a sad day for all weezer fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rise and Fall of Weezer","review":"Weezer has long been one of my favorite bands next to Muse and Radiohead, each with their own unique and distinctive style. Weezer appealed to me through their distorted, yet soft guitars that allowed all the instrumentals to act as one. In their previous albums, they have taken the emo style and gave it a nice kick. In Maladroit however, they seem to have kicked it the wrong way.First of all, their gentle emo seems to have vanished, along with the creative lyrics thrown around with a catchy tune. Weezer diverts from emo into a realm of heavier distortion and louder guitars. Rivers doesn't present many catchy, funny, emotional, or thoughtful tunes, and weezer sounds like they're trying to become metal.I recommend that you take a look at blue or green if you want some classic weezer. =w="},{"rating":"2","title":"More Weezer","review":"After initially hearing the first three songs from Maladroit, I thought that Weezer was bringing their best to the table. Unfortunately the quality kind of sags in the middle of the line up. Weezer demonstrated similar weakness on previous releases, so inconsistency is my one and only criticism of one of the catchiest, energetic bands around.Once again, the production is top notch, and Weezer brings the ROCK more than ever before. This is easily one of the top ten releases of 2002 (a relatively weak year for music, I must say), so by all means, pick this up if you are a fan of Weezer, or power pop in general. While the first three tracks are worth the price of admission, there are some later tracks that sneak in and fully grab your attention as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four albums and still awesome!","review":"Maladroit, Weezer's fourth album. This is another great job. Once again, people will acuse it of sounding similar and poppy (if thats even a word). But i think it's Weezer. Whats that mean? It means its what we've come to expect. Some rock, with some softer songs thrown in to calm it down. If every song was as powerful as \\"Dope Nose\\", you'd come out with bleeding ears. This is as good as Green and Blue, and falls inches short of Pinkerton, which is a great accomplishment."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what I'm talking about","review":"After the near absolute travesty that was the Green Album, the boys of Weez show they still got what it takes. Unfortuneatly the songs are still not of the same caliber as the Blue Album or Pinkerton, but that's okay! Besides, those songs are probably still the best because we all had so long to listen to those 20 songs and only those 20 songs. Maladroit is definetly Weezer on the move: the first album with more than 10 songs, the first one without a color in the name, and an obvious maturing of style. And I'm all for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, garbage","review":"Disappointing, messy, sloppy, worthless. Sad, really. After Blue (which is just an incredible power pop record - it pretty much served as the soundtrack to my junior year of high school when it came out) and Pinkerton (which did the same for my freshman year of college), Green was a letdown. Maladroit has kicked me off the Weezer bandwagon for good. It's just a bad album all around. The songs are boring and uninspired - annoying at times. I guess I'll reminisce with the first two albums, and leave the latest two for the newer fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Any self respecting Weezer fan should be in outrage at this disk. Many recent reviews I have read talk largely of the green album, however the green album shows the downfall of a once great band. After hearing this album I can only believe that they are now deep into the downward spiral into the pit of Sell Outs. They once played from the heart now it feels as if they are only playing to the pocketbook. If you want another popularity contest winner go with this CD, if you want good music go try out Pinkerton and the Blue Album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Fishin","review":"I must state my opinion on this absolute filth. Here I am, listening to \`Keep fishin'\\" at this very moment. This is the one hang- nail throughtout Maladroit that actually reminds me of old times. Weezer lovers know the capability of Rivers Cuomos, and he has surpassed that standard on The blue album and Pinkerton. A lot of fans lost faith in Cuomos, and frankly, I don't blame them. Among the titles he was given, sellout was one of them. A sellout, he isn't. He is one of the most artistically vulnerable performers of our time. He isn't out there \\"making loads\\", maybe bad music, but he is doing what he does best; expressing himself through music. Among others, I miss old Rivers, those great riffs, perfectly articulated lyric, and the flame that was apparent within the first two records. Please everyone; give Weezer some credit for being a great band, and remember them for the great music they used to compose. We love you Weezer, or at least I do. I do not recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"!","review":"Maybe this album isnt weezer at their best, but this album has some great songs with some great lyrics. I recommend it for any weezer fan, but not if you are a first time listener."},{"rating":"1","title":"half good, half bad = 2 1/2 stars","review":"\\"i don't want to grow,even if it's good growth\\" - rivers cuomo, \\"too late to try\\"i like literally half the songs on this album, because half of them rock and half of them... wait, are the other half there? they might as well not be. this is really half an album, for which i paid full price.i love(d?) weezer, but it's obvious rivers is \\"missing something.\\" he doesn't want to open up, and it's hurting weezer's songs.i like this album more than a LOT of weezer fans, especially after the *complete* garbage which was weezer's green album, but i must not like maladroit too much, since i never listen to it. but i do like what weezer did on half of the songs, with the hard riffs and wild solos.. a lot of people think it's derivative of old metal bands, but i think it just rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"After a brief lull with the green album, weezer is back","review":"... Even though the green album wasn't exactly... up to par, they've returned to all their glory with this album, despite writing, recording, and producing it all in a year. Every single Weezer album is different, and yet they're all great. The blue album was very garage band-ish, while pinkerton was rough and raw, the green album was a little too overproduced but still kept a decent amount of integrity. But maladroit is probably the most diverse record by Weezer. It has everything from grungey KISS rock to sappy, yet musically amazing love songs to garage band punk. I don't know if Maladroit is as good as the blue album or pinkerton, but it certainly is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Geeks Go Heavy","review":"When I first bought Maladroit, I thought I'd get more of the same old-school, Britpop-friendly stuff I heard from the Green Album. That turned out to be total BS! Rivers Cuomo really lets go on this album with catchy riffs and sweet solos. \\"American Gigolo\\" is a great beginning track with a nice riff and lyrics that any girl-gettin guy can relate to. \\"Take Control\\" is somewhat lovey dovey but the solo really gets one going. \\"Burndt Jamb\\" is by far my fave track, with a catchy riff on the verses, simple lyrics, and a quiet-LOUD dynamic that screams Kurt Cobain. \\"Fall Together\\" has the best guitar solo on the album, while \\"Possibilities\\" is a great old-school take on sex. I recommend this album to any rock fan, especially Green Album fans and Nirvana junkies (like myself) who like to enjoy more optimistic music (hat doesn't sacrifice sound) as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maladroit","review":"In this album Weezer has changed their style quite a bit, with Rivers referring back to his Rock & Roll influences. There are many more guitar solos, they have diverted from their usual 10 song cd, the booklet contains lyrics, and Rivers is now sporting a beard. One thing that hasn't changed is River's passion for the music. Weezer is one of the only bands on the radio that still writes music from the heart. They are also one of the only bands on the radio whose lead singer doesn't try to sound like Eddie Vedder. While this album can't surpass the listenability of the blue album, the emotion of Pinkerton, or the simpleness of the green album, it will definetely go down as Weezer's most Rock & Roll album. And while Mr. Cuomo may not look just like Buddy Holly anymore he is still just as brilliant as he was when he started."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different...but o.k.","review":"The first time I listened to this album I didn't like it that much, and I have to admit that I still don't like all the songs. But I remember way back when I got Pinkerton, and that's how I felt with that album too. I think with some getting used to, this CD will grow on me. It's different, but all their albums are different......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weezer is back","review":"I hated the green album. It lacked feeling, humor, guitar solos, charm, and everything that makes weezer great. When I heard that they were releasing Maladroit so quickly, I figured I was in for more of them same, and I determined that I wouldn't buy it. Out of curiousity I downloaded a few live tracks. The first song was pretty good. As was the second, as was the third. Moments later i was driving to the record store. Maladroit finds Weezer back to doing what they do best. It's a pop-punk record with lots of arena-rock jokes, a loose feel, great guitar solos, and the requisite amounts of humor and quirkiness. The music is a lot like some of the Pinkerton stuff, and the lyrics seem less mindless than those on Green, although I've been too busy rocking out to notice. It gets four stars for not being quite as good as Blue or Pinkerton, but I am THRILLED that weezer is back. A great record for kicking off summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock is dead...Long live Weezer!","review":"I may be out of the typical demographic for Weezer, but I picked this up along w/ the \\"Green Album\\" and have been happily surprised. I knew the band was more than \\"Buddy Holly\\" & \\"Hash Pipe\\", but Maladroit really set me on my ear. They are able to take several different genres of music and combine bits and pieces in every song. There is no question that this will be on the obligatory end-of-the-year greatest album lists in every music rag, with \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\", and with good reason.This may not be their biggest commercial album, but with the current state of music, it is probably one of the best listens in a long time. Definitely in the heavy rotation for the summer.Standout tracks: \\"Slob\\", \\"Dope Nose\\", \\"Fall Together\\"I could add a slappy remark like, \\"Run! Don't walk to pick this up\\" but if you are reading this, chances are you are on your way."},{"rating":"1","title":"i didn't like it","review":"can't sing along because melodies are not memorable and drag on and have too many unrelated parts.the songs sound more like medlies than melodies.the songs are cluttered w/ different ideas and patterns that don't relate constantly pulling you out of the songs.in other words i couldn't get into this album.for example blue was like 1010 1010 10 10 10000 1010 this album was like 1562765hghbv2jhtru65458265r8365 couldn't follow it.except for slave the rest of the album is no crowd participation background music.in less you just make a complete joke and hold hands and bounce around happily like your on seasame street.this album is less balanced less natural & less dynamic than the older albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good....not good at all","review":"... Maladroit is a GIANT LEAP backwards. I can't exactly pin down what is so terrible about this CD except that I DON'T WANT TO LISTEN TO IT!!!Knowing that all good music takes a few listens to sink in, I gave this CD a chance to grow on me. Each listen just made me wish I had that time back even more.Bottom Line: don't buy it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sniff sniff, something stinks.","review":"Weezer, you suck now. I haven't even made it all the way through this album. I almost get there, but get bored and turn it off. Give up on the gimmicky stuff. Green was bad enough, and now this? Wow. Hide yourselves in shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than the green album!( And that's pretty bad)","review":"When I heard that Weezer was coming out with a new album after the horribly dissapointing Green Album, I was almost giddy. This was going to be Weezer's come back album. But I was wrong. They just photocopied all the songs from the green album, added new riffs and changed the name. This is a horrible album to be blunt, don't even bother buying it. Download a couple songs, but this is certainly not buy worthy. Go out and spend your money on something worth while, like Pinkerton, for instance..."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT BLOWS CHUNKS SO HARD YOU\\"LL WISH FOR BRITNEY","review":"As you may have inferred from my less than optimistic title, i hate this piece of crap. Rivers should have \\"experimented\\" with more mind-altering junk substances for this falls way short for anyone claiming to be under the influence, in order to be \\"creative\\". He should pay you for this sad aftermath of what a once great band used to be. Anyone who used to like alternative who listens to this will be converted, but to the evil side of pop princesses."},{"rating":"1","title":"why weezer? why? : (","review":"this was the only album i have ever had send back, i am a great fan of old weezer i enjoyed the blue album and the green album, even pinkerton. but maladroit lacked something, something very important that the other albums possessed especially the blue album! the songs on maladroit lack feeling and the lyrics sound forced and from the brain not the heart. keep fishin is the best track on the album but over all i don't like it, they might have permeantly lost somthing special, just hope they work harder on thier next album and start to produce better music! sorry weezer but my hope for you is falling rapidly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the short wait was not worth it.","review":"I know Weezer has a lot of songs that they want to show the viewing public, but i think they put out Maladroit a little to soon. The only good songs on the cd are the first 3 and 'possibilities'. For the rest of the songs, they sound like he wrote them in the 30 seconds it took for his Hotpocket to finish cooking in the microwave. Weezer is my favorite band and i cannot belive that i don't love this cd as much as the others. Hopefully, they will take a little more time on their next cd. Despite what people thing 2 years in between albums is an average time period. Keep this in mind Weezer, but other than that, keep up the good work."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"This is an indulgent mess. These guys should play to their stengths which are in pop economy, not 70s riffage and free association. If i want that, I'll go to the pros (Fu Manchu).From weezer, i expect tight little rock songs biting with irony. \\"Hash Pipe\\" got the job done. This record fails miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"A GREAT BAND DESTROYS THEIR LEGACY","review":"The blue album is a classic. Pinkerton was Great, but sold only 500,000 records. I can't imagine Weezer being a band of junkies or whatnot, but they must be addicted to something that costs a lot of money. 500,000 records is pretty damn good, so if you're going to make your two albums musically and emotionally shallow because they'll sell better, then I guess there's little we fans can do. Maladroit is the obvious successor to the sellout called the \\"green album\\". For some reason i thought he'd turn it around for this one. I was very very wrong. It sounds like a group of wanna be rock stars who just happen to sound like weezer. Where'd all the personality go???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I agree with the other reviewer that the departure of Matt Sharp killed the true Weezer. I miss his bass lines and falsetto. Although I will always love Weezer and the emo genre in particular, this boring, ear-grating, unmemorable disc is a big disappointment. I mean, I feel like I need Prozac after listening to it, and Weezer used to make me feel so happy and upbeat. Remember \\"In the Garage,\\" \\"Surf Wax America\\" and \\"The Sweater Song\\"? Those were the good old days. Those will be ingrained in my mind forever. However, after listening to Maladroit a couple dozen times, the only song that really stands out is \\"Dope Nose.\\" I am all for good emo and sad songs (I highly recommend the Get Up Kids) but Maladroit's sound is more impotent anger than heartbreak. And Weezer never, EVER had lyrics this trite! Every lovesick cliche is used over and over again. Please, please, Rivers, bring back the old Weezer! Please tell us you haven't sold out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff!","review":"This is a great cd, it is Weezer kicking more ... than ever.What makes this cd so great is that it's very different on each song. One song will be true Weezer Blue Album style, then it will be true Pinkerton style. Burndt Jamb and Take Control are awesome songs. Rivers and Brian are unleashing all their talent in this cd. True, some moments do have a bit off an emo feel to them, but it's not whiny, self pitying emo-core like Staind or Linkin Park. It's more of a light and happy emo, and i think that is okay. Who says rock stars have to bring their own self-pity into their music? I don't want to be all sad when I listen to music, I mean, mellow stuff like Radiohead is cool because it's not depressing, its just mellow. That's just my opinion. I'm not gonna give a run through of all the songs because they are all awesome. So what are you waiting for?!?!?! BUY THIS CD!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maladroit is so much better than their previous Green Album","review":"I've followed the recording of all of the tracks for this cd. The demos were posted on Weezer.com for fans to download. They were rotated almost daily with new cuts and demos. The songs are great. If you liked TGA then you should like this even more. Its still got the catchy lyrics and power pop style but Rivers throws in more of a heavy sound on tracks like Take Control. The Riffs are amazing. I give it 5 stars because it shows weezers amazing progress from a year ago into a more rock sound. Fans of Pinkerton may be disappointed in the lyrics not being so personal but rest assured these songs are amazing and is definitly worth the 15 bucks because it comes with about 7 videos from their latest east coast tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think Weezer fans are crazy for not loving this","review":"I am a huge alternative rock/post grunge, whatever you want to call it music fan. Weezer's first album \\"Blue\\" was is one of my favorite albums of all time, and I think that most Weezer fans will agree. Although Maladroit seems to get really mixed reviews amongst fans, I think that this is really their true \\"grunge\\" follow up to the first album. Considering Weezer has turned into an uber-marketable pop band, making one sell out single after another, to me this is their last real album. It rocks hard, has great distortion (almost as good as blue), and isn't cheesy like their new work. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the???","review":"Sorta sounds like Weezer but, Something is missing. I have loved all of their albums up until now...Where is the emotion? The lyrics overall are quite corny, lacking any emotion.What happened? Well maybe the next album will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the magic?","review":"What happened to the magic?Weezer's first album was great and since then it's been a steady decline.It happened with Pearl Jam,The Smashing Pumpkins,Green Day, and now Weezer.What the hell is going on in music today?These guys used to be my heroes now they [are bad].Please guys stop overthinkig it and play from the heart.It's not witty or intelligent it's contrived and it [is bad]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Change is BAD","review":"I am a big fan of Weezer and I love their music from the earlier albums, but when I first heard Maladroit I was disappointed. They seemed to have completely changed their style and lost the familiar \\"weezer\\" feel. What happed to the genius lyrics and unique melodies? The songs from Maladroit sound too generic and commercial; not written from the heart like they used to be. The album lacks the strong emotions and creative lyrics found in earlier albums like Pinkerton, and I can't take the songs seriously. It's a shame that people who have only heard Maladroit may overlook Weezer without having heard the old albums. I think this album turns away potential fans who would otherwise love Weezer as much as I do. I hope they go back to their old ways and make their next album more like the older ones and not like Maladroit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"I'm a huge fan of this Weezer CD. The Blue album grew old with me back in the day, and the Green album wrote a check it couldn't cash: the songs were catchy for the first 10 listens, then turned flat and uninspired as quickly as they caught my ear upon first listen. Relative to those two releases, I find \\"Maladroit\\" much superior: the edginess and rawness of the musicianship and vocals are compelling enough to merit repeated listenings, and keep the songs from growing tired. This is modern rock and roll at its best.Every song has about 5 rock influences combined into 3 short minutes or less: surf music, glam rock, punk, and classic rock are all crammed into each song on the album, making it a much more interesting listen than \\"Green\\" (too-obvious, formulaic pop). I don't know that there are any obvious hit singles on the album, which makes it that much more appealing for the listener who finds nothing interesting on the current record charts. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD and Weezer does it again","review":"This is a great new album by weezer and has some great songs on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the Blue basics!","review":"I listened to it (and played it on my computer) and it sounds like the blue album! Its not like the cleaner Green Album. Raw rock. Great! It has more pages in the booklet, more songs, and better songs than the green. Good job Rivers, Pat, Scott, and Brian!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The rock is back","review":"After Weezer's last album came out, people doubted whether Weezer still had the rock in them. What became known as \\"The Green Album\\" was a commercial, predominantly pop record that had hints of emotion, but for the most part, was a rather stale record. With Maladroit, Weezer proves they still know how to rock hard. Now don't get me wrong, it's no Blue or Pinkerton, but it is still a great album. While Blue was \\"nerd rock\\" and Pinkerton contained traces of \\"emo\\", Maladroit takes on more a \\"straight-ahead rock\\" type of vibe. It seems Rivers Cuomo is back in his groove, writing songs that will tug at your heartstrings, while simultaneously forcing you to sing along with all of your friends.Some of the songs on this album are just plain fun, like their 1st single \\"Dope Nose\\". I dare you to listen to this song without singing along. What? You want a track by track review? Never.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Excpect the same happiness found on the Green Album","review":"Maladroit, Weezer new album is the not the same kind of happy tunes people will remember from the Green and Blue Albums. But instead this album has a darker feel like their Pinkerton Cd. Don't get me wrong it's a good cd and it's nice to see them write some lyrics with meaning. The songs \\"death and destruction\\", \\"slob\\", and \\"slave\\" are good examples of the darker feel. The songs \\"Dope Nose\\" and \\"Burndt Jamb\\" bring back we are all used to finding on a Weezer Cd. Also this Weezer has the most songs they've ever had on a CD with 13. Another neat lilttle feature is that if you get the enhanced cd(It will have gold numbers on the back) there are clips of Weezer playing a live show. So if your a Weezer fan from the day of olde this is a must for you, but if you just started listening to the band with the green album, you might want to preview some tracks before jumping into this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The =w= we love...","review":"Coming off what many feel a very disapointing green album, long time =w= fans will be pleased with Maladroit. The album goes back to the core elements which made weezer great: catchy hooks held up by the genius, and often emotional, lyrics of front man Rivers Cuomo. Aside from the two front running singles, Dope Nose and Keep Fishing some other greats off the album include Burnt Jamb, December, Fall Together, Possibilites, well pretty much the whole album is praise worthy. A step back in the right direction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different brand of pop...","review":"(3.5 stars)Normally, I wouldn't give my two cents, but I thought it would be fun to be the first to review this album.Maladroit *is* a strong album. But it has it's weak points as well. The songs are catchy, but not *that* catchy, if you know what I mean. They catch on early, but they lose the same sort of grip that certain songs in Blue and Pinkerton had, that certain adhesive magic. Not that some of these songs aren't definite standouts. Slob, Dope Nose, Keep Fishin', and Fall Together are all standouts...Buy this album. But don't expect the same brands of catchiness that made first Blue a great album and then Pinkerton(perhaps even moreso). Just listen, and absorb the loveable, geeky grooves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, really bad.","review":"This CD is probably worth two stars, but I gave it one because many people only write reviews to recommend items, not to prevent people from buying them.I buy a lot of CDs, one a week or so and many blindly, and I can safely say that in the last two years, I have enjoyed every one. This one stopped my streak. It's just [bad], ok for the-alternative-station-that-loves-creed-and-incubus, but really just [bad].

Reports have it that the big bad record company (Geffen by way of Universal) tried to suppress River Cuomo's creative muses and asked them to hold off on release until the songs were ready. Cuomo streamed the songs out over the internet, and Geffen/Uni was forced to put out Maladroit. Give Cuomo props for beating the majors at their own game. Then listen to the record and give the record company props for hearing songs that range from expert (\\"Dope Nose\\", \\"Slave\\") to awkward (\\"Slob\\", \\"Burndt Jamb\\").

Far surpassing the two most recent releases, Maladroit is full of catchy songs, including the current single, \\"Dope Noise\\". Great music, and an overall great sound. If you don't already have it, you're missing out on one of the best CDs of the century that'll sure stand the test of time. Weezer has survived the so-called \\"sophomore curse\\" with their previous album and came out with a bang with \\"Maladroit\\". Seeing them in concert again will sure beat the past tours with the addition of new songs to their setlist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two disappointing albums in a row...","review":"Where can I start? The Blue Album is a classic album with sixties pop hooks and harmonies. Pinkerton, the follow-up, is weird and experimental, but definitely still worth listening to. The Green Album has a couple good songs, but that's about it. Which brings us to Maladroit. Weezer started off as a great band on their first two albums. Somehow along the way, they started to decline with the Green Album and now are further declining with Maladroit. While Maladroit has a couple good songs, the rest of it isn't worth listening to. Where are the pop hooks from the Blue Album? Where's the experimental edge from Pinkerton? The majority of the songs on Maladroit were written and performed with a half-hearted effort from the band, in my opinion. Let's hope Album #5 is a much better effort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I step back in the right direction","review":"After being very disappointed with the Green Album, I was a bit hesitant to try out Maladroit. When I finally did get it, I have to admit at the time I didn't care for it, and only gave it another listen recently.Well I have to say, it is a lot better than I thought of it at the time, especially compared to Green (which I did listen to recently as well, and still think sucks).The album is a bit harder edged, although nowhere near as harsh sounding as Pinkerton (in Weezer terms). The songs seem to have been given more time to be worked on than the previous album, and it sounds less rushed, in spite of the one year gap between albums. Although Rivers Cuomo still doesn't sing with the same enthusiasm as the first two albums, the melodies are much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very solid album by a band many people thought had burnt out","review":"All the hype around Weezer always seems to be surrounding their debut album and green album. Any fan with the slightest liking of that band will find this album to be essential, with it's onslaught of rocking guitar and heavy but melodic music, it'l definately be a winnner. If you've enjoyed listening to weezer throughout any of their progression as a band, this is a must as a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irrelevant","review":"As time has progressed, one of the more interesting bands of the 90's have faded into obscurity. After PInkerton, they should have just hung it up. Despite the commercial failure of said disc, at least it was a master piece. the Green Album took one concept of song writing and extended it over thirty minutes. Maladroit does the same.

These playwrights are of no great literary caliber, and civil disobedience is possibly the most overrated type of civic action I can think of. Honestly, I don't care if you don't pay taxes. You will just get thrown in jail and get what you deserve, like Thoreau did. The only reason it worked with Gandhi was because the British were so far flung and a declining empire anyways. Also Walden is so autobiographical that you hardly need all of this. I recommend reading Walden instead. I am probably biased because I think President Polk is the 9th best president ever (Between Eisenhower and Andrew Jackson), but this is definitely not one of the best plays out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the trendy","review":"An album not for trendy black metal fan's, Viking Crown is pure unholy filthy black metal,made the way it should be,The album start's of with Song of Faduf ,An intro like Black Mass,setting the mood for what's to come.

Instruments are blurred, the sound in general is muffled. At first I thought Sony skimped on the headphones that shipped with the unit, but I've tried my high quality headphones (AKG 501), but it makes the unit suffer even more. It seems that the unit does not have enough gain to drive higher quality headphones and even my RIO is able to do a half way decent job with it.I'm mainly listening to classical music and jazz which perhaps is too much to ask for on a portable unit, but even some of the rock I've tried sounded more like coming out of a radio than out of a CD player.I'll return it tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's better deals out there","review":"At first site, the CD player looks really cool. Also the skip protection on this thing is incredible. The supplied headphones are good quality. The bass boost is nice, but thats about the only good thing about the sound quality. The sound(even with another pair of headphones)is terrible. It is muffled like putting a pillow over a speaker and trying to listen to it. I was expecting a little more for 70 bucks. You could do a lot better than this. It's not worth it, even with the skip-protection! Anyway, maybe i just got a bad one, but it doesn't seem like it.

The default sound (without bass boost) is dull, with a lot of mid. Since this happens with a lot of portable players, I cranked up the bass - and recieved a rude surprise. The first setting of two, if anything, made the sound even duller than before. The second boost REALLY distorts the sound: the bass starts to hurt your ears, strangely enough, the treble gets augmented, and the mid just disappears. One plus is that the skip protection is nearly foolproof.Bottom line: It's got awful sound, it feels cheaply made, and it's got awful sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"skips 1st 2 seconds, poor sound","review":"My Walkman skips the first two seconds of any CD and the sound is weak and thin, inadequate richness in the midrange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pray it functions...","review":"I bought a QPS back in April, I had configuration issues right away.I followed the tech support format and emailed them.

But this is probably the ugliest looking DVD transfer I've ever seen. The picture is grossly over saturated, with skin tones turning a dark orangey-red. In fact the entire movie takes on a dark red hue. The blacks are crushed; there is practically no image detail in the darker portions of a scene. The travesty is that the accompanying trailer has been beautifully transferred, looking brighter, with accurate colors and lovely skin tones and it emphasizes just how deplorable the main feature looks. How could MGM approve this DVD for release? Definitely not recommended. If you want to watch it, try to catch it at the movie theater.

The background music is irritating, the dialogue is hard to comprehend, and even Neve Campbell's shower scene is a disappointment (if that's the sort of thing you are into). And no, I did not get any sense of a powerful woman in her character as one other reviewer did.The film is basically about a lot of disparate characters all trying to hustle each other, from the low-life on the streets to the rich and powerful. Neve, the only one who appears normal and nice in the midst of all this, ends up being as much a manipulator as everyone else around her.No matter what turns you on in movies, I can almost guarantee that this movie will bore you witless.

It tries to be artsy and smart but falls flat. Thank goodness it's not very long, although I was wanting something else to happen to round it out.

The rest of the movie should have been about how it's all tied up/ makes sense. Or, that's what it should have been.... But this movie has one of the most implausible, ridiculous endings I have seen in a long time. The main character's motivations are unconvincing and do not make a lot of sense till the very end.The movie has it's moments though. Some witty lines and some steamy scenes thrown in here and there.

In fact, I thought about this throughout the very, very long opening act.When the plot finally kicked in very late in the game, it turns out to be Toback's unimaginative riff on \\"Indecent Proposal.\\"A hustler-lover (Fred Weller) of Campbell's character brokers a paid date between aging billionaire Italian media mogul (Dominic Chianese) and Campbell.There's no answer to the rhetorical title question in this nasty film of greed, anger, deception and murder.You may want to take a shower when it's over.Note: I question the authenticity of posts that praise this film and bet they are Toback's stooges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Cares?","review":"Neve Campbell's character is a cipher, but not an interesting one. One doesn't get any insight into why she does what she does or who she is. And what she does is pretty banal.The whole movie feels like somebody's vanity project, with lots of cameo appearances from B- list celebs. The writer/director appears as a character (always a warning sign of trouble to come) who has a very stilted conversation with Neve Campbell, apparently designed to show us how hip and in touch with her sexuality she is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm must have watched the wrong movie","review":"It had the same actors and cover as the one everyone else reviewed, but I hated every minute of this movie.

The movie seemed to be a series of isolated conversations that made no real sense.The back of the DVD case leads you to believe this is a 'smoldering erotic thriller'. I guess the movie is so short (only 81 minuts) because all the eroticism ended up on the cutting room floor. When Will I Be Loved is almost as erotic as a Kermit the Frog cartoon.I recomand this DVD only to people that are planing a lawn party and nave a need for miniature frisbies.One star only because I can not award a lower number."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Exciting, NOT Arousing, NOT A Good Movie","review":"Neve's nude scenes are coy and uninteresting.

I kept hoping something would happen to just make it more interesting. I really liked the subject matter and the conflict, but it was presented in such a non-climactic way that I was bored out of my mind. The acting was good, the directing was good in ways of use of color and background, also maybe symbolism. But like I said, it was just a boring movie. I'm disappointed I chose it.

The story is original, moves at a rapid pace and the characters are fascinating. Herbert includes everything here that won him a massive fan base from the beginning of the series. This book is a welcome volume after the weaker installments of God Emperor and Heretics, though not as strong as any of the first three books in the series. Be warned that this book contains some sexual content (although less than Heretics). If you like the other Dune books, you will certainly enjoy this volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Great book hands down. From Book 4 to Chapterhouse the focus shifts. This whole storyline is a masterpiece and this is a great final book, though its not by any means an ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"An open-ended finale to the Dune chronicles","review":"This is the finale of Herbert's books. It picks up with the inner workings of the Bene Gesserit society after the destruction of Arrakis. Much better than it's predecessor, Chapterhouse:Dune once again will grip its readers. However, the one flaw is that it leaves too many questions unanswered. While it caps the series, it does not wrap up all of the loose ends, and the reader will feel a sense of incompleteness at the not-so-grand finale. It is a shame that we lost Frank Herbert, for it is clear that he meant to add to the Dune series"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the series","review":"I liked the first Dune series. Herbert should have stopped there. The last three books are merely a pedestal for Herbert's personal philosophy. While there were kernels of truth to all of the endless philosophical one-liners that everyone spouted, the rest of the novel (an actually well-devised story) was totally ruined by all of this rambling. The books could have been a lot shorter, or those pages could have been better spent developing characters further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worn & torn","review":"The writing is great and we wanted to round out our FH collection, but this poor book has been overly loved.

Flat out... is it as good as the original? No way. Is it worth reading? Yes.

A lot of questions left unanswered and as a whole very unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor has no clothes","review":"Chapterhouse: Dune is, in a word, tedious. This book has 20 pages of boring, meaningless pages for every page that actually contributes to the plot. As other reviewers point out, MANY things are left unanswered.The last three books in the Dune series are ploddingly boring.Do yourself a favor, and buy the USED, paperback for a few dollars, DON'T bother paying full price.The books in the Dune: House trilogy on the other hand (by BRIAN Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson), were great. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Witches vs. Whores","review":"Who loses? The reader. This is a surprisingly weak book to follow the brave and bold Heretics of Dune, a novel in which Frank took his ideas further than any reader might have imagined. Only one year elapsed between the release of Heretics and Chapterhouse. Frank may have been trying to capitalize on the success of his Dune franchise by getting another book on the shelf quickly. This reads as though the author had run out of ideas and was playing for time. Very little occurs in the first three-quarters of the novel. Almost all of the action takes place in the final hundred pages of the book, ending in that tantalizing cliffhanger. I think this could have been a much better novel had Frank waited and allowed his ideas sufficient time to germinate, but then again, if he had waited too much longer, Heretics would have been the end of the series. Given the strength of that novel, that may not have been a bad outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell happened??","review":"What happened to this series? The first three books made a good story. The last three sketched only the barest outlines of any plot at all, simply as a framework for 1500 pages of Herbert's ideas on philosophy and politics. These stories are apparently suppoesd to have some significance since people always start dying at a ridiculous pace near the end of the books, but by then I didn't even care. The characters are one dimensional at best, simply used as pawns in Herbert's debates. Some of the ideas discussed are well presented, which is why the books rate at least two stars, but putting these discourses under the category of a \\"Dune\\" story is just ridiculous. And can anyone, anyone at all, give a clue what that last chapter is supposed to mean??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brooding finale","review":"Herbert and Bev wind down the greatest Sci Fi series of them all in grand style.The Bene Gesserit are in deep trouble and their survival may require changes that not all find acceptable.Even Dune/Arrakis has been destroyed as the awesome powers of the people of The Scatteringare realised.

Of my memories of the entire seies this stands out the most vivid and magnifiecent of all of them. Frank Herbert is at his best in \\"Chapterhouse Dune\\". It is for the intellectual with its series of mind muddling and complex, intricate plots that are devilish in their severe twists and turns. For once it is not a book with simplistic and overused plots. It also provokes a variety of raw, primal emotions throughtout that cotradicts the intellectuality of the work, but however when thse two are combined a surprising compound is prodced (as proved).We cry at the Sea Child's death, and with joyous uproar greet Rebecca's arrival and existence. One is able to relate to the events of the book, it is realistic with a grasp of material matters and emotions beyond that of any other author. I liked this one the best (obviously!)!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak finish","review":"After a very slow start, the book draws your interest and really gets moving - resurrecting the spirit of the early books. But it utterly fails in the end. The conclusion is unbelievable, frustratingly open-ended, and poorly written. In the end, Herbert disappoints with weak characters, unforgivable plot holes, and just plain flat out hokiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for non-native speakers","review":"The book starts from clear listening tests which made sense.

The content covers how Americans speak English such as rules of pronunciation, contraction, tone and etc. There is a CD with the book, but I haven't used it.

Too many rules in books conflict with standard rules we learn all along. They may be correct, but obviously confuse people who are not native speakers.

There is a CD that comes with it but again without being able to see the corresponding exercises in the student workbook, you feel as if you're working blind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific over-view of Western thought.","review":"What Tarnas has accomplished is actually rather astounding: harness many thousands of pages of material and present them in a few hundred. For a no-nonsense look at just what our forebears have been up to philosophically for the last five thousand years, you can do no better than to read this book. While it is quite dense in facts, and while parts of it might have to be reread in order to digest the incredible amount of material you are given, it is possibly the best introduction to Western thought available. And the trajectory Tarnas reveals for us as we reach into the future is down-right exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for everybody!!!","review":"I am very happy to give my comments regarding Tarnas' book. The detail and research that went into this book is staggerring. It is a tour de force and a must read for anybody who wants to gain a greater understanding of who we are, where we've been and where we're going. Because of his educated analysis, the reader is treated with an invaluable perspective moving into the new millenium."},{"rating":"1","title":"PC philosophy","review":"The early parts of the text provide some helpful summary writing. However, this is the cheese used to lure the reader in the mousetrap of politically correct nonsense with which the volume verbosely ends. The book starts as a river, and ends in a scattered and unrelated drain of tributaries. Feminist critique of science (and other fashionable but superficial faddish \\"thinking\\") is actually taken seriously, while having been rejected by women and men alike who work in the sciences. The author's psychologizing is silly, and is never applied to his own motivations for writing his own text.

The sentences are long with lots of punctuation and emtpy phrases. Tarnas seems to write around his point. Here is an example sentence taken from the book: \\"Although this perspective took on a number of distinct inflections, and although there were important contercurrents to this view, it would appear that not only Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, and Pythagoras before them and Plotinus after, but indeed Homer and Hesiod, Aeschylus and Sophocles all expressed something like a common vision, reflecting a typically Greek propensity to see clarifying universals in the chaos of life.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically False","review":"Tarnas uses the appearance of a Historical work to support his other ideological views. This man is no historian. He misrepresents his sources and writes things that are simply not based in factual evidence. This is shown in his documentation of his sources. I grant you that this book is a good read (and easy to read at that) but only as a work of psycological fiction. Documentation is sparse and it seems that much of the sources he uses comes from his own mind. He makes statements that are completely based upon opinion and represents them as concrete fact. Most of his references are not primary sources, but pre-processed \\"documentaries\\" that support his beliefs. As a history major I find this work to be unbelievably inaccurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has more to do with religion than thought","review":"The book gets bogged down heavily in Christianity.

The cover is indeed beautiful, but the content, with exceptions such as Brian Peterson's work, tends towards high heeled black boots and the burlesque. It seems as though fetish is now the order of the day, with erotic photographers following this very standardized path like sheep. Trouble is, the photographs tend to depersonalize and objectify, which robs them of their erotic quality. If making a statement about the objectification of women is the purpose of much of this work, well OK, but how many artists should it take to make the point?A missed opportunity. Take a look at Judy Francesconi's \\"Visual Sonnets\\" or, from the 1970's, J. Frederick Smith's \\"Sappho: The Art of Loving Women\\" as alternatives.

A lot of decent cgi work was done here, and the guys on that crew deserve credit. Though they alone could not save this movie.I think the major problem was the story line and all that. This plot was so horribly flimsy that it could break like celophane on a window. There just wasn't anything remotely approaching interesting here.

Tom Hardy's 'Shinzon' was by far the best villian for the TNG crew to battle. I personally got really tired of the Borg, especially after their overuse in Star Trek Voyager. I love Picard and he carried the movie so galliantly. Brent Spiner's 'Data' was by far the best portrayal of Data ever.

Only go to see it if you are willing to snooze through a slow-moving, aimless feeling movie that produces no excitment, suprises or emotion. It essentially just relies on the usual Trek trick of recycling old Trek plots and plot devices. This film is a total \\"clone\\" of Star Trek II, however as we have all learned from science fiction, the clone is never as good as the original.

A couple of those scenes added back in, coupled with a more emotional performance by Stewart, would have made this a fantastic TNG sendoff. As it stands, the disc looks great, sounds great, and is just what you'd expect from a Trek film - it just isn't at the level of Trek II or Trek VI, or even First Contact.

The technical aspects of the Special Collector's Edition are remarkable. A crisp, beautiful widescreen transfer on disc one. Disc two has wonderful, if sad insight into the \\"final\\" production. The one problem I have is the deleted scenes. Normally 95% of the time I agree with the cuts left on the editing floor. However, there are a couple of crucial scenes that were cut and I think should have remained in the film. I didn't know Beverly was promoted until I saw the deleted scene. Also the deleted scene with Picard and Data discussing life over a glass of wine makes the decisions in the film more acceptable.

I put a question mark because I'm not sure it's the worst, but based upon a simple test of which would I pick last to watch, it garners the worst rating. The sad thing is it managed to edge out Insurrection from the bottom three. I can't imagine that they'll make another Star Trek movie after two bombs in a row and the latest series reeling (which I've also stopped watching). Now you may think I'm not a Star Trek fan but my favorite episode aired the day I was born, I watched Star Trek in german without knowing the language when I was five, and I'm slowly buying up the DS9 seasons as I can afford them.

Half the screen time you have no idea why the character is doing what it's doing. And the way they killed off Data was truly pathetic.I cannot understand what would motivate the producers to make this movie. It has no sense of wonder that made Star Trek great in Generations, First Contact or Undiscovered Country.

The slap in the face was when they killed Data who became the best character in the series and the only one to hold my interest.The writers seemed to just throw out another ST movie without thinking about a decent storyline and expect fans to accept it.Maybe next time they should try taking more than 20 minutes to write a movie.

With the exception of the early dune buggy scene the script is top-notch, the battle scenes are stunning, there's a bit of that Star Trek humor (but without being hokey), and the Nemesis surpasses the Borg Queen as the best of the Trek villains.Tom Hardy's Shinzon is a multi-layered personality, and Hardy plays him with a subtle intensity and a great sarcastic edge. He gives us a villain that is both menacing and pitiable -- not an easy task to pull off.I hope this isn't the last of the Next Generation films, but if it is, they've gone out with one to be proud of!! Don't miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"I liked the really dark horrible look of some of this but I was not entertained by the story or anything. It was one of the worst Star Trek movies. Too bad. Everyone seemed tired of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of all ST movies","review":"I think this movie was the worst of all the Star Trek movies. I have been a ST fan for as long as I remember but this one was a real let down. The story line was stupid and the ending was contrived. It tried to duplicate the feeling everyone got when Spock died. Well it failed miserably!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Trek Snoozer","review":"Just an all-around boring snooze of a movie. Probably worse if you are a Star Trek fan, because you know it could have been so much better. This movie was actually much worse than the average television show. I have no idea how the script was approved for filming, because it's all right there in the basic story - boring, and more boring. I guess the main drawback of the film is that it just seemed worn out, as if the story had been told one time too many.For a wonderful, spot-on review of the film, go to the Roger Ebert website and search for this film, it's an amusing and deadly accurate review on what went wrong with the Star Trek line of films. Thank goodness J.J. Abrams has come along to rejuvenate a dying patient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek-Nemesis","review":"While not a Star Trek devotee, I felt that this movie was very well done and good for those who don't consider themselves fanatics. The acting was pretty good, the special effects were excellent, and the story had some plot to it. The only thing I didn't like was the plot itself. Sorta freaky. But hey, maybe that's me."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Nice, Movie Average","review":"For the most part, the New Generation series of movies have felt like long TV episodes and not major movies and this continues here. The DVD is nice with a sharpe picture and sound and the deleted scenes were fun but the scenes not done were the key to this film's downfall.I think we have waited 15 years or so to see Riker and Troi marry and what do we get...the reception, but no wedding...no Picard doing the ceremony...no Worf frettng under his breathe...no Data head turn as the humans swoon.... We have waited a long time to see Riker get his own ship and what do we get, a nice scene between Picard and Riker but no Captain Riker on his bridge taking the Titan out for his first voyage as Captain.Those are the moments Trekkers would have lived for, but were lacking.The movie is OK, but like the last two, does not have that Major Motion picture feel to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"I have looked forward to this movie for the past year. I read what those involved with the movie said they were trying to accomplish. I thought the plot was a great idea, but the ideas was poorly delivered in this film. It was more \\"Star Wars\\" than \\"Star Trek.\\" Plus, when the bad guys sneak up on the good guys and are 10 feet away and fire and miss, and this happens over and over in this movie, it takes any sense of realism out of the picture. Plus, the dune buggy sequence is also ridiculous and totally detracts from any sense of real danger or realism. Patrick Stewart is a great actor, but he said in interviews that he had a hard time \\"finding\\" Picard for this movie. I'm not sure he ever found him. A great disappointment and one of the worst of the Star Trek movies, if not the worst. The \\"friction\\" between Picard and Shinzon was nothing compared to that between Kirk and Khan. And there are many more disappointments than I will take the time to go into here."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe the worst of the series","review":"This movie was just plain stupid. That Shinzon character didn't look anything like Picard, I mean give me a break. Plus the humor was just so cringe-inducing. It literally gave me a stomach ache."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nemesis Scores Well","review":"Trekkies and Trekkers will love this movie no mater what. The movie veers off from the typical look of Star Trek movies a little, the use of color to suggest moods reminds me of Star Trek II a little, and the plot is very similiar in other areas as well. Fans of Worf may be disapointed as he gets little to do in the movie, as does Doctor Crusher. The CGI looks great, but doesn't take center stage, like in the recent Star Wars movies. (That's a good thing.) While it doesn't seem to be quite as good as First Contact, it's still a very respectable outing (maybe the last?) for the Next Generation crew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best TNG movie","review":"I read a review that said this was a clone of Wrath of Kahn. I must disagree. I think it is purposefully meant to mirror Kahn. There are many parallels, but I believe that Nemesis stands by itself. I don't know if there will be any more TNG movies, but this one felt like it was an ending. The one thing that impressed me was the level of emotion in this film. At first, I felt a sad nastalgia as the characters met for a wedding, then I felt nervous as the characters meet the villain. Next came excitement as the action picked up. By the end, I was actually squirming in my seat from the tension. I have never seen a Star Trek movie that has struck my emotions like this. I say bravo to the Star Trek franchise. I hope there are more TNG movies.PS (Do you think we'll ever see movies from the \\"Enterprise\\" crew?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"GOODBYE!\\"","review":"I WOULD say this is the best \\"Star Trek\\" movie ever.

YYYYYYOOOOOOOUUUUUUU LIARS! This was not nonstop action!!!! Action is where thier lips stop flapping and thier ...tazers i guess START FIRING! I got fooled by two movies that had made similar statements. The James Bond movie that came out this year made promises that said that ddn't like Bond would like that. Next time I hear a statement like that I'm gonna march over to the nearest movie theater and piss on the projector!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Data has another twin brother!","review":"While the story tends to feel a bit small, the acting, special effects, and several of the scenes are exciting and original! The movie really feels like a two hour episode from the series, undoubtedly because there was not a huge budget. For me, I count this as one of the decent Star Trek films from the series.The DVD looks and sounds great. Most of the CGI effects of the ships and outer space look outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trck NEMESIS","review":"As to what Egads has said he is totally full of it. He or she for got to mention that the ENTERPRISE had help on firing on the Remans ship. The Romulan came to the aid of the ENTERPRISE and help them out and did some of the damage too. So before you write a review buddy write down what really happened and the ENTERPRISE did not just fire 3 times they hit the with phasers and torpedoes and with the new QUTEM TORPEDOS too. So maybe you should go see this movie again and write a much better review. This might not have ben the best STAR TREK movie but the action is really good and even though a lot of the good seans were cut. I am sure they will bring another STAR TREK movie back becasue dont for get there is always \\"Q\\". Even if he was in the FINAL show of STAR TREK he too was a good villin for PICARD. I hope they mack a movie with the cast of VOYAGER, some time soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nemesis Rocks!","review":"What did Nemesis have that made it a winner? There were several things- 1. Real Danger. In most other Star Trek movies you know nobody's really going to be harmed. In this one we had the death of a crewmember as well as a smashed up enterprise. 2. Suspense. Data jumping from the enterprise and landing on the scimitar? WOW! And 3. Character Moments. Let's see, a long-awaited wedding, good humor, and a touching scene reminescing over Data. All in all, a GREAT film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-Par Star Trek Movie","review":"While better than Insurrection, overall this movie stinks. I would actually give it two and a half stars. This one feels very forced, and while I appreciate the inclusion of the Romulans in a movie, it simply isn't ever convincing that Shinzon would want to destroy Earth. Even with the backstory they do provide, I couldn't believe he wants it that badly. The sudden addition of a new sub-class of Remans is lame. One could write off the coincidence of a race of aliens, just happening to share their name with the mythical founder of Rome. But when all of a sudden we learn of an off-breed of the same race that shares it's name with Romulus' brother Remus it becomes laughable. And perhaps it's a bit cruel, but Brent Spiner has gained weight since the series ended, and it's just odd to see the android Data with a second chin. Sorry, no good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Trek Film Ever","review":"First off, to the person who had the first posting, it is Commander RIKER, not Ricker. Sound it out. I just saw this film in the theatre. What a wasted two hours. Not enough character development, poor cinematography, and terrible dialogue. And....what was the point of killing Data???? I mean, this film makes Star Trek V look like a gem! Don't waste the time or money. I don't even think I will buy the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"I rather watch Tera Patricks videos, she's a porn star","review":"Sorry folks, but this movie not the Star Trek of just a few years ago. It was so boring, a yawner! I waited the whole film for something to happen and when if finally did, I could care less. This is not one of the 50 minute TV shows that used to get a little boring with all the talk, talk, talk, which would mercifully end at the top of the hour. This is a movie, they can't make talk fests out of them and expect them to be good.The Captan seemed out of character too, what was the deal with him being so happy in the beginning? And Data, boring, he ceased to be interesting when half the movie was about him and him! Then you had Picard and Picard why didn't the writers think to bring in Will and Will?All in all a very lousy movie. I thought the last one was bad but this one was really bad.How sad, that the advertised last voyage ended up as bad as Star Trek the Motion picture!"},{"rating":"1","title":"On auto-pilot....","review":"THe trouble with this movie is that it seem to be run in auto-pilot.

Data you will be missed! Although not as good as First Contact, this movie will hold up well in the annuls of Star Trek.2 issues, though: 1) The Remuns looked too much like Orcs and the 'fly through' of the mines on Remus too much like Isengard; and 2) Shinzon looked a dead ringer for Dr. Evil (... any moment I half expected him to ask Picard to \\"throw me a frickin' bone here!\\".Top Flick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Star Trek Yet","review":"Don't miss this one! We almost didn't go because the promos didn't make it sound worth seeing -- seemed too much like a video game for teenage boys. But who could miss a chance to spend a couple of hours with Warf, Jean Luc and the gang? When our most faithful Trekkie friend decided to go, we all piled in the car and off we went. I am so glad we joined her! We all agreed -- it is by far the best of all the Star Trek films. It's fast-paced, exciting, moving, gripping; it will have you clinging to the edge of your seat, whether you're a teenage boy or...a little older...Do take along the big box of tissues, though. You'll need it bigtime at the utterly astonishing end.Great movie!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of all.","review":"After a long wait to see the Romulans in a Star Trek movie theyappear on the tenth movie as the good guys who helped Captain Picard. On the other hand, the bad guy in none other than Cap.Picard himself as his clone. By the way, he looked more like a clone of Kojak than Picard, what a shame!The plot is so full of flaws and so illogical that sometimes I think that Mr.Rick Bermann take the fans as stupid people. It is the worst Star Trek movie ever and I hope it is the last because I can't stand this disrespect towards Gene Roddenberry's legacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Improvement Over Insurrection But That's Not Saying Much!","review":"This movie was like a big overblown STNG episode. I enjoyed it as long as I kept my brain turned off. Patrick Stewart was wonderful as Captain Picard but it seems like he was just going through the motions to get a paycheck. He is a capable actor and his talents were wasted on this film. The deleted scenes would've actually made the movie a lot better if they were included. Shinzon was not as effective a villian as Kahn no matter what Berman says! Shinzon seemed like some rushed into production character added to the Star Trek universe just for this movie. The Romulans would never have allowed the Remans to take over the Romulan Senate I mean it would be the same as The Borg being defeated by a horde of Jawas or the efforts of one federation captain (i.e. Voyager) which I thought was just as ridiculous. But we needed a movie to include the Romulans so they came up with this garbage! What a travesty!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NEMESIS RULES!","review":"Star Trek Nemesis is one of the greatest TREK films ever. It's by the fans & for the fans.

This is only the third star Trek movie I have seen, and out of all three it is definately the worst.It just seemed so....cheesy. Especially the ending. None of the characters came across as very real, unlike the ones in the old movies (with Kirk, Spock, etc.)If you're considering seeing this movie, I advise you, for the love of God DON'T! See the old ones first, and then if you're courageous try to make it through this one without falling asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Boldly Go Where Noone Wants To...","review":"I can't even begin to describe how disappointing this was.TNG will always be my favorite ST and to have it end on this note is truly sad. Finally breaking the tradition of even numbered movies being better - the responsibility of this disaster lies squarely on the shoulders of the director. They might as well have gotten John Woo - after all if you're going to destroy a franchise why not get someone with experience (ie. Mission Impossible II)The cast is still the strongest of the ST franchises and is the only reason this isn't getting a one star review. There's also a nice cameo by Janeway. Pity they couldn't come up with a better script than this. Worst of all the deja vu ending (circa Wrath of Khan) leaves even the non ST fans thinking \\"Hmm this looks strangely familiar\\"I have every ST: TNG DVD but I think I'm going to pretend that this didn't happen. Only slightly better than Insurrection.Gene must be turning in his grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE for fans and non trek fans alike","review":"When it's not boring it's ridiculous. This film not only has no respect for the established facts of the Star Trek universe, it has no respect for the viewer! It's as if the fools Bragga and Berman (the producers of this failed enterprise, pun intended) assume the viewer has never seen another movie, and will therefore actually be intrigued by this cliche', predictable, and pendantic plot.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely the worst ST film","review":"I have been watching ST since the late 60s. Every TV show, every movie, read most of the books, etc. I know these characters. This movie was just plain BAD. The writing was disjointed, the lighting was horrible, and there was none of the inside humor that made all of the best ST shows and films as good as they were. This film has NO redeeming qualities whatsoever. It's especially unfortunate that it appears to be the last ST film for the forseeable future. One final note: I don't get the comparisons to ST II and ST III that some of the other reviewers have made. Those were actually pretty good films, II being one of the best. This was just a sad mess, and all those currently in charge of overseeing the ST franchise should be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Days of Glory","review":"Star Treks days of glory have come to an end. STAR TREK - NEMESIS may be the final cinematic chapter the STAR TREK Next Generation crew. Interestingly this is a dark and somewhat bleak looking film involving the Romulans.

Not as good as First Contact, but still very good. I was a little dissapointed that they killed Data, but they brought him back in another form. If they make another movie it will be interesting ot se how B4 develops and assumes data's identity. Tom Hardy and Patrick Stewart did excellent job's portraying there characters. I wish the other members of the Enterprise had more involved roles and sub plots. I think with that many members of a crew the movie should have been longer and more involved.

At least the original Star Trek movies had the characters make professional advances.The acting is terrible, the plot is full of holes, and the movie is poorly directed.

They seem to treat her like a damn Yugo: cheap and easily replaceable. Borrowing liberally from its own past, this film demonstrates how tired the franchise has become. Not that we're tired of the characters, but they obviously need new direction. There is no spirit of discovery left. Berman and company have bled the turnip dry. At least with the TOS films there seemed to be a desire to move the characters forward, despite the obvious and necessary commercial ambitions of the movies. Berman seems content with just holding a record for spin-offs. They tried to make this their Star Trek II with a black hat villain and heroic sacrifice in the end, but there's no emotional connection. It's all too fantastic to believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice trek.....","review":"The crew of the Next Generation is back with a very good movie that deserves to do better at the box office.

Aside from the brief wedding scene there is no warmth, no humor, no interesting locales or character interaction and the villian, who seems to have three-fourths of the film's dialogue, is neither menacing nor interesting, just an arrogant jerk. I wanted more Worf and Riker!!! There was a lot of action, but it amounted to nothing more than a prolonged space battle differing from episdodes only in that it was much louder and considerably longer. In contrast to the exotic and colorful settings of the Star Wars films, the masterful action sequences of the Matrix, and the dynamic characters and villians of the X-Men, this dead in the water bomb makes Star Trek look tired, uninspired and down for the count.

Horrible...","review":"Excited from the awesome trailer, I took off to the local theater to watch \\"Nemesis.\\" What a major disappointment! This was by far one of the worst Star Trek movies ever created. It played out like some cheap, made-for-TV movie. Campy scenes (such as a wedding scene), gobs of boring exposition, and a \\"nemesis\\" who does absolutely nothing but talk. The best part of this entire flick was the first 5 minutes where the senate is turned to stone. After that, it's camp-city! Baird could have spared us from the sex scene between commander Riker and counselor Troi. \\"Contact\\" w/the borg lady is the best so far..."},{"rating":"1","title":"missed chance for movie","review":"I'm a late bloomer trekie fan. Within the past 4 four years I really got into the Star Trek world (I'm a die hard TNG,DS9, & VGY fan). I also just buying most of the movies.I looked forward to Nemesis mainly because of the Romulan angle. To me, they are the most intresting group that never received their full due in any movie.I felt that the plot was very weak and was ok for a one time viewing. I know with all the great stories on the shows that someone could have written a better movie.I hope the upcoming movie is alot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bad film","review":"I am not sure what they hell they were thinking with this movie, but the only thing I can say is its better than Insurrection, of course if you have seen Insurrection you would know that isn't saying much.This movie and Insurrection all but killed the Star Trek movie franchise, with a reboot film now in production hopefully it will redeem this historic sci fi series.If you are looking for a good Star Trek film try part 2 The Wrath of Kahn, the best of the films, though most of the ones with the original crew are good. The best of the TNG crew is First Contact, though Generations is worth a look.As a completist I will likely at some point buy this film, but for other people I do not recommend this film at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling","review":"So it's come down to this: 20 minutes of substantive material lost in a sea of fight scenes, battle scenes, and noisy special effects. If you've always wanted Star Trek to be more like an expensive Saturday morning cartoon (\\"The action is non-stop!\\"), congratulations; this one's for you. If you have previously admired the interesting characters and thoughtful science fiction that used to be hallmarks of the series, avoid this vacuous turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prime Suspect","review":"This movie is a cheap-looking travesty, with low-energy performances, pointless digressions, and tedious 'action' scenes.

Hey even Voyagers Kate Mulgrew made an appearance(How did someone like her ever make it to admiral when she and her whole grew got lost for years?) and Picards clone makes refrence to the Borg. And Data even seems to have forgotten he had a brother himself earlier that evil Tinman Lar?Lor? he now acts as though this hunk of junk they found, B-4, is the only other Data module there is.

I didn't see some of the twists in the movie coming and, the special effects had me watching the flick for a third time to soak them all up.So, what more can I say? It's a good flick that set's the stage for yet ANOTHER sequel in the coming months.Ciao!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nemesis: Earnest, But Disappointing","review":"It has been twenty-three years since the first Star Trek film was released, and its most stylish villains - the Romulans - finally have their turn. It's fitting that John Logan (one of the screenwriters of Gladiator) wrote this installment - albeit with some meddling by Brent Spiner.Unfortunately, as with so much recent Star Trek fare, the execution is earnest but poor; production design is insipid, the vistas generally colorless, editing is awkward. Spiner has also pulled a Sigourney Weaver - using his input to give himself a heroic sendoff.Compared to Star Wars, one expects some cheapness in Star Trek visuals, yet painted backdrops and redressed sets just don't meet today's standards.Don't expect to see Riker's new command, the Titan, either.Nevertheless, Star Trek loyalists will remember the series' better days, swallow hard, and buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"Basically the item came at the last possible moment.

This happened for a good reason and I wish it had stayed that way. Nememis emulated TWOK too much and relied on a week Romulan villain with a really big ship. I am so glad Star Trek 2009 was nothing like this film (sarcasm).Data's death was stupid and at that point I really didn't care. If there had been a sequel, he would have came back in B-4. Thus, the Wrath of Khan like Nemesis would have been followed by a movie similar to The Search for Spock. Lame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scifi finally returns in Star Trek","review":"Nemesis, is one of the best Star Trek movies yet. The reason it didn't do well at the box office is because it stayed true toscience fiction,which much of the main stream do not understand.The fact that Capt Jean Luc Picard has been cloned is the basisfor this movie and his fight with his other self to save theuniverse. Good character development in this one and I don'twant to reveal too much.

It had some decent special effects but no decent storyline or dialog. At the beginning of the movie, we find Picard standing on an alien planet with Data-like android parts scattered in 4 or 5 places - an arm here, a leg there, and a head somewhere else. Picard says \\"Something isn't right about this.\\" Really, Jean-Luke? What was your first clue? I think the disembodied android was a metaphor of the movie to come. The rest of the movie was just as disjointed and never came together. Maybe the android was in one piece before the editors started whacking away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst of all the Star Trek movies","review":"I'm a Star Trek fan, and of all the movies, this one is the only one that really HAD to be hyped. Even the Star Trek movies that aren't the greatest (traditionally, the odd numbered ones) have some merit to them. This movie, is horrid, with it's contrived sequences, that propel it's story to...more contrived sequences.

The result is that everything you cut from the top slides to about a 35 degree angle instead of straight down. Clearly, this is a problem because you can't use them to dice or chop, because you don't have enough knife control with this type of blade. Everything you cut swerves 35 degrees off from where you intended.I complained and Chicago Cutlery upgraded me to a regular knife set - the metropolitan. The metal on the metropolitan is less sturdy and the handles are a cheaper material, but the reason I presume they are more expensive is because they are better quality. They sharpen easily and cut properly. I would recommend those over the Classic Chef any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word....TERRIBLE!","review":"My parents have a set of Chicago cutlery that they got for their wedding decades ago, and it's still a great set for them.

Their serrated edge means that they tear whatever you are cutting, and they stick to the chopping board (if you are using a wooden chopping board).

He fought through the war to its end, serving in the battles of both Ypres and the Somme.Undertones of War is the memoir which he wrote about that period.Delicately written and insistent, Undertones of War focuses on both the nostalgia for the countryside left behind and on the deep sorrow of trench warfare.

First of all, the length of the fingers and thumb weren't sewn for universal use. This creates a small ridge right in the middle of your palm which creates a pressure point when lifting, and when you're bench pressing a lot of weight, you definitely feel the irritation. The second thing I noticed with these gloves is that they tear way too easily. I've only had them for about one month and I already have tears on the pinky side of both gloves. They obviously weren't constructed to last and I now i know I should've just payed more for higher quality gloves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good Gloves","review":"I was looking for a light weight gloves to lift with because my hands begin to ache when doing pull ups and deadlifts.

Thanks to the copious documentation of the template inaccuracy, I was able to correct the template (one hole was off by one diameter) using the spacer block, which _was_ correctly drilled. Installation was quick and easy. Both my wife and I like this device better than the unit it replaced. If you're a real nitpicker, take off one star for the template, spacer holes (should be larger if you need to use it - just drill them), or the 1-2 degree \\"lean,\\" noted by SZQ.

When the block it turned sideways to get the knife handles out of your face, so to speak, it is really noticeable. When the handles are facing you the handles are tilted a bit to the ceiling. Very annoying to look at but functionally it is a good space saver and very convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice space-saver","review":"We had two knife blocks on the counter, with lots of dull knives in them. We bought two good Global knives, and sent the rest packing to the drawer or the summer cottage. Now we have more counter space and sharp knives. The reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 is that it doesn't fit under our cabinets in their recommended installation. Our cabinets are 12 inches (30 cm) deep, and when I installed the block as recommended, it would bump against the wall when I tried to rotate it. So I had to move it forward about 1 inch (2-3 cm). If your cabinets are 13 inches (33 cm) or deeper, you should be okay. Also, the template was slightly off on one of the holes, so check the template against the pilot holes on the block, and modify the template before you mark the cabinet for drilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"great niche product","review":"For those of you who have huge kitchens, stop reading now. For those like me, for whom counter space is at a premium, this is a great product. Fits nicely under the cabinet, although you need to think before you blindly follow the template. If your cabinets are 12\\" deep cut about 1\\" off the front of the template orthe block will bind against the wall as it turns. Slots fit my knives and steel perfectly. Really glad I got this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot","review":"I bought one of these years ago and it has served me very well. However the current product is not the same. First of all the product is not made with any quality. The wood is green and the glue joints separate so badly that my son, who is a woodworker, said there was no way he could fix the last one I bought. Then we get to the knife slots. There is not one slot wide enough for a normal size chef's knife, basic to any knife set. The sharpening steel slot, which on my old block is on the bottom row, is on the top row of slots and, as every steel has a hanger ring, that falls in front of the knife slot below it. For a company as well know as Wusthof it is a disgrace. I sent a letter with photos to Wusthof USA to which I received no reply. Shame on Wusthof!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice finish but doesn't fit","review":"This knife block has a very nice finish, however it doesn't fit under any standard cabinet. The block that mounts to the underside of your cabinet is about 1\\" too thin to allow the block to swing out as it is designed. Also, the template does not match the mounting holes in the swivel block, and the screws are not the right length. I am returning mine for a refund.Also of note - the block holds the knife in place by magnets that can scratch/mark the blades of your fine cutlery when you pull the knife out or slide it in.Altogether, this is a non-starter. Yes, I could modify it and make it work but when you pay this kind of a price for a block of wood with slots in it you shouldn't have to re-manufacture it to make it work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good block but mounting difficulties","review":"I gave this a 2 and returned it because I did not realize that I had to drill holes through the cabinet and secure it with screws from inside the cabinet to mount it. Also the shelves inside my cabinet are not removable, without a right angle drill attachment it is impossible to countersink the holes from inside the cabinet for the flat head mounting screws to be flush with the bottom on the cabinet.The storage block itself appears to be well made and would solve the problem of not cluttering up the kitchen counter."},{"rating":"2","title":"knife holder","review":"great product, great value, only too much packaging...box, inside box, inside box...could have been reduced to save shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install, holds knives securely, needs a slot for kitchen shears","review":"On a quest to reclaim counter space and ditch my large countertop knife block, I ordered the Wusthof under-cabinet knife storage block. It installed easily using the provided template and includes an extra spacer block in case you need to drop the knife block down below a deep cabinet lip.The under-cabinet knife block does what it's supposed to do, keeping knives safely out of way while still making them accessible when you need them.

Having the rear port and being able to control its reflections to ideally tweak the phasing with larger mains was my reasoning behind this selection.This is a very satisfying subwoofer, although bass extension isn't spectacular and it produces a fair amount of port noise on the lowest notes. It's a great sub for music and excellent for the money, and a definite step up from integrated home theater subs. Unless you push this sub too far (and produce a lot of port chuffing) or you really know what truly deep bass extension feels like, you will be completely happy with this sub--especially for the price.

This thing stopped working after light use in about 6 months. Velodyne is a respected name in the subwoofer industry but this thing does not cut it . Good velodyne subs cost a grand and then some. Quality control is sacrificed on the cheaper models. Also the power rating is misleading. Your sub has to be able to handle more than 100 watts especially when paired with a good quality amp.

This one, however, has sliding panels that are encased in tough, solid cardboard pages, and is almost impossible for small children (ages 0-2?) to tear apart. The sliding action helps develop eye-to-hand coordination, and the panels move easily from side to side, avoiding the frustration that some movable parts can create.

The young child notices apparations, as well as her mother, that sends the movie into a suspenseful story line that captures you throughout the entire movie. Well, at least it should have, but it wont. The story of the movie is rather orginial, however the overall story line downplays the excitement and general suspense that you would expect in a horror movie.

If you are trying to decide this and one of the other related movies, then try another one first, this one is far too slow and laughably boring. (I think Ringu and the amusing Uzumaki are best).I'm glad I didn't see the American movie first, something this bad won't translate. The comments on divorce/motherhood just do not make sense to most Americans. Nor does the huge shame of having some psych treatment. Nor does not beating your building manager if you have a massive waterstain!! At least the themes of familial love, social estrangement and simple hate in A Tale of Two Sisters/The Eye/Ring made some sense.If I see another horror movie about a girl in water with long bangs, I'm shoving a hose in my head and turn it on til it explodes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre horror flick, disappointing ending","review":"Films made in other countries like this always seem to be too 'polite' and dont match up to U.S. made movies. Especially the poo coming out of the U.K. who like to fool us with interesting looking DVD covers.The dripping water was a good spook spoof and the acting was acceptable for lip-synced foreign films. I would have given the movie 1-2 more stars if the ending was done differently, and they could have done it on low budget.It may be more of a hit in other countries (why I didn't give it 1 star) but after watching enough American horror movies your expectations may be too trained to enjoy this one.[Updated: Sorry, previous review gave too much away.]Grade: D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hang in there folks","review":"I bought this dvd for $4 and had no idea what it was aboutso was I surprised how creepy this flick is.You must be patient and hang on the pay off is well worth it.This really is a fine film and I think the acting is top notch.See it."},{"rating":"1","title":"it s not great movie","review":"bueno..debo decir..que ya estoy un poco cansado de tantas peliculas..japonesas de terror.. que siempre..se vuelven muy repetitivas,,,esta no es la excepcion..lo unico emocionante son los ultimos minutos.. no se si considerarla terror.. o drama..pero..creo que ya es un tipo de pelicula que repiten mucho...saludos"},{"rating":"1","title":"On Man Caravan","review":"A very boring read with no soul.

Based on his opinion, I almost did not buy this book. I am very glad to say I did buy it and will read it many more times. Understanding that the book was written 70+ years ago, the travel was more of an adventure than the method of travel, and what this man accomplished on a relic of a bike is astounding. You cannot buy this kind of adventure today for any money. Read it with an open mind, place yourself in the writer's boots, and imagine trying this today on a modern bike. Would you write about the bike or the travel? The writer's bike receives enough space to satisfy and intrigue the reader, the adventure of his travel will stay with you much longer than the type of bike he rode. Buy this book, it is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Man Caravan","review":"The best travel book I have ever read. As a young man in 1933, almost on a dare, Robert Fulton rode a Douglas motorcycle (which he still owns) around the world, not only seeing some increible places but writing about them in a highly entertaining and informative way. The book, like the trip, lacks the higher agenda which mar so many travel stories. Fulton simply set out to have a grand adventure and to write about it with humor and respect for those he met. You'll want to go right now to see some of these places for yourself. My favorite is the spot where Krakatoa once stood, marked by flames on the surface of the sea. A must read for anyone who likes a good travel story."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite CD....","review":"I consider myself a metalhead of color.

It's got heavy low-end grooves, the clanky bass guitar, a guitar/keyboard solo here and there, lounge piano and atmospheric textures, and a fantastic lead singer like you've never heard.

Unfortunately, when this arrived I discovered it had the kind of bristles that resemble those that don't last. And that's exactly what happened, big clumps coming out by the third use, and the bristles aren't really that strong at cleaning either.

But the backlight is a downgrade from our previous brand. This thermometer requires you to plug it into your cigarette lighter(CLA) in order to see the backlight and then stays on the whole time it's plugged in. We find the need to be plugged into the CLA to be annoying since we often use the CLA to power our other electronics (like cellphones).

They beat the ones I had 100% in total sound reaching the ear canal. This helped block out the extraneous sounds of engine and multiple conversations. Plus, the bass was solid as well.

Rest assured, they won't weigh you down.- The sound is average, but the volume is more than you need for most applications.- The cord is a little short. Not an issue for me, but it may cause you some hiccups.Bottom line: For the price, I'm not sure you can find a better pair of headphones, particularly if you're an avid athlete. I've gone through countless \\"active\\" headphones from $15 to $75 that were unusable after only a few months of regular use.

Unfortunately Sony makes crap now, and this pair I bought just stopped working 5 months later after using them 4-5 days a week for about 30-60 minutes each day.

The fact that they kept slipping coupled with the wind noise issue kept me distracted and aggitated to the point where I couldn't enjoy my work out.

Seriously?). These things have pretty good sound, are comfortable, and are so cheap that they're practically giving them away. That's the good news. The bad news is they have a life span of only a few months of heavy use. Without fail, audio will go out in one ear or the other, and then it's time for a replacement. My Amazon order history is littered with entries from purchasing pairs of these. I've been known to buy two at once, so I'll have one on deck for when the first one starts going out.

It's very annoying and I have already stopped using them for this reason.If you're considering some lighter headphones for working out with, it's just not worth it to save a gram here or there in weight.

I used to like these Sony's a lot until I tryed the Creative ones, they are incredable. The bass is out of the world, and you don't have to adjust them even once and they are really comfortable.

I have gone though about half a dozen of these same headphones in my lifetime and all of them have ended up in a landfill.Why did I go through half a dozen of these headphones you ask? 1.

Whether they work for you depends on your intended use. These I've used for exercise, while I have a different, nicer pair, that I use for everything else. They are perfect for running, or any other exercise you can imagine. Cheap enough to take out into the elements or into the sauna. They aren't going to win any sound awards, but they sound way above average for a $10 set. Very lightweight and won't fall out of your ears like earbuds. The con is that they last as long as a $10 set. Depending on use they seem to last about a year. One of the two earphones will go out first, followed by the other. Not sure if this is a flaw or merely because of the sweat that gets into them and the general rough treatment I give them.

After several months, the wire connections break either by the ear piece or the connector.

The older set folds and has awesome sound but I know they won't last forever. I bought two pair of the W08L after reading some of the reviews posted here. As others report, sound quality is very good. Construction is all plastic so they are very lightweight. To decrease the possibility of accidental wire damage I added a few drops of quick set expoxy cemement to stabilize the wires against the frame thus providing some resistance to inadvertant jerks on the wire.

Works for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"the sound went out in my old headphones so this one looked pretty good. i ordered them and when they arrived i was so disappointed. these headphones are very light but thats because their so cheaply made. it feels like if i sneeze while wearing them they would just rip apart. the wires also feel like that so you gotta be very careful to not tear them up. They are also very short on me so if i put them in my pocket while at the gym they keep on pulling my head down when i walk around.( im 5.9\\" by the way) i placed an order for a different product and hopefully its more durable then this...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Flimsy for Exercising","review":"These headphones are way too flimsy to stay put when running on the treadmill. They fit fine when I'm still, but as soon as I start running, one side comes out and rests on my outer ear, while the other side is barely in, not to mention the head band keeps migrating down. I kept having to adjust it while exercising, which was super annoying. Next time I'll shell out the extra money to get the Sony MDR-A35G S2, still lightweight but stay put in your ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 2 months","review":"I bought this headphone 2 months ago, and it already stopped playing any sound on the right side. Very disappointed. I run with it every other day for only an hour, so only a total of 30 hours of playing and it is already kaput. Cheap material and poor construction quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for the 15 seconds they worked...","review":"Found these inexpensive earphones. On the first use, the right earphone quit after about 15 seconds. Sounded great while they lasted! I'm going to get a replacement and see if they last longer. Call me crazy, but I think just because a thing is cheap, doesn't mean it shouldn't work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Not Reliable","review":"After reading reviews of these headphones on this site and others, I took the chance thinking it wasn't that much wasted if they didn't last long. I also liked the style - I didn't want ear buds which take more \\"prep time\\" to put in when I'm at the gym. However, I was unable to use these Sony MDR-W08L - they gave me a shock within one minute of use. I tried using them on different electronic devices (6 in all) and each time, I received an electronic shock every few minutes while using them. Another minus - the cord is shorter than most - I'd rather have a longer one that allows for more adjustment to an individual's different heights even if it needs to be wrapped a little bit.On the plus side, I asked for and received an immediate credit from Amazon, and was able to get a different model/style altogether, and it's working great."},{"rating":"1","title":"These headphones don't stay in!!","review":"I bought these headphones b/c they were reviewed in Shape magazine. It was said that they stay in place and you barely even notice you're wearing them. WRONG! These headphones drift out of my ears as I run, and it's completely random as to which side will stay in. Sometimes both sides pop out! It's so frustrating and annoying as I'm running to constantly be pushing them back in. The sound is great when both earpieces are actually in my ears, but that is rarely the case! Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lost them recently and glad I did","review":"they sound ok, except what good it's for if earpieces constantly fall out and the head band won't stay put. And how could it be otherwise the way they are build as little speakers rigidly facing forward. I saw some reviewers claiming the opposite, but I think they got confused about the product they are reviewing, or else they have heads shaped to special Sony specifications. I finally lost them somewhere to which I could only say: good riddance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than standard earphones","review":"Much better and more comfortable that came with my IPOD. I use these when doing yardwork or working out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable quality with durability issues","review":"I have been using this model headphone easily 10 years. I tried 2 similar Sony sport models costing twice as much and the headbands broke within 1 week and no improvement in audio quality. The lightweight design allows for extended usage without ear fatigue or irritation to the outer ear. In the summer while mowing the grass or bike riding sweat will clog the sound holes or cause an un-equalizing seal in the ear, must dry it off and move on! As far as durability I agree with James a good pair could last nearly a year but 2 or 3 months is more realistic. I feel that there has been a decrease in quality over the years. But the $9.99 price makes these headphones a disposable product! It would be nice if Sony would fix this problem. After my experience with a Sony MD player these headphones are the only Sony product that I will buy. For more critical listening try Yamaha RH5MA Headphones $59.99."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic iPod/MP3 headphones - nothing more","review":"These headphones are definitely a bottom tier set. The frequency response is poor at both ends of the spectrum and everywhere in between. The sound reproduction quality is muddy. They distort badly at a relatively low volume.

I can't say enough good stuff about them. The last pair I bought was 10 years ago and I took them with me everywhere, travelling, in my hand bag, on the train, plane, you name it.They are just AWESOME for physical exercise. Some earphones pull out of your ears when you run with them, these ones don't budge. They're just great, and the quality is awesome. The price is fantastic. A comparable pair cost 10 times more! I purchased 3 of these as they no longer offer them in my country so shipped them all the way home. Can definitely recommend these if you want to do physical exercise or just wear them with you when travelling or at work. Really durable and great quality - super light and flexible too . Thank you Sony!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke After 9 Months...","review":"I loved them while they worked. I used them whenever I used my iPod because they're louder than earbuds.

You get what you pay for..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just hate the way they fit.","review":"The sound quality on these headphones are not bad, but the way they fit irritates me. I have a normal sized head and they fit so loose you would swear they were made for not a human but perhaps a moose instead. I haven't had the full affect of the sounds because they barely tickle my ears. I bought these becase I don't really like ear buds, but I didn't want bulky head phones while exercising either. What a mistake. Next time I will go in to an actual store to purchase some headphones a bit more snug. Other than that they came in when they said they would and they were in the condition described.

Lightweight, decent sound, cheap - AND COMFORTABLE!","review":"These is the most comfortable headphones I've used, and I've bought and used some very nice ones. I wear glasses and regular headphones become painful after 30-60 minutes. Ear plugs trap moisture in the ear canal and that's uncomfortable after a few hours. While it may seem nothing will make me happy, these headphones do. I've used them for several weeks now, and I'm still happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My second pair!","review":"My first pair lasted over 5 years. This is unheard of with corded headphones. They get hung up, yanked off, whatever and cut out. My original set has been pulled off while mowing the lawn, hung up in trees and stolen by my dog when I set it down. It is just starting to cut out in one ear so I opted to replace them before they quit. The new headphones work and sound great. Better than an expensive Koss set I had that quit within a few months. There are no earbuds to wear out or replace either. I love them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought these twice, and twice failed!","review":"I really like the feel of these, most headphones hurt my head or ears, but these don't. However after my first pair failed in the right ear, I thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt. Now on my second pair, and the right ear failed again! I was happy with them the first time, but now I would NOT recommend these to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones for the price","review":"These replace Sony MDR-AS35 and their immediate predecessors. Reviewers said they were better for one third the money. Reviewers were correct. The treble is perhaps slightly rolled off compared to the AS35s, but not in the annoying way it is with my old Sharper Image noice-cancelling phones. Sounds \\"softer\\" rather than \\"duller\\", if that makes any sense, but instrumental definition on Wagner is nevertheless good. Where the AS35s were better was in the user details: they fold nicely, they come with an extension cord (short for shirt, long for pants pocket). Unfortunately they break easily as well. The W08L probably won't last any longer, but at the price you can buy three for the price of one, which is what I am going to do shortly. In one word: a sleeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these","review":"I love these headphones. I purchased a pair for my daughter and I accidently broke them.

The only bad thing is that inevitably one ear-bud will die, leaving sound only coming out of one ear-bud. I typically buy three of these at a time since they are so cheap, and they usually don't last more than 6 months. But they work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGH Value","review":"This is my 2nd set of these Sony headphones - having lost the originals in a recent home move. They are especially comfortable to wear - easily adjustable and VERY light. I use them for audible text using an Amazon kindle reader, so the sonic range, for my use, is pretty constrained, That said, their performance has been excellent. I did not experience any loss of audio over time (broken wires reported in other reviews) but used them with reasonable care over the course of 18-20 months. I will certainly not stress the wire-to-headset connection knowing now that it may be a weak point. For the price, however, you can't go wrong. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"wouldn't buy again","review":"Sound was crackling and the band part of headphones was so flimsy they barely stayed in place.

As with all headphones, the wires are subject to breakage when pulled, so I keep an extra pair or two available. They last for 2-3 months of fairly heavy usage. I listen to audiobooks and music while I'm ironing, cooking, knitting and walking. I started using this brand and style of headphones when the children were infants because the earpieces do not block sound. They just sit comfortably in the outer part of my ear. I've tried earpieces that came with my mp3 player, but I can't tolerate the irritation from having them in my ears. Heavier headphones flatten my hair and block sound. These are definitely my favorite headphones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As expected","review":"These headphones are everything I expected. It was described as no-fluff, which it is. But, they're perfect for my needs. I needed light, over-the-head headphones with earbuds for my workouts, especially when I run. They don't budge during my workout. The sound isn't bad either. It's not high-quality sound, but that's not what I purchased these for. If I want high-quality sound, I'd use my Shure or Seinheiser headphones. I'd buy these again in a heartbeat. In fact, I may buy a couple more as back-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony Headphones","review":"These are wonderful headphones, I had a pair prior to these so I knew how great they were. Only reason I bought another pair was that I had caught the headphones on the cabinet and they had only sound in 1 ear.

The sound clarity is good, sound quality towards the high frequency part with lacks of bass if compared to my other earphones of the same size driver.

The sound quality is great with a good low end (bass), and they are certainly more durable than they feel. But they are cheaply made and will not last. The left earphone became temperamental and eventually stopped working altogether. I believe this is due to the wiring not being securely attached - it is probably cheaply soldered with no other support.The most frustrating thing is that the warranty is for 90 days and this is how long mine lasted. A replacement pair would probably break also. Don't be tempted by the price like i was - put the money towards something of better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 6 months","review":"I bought these earphones based on all the good reviews.

I wonder if it was because of my sweat, but the they are now useless. I guess these are not sweat proof (It doesn't say so and they don't appear to be).

They're made entirely of polypropylene, a scent-free, harmless clear plastic (no smelly vinyl), so they look very modern. They're sealed on all sides, rather like a clear DVD case, so they're dust free. Since they're sealed on all sides they're essentially flat boxes (sort of) which you can stack them any way you like. A transparent cover insert area, again like a DVD case, for creative customization (or just let the first page of your papers show through the cover, that works too!). Another practical advantage: A 1\\" binder only needs 1\\" of shelf space, whereas a traditional 1\\" binder would need about 1 1/2\\" at the front where those old fashioned giant metal rings would go. No metal here... the choice is clear (pun intended). Love them!

Also, if you have other 77mm filter sized lenses, the you can share your polarizer, ND and UV filters with the Sigma 50mm f1.8 instead of buying a whole new set for this little Canon lens.

This lens, for it's awesome price, did not disappoint! Sure, it's light, and the manual focus is nothing to brag about but for what you are paying, it definitely gives great sharp images. I did not buy the kit lens because most people I know barely use theirs. I am so happy with this purchase and I highly recommend it to anyone who is starting out in photography - which a lot of you know is a very expensive hobby. I use it mostly to take portraits of my children and since they are all over the place I don't mind moving along with them since this is a fixed lens. Since this lens is so inexpensive I have more money to spend on a good wide angle and a telephoto. All in all this is a great everyday lens!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent starter lense","review":"Recently picked up photography (refurb'd Canon Rebel XT) and got this as my first lens. I had my doubts when I first saw it. It's really cheaply constructed (plastic everything, feels flimsy) and the manual focus ring is tiny and pretty laughable, but this lens produces AMAZING images for the price. Not to mention the ability to stop down to 1.8 which has some stunning dof/bokeh. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a solid lens to do portraits and general shots.Pros- Dirt cheap- f/1.8 allows for shallow DOF and neat bokeh- light and compact, not going to bother you carrying it around- Pretty quick auto focus- Produces AMAZING looking picturesCons- Kinda noisy- Aforementioned poor build quality- Manual focus is laughable"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uber \\"Bang for the Buck\\"","review":"Before purchasing this lens I did my homework.

IS usually better for low-light. Iffy auto-focus","review":"This lens is overrated. I just took two shots of newspaper print with my XSI camera in low-light. One with this 50mm f1.8 lens at 1/160 and f2.8, and the other with my 18-55mm IS kit lens at 1/40, f5.6. The resulting image with the 18-55mm kit lens was much sharper. So my simple test proved (to me anyways) that the IS makes the kit lens a better low-light performer (unless you need the higher shutter speed to stop the action). The only other reason to get this lens is the shallower depth-of-field afforded by the wider aperture. I would really find this useful, but the other thing I've noticed about this lens is that it often misses the focus. So I can't trust it.Also feels far too fragile to throw the lens in my camera bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but very limited.","review":"This lens takes great pictures, but why spend $85 for such a limited lens.

Suddenly my Rebel XTI is almost like a range-finder camera and is so much more usable. The lens produces excellent images, both with daylight and in low light. I strongly suggest using a rubber lens hood to keep flare low and to protect the lens; a hard plastic hood will not absorb shocks, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pictures, fast focusing even in low light","review":"Great first experience with a prime lens. Currently using Tamron 17-50mm f/2.8 as my main lens on Canon 7D.

The lens is excellent even in the poor lighting at the gym. Saw quite a few reviews mentioning questionable build quality, but no issues on my part; awesome bokeh, fast, and light. This is my first prime, so I'm not an expert by any means but I don't have any reservations about this lens. And for the price? highly recommended. Will post more after I've had it for a few weeks.

Once you do get a good one this lens is never coming off your camera. Is has perfect sharpness, even at 1.8. Its a tad slow to focus and is noisy. It feels like a plastic toy from a snack box but dang, it has awesome glass and thats what matters.You're not going to find a lens under $400 that can perform nearly as well as this one does. Its extremely sharp that your eyes will bleed, it has perfect contrast and color. No true canon fan would be without this lens.Due to its awesome 1.8 fstop its great for low light.

I was holding out to buy the 50mm F1.4 at 3 1/2 times the price, then decided I would buy 50mm F1.8 to see what a diffence that aperture would make.

Great for portraits.- Focusing is spot on. Takes good pictures in low light (because of high f/stop)- Is built well enough, nothing to complain about.- Is economic making it a good investment for beginners.Cons:- Focal length 50mm: on a D-SLR with crop 1.6 focal length is actually 80mm (crop 1.5 = 75mm), you really have to step back when taking pictures indoors, otherwise be prepared to crop someones head or feet off :)- is a little noisy, but that can be ignored when compared to the pictures it produces. And it is not USM, it is a regular 50mm lens.Overall, this lens is great for the price and I would recommend this over the kit lens for beginners.Update:This is not a replacement for the Kit Lens, but a great lens to begin with.

It is so slow, noisy, and at times inaccurate that you're better off keeping it on manual. Also, 50mm on a cropped sensor is really an 85mm lens, putting you uncomfortably close to friends and other subjects.Personally, I think this is a waste of money.

I wish i had brought one when i first got my camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon EF 50mm 1.8 review!","review":"Solid 4 star rating great lens for the price. It is not as sturdy as other Canon lenses, but works very good. The price may lead you to believe that this lens is cheap, however, do more research and you'll see its an awesome little investment. Great beginner lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon f 1.8 prime lens","review":"If you have to have one lens for your Canon DSLR, buy this one. For about a $100 you get a super sharp, fast lens that you can shoot with in low light and get a soft background focus effect- perfect for portraits.This is a fixed lens (no zoom, just focus) and it is not stabilized (anti-shake) but you won't need it because it lets in so much light that you can shoot at faster shutter speeds.It has a plastic lens mount and a cheap look and feel (but the glass is first rate) but who cares when it works as well as $1000+ L series lenses.Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"This lens is a fantastic value. It is plastic and doesn't feel nearly as good as other lenses, but when push comes to shove it does its job very well for a very low price. (The auto focus is noisy, but not prohibitively so.)My wife and I are about to have our first baby so budget is a concern-- because of this lens I will be able to take sharp pictures without a flash at a price we can afford."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat it pound for pound, dollar for dollar","review":"Light, compact, fast, cheap. I have had mine a few months not with moderate use and have had no issues. Manual focus ring is small, but usable. I love this lens, and will not buy the more expensive F/1.4 untill i break this, If i ever do! The Immage sharpness i found to be incredible when stopped down to F/2.8 to F/5.6 and expert lens reviews confirm this. This lens actually is sharper at most F-stops than the 1.4 according to lens reviews. for the 100ish bucks this thing costs you cannot beat it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with ease of use (extreme SLR novice).","review":"I purchased this lens just cause and I must admit the pictures I've taken with it so far have not disappointed me. I prefer to use the lens in Manual Focus...it seems like the little motor is working so hard and I'm not ready to make the jump to the next model so to give it a break and me more experience in learning, this is fine. My only real complaint with this lense, is the material its made from. With all lenses you should be careful, but this one because of its delicateness you have to show a little more caution. Overall I am pleased with my purchase, I would recommend this product and defintely purchase from this retailer again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"I love the price of this lens for what I got.

All for just $79. Throw away your zoom lenses people and get this fantastic lens!"},{"rating":"1","title":"front focus","review":"Maybe I had bad luck. I bought this a new 50mm/1.8 from amazon, unfortunately it is front focus. I sent it back to Canon service center twice, first time they replaced the motor (they said the motor was not working well), second time they replaced the barrel (they said the barrel was distorted). But it still has the \\"front focus\\" problem. So this lens is almost useless for me, and I almost never used it, and it is still \\"NEW\\" in the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a waste of money, but a waste of time","review":"This lens is worth about what you pay for it. It's very soft around the edges when wide open. Optics are so-so, but the build quality is very cheap. I think someone else likened it to a \\"Cracker Jack Toy\\". That pretty much sums it up. This lens, if put to good use in the field, would literally fall apart. It felt so \\"cheap\\" in my hands...rattle...creaking, loose, cheap. I got rid of it just as quick as I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens!","review":"Just what I wanted! In love with my pictures! Gives you great depth for portraits and up close shots. Love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"The lens works great considering the price. The low aperture makes for good portrait photography. My only complaint is the noisiness of the lens when on auto focus. Other than that it does a good job and takes great photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money. Sharp photos but noisy focus motor","review":"I just jumped ship and moved over from Nikon and picked up this lens to go with my 60D. It is fast and sharp. The only downfall is the noisy focus motor. It's not a turn off but its what you get for $100. Overall a great buy and a must for any DSLR owner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have...","review":"I bought this lens for my EOS 20D. The image quality is just excellent, on par with lenses way more expensive. With my 20D, the 1.6 crop factor makes it an 80mm f/1.8 lens, which is perfect for portraits. Very recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A hell of a sharp lens","review":"This lens is really sharp in low light. Great for highlighting your subject on a blurred backdrop. The only fault is that it's automatic. There are no markings on the lens, e.g. distance, aperture opening, etc. On my T2i the necessary information is displayed on the camera screen. I guess I'm too old-school... I still carry a tape measure in the field. Like I said: one hell of a sharp lens for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Fast Lens","review":"I don't regret this purchase one bit. This lens is awesome. The amount of light and speed you get at this price, you can't pass it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little lens","review":"This is a great lens, especially for the price. My first real test of it was during parents' night at my daughters' gymnastics class. The gym has very poor lighting for photography, and flashes are forbidden (don't want to cause an accident). With this lens opened up and my Canon 40D in manual mode (shooting at 1/125 and ISO 1600 with +2eV), I was finally able to get some good \\"action\\" shots of my girls. I was able to shoot complete tumbling passes without a lot of motion blur and still have enough light to actually see something without a lot of post processing. My only complaint is that the lens is so small, there's not much to hold onto while shooting handheld. I let a friend of mine borrow it for a basketball game, and he's getting one for Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Lens for Amature Photographers","review":"I bought this lens because I need a fast lens (wide aperture) for night/indoor photography and it's been a great addition to my camera equipment.When it arrived it was nicely packed in the box and had the warranty card so you can register it at Canon. I was a little disappointed that Canon only offers a 1 year warranty on it's products, but what can you do?I will admit the lens itself does look kinda \\"cheap\\" since it's made out of two or three different plastics, but the pictures look GREAT! If you have another $200 to spend I would get the EF 50mm f/1.4 since it has a USM motor if it's AF, but if your on a budget this lens will work great for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every cent it cost","review":"I am writing this review from a dollar value perspective. For the price this lens delivers quality pictures and I would have to say in some cases it far exceeds what one would expect given the low price. The only criticism I have from a capability standpoint is that it delivers rather soft pictures but acceptable nonetheless. Most people who own a DSLR also have a computer and probably have some sort of editing software that will allow the sharpness to be adjusted somewhat so problem solved. I use Lightroom 2 on all my photos to tweak them to their max potential. I think this lens would be a great gift for anyone with a DSLR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best little cheap lens","review":"I love this lens, great for people on a budget who want to get into photography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Affordable Lens I've bought","review":"This lens, for less than a hundred bucks, is 95% of what I shoot with, it's great for shooting people and is fast enough to perform when the light isn't up to par."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens","review":"great lens - tricky to get DOF at first. Very apparent pentagon shapes with lights (e.g. xmas tree lights). But for $90 not a bad deal. And it's super lightweight."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Canon value for that perfect shot... but step up quality control Canon!","review":"This really is the best Canon value for that perfect shot! My only down side is that there are some soft qualities about it and I still can't find a flawless lens. After returning two others... I still see imperfections in the glass. I think Canon needs to step up their quality control on this one. This doesn't seem to affect my photos, but it's not true prime glass quality. Otherwise, when it spot on... this one makes you smile. Totally worth the cost... My only down side now is that I want the 50mm 1.4! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nifty fifty - 50mm review","review":"Amazing pictures using this lens. Autofocus works great.

The pictures I took with it are great! Sharper than the pics from my XTI IS lens.

Most of the time, reinstalling the battery does not resolve the error so I always carry my kit lens.It is kind of frustrating that you just never know when this lens will work and when it will not. :-(I am now looking for a more dependable lens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality lense.

But this lens makes me look like I know what I'm doing!From reading the other, more concise, reviews about this lens I guess I got lucky in the build. I've had this lens since Sep 2007. It was my exclusive lens all of 2008 and most of 2009. It's been knocked around (gently) but still holds up. Eventually I'll probably have to think about replacing it and will probably do so with the same, instead of the \\"better\\" but more expensive 1.4. Only because I recently got a 60mm macro lens that I'm having fun with now, giving the 50mm a much needed rest. (I think.)So, like another reviewer said, if you're on the fence about this photography thing, do not hesitate to buy this lens. It really does help you take amazing pictures. p.s. my camera is the Rebel XT. check out some pics I've uploaded in the customer images gallery."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Buy","review":"It is a great buy. For the low price you pay, you will be amazed by how much it can do for you. It allows you to take pictures at low light condition and take great portrait photos. There is nothing to complain about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens","review":"I bought this lens because of the reviews I read and the years of experience Canon has had to perfect this lens. I do not regret buying this lens at all, as a matter of fact I use it all the time when shooting people. Love the clarity and how easy it is to use it, but most I like the 1.8 Fstop, you get some great shots with almost no light.I would buy this lens over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"great lens and inexpensive too","review":"got this lens for my XS and it's great. i use it often during family gatherings and vacation. i was torn between this and the f/1.4 version but couldn't justify spend the additional $$$ especially when i'm just getting into DSLRs. it's a great lens for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great portrait lens! Quick review for beginners with ambitions","review":"Picture quality, speed (large max. Aperture) are sensational for the price.The question for me was: will this 50 mm be useful on my 1.6 crop rebel? The answer is yes - absolutely, the focal length of approx. effective 80 mm works very nicely for portrait shots. The range is actually more flexible than what I had expected - it is usable at more than just one distance. My fotos actually have benefited from being forced to one length, with standard zoom I sometimes intuitively zoom to the same framing on each foto. This lens forces some creativety for portrait shots that can help a beginner.Even in low light, it is increadibly easy to shoot decent portraits without flash, because of the large possible aperture. It make a very big difference to be able to shoot around f2 vs. f4.Avoid f1.8, f2.2 is my personal minimum for excellent compromise of speed and sharpness. F2.2 works great in dark indoor rooms.For the price, this lens is amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good lens but too close for digital","review":"They improve pretty well the lighting, they are much faster than my 28-105mm 3.5-4.6 so I use them on dark environments. The only bad thing for me is that they have a large focal length so not much gets in the picture if you use a digital SLR such as the Rebel XTi. If you dont care about that its a great price for lens like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst purchase I've ever had on amazon","review":"I was super excited to finally purchase this product for the price I was looking for. I have been researching this lens for a while and finally decided to pull the trigger and get it for a fun trip was taking to CA. Not only did it take 3 weeks to get to me and never got tracking on it. But when I finally got home to find the box after my trip. The lens was placed in a box without protective paper, nothing just sitting in the box. Lens are very fragile so I refused the package because of the large possibility of it being broken. So disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective unit?","review":"Immediately out of the box the lens was making grinding noises, It had terrible auto focus, and one month after purchase the lens housing actually FELL OUT while on a shoot.

Pretty fast if you ask me AND the seller included a set of three filters and a lens cleaning kit FOR FREE. This lens is really a good deal in terms of quality to price. The lens performs well as expected, however, it is constructed with mostly plastic so you just have to be a little more careful when you handle it.Will update when I have taken more shots with this lens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend the extra $275 for the better 50mm","review":"This lens is cheap, focus quality is awful. I shoot with a 7D, when I switched to the 50mm 1.4f for $375 the image quality rose tremendously. The 50mm 1.8f only has 5 blades and is made out of cheap plastic, you get what you paid for. The 50mm 1.4f is much better and has a better focus area than the 50mm 1.8f."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't Disappoint!","review":"I love this lens! I am VERY new to photography so this lens gives me so many more options! Some of the other reviews said the lens came in an unmarked white box with no instructions but I am happy to say mine didn't!

I suggest this lens for anyone starting out as a secondary lens, and for anyone looking for a new twist on typical photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS LENS!","review":"This lens is AWESOME! I only wish that it was a true 50mm on my T2i (in reality it's an 85mm because of the cropping).

But be aware if you are looking for 50mm lens for your non-full frame, consider the crop factor, for example if you own a Canon T series with APS-C it will be a 80mm lens (50 x 1.6 = 80), which I found to narrow for most indoor and some outdoors when you want to portrait people. For a 50mm equivalent on an APS-C consider Canon EF 28mm f/1.8 which will be 44.8mm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens","review":"I was so happy to play with an f-stop lower than 3.5.

This lens is fast and sharp but the auto-focus is slow and noisy. My photos are super sharp and the bokeh shots are sick. I also love the fact that it performs amazing in low light situations. I'm using this on a T4i and I own the kit 18-55mm IS II lens and the 55-250mm EF-S IS II lens and the 50mm kicks both their butts in both picture quality and low light performance. After reading some reviews & test done on this lens it destroyed the Canon 50mm f/1.4 and the 50mm f/1.2 L USM! The only thing is this lens make a strange noise when auto-focusing straight down but don't fear from what I've been reading and from talking to an old school Professional photographer its a normal thing. In short I believe I found my everyday walk around lens and I highly recommended this to anyone who is looking for amazing performance on the cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairly good","review":"Very good quality and very crisp, clear pictures.

I had been using it about 30 minutes and the auto focus just broke. It simply just quit working. Manual focus was intact, but auto was gone. I was so disappointed!!!!! I am mailing it back for a refund. I knew it was cheaply made from reading the reviews, but I really thought I would get at least a year or so out of it before it broke!

Not 10 minutes of use later it fell apart again. I did get probably a 1000 pictures out of it before it fell apart but I am finally now going to purchase the 1.4 version of this lens, so I would have been better off just getting that one in the first place.

I mainly bought this for portraits, but have used it for landscape a few times and am impressed with the quality of the image.Since this is not a zoom lens, taking landscape photos with this lens gets really interesting and I like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm embarassed to admit I own this lens, but I like it and use it often","review":"Review Update #1 11/23/2010This cheap lens is still working fine with no issues. I wouldn't use it for your top quality art shots, but if you're in low light, it works great.Original ReviewIt is cheap, \\"disposable\\", sharp, fast, accurate, and light weight. I use it for low light conditions. I did some research before buying it and found most people gave it a buy rating. It is not built to last, so don't drop it. But for the money, if you need a fast, cheap lens, this is a solution. If you have the extra money, I highly recommend the 1.4; is a much better lens with very deep saturation. But, I have taken some really cool shots with this humble 50 1.8"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent lens, a must have","review":"For the price every canon owner should have this lens. I recenly picked up aCanon Digital Rebel XTiand this lens along with it. I'd highly recommend it over the default lens that comes with the camera, the 1.8 makes for much better pictures even in lower light. I haven't yet had any issues with quality like other reviews mention but it's only 1 month young."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic pictures and I love the price","review":"I have had fantastic results with this little lens The pictures are crisp and match or better the quality of more expensive lenses.It is a delicate lens though and you have to be a little careful when handling it. Ive heard stories where people have broken the lens very easily hense the 4 stars instead of 5. But at this price you could just buy another one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good lens for the money","review":"probably what everyone else is saying: amazing optics for the money, poor build quality, but just dont drop in and you'll be fine"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meh, shouldn't have traded from the 1.4","review":"I sold my 50 1.4 to purchase some flash equipment, but after purchasing this lens I wish I would have kept the 1.4. I read that this is plastic construction, but it just feels cheap (at $100) I guess it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad AF","review":"great in total, but very bad auto focus, as much as i spend my time to tell you abut how much am disappointed about focusing in low light situation, keep searching for the focus point till you turn it to manual and show it to her..... ;0)but still great lens in that value of money( sharp, light like plastic toy, fast )"},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly constructed lens","review":"I bought an exact same lens in December of last year from AMAZON.com (I never got asked to review that lens) while purchasing a Canon DSLR(from DELL). While I was on a field trip,the lens fell apart physically in to two segments. I had to replace it right away and I rushed to buy another of the same kind as I felt it could have been a freak problem with one lens.Apart from its being a cheap and lite it was an okay lens.I wonder if I would get it repaired if it falls physically apart again, as Canon seemed to disown any responsibility for its doing so spontaneously!As an experienced photographer for over 45 years, I have never seen a lens that came apart when used in an acceptable manner and I've my doubts as to physical stability of Canon lenses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing lens","review":"I am a beginner and I am extremely pleased with lens. Yes, the construction quality is not the best but for this price you can't beat it! The quality is stunning for such an inexpensive lens. If you're hesitant on buying this, I would just go for it. There is NOTHING to lose.Also, my item came the next day I ordered it. Very pleased with this company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens","review":"For the price, (a bit long on the CCA sensor, it looks like a 80mm) it does the job. Next choice would be the $300.00 1.2 50mm lens. But I really don't need IS, USM, etc. I would like a 1.2 50mm manual prime lens instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best lenses I have ever tried!","review":"This lens is very fast with a 1.8 aperture. The depth of field when on 1.8 is 1.5 ft. I also like how you can get very close to the subject in question. It is also very affordable at only $100. I would definetely buy this as a starter lens or for someone who is quite experienced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp Lens, Inexpensive","review":"Canon - Lens - 50 mm - f/1.8 II - Canon EFGreat Lens, inexpensive, nice bokeh, good to have one around in your lens bag.AF is little noisy. for the price its well worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"canon 50mm f/1.8","review":"This is a awesome lens for portraits and low light you can get a good depth of filed look with this lens i have some pic taken with it on my web page [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Photographer's Buddy","review":"It is one of the best investments I have ever made. The lens is good, and its image quality is superb. The package cam in time, and I took some really awesome shots with it. Thanx seller for such a wonderful deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just amazing for the price","review":"I just love it. Is a really nice lens for the price. Pretty clear, I had nice shots impossible without flash with my other lens (3.5-5.6). Every body with an SLR camera should owned this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"CANT BEAT IT","review":"This is great cheep lens to have. Results are amazing I will be upgrading to the EF 50mm f1.4 USM but this has held me over in the meantime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy It","review":"Every one needs a prime. Depending on who you are you'll get a 50 or a 35. Working with a prime proposes composition challenges. And makes one a truly better photographer. I recommend this to anyone just getting into photography for two reasons: PRICE and OPTICAL QUALITY. This lens is dirt cheap. The over all high prices of DSLRs and lenses can scare people, but I show people this lens and the shots I've gotten with it. I mean this lens is amazing for the price. You can't beat it!The AF is noisy but not a problem. The AF is off sometimes as well. 95% of time this lens preforms. Everyone needs this lens in my opinion. Buy the f/1.4 option if you've got the money. Personally I don't see that much of a difference, besides better bokeh.This lens is great for the beginner. This lens is a great instrument for learning digital photography. Buy it now and don't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nifty fifty","review":"Best low-light lens for the money! I was leery of buying this lens because of its price. I mean come on, a SLR lens for $100? After friends recommended it I purchased it and haven't regretted it for a moment. The autofocus is a litle slow but that's the only downfall. Works flawlessly and even though the exterior is plastic, it's a tank!Update!! Almost 3 years later and it's my go to lens!! Get this lens if you have a Canon DSLR!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's waste money","review":"I already wrote some note that lens motor made some noise when I got this lens. Two months after, a front part of lens which was moving for focus fell out of the lens. And then I can't put this back, I tried but camera said lens sensor error. I can't take a picture any more with this lens. Please Don't buy this lens. You may be waste your money like me. I don't know they can fix for me. Where can I contact???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lens hood is a must for this cheap quality lens","review":"Please do not ignore the reviews on this lens when it comes to the build quality. I had always associated Canon with quality but this seems to be the one exception I've run across. I literally dropped it one foot, and it broke in two pieces on my first shoot. The glass is good, but the rest is bad, so if you must, make sure you pick up a lens hood to help prevent the same happening to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible quality and no options","review":"I have had this for almost three months and only used it once just to test it out. The other day I was pulling it out of my camera bag and the lens had just fallen out of it. I couldn't even get it back in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend the money on the 1.4 or 1.2","review":"This lens is made of cheap plastic and when it tries to focus it is super loud! No matter what the photos aren't crisp enough for me (a professional photographer). It is a waste of time and money. HOpe this steers someone the direction of the 1.4, a much better lens :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"lint inside my lens has","review":"Me just arrived a lens of 50 mm and I see that has 3 lint andetro, wanna know as change it,'m in Peru"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Quality Photos","review":"This lens takes very, very high-quality photos. The color/contrast is amazing, and there is no pixellation or anything!!!! I bought this lens 6 months ago as a backup lens, and I never used it. About a month ago, I looked this lens up and saw the great reviews, so I tried it again and I was floored. As an amateur 13-year-old photographer, this lens is great (for me), especially as I have a limited budget.Pros:Great quality photosGood autofocusVery lightCons:No zoomI hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"So sharp + perfect!","review":"If you KNOW how to use this lens (which I feel 99% of people who gave it 1 stars don't..), then you should know it's great and does EXACTLY what it's made for."},{"rating":"2","title":"cheap doesnt mean, bad!!!","review":"i use it as a kit lens on a t2i. after one year of use i understood that i need wide lens for close shooting, cause this lens is too long on aps 80mm approximately. i bought tamron 17-50 non vc(499$). after 2 month of use tamron i was comparing photos both of this lens and canon was sharper. go for it, its BARGAIN"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is on my camera most of the time","review":"Of my several lenses (including the L-series 100 mm macro and 70-200 mm telephoto), this is on my camera much of the time. It takes great shots on my 5D Mark III and it's so nice, compact and light weight. I chose this lens over the higher f stop versions with the thought that the 50 mm is very common and has been well researched and developed and should be a good value.. I have not been disappointed and anticipate sticking with this version.
