Child of God took the meaning of a great novel, and totally re-created it. This is not your everyday reading material, meaning... you will NOT be able to predict what's going to happen next. You will NOT feel as though this is a typical story line. This novel is one that will have you on the edge of your seats holding your breath to see what's going to happen next. The best thing about this story is that it touches on a topic that no other author (that i know of) has touched on. This is something that happens more often than we think. So if you are looking for a novel that is more of the same, this one is not for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Child of God...Lolita Files","review":"I read this excellent novel a couple of years ago.

I didn't care for the subject matter at all. In this novel, Files' attempts to make a romance novel about incist. The story lines jumps from one horrible scene to the next... In all fairness, the book is written very well,but again the topic is disgusting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let this one pass you by","review":"This is Lolita Files best book yet. At the beginning I got a little confused with who was married to who and who were the mother and father of the children, but once I got that straight the book was excellent.I read this book in one day. This book contained everything, drugs, incest, betrayal, murder you name it and it was in there.This is one of the best books I have read in 2002!!...Buy it you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Weird and Contradictory!","review":"What the--?????????This story was all over the place. Hard to make heads or tails of the situations. Too many storylines, no plot, no connections or weaving of the story together. I don't get it? What's the purpose of the story? All I can figure out are fires being set, incest, voodoo witchcraft and later in the story it flips to urban street lit with drugs, guns and hos. There are at least ten stories going on in this book and a whole lot of profanity too for this to be a \\"CHILD OF GOD.\\" The author would have been better off just taking the latter part of the book and writing an urban street story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Club Read","review":"I bought this book because it was picked from my book club.

When I first began reading I was not happy,and tempted to put the Kindle away. Lolita really grabs your attention with the violence and horror at the opening, but eventually comes full circle to connect her story.I found my mind captured by the word pictures,and experiencing the story as if I were one of the family. (You'll have to read \\"Child of God\\" to understand my comments.) I think it was well written and worth my investment of time and money. However, becareful of this read if you have a weak constitution!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highyly Intelligent & Courageous!","review":"For the first time in a long time I had to pick up a dictionary on several occasions to make sure through Ms. Files chosen words, I was getting the essence of the story. I didn't want to miss one morsel of information that she packed into every paragraph. The courage it took to tell a story that exists on some level in many families that few are willing to reveal was incredible. I was on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. Ms. Files is an awesome writer. It is the story of a family passing devastating and destructive behavior from one generation to the next until one person learns to accept themselves, the truth and accepts the courage to break the cycle. Well done, Ms. Files, well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GRIEVIOUS","review":"After reading this extremely dark, & dismal tale I was numb and disturbed, and seeking a way to process what I'd just ingested.

I'm still stunned...and not pleasantly so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page turner... Child of God","review":"This book was outstanding!!! From the first chapter to the very end, I couldn't find myself putting the book down. I had to finish it once I started. I actually made my co-worker drive so I could spend the hour trip finishing the story, and I was 5 pages from done by the time we pulled up to our apartment building.This book follows the story line of one family through at least 4 generations. The writings were so off the wall it sucked me into the story. I could literally see the characters in front of me acting out the scenes. I couldn't believe that this story engrossed me so deeply. I thank Ms. Files for writing this story. I am definitely passing this on to some friends. I just have to finish compiling my list of recently read stories. My library is steadily growing.

It was that good. I felt bad while reading it, but COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN! So many twists and turns, and everyone is soooo twisted in this book! There was so much deceit, lies, INCEST, hate, voodoo, drugs, sex, just sin, sin, sin! I think every sin mentioned in the Bible is commited here, and more than once! The ENTIRE family is so twisted, its kinda sad. You gotta buy this book, it is a must read(and re-read)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turner!","review":"My niece gave me this book to read and said that I would love it. She wasn't kidding!

The end will definitely surprise you! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"grim","review":"This book is about as much fun as an evening at the morgue. Ophelia, the heroine is the product of incest and has a baby by her own brother, the vicious Laertes. This book is a nasty gumbo of tabboo sex, voodoo and one tragedy after another.

Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incestuous","review":"This is an excellent book. This family had too many secrets. Sad, tragic, incestuous, twisted, and sadistic but it is a great book.

The author is obviously very passionate about her profession and takes it very seriously. This book is full of practical ideas on how to facilitate learning in the classroom.

Avoid at all costs. I have actually read some of this book. What I read was all very common sensical stuff. Judging from what I've seen of the author's teaching, I don't want to know what her more \\"enlightened\\" views are.All in all, don't bother.

The quality of the product I bought at the store was great and I love this product not only for taste and versatility but it is low cal. However, I was disappointed in the product I received via Amazon. It seemed that the toast was very brittle and if I had to guess I bet it was because maybe it was past its prime shelf life. I will still continue to order groceries from Amazon because for the most part I have been satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"These are great - they work well with peanut butter or flavored cream cheese for a sweet treat or with tuna or egg salad as well. I have them in place of toast since I am on low carbs and they are great with eggs in the morning. Serving size is two but I usually only need one so the carb count is only 5.5 that way. (11 for 2 pieces) They are a little dry to eat plain but I have buttered them and eaten them plain as well and that works too. I haven't tried it yet but I think they would work broken into a salad as croutons too.The only downfall I found is the packaging. Once opened you can't close it so I slide the opened package into a ziplock bag (gallon size) and they stay perfectly fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best ever","review":"Even on a modified gluten-free diet these are permitted for me. They have a slight buttery taste which makes them appealiing for all types of appetizers or snacks; they are especially good with a spread, like Nutella.

There are a variety of uses for these, from snacks to saads to main dishes--they are kid friendly also because of the great taste.

Every quote you you've ever read about him or interview you have ever seen has been doctored to portray him has a brutal, ignorant bully. But in truth he is a very introverted, intelligent, and compassionate human being. But, the media needs a villain so consequently we have an amazing misunderstanding of who the man really is.

One downside is its rather high price, but I wouldn't be replacing this one for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad workmanship and parts. I expected more from Kohler","review":"I bought two of these from Home Depot for a quick update to my 30-year old bathroom. One of the two faucets had a broken internal plastic part. I had been told by the Home Depot employee that Kohler products are high quality and only use metal parts. Well that was clearly wrong. I exchanged it without a problem. I should have gotten something different.3 years later, I noticed that one of the faucets began coming apart along the neck of the faucet that appears to be made up of two pieces of chrome-plated plastic snapped together. It's corroded now so I don't think it'll snap together.Not only that, but I get 100% volume after turning the knob about 30 degrees of the total 90 degrees. It's hard to fine tune the temperature.

Calling is, in my opinion, the most under-rated progressive rock album of all time. Thats a strong statement, considering I have heard hundreds of prog albums over decades of listening. It is definitely the stronger of However's two albums. I would rate it equal to any of the best material from Gentle Giant. The lyrics are both evocative and humorous. As a whole the song crafting is sensitive and adventurous, eclectic and subtle enough to warrant many listenings over a lifetime and still discover new things about it. For example, that blazing guitar solo is actually the melody from Charlie Parker's \\"Donna Lee\\". The bonus tracks sound like material for a third album that was never completed. They fit the tone of this album perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A blatant example of cultural racism.","review":"This book by Berenger contains the two most blatant examples of cultural racism currently in print that I have yet found.

It was highly unnecessary and insulting to 80's fans to include disparaging remarks about the decade and banal political commentary by obvious leftist sympathizers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"This book does exactly what the title says, it reveals the ugly side of the modeling business. However, it is an older book so you won't hear any recent names. There is another book out there, \\"Shut up and Smile\\" that covers more recent models. But the writing from that book is no comparison to this one. This book is by someone that knows how to write and the stories are very in-depth which can only make the book better. The pictures are also better in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great History Lesson on the Modeling Business","review":"This book was less gossipy than I thought it would be. The first 2/3rds are great. The book serves as a wonderful primer for anyone going into the modeling industry or just interested in its origins.The book starts out with the first official models, which were generally socialites. You get to read about how modeling agencies first formed and who the first models and clients were. The book follows along as agencies and models fall out and new ones come along. Close to the chapters around the 1980s/1990s you learn more about the all out \\"model wars\\" and the switching of models between agencies. Mixed in with all this history are bio chapters highlighting the stories of specific models along the years.The book is very interesting and makes me miss seeing the models on the cover of magazines! The book is slightly dated now but the history provided is still accurate and informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly about models from pre 70's era","review":"I thought this book would focus heavily on models of the 80's and 90's, but it's actually more like a history of modeling. Much of the book seemed to center on modeling/models from the 50's. These figures weren't familiar to me and I wasn't interested, so the book felt like a waste. I was kinda of shocked because the author was so ubiquitous as a go-to authority on modeling during the 90's.

The book was huge but I enjoyed every single page and appreciated the inclusion of photographs. The only complaint I have is that the mentions of Brooke Shields and Cindy Crawford were way too small. When I was an impressionable teen back in the 90's Cindy was THE SUPER-SUPERMODEL and when i was reeeeeally little it was all about Brooke (what i'm trying to say is I was actually alive at the time so I know this as first hand knowledge) so I was surprised that they barely got any attention.

It's just a fun movie without a deep dramatic plot but the idea of preventing slavery is the underlying theme & is not made fun of.

The fanciful story doesn't hold up as well as I remembered, but I still enjoyed watching it and am glad to have this added to my collection. Warning: They play the theme song seemingly all the way through the movie. While it is indeed a catchy tune, it got stuck in my head for days afterwards.

Because amongst all the embarrassing and unfunny moments; like a laughing sultan, two hysterical and screaming women, a shamelessly wasted and mis-cast Henry Daniell, the obligatory cute monkey, Peter Lorre and Fabian, it actually has a weird charm of its own which makes it wachable. -But these thrown-together characters come from nowhere, and seem to have no past, so you don't care for them at all.

The zombie giant(greater than a ton) VS. man w/ chains. Not very realistic. Although it lacked some realistic action, I thought that it hooked the reader and held firm. I finished this book in 3+1/2 days. The ending is left open for a sequel, this is a plus.(also a chance for jess lebow to redeam himself)I give this book a four because again it has some very awesome twists.(new readers will love) But even for a fantasy novel it lacked physic realism.That and the way they pick up weapons and BAM! Kick a$$! Possible, but not realistic.Good read if you are new to the series. But I would not reccomend it for the die-hards. Peace out God....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I liked the idea of just a plain adventure. No world changing events. But there were just to many things that didn't make sense, and horrible ending. There were times I did really enjoy this book, but the problems really ruined it."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst forgotten realms ever","review":"OMG...this was horrible. Nevermind the premise that a couple of brothers with NO training become weapon masters overnight. Especially the chains dude - picks them up, kicks ass.... Right.Then, we can stop thinking about physics at all. Yup - wrap a chain around a statue's base and it will tip over????? Or chain a stone giant's leg and pull???? That didn't work, but when a stone hit the chain, the giant fell, not the human? Though lesser mass lost????I could go on, but it would be pointless. I think this is the first book in the forgotten realms series that I will not bother to keep on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I dunno, maybe it's just me, but the thing doesn't seem to snug the balls up like it should.

I was *very* wrong to have done so. I slogged my way through GH and ended up skim reading the last quarter of the book so that I could finish and forget about it. Not only was the plot and writing very poor, the characters were trite and cliched. Speaking as an Englishwoman, I was appalled how Olivia was portrayed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confunsing 2","review":"I do not recommend this book at all! Don't buy this book! The first reviewer says it all. I, too, was left confused and irritated. Th character of Olivia was stupid. She was an airhead with no confidence who wouldn't listen or follow directions. You don't want her to be a wet noodle but you would like her to have some sense.This book was better than Key West, the heroine in that story really made me crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Stella; not up to par","review":"I have always really enjoyed Stella Cameron's books and so when this one came out in hardback I paid the price thinking I'd have a keeper. Not so! It goes in the trade/yard sale pile.I found the plot incoherent and the characters unrealistic. I just kept slogging through it waiting for the story to get my attention: didn't happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT ! ! !","review":"I picked up this book because of the author's previous work and ended up greatly disappointed. From the first chapter I could tell the story was underdeveloped, the characters were unrealistic and the dialogue didn't make any sense. I kept reading hopping that it would pick-up but no such luck. At the end I felt . . . . . . . cheated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. My only disappointment was, that I read the only 2 Stella Cameron book's I've read out of sequence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stella has lost her groove","review":"I have read all of Stella Cameron's books and seen a downward spiral in the last few. However, she's really done it this time: chapters dealing with \\"bad guys\\" were unintelligible and those dealing with Aiden and Olivia were boring. Try harder, Stella!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glass Houses","review":"The hero in this book, Aiden Flynn, made his first appearance (along with his killer collectible cars) in \\"Key West\\". This book is a fast-paced and believable tale of Aiden's rescue of the heroine, chases across country by the villans, a reappearance of the hero and heroine of \\"Key West\\". Both Aiden and Olivia are enjoyable characters. The book is not as good as some of Ms. Cameron's earlier contemporaries, but is well worth reading. I buy very few romances in hardback -- Stella Cameron, Jayne Krentz and Linda Howard being the exception. This book is worth every penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Interesting Enough","review":"This is my first Stella Cameron novel and it may be my last. I gave the book's first 100 pages the benefit of the doubt but then I started skipping pages, then chapters and finally decided that I didn't care what happened to the characters and skimmed to the end. The storyline of a Brittish photographer who flees to a NYPD detective for help after meeting online wasn't convincing and didn't flow. I found myself asking \\"why would they do that?\\" a lot. I couldn't get into the characters and found the dialogue boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOUR PLUS STARS!","review":"An extremely enjoyable and entertaining book. I loved Aiden, a real heck of a guy, and Olivia, although sometimes she tried too hard to hide her lights under the bushel. Suspenseful and interesting characters throughout. I will go for \\"Key West\\" next and any other book by Stella Cameron I can find."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this was better than his debut","review":"Somehow, Chris Walker didn't get the push he deserved after two albums in 1991 and 1993. I think that he showed promise even if he had a more mature kind of R&B that avoided trends. But what makes this album better is Love Tonight. That sing along catchy chorus of LooooooooooooohLove Tonight just grabs me everytime that song comes on. It is his best song to me. Take Time, the hit from his debut, doesn't even come close. Some wiseguy host on VH-1 is going to say some clever, snarky, remark about Walker on a One Hit Wonders special, but Walker really held his own for two albums that this label should never be placed on him. He was a good singer during this time of the early '90s and this second album proved that."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW!!!","review":"THIS CD IS SOO PERFECT IT'S SCARY I HAVE NEVER BEEN MOVED SO MUCH BY ANYONES VOICE AS I AM BY CHRIS WALKERS.

Ofcourse there are others too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad poetry, poor quality pictures","review":"Okay, it was the 70's, so maybe the newsprint-quality photos are all the Wicentsens had to work with. The ultimate offense of this book are the mooning, pathetic, high-school quality poems that accompany the muddy photographs. And these are not Jim Morrison's mooning, pathetic poems (which are execrable enough in their own right) but the poems of...? I have no idea who. Perhaps the Wicentsens have neices or teach high school writing classes. This book is not worth the $8.95, and Half-Price Books only gave me 50 cents for it, even though I only looked through it once. I can't believe these people had the gall to present this book as an attempt to jump on the Morrison Death Cult bandwagon. Want gorgeous Morrison photos? Try Dark Star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted my money on this for sure","review":"Random poems by god knows who, all the photos look like they are just photo copy's & one is shown over & over in the book with different color hues.

Zen Master Chang Sik Kim reveals his \\"just now mind\\" through this work of 'free association' poetry. A good poetry book combined with some classic ko-angs (Japanese: koans); spiced with Korean 'Hwardu's; the founding master gives just a hint of his profound inner knowledge of Zen. Yet, having been in the States since 1974, a level of Chang Sik Kim's Americanization can be discerned from the poem: 'One Cup of Water' on page 83, where he is almost cynical! Perhaps that is a strength as Zen deals with the most advanced technological culture in the 21st century as felt by one of the most 'PURE' Zen Monks in this country. \\"The Sky Is Blue, The Water Is Clear\\", like the Stone Lion at the Cross Road, informs those who view it, in the most simplest of terms, an endless Zen lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"very happy","review":"My book come a day before i thought it would very happy with that.

The plot was good and there were some funny scenes in it but it was just dully written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant- like the others","review":"I am a picky reader, especially when it comes to the standard fantasy cliches, like, romance, Dragons, and enchanted forests. This book is easily taken for granted-- a standard quest, with all the usual quest-hampering pitfalls. So how does Patricia Wrede turn it on its head and make this (and the other Enchanted Forest novels) some of the most well-written and engaging novels I've ever read? They appeal to everyone I've ever known who has read them, from my little sister to my much-older cousin. They even appeal to me, reading for the fifth or sixth time many years after I first picked them up. Particularly this one, which may be my favorite of the lot. Anyone who is interested in fairy tales, fantasy- and for that matter, anyone interested in reality- will have their socks knocked off their feet."},{"rating":"2","title":"I DID NOT PUT THIS DOWN","review":"This book, along with the other three in the series, captured my full attention and did not let it go until I had read the entire 600+ pages in the Enchanted Forest Chronicles.

She later meets the King of the Enchanted Forest who also finds some problems going on in the forest. Could these be connected? Cimorene and the King join together to stop whatever evil force that has come to the forest. I really liked this book and especially liked how the King does not like all those princesses that are air headed, and how Cimorene does not like princes who are only after her for the land her father is giving away for someone to find her and marry her. So in the end they end out perfect for each other which is a good ending to the two books.Note: read the first book first"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book was really incredible.

I wish that the series went on forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second in the Series Doesn't Disappoint","review":"The King of the Enchanted Forest teams up with Cimorene to find a missing Kazul.Naturally, you should read \\"Dealing with Dragons\\" first (this is the second, and almost the first's equal). Both are fun, lively, clever reads (for adults or kids), and superior to the books which follow. Wrede confounds expectations and provides a well-paced tale of adventure and magic that delights and transports--what more could you want from a book?Note: a 3 star ranking from me is actually pretty good; I reserve 4 stars for tremendously good works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Book, but what's with the new cover?","review":"When I was younger, the Enchanted Forest Chronicles was my favorite series. The books were funny, imaginative, and had great characters. In fact, I still love them, although I don't read them as often now as I used to. But as I was poking around here on Amazon, I noticed the new cover they have and I absolutely hate it! It's not at all as I imagined them looking, or an accurate depiction of that scene! (even if I did recognize what scene they were trying to depict right away... that's just because I know the book so well) I had always thought that the old covers were perfect, so why mess with a good thing? If anyone who has any control over this book reads this review, I think you should bring back the old cover, which is by far superior to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting Fantasy Book!!!!!!!","review":"This is a great book.Great, ecspecially to follow Dealing with Dragons.

Although it is cheaply priced, it is worth every penny. Without going into major detail about the story, the plot is simple, a bank robbery started by several discharged US Soldiers from the second gulf war goes bad. The only thing that almost turned me off from this series was Donnie Wahlberg (more famous for New Kids on the Block than as an actor) plays a police negotiator. But somehow the strange tale and Donnie's performance works. However, what really makes the story work is they ended it nicely. You are never left wondering what happened to any character in this show. For that alone I give the producers 5 stars. At least it is lot better than some of the television shows that leave you hanging on a cliff (like the last episode of My Name Is Earl)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I ordered!","review":"The DVD was brand new!... sealed and everything.

Both are available on Amazon.com. I purchased and read both, and Amazon asked me to review them. I have done so and compared the two in a review under the Amazon.com entry for Walker's book. Please go to it if you would like a lengthy comparison. But the bottom line is: 1) in my view, Stein is an exemplar of the great life productively lived and he thus merits your attention whether you are that interested or not in Central Asian archaeology; and 2) of the two biographies produced on him, Walker's is clearly the one to read first and then, if you are hooked on Sir Aurel Stein (as I was), you will find Mirsky's book of value as a more personal view of the man.

How come the book was so dull and after reading it I still didn't know what Ghosn had actually done to turn around Nissan?Two things recommend this book: Ghosn's recollections of starting out at Michelin...his portrait of that privately owned corporation was much more interesting than his Nissan story; and as a companion to the Reckoning, David Halberstam's history of Detroit that focused on Ford's eclipse by none other than Nissan. To find out that Nissan was already rotting from within by the time Halberstam was finishing his great book, makes this poor one at least an interesting appendix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and outdated","review":"I'm amazed that this book is still in print. Other than the fact that RUBYFRUIT JUNGLE was a topically-groundbreaking book, the novel deserves little literary attention. I read this book really wanting and expecting to like it, but the storyline is simplistic and the writing is amateurish at best. Skip this one and try DESERT OF THE HEART by Jane Rule."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profane. Overrated.","review":"This book is heralded as a masterpiece of lesbian fiction. On the back, the author is compared to Mark Twain and people proclaim that it made them laugh and cry.Well, I doubt Mark Twain published anything that comments on the human condition by resorting to sentences like 'f*** this s***'. It's not even dialogue either.I didn't think the heroine was very likable at all, and had a penchant for scatalogical retribution. Everyone's creepy and sex-obsessed. She has her goals but you never see her reach them, so that's annoying.That said.. if you go into it expecting some smut, then it'll be passable. I read the whole thing in about a day, because it's not like it's Jane Austen or anything. There's a lot of man-bashing in it, and some really pathetic male lover types. Most of the chicks are screwed up too, though, so if you want dysfunction and disrobing, this is your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this book repulsive","review":"I was repelled by the personality of the book's narrator. My disgust centered on two events:First, when the narrator was a child, she avenged herself on someone she didn't like by filling a raisin box with rodent droppings for her enemy to eat.Later, when she was a grown woman, she avenged herself on a co-worker she didn't like by putting dog dung in the woman's desk drawers.This isn't humor, it's vicious bullying.

Some things I don't wanna know. The details are NOT necessary. Definitely not a book for a light stomach. It's not just lesbians...she seems to go both ways for awhile, then gets bored with men, explores with older women, obsesses over a woman her own age who ends up getting married, and in the end, it's an altogether depressing book. Whether this is the outcome of all homosexuals, or a dramatic complaint of one woman who kept on and never gave up, i don't know. However, pick Joan of Arc or Hellen Keller if you want a real story of perseverance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book","review":"First of all I am not a person of many words so my review will be somewhat short. Quality not quantity.Rubyfruit Jungle was a grat book. It was a tad graphic, but that really did not bother me so much. I really like how the story went. Molly had such a hard life to begin with and her being a lesbian did not make it any better. Carrie was so mean to her and she did not accept Molly for the person she was. I am glad that things start to work out for Molly toward the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Absolutely loved this book . Over the years heard about it many times but due to time and my forgetfulness never read it . I read the thing in two sittings because it was just that wonderful . I could relate so much to the main character at parts felt like it was about me . Excellent and worth reading ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth reading!","review":"This book was very inspiring. I had to hide it from my parents of course, which made it all the more interesting. Unfortunately, I agree that the characters are underdeveloped and the writing style is simple, but as I have never been to Southern United States perhaps that is how they talk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does anybody still consider this character a 'heroine'?","review":"This book is historically significant, but as modern literature we need to put this one to bed. The central character has no empathy, capacity to love or even hold a meaningful relationship with anybody, yet women keep throwing themselves at her left and right? I couldn't care less about what happens to her, and even if she does make her dreams and desires come true, there will be no one there to celebrate with her if she does. An empty, hollow book with a 'heroine' I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book to read, but lack of strong ending","review":"This book was pretty good. I couldn't put it down after I read first few chapters. Molly's courage and struggle through her tough life simply melt my heart. It was quite inspiring. However, I didn't rate this book 5 stars because I thought the ending was pretty dull. Also I didn't like the idea of Molly's sleeping with her lover's daughter. That's sick! This is a brilliant book if only the ending wasn't so dull. It could have been so much better. Overall, it's a fun book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I *Heart* Molly Bolt","review":"I am going to be honest, Molly Bolt is probably my favorite character, right after Lestat De Lioncourt of \\"The Vampire Chronicles\\" fame. I liked her personality, her resiliance, her strength and her determination. I have to disagree with a lot of reviews; I don't think she's cruel. I think it's more about she has a point to prove. I love her frankness and her audacity. She is definately an original character in literature.The novel itself was very well written. I liked that it was stripped and clipped, without any fancy prose. It made it feel more from the heart. It was very realistic and it made me feel as if I was right there with Molly and experiencing what she experienced. I have to admit that it had a couple of scenes that were a little hard to believe, namly that scene about the man who loved to have grapefruit (or rubyfruit) thrown at him. It was a definate \\"What the h*ll\\" moment.But overall, a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremly funny!","review":"I had heard of Rita Mae Brown years ago and this book but never took time to read it.

Funny, human, moving, personal","review":"While on the phone with a friend I heard her mom in the background laughing out loud. Nobody else was in the room, she was just reading Rubyfruit Jungle. I had to read it and have been in search for a book as funny, streightforward and moving ever since. For me, the moral of this story was embrace what is unique and quirky about yourself. Live life to it's fullest, and laugh while your at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Great book--but then again, I know what it's like to be a misfit, so I could sorta identify with Molly--which makes my opinion somewhat biased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-read !!!!!!","review":"Rubyfruit Jungle is one helluva-romp through the bad times and the good. i really like the scenes where Molly gets hot with her gym teacher and cried when she shared the pain of those awkward steps out of thecloset that opporesses all wimmin who Dare to come out of the closet. I really reccommend this book for all lesbians, young or old."},{"rating":"2","title":"The unsinkable Molly Bolt... What an inspiration","review":"I began reading this landmark book not knowing what to expect. Who I discovered was Molly Bolt who followed no rules and simply lived her life. She had the courage or audacity to say what would only run through my brain. I wonder where we would all be if we could simply do the same. Perhaps not the in your face shocker it was when first published this book has not lost any of it's charm. Not only do I admire the adoption story line (as I am adopted also) but also the transitions of coming out. Even though now lesbian characters are seen on almost every tv series... mis-nomers and prejudice still haunt us. I believe Rita Mae Brown wrote a timeless classic with Rubyfruit Jungle and gave lesbian literature its own hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great FM transmitter design","review":"This unit failed on start-up. The unit design is not very good for a moving, bouncing, car. The plug does not fit very tightly in the socket. (Even with the included washer). The arm is long but the iPod Video is heavy, so it wobbles and cannot maintain consistant contact with the plug. Everything is too loose. I called the Radian tech support number. I was put on hold for over 1/2 hour and never got help. I tried 2 times.The results were the same. The package says 24/7 support. Finally, I emailed them for a RMA number (which they say to do on their web site)and after 2 weeks I never heard back from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent statistics book, crap solutions.","review":"This latest edition does a decent job of explaining the world of statistics. They also provide step by step instructions for TI-83 and TI-92 calculator use as well. What makes this book good is the use of \\"real world\\" data not some made up study to generate statistical problems. However, the solutions are very poor. Many answers in the back of the book are incorrect and the solutions manual is of little help. The Professor finaly generated her own solutions manual and handed it out to the students. My favorite part in the book is the history lessons (one pagers) about famous people in statistics. Ever wonder how Statistics and Beer are related? Turn to chapter eleven and find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Though not new one,it's good one.Not bad!","review":"Though not new one,it's good one.Not bad!It looks OK,and the pages are flat and tidy.It worth the price!

I think the text does a great job of covering all the topics needed for the Exam and provides a good mix of thought-provoking problems and good explanations of procedures if you take the time to carefully read.As one reviewer pointed out, the problems are interspersed througout a section, not all grouped at the end of a section. This makes it awkward when trying to find a particular problem number. Also, as mentioned, the headings could have been done better to help outline the sections and chapters more easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehhh","review":"This book is alright.

It is so real that you can actually feel the hero's and heroine's pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like Cheaters","review":"After reading seeing how everybody rated this book so high, I couldn't wait to read this book. Unfortunately, the rating was misleading because I didn't like this book at all. One of the main reason was because in the middle of the book, the hero cheats on the heroin after that I just couldn't forgive the hero for that therefore couldn't enjoy the book. I don't want to read about a cheating spouse and the hero's reason was so stupid too. What piss me off was that he excepted her to forgive him easily but yet in the end when the hero thinks heroin cheated on him towards the end of the book, he banishes her from their home; furthermore her hits the heroin for betraying/cheating him, which made me hated him even more. I also felt the ending was too rushed. I mean the conflict with that one guy (can't recall his name) was finished too fast and easily. The only reason I give this book even a one star was because I like Martin's style of writing and I think she is very talented."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST MEDIEVAL ROMANCE STORY EVER!!!!!!!","review":"I LOVED this book!! This is the BEST book I've ever read!! I have read and re-read this book so many times I've los count. I'm in love with Ral. And he is in love with his \\"Cara\\". I read this book about 2 years ago, and it's still my favorite. Because of this book, I've read all of Kat Martin's books, but to me none of them compare to this unforgettable love storie ( Dont get me wrong know, her other books are pretty good too). I mean I really felt hurt and betrayed when I saw him(in my mind) with Lynett(hope I spelled her name right. Gosh how I HATE her!) I also felt heart broken. And when he slapped Caryn, Wow did I feel that!! But I also felt his love and pain, and that is why I absalutely loved this book. It really plays with your emotions. I don't want to over paise this book, but I can't really help it. So, I hope I'm doing good instead of harm to someone who has not read it yet. I give this book 10 Stars! Like I said I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bold Angel is NO disappointment!","review":"If you're a fan of medieval romances, you'll love this book.. of course, it's no \\"Knight in Shining Armor\\", but the characters, dialouge, plot.. there'll all top of the line. Kat Martin shines in this book and brings her characters to life. This book paints 11th century England like NO other I have ever read, and in that aspect, I strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good easel for the money","review":"I agree with the reviews here. Good easel, a little difficult to assemble, but my kids love it. The split dry erase board bugged me too, but the kids don't seem to mind, so it's not really an issue. It was nearly impossible to find a refill roll of paper when the original ran out. After checking Hobby Lobby and assorted office supply stores, I finally found it at Michael's in the kids craft area. It's a little shorter than the original roll, but it's the closest match I've been able to find. Very inexpensive also - I paid $3/roll and it'd be even less with their weekly coupons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not an easel expert. . .","review":"Our 5 year old loves it and went through the included roll of paper in a few days.

Now I cannot find the refills...they are 14 inches. It is a neat easel with lots of pockets for storage of crayons, markers and paints. Folds up really nice too. There is another downfall though, the board is 2 pieces, and they do not meet evenly when put together, so this creates an uneven drawing surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST purchase I've made in years!","review":"The assembly was difficult because the metal was bent and warped. Once assembled, it did not sit level. The canvas pieces weren't large enough to be attached as directed, the velcro kept popping open due to the strain. The hard surface that the child will draw/paint on is actually 2 pieces that lock together, making every piece of artwork have a nice bump/groove/line where a marker might pass over it. Lastly, you have to break down almost all the assembly to get this thing folded up.A waste of money, time, and raw materials! I returned mine.

The markers are weak in color its like some one wet down an old marker and is trying to get some use out of it. the easle falls over everytime you look at it. DONT try to let your kids use this outside. Lastly the tray is too small as is the side pockets to even hold a 24 pk of crayons. My question to the owner of rose art, would you buy this for your child? I didnt think so and i should have bought the mellisa and doug easle"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but poorly designed","review":"A folding easel is a great idea, but this easel is NOT easy to fold and the likelihood it will ever fit back in the bag is very small. The worst part is the dry erase board is in 2 pieces and so my kids get frustrated when drawing because of a crack in the middle which is frustrating for dry erase creativity as well as drawing on the paper roll. It is also lacking a chalkboard which kids love. We received this as a gift and will be donating it to a local thrift store.

After struggling with the worthless directions (all pictures that show no detail and are very poor quality) we immediately knew it was total junk. The dry erase board comes in 2 pieces, so there will be a line down every picture drawn. The backing is also extremely flimsy, as is the whole thing. My 2 1/2 year old son knocked it over within 5 minutes. I wish I had read the reviews before we took it out of the box. We had it boxed back up immediately and are taking it back today. Really, EVERY Rose Art product is just not good quality. Their markers, crayons, etc are no good. We also found out that you cannot find replacement paper on this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"review for easel","review":"I bought this product for my 4 year old son.

They absolutely LOVE this easel.We live in a townhome and don't have too much space. This easel easily folds up, goes into it's bag and slides right behind my couch when we have company. Our first easel was a fisher price easel and it was too bulky and even though it claimed to fold up, it was still huge! The fisher price easel was also very babyish and was not as versitle as this one. We love the paper roll and the refils are not expensive at all. We like how all the materials are displayed on either side. It always stays neat and organized. The storage pocket below is not too large but does hold all extra supplies.The ONLY negative thing I have to say is that the white board is split down the center for easy disassembly. Sometimes when they are drawing on the paper,their markers/crayons get caught up on the crease. Still totally worth it though!

The cover by Roger Dean is one of the sign of the old progressive style influence. This is a new album but the band is formed by old musicians from others old bands. The sound is based on progressive vintage keyboards and great clear guitar solos, the recorded quality is excellent and the singer is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrew Flescher","review":"Brilliant song writing, brilliant execution. This is pastel, harmonious classic (not neo) prog that harkens back to 1972 Yes and Genesis. However, if the style and lyrics are tribute, the melodies are all original. Waterline and All Hollows Eve are simply splendid, as good as the best of the 70s. Besides Echolyn, Ad Infinitum is the only other band that understands just what exactly was going on 30 years ago. One of the best albums I've ever heard. You will fall in love with this album if you understand what progressive rock is all about to begin with (that is, song writing not mere virtuosity)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic prog at best","review":"Sorry, but this recording just did not do it for me. With all the great new prog bands (spocks beard, flower kings, glass hammer, to name a few) creating great new sounds, this recording to me sounded uninspired, lacking the tight heartfelt musicianship that so defines prog. As alluded to in the liner notes, it sounds like a prog record made for the sake of making a prog record.The death knell for me was the dennis deyoung sound-alike on lead vocals, uggghhhhh... Your money would be better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrying On The Tradition","review":"Had first found out about Ad Infinitum from listening to AOL's Progressive Rock Radio. Upon listening to only one song on this most underrated work, I had recalled a few other songs from Ad Infinitum that weren't played for a long time on this same radio. And so I wanted to hear them again. How I rated this LP is how fond of this type of texturous music I was and always will be. Mainly because Ad Infinitum did, in fact, carry on the progressive rock tradition that classic prog bands such as Yes, Genesis, ELP, Camel, Caravan, and Pink Floyd had set forth."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is [bad]","review":"I can't believe how many good reviews this exceedingly formulaic CD is getting. Not only are the vocals too metal-esque for my taste, but the arrangements and chops are nothing to get excited about. Some of the sections are almost 'hokey' in their effort to be dramatic or to fit into the 'progressive' category. Playing a Hammond, a Mellotron or a Minimoog doesn't necessarily make the music any good (I love all three, btw). After so many new progressive bands have done some truly interesting things, its hard to see why this gets so much attention. I was truly disappointed after having read so many good reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best option for bar preparation.","review":"I bought this book the year before I took the bar, hoping to get a leg up on bar review.

I used them at work, sitting at my desk, not moving around very much; however, after a few months the jack lost its tight fit and began to slip out.

I have to pump twice at work (about every 3 hours)and never can get enough time to actually wash and clean a set before I have to get back to work. So I bring two sets and wash them when I get home.It's a good set for the price. You get lots of accessories that are needed. However, I don't like that the bell and the valve are all one piece. I use a pumping bra (the kind that has 2 holes in it) so I can pump hands free. In order to do this, I'd have to detach the bell part and place that under the bra so the bra can hold it in. The other half of the bell sticks out of the bra and then you can put the valve portion on and then screw on the bottle. When it's all one piece, there's not way I can get the bra around the bell."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING","review":"WARNING TO ALL WHO ORDER, THE FLANGY DOES NOT COME OF THE CONNECTOR.

Please note that the breastshields are one-piece breastshields and connectors. Some people say that they are harder to clean than the separate ones, but I don't think so.

I recognized it right away and took it to the store, versus wasting time with Motorola and the same helpless end result. So today I decided to give this phone one last hope and traded in another one. As I was pulling out of the parking lot of the store, it died and will only turn on if I remove the battery and replace it for each use. This phone is a disgrace to Motorola and the phone industry.

I would have expected a book on stocks and investing to be rather dry but this book is very well written and quite readable. When I think of online investing, I think of buying and selling online but from this book I found there is an astounding amount of SEC and other information on companies out on the Internet these days enabling me to be able to research online as well. The authors have spelled out just what to look for and where to go for researching potential stock investments. The glossary in the back is handy (for me as a novice) as well as the appendix of investing related web site reviews. I have always been leery of stock investing, leaving it to my better half, but with the understanding and resources I am getting from this book, I have the confidence to venture carefully out... I would think ANYBODY who does any stock investing would DEFINITELY want to read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"These are very good and surprisingly comfortable, even under jeans!

They are light, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuts off with phone use","review":"I bought these headphones for my dad and he says that everytime the neighbour picks up the phone, his connection to the base unit is broken.

This happens quite frequently and he's very very annoyed.

At times the presentation can become tedious but on the whole this is a book well worth reading and a life well worth knowing more about. Beyond his explorations Burton lived, wrote, fought, loved and experienced life to the fullest extent. As many of the other comments from other readers have suggested, his life and how he lived it can be a positive inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad attempt at writing a term paper for psych class","review":"If you're looking for a good bio about Sir Richard F. Burton...this isn't it. The man was an enigma of his time: explorer, linguist, anthropologist and above all, a man of courage. Yet, Brodie describes his adventures with little description, placing little emphasis on his acomplishments. By the same token too many pages are spent describing his later years in life when he spent his last years as a translater. And the entire book boils down to the author's opinion that Burton was confused about his sexual identity because he chose not to write about his sexual realtions with his wife. If that's proof, then any male who never put down a word about his relations with his wife must also be prone to deviant behavior (according to Brodie anyway). The book is a waste of time and the only reason I read it cover to cover was in the hopes it would get better. It didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indiana Jones in the flesh...","review":"Richard Burton was an enigmatic, sour, oftentimes neurotic voyeur with the intention of beating his contemporaries and traveling the globe learning and exposing the cultures he came across. Ms. Brodie also has a tie with writing other biographies of sensational men (Joseph Smith, Jr of Mormon fame) and this book is an educated insight into Richard Burton's travels, motives, and surroundings. The maps included along with photographs, illustrations, and excerpts of Burton's own words help move the narrative along. It can be 'old English' tedious, but is well worth the delve into a man that went against the grain in every way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart","review":"My cats both love mouse toys especially those cheap catnip rattling ones you see at the grocery store. That being said, they showed little interest in these until the rest of their mice disappeared under the furniture.

These are not safe for kitties that play rough! I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keith Hudson--Pick A Dub","review":"This is one of the finest dub recordings from the height of the Jamaican dub era. Classic mid-1970's style dubs, very consistent, if a bit lo-fi. If you like dub, this recording is a must. If you don't know if you like dub, you'll find out by listening to this. If you don't like this, you don't like dub. One of my favorites to listen to on my weekly Amtrak commute. I have yet to tire of that heavy bass. Augustus Pablo's melodica solo opener of the first cut caught me right away. Keith Hudson wrote and produced the material, and sang on some of it, though of course the vocals are reduced to tiny snippets as is the standard for dub. Features the heavy rhythm section from Bob Marley's Wailers at the time--Aston Barrett on bass and Carlton Barrett on drums. One of the first dub albums to appear in Jamaica, and a big seller at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Christmas stories and truths for us today!","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.

King Tubby, master (and inventor!) of most of the tricks of the dub trade, showcases his talents as he mixes down some roots gems... the resulting dub tracks are tremendous in both their raw power as well as in their texture and subtlety. Vocals, guitars, and hi-hats are deftly woven in and out of tracks built upon a solid foundation of rich, deep bass and drums that are at times punchy, other times \\"wet\\"-sounding they reverberate so much. For those who really get into it, I'd recommend \\"Jesus Dread\\" by Yabby U: most of the tracks on \\"Prophesy\\" appear here in their vocal/original versions (with other versions included featuring a veritable who's-who of Dub & Roots artists and producers)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riviting&Minimal","review":"I agree with everything the previous reviewer said..except that he only gave the album 4 stars. Definately some of Tubby's most driving and minimal works. If your're ready to sit back and let the subtlety of Tubby's masterful work on the controls pull your heart and your head to the beat then buy this album! Listen to track #2 and if you don't feel how the keys just pull you along...then don't buy this album, cuz you aint feelin it...no offence to you.

The quality was just not what I expected or hoped for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Perspective of Reality!","review":"Read this book only if you are really and truly interested in finding the path to freedom from emotional dependency. The great master makes you aware with his candid elocuence of all the emotional weigh and guilt that we needlessly carry through our short life span on earth. You will learn how your mind through the thought process plays tricks on you that sometimes make you see a distorted picture of reality.

I recently found out that since my blowdryer is over 1 year old, I have to pay Farouk $35 each time I send it in for repair.

One can almost imagine a professor telling her, \\"Have one of your characters held up at gun point and see where it goes.\\"Unfortunately it doesn't go anywhere, other than for an aimless stroll through the extremely shallow, bland psyche of our dimwitted narrator. There is no depth here--the characters are flat, the potential emotional complexity engendered by this sort of traumatic event is basically ignored, and the first-person, present tense narration gives the book all the heft of an overwrought teenager's diary.On the plus side, the book is so threadbare, provokes so little introspection or contemplation, that one can read it and cast it aside in a couple of hours--though it did pain me to place it back on the shelf between Updike and Voltaire.Spend your time and money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I Miss Something?","review":"I was anxious to read this book because I had read so many good reviews in the papers, magazines and of course Amazon.

The others were wonderful, and this one was just not good at all. The plot was bumpy and the narrative was just plain dull. I think she was going for minimalism. But through enormous life changes, the narrator is nonplussed to the point of being infuriating. I finished the book feeling I'd wasted my time. I see that Vida's other works have been better reviewed on this site, so I might give one of them a shot. But not for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"I think that good reviews must be written based on things such as how quickly a book can be read.

John Brightstar comes out to Pine Hollow (which never happened in the book) and isn't even from the west- it's all an act.

It is ironic but not surprising that Perry's own tastes have been unwittingly denounced by the MCC members."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even allowing for Christian charity...","review":"Even allowing for Christian charity this is a poor effort. It has no literary flair at all but instead reads like it was dictated and typed up with little if no editing.I don't get The Reverend Perry's take on Christianity at all - and I dearly wanted to. As a former member of the Born-Again Brigade and gay myself, I had hoped for some insight. Alas, he just comes across as someone with a lack of self awareness and his grasp of theology strikes me as naive at best. I wish I could be more generous but I can't.If you're looking for a book with insight and integrity on this theme then I'd suggest Mel White's \\"Stranger At The Gate\\".

I was looking for a biblically-based book on Heaven. Unfortunately, I let the author's scholarly verbage persuade me to think his ideas would be based on more than his opinions. He even goes so far as to say that \\"happy ghosts\\" are from heaven... *because* who would venture to claim that C.S. Lewis' visitation (of his dead wife) was demonic?! This is the same weak reasoning he uses throughout the book. I find more biblical facts in Francine Rivers' historical fiction.

Rather than relate the beliefs of various religions, the author selects the sources that support his New Age view. While the Bible serves as one of his sources, he doesn't give it any special authority. In considering some of the teachings on Heaven by Jesus Christ, the author sides with the views of non-Biblical writers in order to justify his position on a particular point. For readers interested in a scripture-based approach to Heaven, Billy Graham's \\"Death and the Life After\\" is a much better alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"based on opinion","review":"This book was very disappointing.

Don't be fooled - this movie sucks. I admit that I liked the title song (Behind Blue Eyes), originally done by the Who, as well as the video of the song. But the movie itself was a poor imitation of The Sixth Sense and, especially, Stir of Echoes. The plot is somewhat preposterous, even for a horror film.Halle Berry looks good in the film, and she didn't do a bad job acting. In fact, all the actors and actresses Gothika tried their best to do a good job and are fairly credible. But the script is lame and the premise is foolish. Overall, the movie is pretty tired. This movie adds nothing to the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halle Berry: Has-been Part 1","review":"Ugh!Step one on how to kill a career fresh off an Oscar win.

The \\"surprise\\" villain at the end is as predictable as a drought in a parched desert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't overthink it and you'll be fine...","review":"I enjoyed this movie, and regardless what you read from other reviewers, it was a chilling experience. I would have cast Penelope Cruz in Halle Berry's role, and there were cliches as there are in most movies of this genre, but it didn't bother me. From the perspective of the script, there was uneven treatment of Halle's relationship with Downey, which did kind of bother me. And from the perspective of continuity, if you lose the fender of a car in one scene, and it is somehow replaced in the next, you have a problem. Nonetheless, it's still worth watching, a few flaws notwithstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked The Ring? See this!","review":"If you liked the Ring then you've gotta see this. Gothika is an intelligent, at times scary ride with a few curves and detours in the road. Maybe I'm not as astute as some others who have seen this flick, but it kept me guessing pretty much till the end. Like the Ring, the story reveals itself through a series of mysterious circumstances that the main protagonist, Halle Berry, solves with you. Each scene leads to another question that must be resolved.My only negative comment is on Berry's performance. She is not really convincing as a psychiatrist. This is partly due to her stunning beauty which, in this case, is a distraction from her character along with her overly dramatic emotionalism.All in all though, this is a great film and I will actually purchase it on the after market for my personal library... And place it on the shelf right next to The Ring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a pretty good show","review":"Gothika is a pretty good horror/psychological suspense show. Mathieu Kassovitz doesn't give us any great surprises (you can figure out what is going on fairly early in the film) plot wise, but he gives some great shots. And Halle Berry gives us some great moments on film. She shows just how great of an actress, just how intense she is. The rest of the cast gives a solid performance. The dvd is a bit sparse. There is the Limp Bizkit video, \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\", which is a great song and a very well done video. There is also a commentary with director Mathieu Kassovitz and DOP Matthew Libatique, who actually calls himself a cinematographer on the commentary track. As well he should because the cinematography itself is a character in itself. The lighting, the camera movements, the locations, all add to the atmosphere, more so than in many other movies. The two compliment each other both in filming and in the commentary track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Berry does as well as anybody else could in this muddle","review":"GOTHIKA follows standard horror-thriller conventions (especially the red herrings and cheap scares) and it's technically well-made. But . . . the anticlimactic third act finishes with a ridiculous finale with muddled disclosures and plot holes galore. GOTHIKA wants to be a supernatural ghost story, a woman-in-prison movie, a wrongfully accused movie, a murder mystery, and unintentionally, a comedy! Not awful, but not that good either."},{"rating":"1","title":"ENOUGH ALREADY","review":"Okay, no more movies with stupid dead kids that communicate to the living. No more stupid thrillers that have these bad endings (i.e. Identity). No more remaking classic rock songs (the who's \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\") for the soundtrack by no talent hacks by pseudo bands like 'limp bizkit'. The movie looked alright, had the normally unwatchable bad actress Penelope Cruz, prepostorous story and Halle Berry. SKIP IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"turning the matrix into a cliche\` vanity filled horror","review":"dark castles has had a bad past for putting out horror movies with over made computer graphic creatures, shakey plots, and good-looking woman with cues to scream, and show skin, disbelieving in the actuall acting talents they're suppose to give. Instead they go to the cgi graphics. dressing the movie up. In the opening credits I saw joel silver...mixing the producer of the matrix movies, and dark castles which helped put out movies like house an haunted hill, the haunted, and 13 ghosts -- it's the oil and water mix at it's worst. The elements are very watered down and over done!! if you like computer generated horror movies that make up more than 40% of the movie you might like it, but if you're a classic horror lover you might not like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dang, I wanted this to be good","review":"This movie had a few scenes that really made me jump, but then abot 2/3 of the way through, the mood totally changed, and the frightening parts suddenly came to and end. The movie had potential, but was ruined by a weak screenplay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as scarey as I thought","review":"I was in the mood for a good, suspenseful, scarey movie. So I rented 'Gothika,' since I heard that it was very, very scarey.NOTE: If you're looking for a thrill ride/ultimate scare, pass this one up.Halle Berry does an excellent job portraying Dr. Miranda Grey, who works in a mental institution. She has trouble believing the outlandish tales that the inmates tell her, until she becomes one herself.'Gothika' employs the use of paranormal, with ghosts and possessions taking the majority of the explanations, and the film.However, there are some rather suspenseful, and awe-inspiring parts of the film, like Berry's multiple attempts at escape, and also parts in which the ghost visits her cell. Toward the end, the film becomes somewhat predictable, but nevertheless, suspenseful. And it does all make sense in the end!Overall, I believe that 'Gothika' is worth four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good acting, flawed storyline","review":"Most movies ask for a certain level of suspension of disbelief, but this one carries this to a ridiculous extreme. For example, if a ghost can carve a clue into your arm, why can't it just write you a note to tell you what it wants? Also, I'm quite certain that a medical examination after a rape is a good way for a well trained expert to determine whether or not a woman has been raped or at the very least has had sexual intercourse. Another problem in the movie is with the fact that in a suicide investigation, the forensic examination of the body would determine whether or not injuries were received before or after death. These and other obvious flaws in the storyline and the less than mediocre plot are just some of many reasons this movie is lacking and should be skipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly a horror movie...","review":"This movie in my opinion falls more under the suspense genre rather than horror. The movie isn't really all that scary, the scenes where something \\"scary\\" happens are very predictable. Halle Berry was mediocre as was the rest of her supporting cast.All in all, the first half of the movie is enjoyable but the climax/ ending will leave you speechless (not in a good way). It leaves you thinking \\"wow, it turned from a ok movie to an outrageously dumb freak show.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A bleak, evaporating movie","review":"The first half of this movie builds with an interesting story concept and some beautiful and inventive cinematography. Then it simply runs away into a film so full of plot holes and forgotten story threads that it sort of dissolves into nothing.By the end of the film, all the characters have lost any depth that was hinted at in the promising beginning. Robert Downey gets one decent scene, and then is left to wander through the rest of the picture, delivering a line here or there and generally looking either bewildered or dutifully concerned. Halle Berry, who has proven that she can act well in a supporting role, can't really seem to deliver the weight needed to carry a picture.All in all, a good start that quickly digressed into a weak mishmash of ideas and concepts. All the viewer is left with in the end is the rainy, bleak atmosphere of the picture - slick and pointless. --Mykal Banta"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Movie I have seen all year","review":"This movie sux. It has a very poor plot, it starts out slow, it is predictable, the acting is pure ass, and it definately isn't scary. Halle Berry(2002 Oscar Winner) has just ruined her carrer, and Penelope Cruz can't act at all. This movie is an insult to horror movies, and I know I am 'NOT ALONE' in thinking that. The best part of this movie was the Limp Bizkit song at the end, that is how sad this movie is. Limp Bizkit sux, but Gothika sucks 100 times more."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are these people thinking?","review":"Okay, honestly I loved this film. Even though it was slightly cliched as far as a story that had been told before in The Sixth Sense and Stir of Echoes, it was done very well, and remained slightly darker and more brutal than its predecessors. Here is my question: why, when this movie is less than a year old, do the creators of this film feel compelled to sell us a special edition version of this movie? I get tired of hearing of this, as they are doing the same thing with Pirates of the Carribean, and Club Dread. Why didn't they release the 2 disc edition when the movie first came to DVD. Honestly, if you've bought the single disc Gothika, save your money for a different movie, if you haven't bought it yet, go ahead and buy the 2-disc, I know I'll be saving my money though."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining film...cast brings this film up a star","review":"My fiance, a friend, and I watched Gothika last night. The film was entertaining. It had it's scary, startling moments.

She proves quite well that she can take the lead in a film and carry it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, so","review":"This was a different type of role from Berry's other films. Maybe she's attempting everything to keep from being typecasted. Well, I liked the movie for what it was worth...passing time on a rainy day.

I'll ignore the fact that the hospital's lights are always blinking and much of the equipment resembles a 1500s torture machine. But I refuse to ignore the blatant disregard for non-cheap thrills, quality acting, and screenplay (This \\"script\\" has more plot holes than 200 STAR TREK episodes).

The background music creeps and skulks and spasms, as the camera undulates, but the content is scattershot and laughably melodramatic. Add to that a doozy screenplay that skips between the natural and supernatural with such wild abandon that you never quite know where you are.

I certainly couldn't figure it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take it in the Asylum","review":"A dreary and uninspired entry into the \\"Psychological Third Act Twist Thriller\\" genre, this one was only saved from distribution by Nu-Image or Troma by the presence of Halle Berry, who may have the worst taste in projects of any actress ever known. How she can go from getting an Oscar to becoming Catwoman is beyond me. In this movie, Halle clearly has her head in somebody's else's Asylum. Gothika is a colossal train wreck, a movie about a haunted asylum where absolutely nothing happens.Joel Silver and his Dark Castle label may be the single worst thing to happen to horror movies in the history of cinema. Hard to believe that somehow they keep making these monstrosities. I won't even go into how bad Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions were. What happened to the Joel Silver who made Predator, and who is this charlatan who took his place? Now he gives us House of Wax starring Paris Hilton. Oh joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gothikless","review":"This film does not provoke a gothic atmosphere. No, not at all. More like a sterile, monochrome and lifeless. So I'm afraid the title is a complete and utter lie.As a horror film this is a total potboiler. As a Dark Castle production it's the worst yet. Why on earth would a freshly won Oscar-winning actress do such drek?The story is the most predictable and boring ever. You can literally see all the twists and revelations coming. There are also gaping holes in the logic. Such as if the ghost of Rachel can have a physical effect on the real world, then why would she need Miranda at all?Well there wouldn't be a film if the director realized this. But then again, that would be a good thing. A complete waste of time! Zemeckis and Silver should know better.The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound.

It's hard for me to put into words what all went wrong with it -(some of the other reviewers did a great job with that though). I'll just quickly say that I saw parts of The Ring, The Sixth Sense, Exorcist, and other movies thrown in and mixed all around in an attempt to make another \\"scary movie\\". Unfortunately, ripping off ideas from other movies didn't work for this one. In my opinion, this movie is not quite as bad as 28 Days Later, but close!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I'm going to be in the minority...but...","review":"I have to be honest.

Don't bother renting this, let alone purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, scary thriller.","review":"Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't think this movie was predictable at all. I also thought it was really scary--I jumped a lot of parts, and even screamed, even though I was with a bunch of my friends and we were watching it in the daytime!This movie stars Halle Berry (who I think did a great job at acting), who is Miranda, a psychologist at an institution for the insane. One night she is driving home from work, when she sees a mysterious girl burst into flames. Before she knows it, Miranda is waking up in the institution she works at...except that now, she's a patient.

Give it a miss..."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad..yet I couldn't look away","review":"I thought this movie was terrible. Very stupid and unbelievable. Halle Berry was actually terrific though, and if it weren't for her, I probably would have turned it off after the first 10 minutes or so. Robert Downey Jr., who is usually first class, is flat and uninteresting and the general plot is incredibly ridiculous.What starts off as a promising story quickly turns into a circus, with Halle Berry becoming a patient in the very own facility in which she had practiced psychiatry just the day before (like that would ever happen). One day she is treating patients, the next, she is one of them. I'd tell you more but it's really not worth the time it would take to write it out. However, if you love camp and you can sit through the movie long enough, you have to watch the scene where the mild mannered buttoned up sherrif suddenly turns into a raving shirtless tattooed psychopath. Funny stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!","review":"I have been a fan of all Dark Castle Productions past films. I couldn't wait to see this one and I wish I had.

Having seen the previews and having read the panning from critics I was expecting a movie so bad that it's laughable.However this is not as bad as it has been painted. The idea and story is far fetched but it is a ghost story so why should there be rules? There are more holes in this film than on a golf course but the same can be said for many films of this genre.Whilst there would never be any Academy Awards given out for this one the movie is at times very suspenseful and the cinematography is good.At times it feels a bit \\"Sixth Sense\\" ish - but of course it is in a completely different laegue.Don't write this one off without giving it a go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense.

Everyone else (Robert Downey Jr., Penelope Cruz and Charles S. Dutton were believable. For some reason I had the feeling that Halle Berry felt that she was too good for horror. That she was beyond this. When you can't feel for the main character you already have a movie in trouble. Then when you take the plotline from Stir of Echoes and twist it around a little bit you come up with this terrible movie called Gothika. If you want to see a good movie with a similar plot watch Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. You'll be happy that you didn't waste your money and time on Gothika."},{"rating":"1","title":"plagiarism. How do these people sleep at night?","review":"The basic plot of this movie was almost identical to \\"Kiss the Girls.\\" There are two serial killers working together. One is a doctor and one is a cop. The murders even take place at an abandoned farm. If I was James Patterson I would be suing.

This means sending the unit back to the manufacturer for service. If you don't, it tends to sneak up with progressively higher readings. Unfortunately, I found this out after I bought it. So here's the thing you will need to consider: you are paying $130 for 1 year of ballpark accuracy readings. After that it will cost you another $75 (+2 way S&H fee to Michigan) per year just to maintain the same reading accuracy. Seems like a high price to pay when you can have a professional come in yearly and give you a more accurate reading for about the same price. Granted, readings can change daily to weekly but in my three years of measuring, I've found that the detection range was pretty consistent (within 2-2.5 pCi/L seasonal differential).

The new Safety Siren Pro Series HS7151 3 Radon Gas Detector gives more precise readings. I can't vouch for it being more or less accurate. The older version gave readings between 0 and 99 by increments of 1. The new gives readings between 0 and 999 to tenths of a picocurie per liter and mine now reads between 0.90 and 1.2, (Probably a normal variation depending on various factors) It does the job! I installed my own radon reduction system ten years ago. Our house at that time had readings going up to between 24 and 33 so I was pleased to reduce it to between a 1 and a 2.

The fact that I have to sit there and listen to a bunch of beeping to mute the device is a bit weird. Also it would be nice to have the device remember the mute settings after the power failure (hence the separate reset button).Hey, I am not bitter! Those are the only shortcomings of this unit.

Out of curiosity, I opened the window near it for several days and the value never changed. I ended up calling several radon mitigation companies and the state lab. Everyone told me to use a carbon test and not to trust the cheaper continuous monitors. They said that they do not keep their calibration.

They ran their test and the numbers came in right on the button with our Safety Siren Pro Series 3. Mitigation was done and a follow up test was performed by the testing company. (Testing and mitigation were done by two separate companies to avoid any conflicts) Now our always-on Safety Siren Detector provides a consistent way to visually check the current readings and also will provide an audible warning if the levels ever get too high again. Our mitigation system has only a visual method of checking operation and it's nice to have the audible backup of the Safety Siren."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"This is a great product. We have had it about 2 months, and it has performed well. Before we bought the detector, we paid $10 for a radon test kit at Home Depot, then $30 to get the report. We found we had a huge problem, and wanted to make sure it was taken care of.We bought the detector, and were able to watch the average drop as the radon removal system worked. We are now at the background level, which is great. I can think of a couple of improvements, such as an instantaneous readout (i.e. what the \\"current\\" reading is), but it is great to have. With this model, it takes 48 hours to get an initial reading, then displays either a 7 day average, or a long term average (i.e. since it was either plugged in or reset). Since it is portable, we were able to check all the levels of our house. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth getting","review":"We have the version II of this and found it to be accurate and useful. We confirmed the results of this device with a professional tester and also a series of 3 day and 3 month charcoal tests....every single testing method we used matched the digital readings on the Safety Siren II.

You are quickly spending more for those than this machine costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pricey, but appears to do what it claims","review":"The detector keeps an average reading just as described and seems pretty solidly built.

The inital reading at 48 hours was 9.5 pCi. This increased to 9.9 at 52 hours and thereafter dropped steadily at a rate of 0.1 every 1 hour. At 73 hours the reading is (now) 7.4 pCi/liter. One explanation for this, is the occurence of one or two very large spikes in radon levels which temporarliy increased the running average. Another, I think more likely, explanation is that the device is not working properly, at least during the inital week. As the readings should have been accurate from 48 hours on, I am rather skeptical regarding the reliability of this detector, and may decide to return it. We are doing canister measurements in parallel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use and worth the peace of mind","review":"We had some concerns moving into our home about radon levels so we picked this up and rotated it around the basement and first floor to see what sort of exposure we were getting. This is very easy to use and the short-term and long-term readings give you a sense of how the levels are trending. The readings were also consistent with the professional test so it seems reasonably accurate. If you have reason to think levels might be higher, it's probably a good idea to get a professional test but it's nice to see this confirming the safe levels after that's done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Product","review":"After 2 days, it displayed 1.7 then went up to 5.3 in one week.

Seems to do exactly what it claims.Only way to know would be to get a couple of units, and exchange their locations over time. If you get a high reading, you would maybe want to get a licensed inspector/contractor to come over. If the reading is not high, this may be a lesser cost way to ease your mind...Customer support is excellent - nice people.

It's a good indicator of the levels in your home. Based on my research nobody really has a definitive cause/effect for changing levels of radon in a home. Secondly I don't have a professional understanding of all things hvac, ventilation and construction related. Therefore, I wouldn't use this device as the actual radon reading; but more of a guide as to whether further action is needed. The owners manual states the device needs to be re-calibrated annualy at a cost of $75+postage.

My second one provoked questions on their part, and then a series of emails telling me that I had sent my response incorrectly--without suggesting the correct way to do it.Finally, they got back to me again asking questions on when my BIOS was last replaced.

Truely unique and if you like Dan the Automator's Deltron, then you should go looking for Blazing Arrow. However The Craft is more modern than the futuristic styles found in Deltron and Blazing Arrow. Still this is voted by so many mags as one of the best alternative hip-hop albums around and it shows. Just listen to the first and last track. Those kinds of tunes demand space on your iPod."},{"rating":"2","title":"uneven enough for 3.5 stars but gains momentum","review":"Most of the previous reviews lamenting the loss of the classic Blackalicious sound are appropriate. More pop/funk sound instead of XCel's stellar production is always a BAD thing. The flow by Gift Of Gab is solid, but when a song is bad, it's pretty embarrassing. \\"Powers\\" \\"Lotus Flower\\" and \\"Side To Side\\" are really awful - Quannum would never have put out songs like those.That being said, when the album hits its stride in the last third the results are impressive. \\"Your Move\\" \\"Automatique\\" \\"Black Diamonds\\" and \\"The Craft\\" are all smooth tracks that sound like the Blackalicious of old - great sounds to bounce to. Too bad it takes so long to get to those songs.If you're a Blackalicious fan there might be enough here to enjoy, but if you're new GET 'NIA' FIRST!!!!!!!!!!!!

You have your tight beats from Chief Xcel. The great, smart, very unique rapping from Gift of Gab.The album sounds like it could have been recorded years ago in hiphop's heyday. But it doesn't sound dated - good beats never go out of style.There are only a couple songs that sounded average. Overall, there's a good, tight compact feel to it throughout. It doesn't jump all over the place like some releases. Great stuff from a great group!"},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon....","review":"I dont understand how all the previous reviewers can rep this album so much. This is a real digression from the sounds of Arrow and Gabs 4th Dimension.

I've invested quite a few bucks on Quannum sounds over the years, and this has been my most disappointing purchase.That said, when its good, its really, really good. Vintage, timeless... Automatique rocks my socks.If you're familiar with Blackalicious, buy it anyway. They deserve your loyalty on the basis of services to hip hop.

Gift of Gab went off a few times freestyling in excess of a few minutes, just going crazy on the mic. Chief Xcel has impressed me the most with his latest offering, utilizing lots of live instruments to record the tracks, and Gift of Gab does NOT dissapoint lyrically--but how could he ever? I see track four, \\"powers\\" as a potential single since it is kinda catchy. My favorite track would have to be the last track 14, titled 'the Craft.' If you enjoy music as an art and not just as entertainment -- BUY THIS ALBUM, not to dissapoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do these guys ever disappoint??","review":"While I slightly prefer Blazing Arrow over this album (and NIA over both), that's just a matter of preference and not a comment on their quality. Gift of Gab has improved in his flow (he's always been nice but he doesn't \\"babble\\" that much anymore) and Chief Xcel continues to impress with his beats. The best track isn't really a rap but is sung somewhat: \\"Black Diamonds and Pearls\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift is in his prime","review":"I bought this album with very high expectations. A2G was tight, Nia was slightly better, Blazing Arrow was a masterpiece. Then Gift went solo and in my humble opionion, fell off with about half the album. So needless to say, I expected redemption. I got it in full, and then some.This is definitely an album made to listen to from beginning to end, making it much more of a work of art than a collection of dope tracks. I really can't see any other producer catering Gift's beats than XCel. He proves on this album he can create the perfect \\"exoskeleton\\" for the soulful, articulate workings of Gift's lyricism while pushing the hip hop envelope slightly further with each track. The energy on this album is well controlled and definitely at a higher intensity than previous albums.What is truly uplifting is that Gift mentions several times that he feels that he's just now gaining momentum. This is only gonna get better.Best Quannum album to date"},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better than if some guy (in jeans) had made it.","review":"This effort by the group is different from the rest in that it incorporates an almost 80's synth pop backdrop to the fast paced harmonic stylings of the rap group. Songs range from catchy and witty, to offbeat and uncharismatic. At first listen, the album appears to be all over the place and sloppy. But repeated listenings have made me understand the way the album was put together. as the album progresses song by song, it comes together more and more. It's quite an ingenious effort by the group.

I've had too horrible dropping incidents. The PSP was in the case both times. Both times the case came open and the PSP came out. Both times the PSP was unharmed. It would have been better if the case didn't open, but the way I see it, the case took the brunt of the impact, it opened and the PSP kinda slid out.

The screen protection is a great idea, separating the console storage space and the game disc storage, but often I find it hard to release the clipped-down plastic piece, and I am in constant fear that the yanking, pressing and pulling will eventually scratch the screen and leave a big mark.

The case studies are helpful in demonstrating the point that the body has its own memory, whether a person consciously recognizes it or not, and the importance of integrating the psychological and somatic imprints of the traumatic event. Far from being prescriptive, the author demonstrates that the tools and techniques must fit the client, not the other way around, and highlights the need for a range of therapeutic skills to draw upon as well as the importance of having a comprehensive understanding of the biochemistry that underpins the condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atmospheric, ambient-like early recordings from No-Man","review":"\\"Speak\\" is an anthology of early recordings from No-Man, i.e. Porcupine Tree's multi-instrumentalist Steven Wilson and vocalist Tim Bowness.Initially self-released on cassette in 1989, the album was digitally remastered from the original analogue 8-track tapes and partially re-recorded (vocals on all songs except two have been recorded anew) and released on CD in 1999 only in Italy. Sound quality is excellent, despite the analogue source.This is the first US release ever and appends an extra unreleased track (The Hidden Art of Man Ray), a 12-minute ambient track.These are slow, atmospheric pieces, with lots of reverberating guitars and droney keyboard (think of a cross between ambient-period Brian Eno and the Cocteau Twins, with male vocals).Highlights include \\"Heaven's Break\\" (which would later appear, in a different version, on No-Man's later album \\"Loveblows and Lovecries) and two covers (Nick Drake's \\"Pink Moon\\" and Donovan's \\"River Song\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"b-sides?","review":"Please post track listings.

I felt the expertise in descibing the medical procedures used in performing lobotomies to be accurate and precise.

Even though the book was based in fiction, there was a lot of truth to it, and I like that. The author seems to be a very intelligent woman with a very compassionate heart for people in general.

But it remains a fairly enjoyable example of grim Fifties B and W horror. A well-meaning scientist has discovered a miraculous method which enables humans to recover from devastating injuries in the same way some reptiles do. Wow! But there is, of course, one little side effect -- it also turns them into semi-alligators. Beverly Garland turns in a good performance as the gutsy heroine, and so does Lon Chaney Jr as a brutish drunk. The atmospheric swamp setting is also a plus. The big payoff scene, in which the unfortunate hero gets an overdose of radiation and becomes an almost total alligator (complete with alligator head) is memorably outrageous."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I ain't gonna quit shootin' Gators!\\"","review":"Lon Chaney Jr.'s role stood out in this movie as the drunken swamp rat Manon, who lost his left hand to an alligator. His hatred for the critters is evident as he runs over one with his truck and stands by the swamp one night with his pistol, blasting away, but not hitting a damn thing! At this stage in his life, Chaney probably had playing a drunk down pat since he was reportedly drunk while filming a lot of his movies.The Alligator People is a typical campy 1950s horror flick, but it's good fun to watch on a Saturday night with a bucket of popcorn.The scenes in the Louisiana swamp and at the plantation add a spooky ambiance to the movie, which really helped it along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fox Terriers","review":"The pictures are wonderful.

I absolutely loved it! It has a strong, smart, sexy, and fearless heroine in Jessica. I also love the hero Richard's brooding nature. He tries hard not to fall for Jessica but can't help himself. Unlike Devin Aincourt, the hero in \\"So Wild A Heart\\", Richard has no problem resisting oversexed, conniving Leona Vesey. Richard is a hero worthy of Jessica's love (and mine!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Winning Read!","review":"THE HIDDEN HEART is a wonderful sequel to SO WILD A HEART! I recommend you start with the first book then THE HIDDEN HEART and follow up with SECRETS OF THE HEART. All three books are easy to read regency romances with a flare of mystery. The stories are closely connected that it's best to start with the first in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 & 1/2 stars--this one REALLY needs the 1/2 star","review":"I was totally hooked with the prologue. Even though I discovered that this was the second in a series, I could not wait to read it.Richard is a fabulous hero--very deep, emotional, and responsible, intelligent. His depression over his wife's & daughter's deaths leads him to contemplate suicide. But along comes brave, stalwart Jessica who, in her determination to protect Gabriella, is willing not only to battle his unwillingness to be the girls' ward, but also to bring him back from the brink of self-extinction. They are superb together.Secondary characters run the gamut: Richard's sister-in-law Rachel (who stars in the next book), Jessica's ex-fiance, a Bow Street Runner, a mystery woman, and a murderous villain, among others. Several are not what they seem. The mystery is a bit convoluted, but nothing in it turned me off the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great series!","review":"All three of these books are wonderful!

Every episode is packed with Sex, Violence, and Debauchery. I've never watched a Buscemi role where I wasn't just entirely focused on who the creepy-looking actor was. Buscemi's acting is executed so flawlessly, that you quickly forget that you're watching Steve Buscemi...You're watching Nucky Thompson. (who I predict will eventually become one of the more notable and celebrated characters in TV history)I'm not going to go into minor details as to why this show works. It just does. It's addicting and thoroughly enjoyable. Do yourself a favor and watch the first episode, because then you'll understand why this show is so well received by it's audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome show","review":"For those who were Soprano addicts like myself going through withdrawal symptoms along comes Boardwalk Empire from HBO.

While good family fare is fun at times, it is nice to have a morally complex character and story. Boardwalk Empire is merely the next one of these shows. Steve Buscemi is amazing in his portrayal of Nucky Thompson, the corrupt, scum ball treasurer of Atlantic City during Prohibition, and the crime boss of all vice in that city. Buscemi, good in almost anything he does, pulls out all the stops in a great leading role. Behold hecwas in danger of being typecast in his Reservoir Dogs type roles, this brings a slimy, unctuous bastard to the small screen that has tons of charisma and nerve. While quite bloody and sexual, as most HBO shows are, it is rarely gratuitous.

I'm not sorry I did. At first I was disturbed by how the main character, Nucky, was caked with so much make-up, lipstick included, that he looked like a walking corpse, fresh from a funeral parlor. Once I got used to that, I was hooked. As a fan of The Sopranos and Breaking Bad, I have come to appreciate made-for-TV, serial productions. This one won't let you down if you like shows about real terrible folks played by great actors. I'm three shows into Season One, and it just keeps getting better. I'm hooked.

I should not be forced to sit through their advertisements before I am allowed to watch the show I purchased. I was considering adding HBO to my cable subscription, but not after this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boardwalk Empire S1","review":"Bought this because of Kenneth Michael Williams, Omar. Season one was good did more laying of ground work for future seasons than tell a story. At first Buschemi didn't fit as nucky but after a few episodes I bought in. Can't decide if the costumes and props are lame accurate or both. The acting is good for the most part. Also the only reason I bought this was because it wasn't on Netflix. Gotta say I liked it and would recommend it to those looking for a good crime drama. Its no Wire but nothing is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start of a series","review":"We're a little behind the curve on this series but haven't heard a whole lot about it. Very interesting role for Buscemi (sp?). He's doing a great job at it and can tell he gets more comfortable with being the lead as the series moves forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Series","review":"This is a remarkable piece of work in the world of pay for view television. The writing and the actors are excellent. The story is set in the 1920's and is historically accurate. It's always fascinating to see how producers incorporate a fictional story into a historical background, and this is done beautifully. Ultimately, the most impressive and intriguing aspect is the character development and interaction of those characters. You find yourself studying them, analyzing why they are who they are as you learn the history of each. This is an intellectual production with a fascinating storyline. If you want action, this is probably not what you're looking for. If you value cinematic discourse, have an interest in US history (particularly around 1920), and are curious about the origin of organized crime in America, you'll like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"12 wonderful hours on the Boardwalk!","review":"The series takes time to understand the various characters in the program and injects new characters in just about every episode.

Your pretty much guaranteed a slam dunk when you see that it is also produced by Martin Scorsese who in addition to producing, directed the first episode which is much like a film in itself.A great start to what is sure to be an amazing series.

My problem is trust. After purchasing two seasons of Deadwood and five of the Sopranos, what did HBO do? They cancelled Deadwood and never gave it a proper ending, they cancelled Rome after two seasons and the Sopranos ending was so bad I traded in the dvd's at a used bookstore and never bouight season six. My concern is after purchasing season 1 and season 2 and so on, will HBO just do what they did with Deadwood, Rome and the Sopranos and leave everyone hanging?

He is assisted by Mark McCrite on guitars and vocals, Don Schiff (Eddie Money, Pat Benatar) on Stick and Tommy Amato (Doro) on drums. I have always liked these guys, but they seem to suffer from a lack of respect within the progressive rock community, and I have never really understood why. Their sound is more on the mainstream end of progressive rock. Norlander uses tons of old time analog keyboards to give it that authentic progressive rock feel. Vocalist McCrite has a nice voice that might fit in on an Alan Parsons Project album. Schiff and Amato provide solid rhythm. Highlights include \\"Wake Me Up\\", \\"Brutal Architecture\\", and \\"Mariner\\". Really I pretty much like this whole album. This is not my favorite disc by the band, but it is certainly worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, except for the straps..","review":"This little vibrator... designed to pleasure the clitoris but not cover \\"everything\\" is powerful, and fun.

I was pleasantly surprised!This book is full with stories about Shannon, and it gives you some insight into her life, career, and faith. It was nice to finally read some things written by Shannon, not about her.If you want to read about Shannon's life in her own words, read this book. You won't be disappointed!And no, Shannon does not tell you how to improve your life, she only gives suggestions and explains how different things worked for her, and could work for you.NOTE: This book is not a biography. It's only a bunch of stories strung together, but any die-hard gymnastic fan should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational!","review":"This is a wonderful book with inspirational words for anyone striving towards greatness in any sport.

Since then it has been inventively employed by artists ranging from the Dadaists to Rauschenberg in his 'combine' pictures. The author of this concise treatise is an artist and lecturer who takes the reader through the basic elements of the subject with a refreshing simplicity of explanation and example. Illustrations of collage works by artists Schwitters, Matisse, Gris and others demonstrate the almost limitless potential of this inexpensive and versatile method of constructing art objects in which almost anything from photogaphs to string, seeds and nails may be effectively used"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A GREAT BOOK!!!","review":"This book RULES, man!

He's infamous for his infantile rants and insults on the web. (As in the below review, posted anonymously, but obviously him.) \\"Some people don't get this book...\\" he claims. As though the story and it's theme were \\"above\\" some readers. Perhaps he did a crappy job of telling the story and conveying that theme? The book speaks for itself, regardless of it's inclusion in so- called \\"Best of\\" lists and claims by the author.

Micro Machines by Galoob was bought by Hasbro and they started making the Titanium series with pretty much the same molds. The Action Fleet versions are plastic whereas the Titanium versions are die-cast metal. I was amazed at the level of detail on this Y-Wing. It comes with a pilot and R2 unit. The cockpit opens, the landing gears retract, the left side engine \\"sensor\\" pulls open, the engines have a clear plastic over the rear section which is nice, and it comes with a stand. If you can't really have the larger version for the 3\\" figures, either because of cost or you just don't have the room, these are just as fun and sits well on a shelf.On amazon, I believe there was one for $9.95 plus shipping which is fair, but I wouldn't pay over $20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wireless Keyboard","review":"It's not bluetooth but does a great job.

It once locked my desktop too due to several attempts at unsuccessful logging on.The mouse was also poorly responsive. One really has to click several times before it responds.

The five programable buttons work well and are easy to program.The keyboard works fine. I like the zoom slide and calculator button. This keyboard has more features than I am likely to use, but I am a gadget junkie.The only things I have a beef about are lack of a light on the caps lock key, (I often hunt and peck and I sometimes type all caps). I realize a cap lock indicator would be a battery drain. Occasionaly, a window pops up to tell me the mouse is out of range or low on power. When I check the mouse application, all is well. My last complaint is a matter of taste... I am tired of silver plastic. It's the fake woodgrain of the new century. It's about as tasteful as Courtney Love at the Pope's ordination.The keys are worse than the silver board. They are a translucent grey. Roboturd grey?

I'd click on a dock icon and wait 2-3 seconds before the click was acknowledged and the application started. (Same for clicking on a hyperlink, menu, close button etc.)4. Mouse signal strength fluctuated between 2-5 \\"bars\\" even though I placed the base unit right next to the mouse. When 2 bars, mouse movement was shakey.

The keyboard seem ergonomic and stylish. HOWEVER, once set up, the wireless signal was uselessly weak -- to the point that the key board would not work on my keyboard tray less than 24\\" away from the receiver unit. The receiver unit has a long cord and theoretically could be extended closer to the keyboard, however that essentially defeats the point of a wireless unit and would have created wired clutter on the desktop. The receiver unit is surprisingly large -- larger than the mouse itself! I have used another Microsoft wireless keyboard (Microsoft Natural 7000) and it works much better, and has a much more compact USB receiver. In fact, I simply installed the MAC version of the 7000 driver and now use the 7000 keyboard.

This album has all the good metal tunes and I think their newer stuff gets even more corny (but good) than thier 80's image. The best songs are : sole survivors/ where the rain grows/ why?/ still we go/ & Mr. ego.

It's nothing amazing, but good for casual listening or gaming. Bass is lacking (duh), but doesn't sound tinny. Highs are alright, mids are decent. Like I said, it's not special, but it's a \\"good cheap pair.\\"The reason why it gets four stars is because they're DURABLE. I've owned my pair for several years now. They've been tangled and untangled, tossed into backpacks, stepped on and tripped over, tugged and yanked around. They passed with flying colors. Only recently has the left one finally started dying.In short: They're decent-sounding, yet stood up to over three years of rough use. A good durable pair, perfect for stuffing into pockets in case the need for headphones arises."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real McCoy","review":"I just got a two-pack from buy.com for cheap. They didn't come with the windy case, but they are genuine. I have a pair of genuine 7-year-old mx500's for comparison and they sound the same if not better. The treble is amazing as I am sitting here listening to AYNIN by the Durans. I am hearing things that I do not normally hear. They are a bit uncomfortable as all buds are to my ears after a while. But for the price of a large fry, check them out. You do have to boost the bass a bit. (It probably doesn't hurt that I have a Cowon D2+ and a Sansa Clip. Remember, you have to feed it with something good to get good out of it(AKA not an Ipod-yes I own one))."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 Months and it's broken!","review":"Pretty disappointing actually..

I'm not sure they are real Sennheisers. They may be counter fits. First because they came in vacuum sealed bags. Second because of their sound quality. Some of the other reviews here on Amazon make me think some people are receiving real Sennheisers, and others are getting either b-stock or counterfeit models.They don't sound bad, but don't sound as good as I would expect from Sennheiser. Clearly at this price point they aren't supposed to be high end. But I would rate them slightly below the standard Apple ear buds that come with iPods.The Sennheiser's have a little less bass, and more forward highs. The stronger highs make the less bass seem even weaker. For $7.50 they work as extra ear bugs to be laying around or used at the gym."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great case, poor sound","review":"I bought several ear buds for my wife's iPod because she was uncomfortable wearing the stock earbuds. Sennheiser always has had a good reputation and these got good reviews. She didn't like any of the options and prefers lightweight over the ear headphones so we put them away. I then bought an iPod and tried the different options that I bought for her. These produce a very muddy sound. By far the best are the Creative EP-630s. I now use those and store them in the Sennheiser case which is a great design and prevents cord tangle.If the carrying case comes with these ear buds (and some reviews say that it didn't), I'd buy them because the case is worth $10.00."},{"rating":"2","title":"cant beat the price!","review":"at only $8, the sound quality is really good, I could believe i was listening to so cheap earphones, dont think it twice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality earbuds","review":"I bought these in an effort to switch from using primarily in-ear headphones. The sound quality was the biggest attribute I was looking for, and these certainly deliver. They have no problem delivering clear and easy-to-listen-to sound. You can't reproduce the bass of canal phones, but for the form factor, these are great. At least comparable, and probably superior to the ones that come with an iPod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser in-hear headphones stay in my ears!","review":"I've always had a problem finding in-ear headphones that actually stay in my ears.

After listening for a couple of weeks, I'm quite impressed. They have a much more detailed sound than any of the other earbuds I've tried under $30, and even rival my Etymotics in their midrange clarity. I can understand lyrics that I never understood before on songs that I've literally listened to hundreds of times. They're quite comfortable in my ears as well.Downsides include a short cord (would be perfect if it was about 6 in longer) -- as is, I can't keep the player in my pants' pocket while listening. The foam covers also don't want to stay on very well.Overall, a very nice set of earbuds at an unbelievable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound great but uncomfortable","review":"I purchased these as a replacement for the Apple Earbuds that came with my iPod. For the price, the sound is great. They sound much better but fit similiarly to Apple's. Apparently I must have small ears and cannot get bud style headphones to stay in place without forcing them into my ear and causing pain.I have since replaced this pair with Shure in-ear headphones and am very pleased with the fit but do not appreciate the noise suppression that goes with in-ear headphones. I wish that the MX-400s came with various size earpices for people who have ears that are not \\"average\\". The bud style is very practical as it tends to deliver good sound, better than over-the-ear and almost as good as in-ear. The benefit for me is that buds allow other sounds to enter your ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"my ear holes must be too big!","review":"I bought these because the price was really cheap, and they got fairly good reviews. I garden often, and am always listening to my ipod or talk radio. These kept falling out of my ears. Maybe if i find foam covers for them at the dollar store and try them out again, but from now on, I'm staying with the earhook designs, particularly the blue sony's found about everywhere for ten bucks. The sony's are pretty durable, as even with getting them snagged several times a day, i only have to replace them about once a year. Sorry, Sennheiser, i really wanted to like you too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earbuds do the job so far","review":"I've only had them for a month, but so far I'm quite satisfied. They have a good sound, noticeably better than your bargain basement earbud. My main concern now is to see how durable they are, or if they break down after 2 months like a lot of earbuds. If they prove they can stand the test of time, my review would move up to 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sennheiser quality","review":"These headphones sound very tinny with little bass.

Honestly, I am quite disappointed in these mx400. In my opinion, the bass is very weak and the treble is overemphasized. Even playing with the EQ on my portable player didn't help much. I do realize these are an entry level model, but still, compared to my old buds, the mx400 sound inferior and unbalanced. If you want reasonable bass, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty bad sound....","review":"I compared a bunch of low price earbuds using my daughters 1st gen ipod, my sons zune, and my recently acquired 2nd gen touch with consistent results for all earbuds tested.This model has splashy smeared highs that after some amount of listening is fatiguing. Don't know what the folks who praise the sound of these are listening to, but then also I can't fathom why budwieser is the most popular beer.The Sony MDR-E828LP was the best sounding headphone of the bunch I tested by quite a margin. The Sony has clearer (much less smeared) highs and sounds more musical giving a sense of air/sound stage. Slight emphasis on the low end but its not too bad. Get those, don't waste your ears on these."},{"rating":"2","title":"GODLIKE SOUND QUALITY","review":"I can simply hear everything so crystal clear on these, they've actually made me start noticing the difference between mp3 and CD quality.. though not by much it is still amazing. They also do not distort at all at higher volumes, and they are overall perfect in every way except for the fact that they are earbuds... which is forgiveable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sound for the price","review":"I have several pairs of these, used with an iPod and a portable radio, occasionally my laptop. They are a great value, and have a smooth sound and good frequency range. The only drawback is that the wires could be more durable. I use them several hours a day, and it seems that the wires wear out from flexing and then I have to order another pair after a year or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing you can buy for the money","review":"These ear buds aren't the loudest, but they also are far from expensive.

My only complaints are that the sound is really lound and I need to turn down the volume on the computer and MP3 player for those headphones and then back up when these items are hooked up to other things. My other complaint is the length of the cord. The wire is not very long and so as I move my head the headphones keep coming out of my ears since the cord is so short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expected more from this unit","review":"I didn't realize how good the Shure e2c is until I try outthe MX400 unit. I know it's not a fair comparison since the Shure model costs 5x more than the Senheiser MX400. Nevertheless, it helped to convince me that I should just stick with a quality unit for serious listening.The MX400 is good for radio listening purpose. Also, it's a good alternative when I don't want to lug the Shure around.

Just because people give this high rating doesn't mean you should expect some great technology that will deliver everything. It's good for the price. When I lost these earbuds, I temporarily switched back to the stock earbuds.

Sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I am a first time camcorder owner and decided to get this camcorder based on reviews on another website. Then, right after I ordered the camera, I began reading the reviews on Amazon and got worried--I should have checked here first. After further research, I decided to also order the Panasonic PV-GS80 to compare the devices.What I found is that the Canon is just as loud as everyone has reported. When I played back the tape on my TV, you could hear the humming noise it makes while filming plus a clicking noise each time you zoom in or out. My other complaints are that it doesn't fit in the hand as well as the panasonic, it has a bottom tape loader, and the power adapter is only a couple of feet longIn comparison, the Panasonic was quite as a mouse. Images are also more crisp on the 2.7 inch screen and the power adapter is at least 5 feet long which is very helpful.I am returning the Canon ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor noise","review":"I really like the size and weight of the camera. It is very easy to use and the picture quality is pretty good. I had to return the cam because the motor noise is unacceptable. I recorded some scenes while skiing and the whiny noise is very noticeable, even outdoors. All the other reviewers claiming the cam records motor noise are dead on. I will spend a bit more money and get the Sony HCR-DC96 instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price - a few drawbacks","review":"There are a few drawbacks. The motor noise mentioned in other reviews is a real problem - it's a loud whine and hiss, really annoying. I almost sent the camera back because of this alone so be warned. There is no Firewire cable included, you have to get one before you can transfer video to the computer. No video software is included but since I am using Kino in Ubuntu Linux, it wasn't an issue. In Linux, it's extremely easy to transfer to Kino, edit, and burn to DVD using K3b. (don't forget in Ubuntu you have to run it as root - 'gksudo kino'). Kino controls the camera through the DV interface, playback, edit, export to DVD. Haven't tried anything more complicated than that yet. Controls are nice and picture and sound quality quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"This was the first electronic item I have ever purchased on the internet, and it does not work.

After recording one tape I decided to watch the footage to see what kind of quality it had. The video quality was outstanding but the audio was not. The motor in the camcorder puts off a quite hum which you don't pay any mind because it's very faint. However, the internal microphone picks up this hum and records it. I love everything else about the camcorder. But in my opinion the motor noise is just not expectable for something of this price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't come with necessary cable to do video transfer","review":"The camera is decent.

The white guy who played several roles including a black man & in the same persona an Indian (dot, not feather). Cant make up your mind? Who's mom played the mom at the beginning? I paid $2.47 for the movie & another $2.98 for shipping. I cant ever get this time or money back. I LOVE b-movies & have over 600 of them.

Regardless, though, of whether a movie is huge or low budget, it must have certain characteristics to make it enjoyable, such as a decent plot, good camera work, good acting, interesting characters, etc. This movie has none of those elements. In fact, the majority of the film is shot inside a van, and with a Walmart quality consumer camcorder. The plot is stupid, the acting horrible, and the image quality so bad its distracting. I'm embarrassed for the director and producer that they would issue something this terrible. I love movies, and they're a great form of escapism, and I tend to have a very flexible standard. However, time is short and precious, and I'd rather spend my time watching movies that at least have something redeeming. Not so here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do I really have to give it a whole star?","review":"I used to believe that there really wasn't a way to know what the worst movie of all time was, but now I know it's Zombies Gone Wild. Now I do enjoy watching bad horror movies but this goes way beyond that. I think that jamming a rusty fork in my eye would be more enjoyable than watching this movie. I do have to say my favorite part of the movie was when the random people walked into the scene not knowing the worst movie of all time was being filmed. If you have someone that you hate, I suggest thinking twice before sending this 'film' and asking youself 'How much do I really hate this person?' On the upside, anything that you watch next is a masterpiece. Even Uncle Sam or Black Sheep.

There are more than 200 games, but they are embedded with many variations, some of them complete miniatures of their own. This increases the value of the book as an opening reference. Although the book is hardly exhaustive or current, a certain level of player (<1500) could use it as a guide to openings.The complete games also serve as a lesson in attacking chess, sort of like 'Art of Attack' or 'Art of the Checkmate' (although WQaC is not organized by attacking theme). In addition, by covering up the moves, you can use this book for tactical exercises. There aren't as many problems as in a typical exercise book, but the fact that they appear in the context of full games rather than isolated positions makes them more valuable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"This is pretty much one of the best 3rd player combat games i have played, which says a lot.

From her wild and sexy reggae version of Fever to the incredibly energy she and the band create on My Romance, this album will leave you feeling happy! I love the ballads too, particularly The Night Has a Thousand Eyes, and We Kiss in a Shadow, two little masterpieces...incredible lilting tropical moods.

This is the most creative album I have heard in years. If anyone has any doubts about the future of jazz singing, here it is! As the other reviewers have said, the album is a trip through a number of different musical styles, all solidly grounded in jazz. The band is incredible, and Kitty Margolis shines on every tune. There's nobody like her singing today. Some of the songs are small miracles of creativity and musical excellence.Now I can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"like coffee and chocolate on a Friday evening","review":"If I were to select songs for a contemporary jazz vocal collection, I would choose 'In walked bean' from Kitty Margolis, which is a perfect representative of her work. Her humorous scat singing is something we missed in the world of jazz singing, where women are given certain stereotypical roles. The new jazz women bring their intelligence to their singing. Kitty Margolis' witty and experimental style carries her to surprising tastes such as the Indian flavoured interpretation of 'Speak Low'. You have never heard it like this before.However, the peak of this album is unmistakably 'Wouldnt it be loverly' which is almost like coffee and chocolate on a tired but content Friday evening after a long week's work. Not to forget the contribution of Charles Brown's duet to this song. The only other song, which gives me such a similar pleasure is Betty Carter's 'When its sleepy time Down South'."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"The synopsis said Marines were sent in when actually it was SEALS.

I am not sure what this was about. I do, however, take exception to the first review. Lance Henriksen is not quite a \\"no-name\\" actor, having been in the casts of Dog Day Afternoon, Aliens, and The Terminator. That said, his imdb resume should be a clue that the \\"supernatural\\" might be involved.The problem with this flick is that it doesn't know it's audience: scifi, horror, war, supernatural? It tries to appeal to many and ends appealing to few. Standard crew, including the token female, runs around the ship and each is killed/disposed of in the usual fashion.This is a movie you watch w/friends in order to laugh at how much they got wrong (or, to take a drink everytime they do something we've seen a million times before).Don't buy it, don't rent it, wait for it to come on cable and if you have a little time to waste, it won't kill you to watch this...then again, it adds nothing to any of the canons it tries so hard to emulate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality and value","review":"I was very pleased when the jewelry box arrived!

I was especially worried about the mic hole at the bottom as it rides right up against the cutout instead of being centered.If you are not picky about cases and just want some cheap protections with a kickstand, this will definitely do.

For ~$15 they most likely beat out any other buds that come standard with mp3 players. They don't really isolate, but then they're not supposed to, which can be a good or bad thing depending on your situation. I got these to replace the lower model Senn MX300s that came with my Rio Karma. Save yourself a couple bucks and get the Senn MX400s since the only difference is the lack of volume control and color (same drivers so I hear from others).The only problems I have with the Senn buds are the short cable length (3ft) and the shape of the buds. Sometimes they feel a little loose, but you can get them into a position where it gets a relatively tight position (tight enough to not fall out while jogging/running)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"I use these headphones on a cd player when I walk or jog. It is so handy to have the volume control right at my fingertips since my MP3's do not have volume leveling. The audio quality is a big step up from the cheap pair of earbuds I had been using. The buds themselves are a little larger than I'm used to but it bothers me a little less with each use and I'm sure that with time, I won't even notice. Cord length is fine.

I also have a set of ($100+) Shure E3c's that I use for traveling by plane, and the sound quality of the Sennheiser MX-500's is easily as good as the Shure. I primarily use the Sennheisers as laptop headphones at work.

So my real rating would be 4 or a 5. In terms of value, definately a 5.The sound range is great, the comfort is quite good, the earbuds might be slightly too big in terms of comfort, but I guess that makes them not fall out as easily. I like that the lengths of the two wires to the ears are actually equal (I don't know what idiotic product designer thought it would be a good idea to start that trend of having one be short and constantly tugging at my ear). The windup function, though nothing new to the market, is also a convenient function for me since my old ones would always get tangled up in the front pocket of my backpack.edit 2: Not the most durable earphones, I seem to replace them every couple of years, but they're cheap so why not?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great, not good","review":"These earphones are not secure in the ear, having a tendency to just fall out.

They don't have the punch or clarity that the PX-100s have. They sound tinny, and the music lacks any sort of power.On the other hand the PX-100s are amazing, even though the form factor isn't as convenient as the MX-500s.

The sound really disppoints me. I had SONY MDR-888SP, which is among the top pair. The reason I bought this one is because my MDR-888 is sort cord and I need a long cord one. Unlike the clear, crispy and fully detailed sound from MDR-888SP, this one is just like you are listening to an old radio. Not even compete my crapy MDR-805. Just for the price someone might be able to suffer it, I'm not.And this pair is very uncomfortable for me. It hurts my ear after merely 15min usage. It is too big for me, even without the sponge. However, the SONY MDR-888 is so comfortable.In general, if you are not so picky for sound qualify but picky for price, it's a good choice.

These Sennheisers solved the second problem: the sound is clear, precise, and quite satisfying. Alas, these buds are no more secure in my ears (which my wife tells me are quite normal in their shape) than any of the others I tried.

In heavier shoes or when walking any distance, they become a sweaty mess because nylon is non-absorbent and provides no wicking or in-shoe airflow. I've never before had problems with my feet smelling bad, but after a week of these nylon disasters, my shoes started to smell because moisture-wise these socks are as good as going barefoot. Eeew.

Taylor. We think that the movie was jumbled and confusing. There were scenes from the middle of the story in the beginning of the video and scenes from the middle of the story at the conclusion of the video. One would not know what was happening in the movie unless he/she had read the novel. We agree with another reviewer who said that they were eagerly awaiting Casey's retaliation towards Lillian Jean. We were so disgruntled when this scene was not included in the movie. The movie was a huge disappointment! Our class enjoyed the book so much and anticipated that the movie would capture our interest, also. It did not. Don't bother watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was all mixed up.","review":"This movie didn't go along with the author's version. The scenes were backwards and if you read the book, you'd see that if you rewound the movie, it would still be all mixed up. They must have been short of actors or actresses becaus the characters weren't the right ones. Yes, it is a good lesson, but if you read the book, you will find out even more about this story and also our country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roll of Thunder","review":"I think this movie was not even close to the book. The way they started the movie was more like the middle of the book. There were many obvious differences between the two. Like in the book there were Wallaces and Simms and in the movie there were only Wallaces. If you haven't read the book and you watch the movie it would confuse you. The acting in the movie was really bad besides Morgan Freeman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roll of Thunder,Hear My Cry.","review":"The Roll of Thunder movie was not very good. You would have to read the book before you watch the movie because you would not understand what is going on if you don't. I think whoever made it should have put a little more effort into it. I think whoever directed the movie wanted the Avery's and Logan's killed and personally I liked to Logans very much. All I have to say is the movie was pitiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Come Close to the Book","review":"Most movies based on books do not deliver the power that the books do, but the film version of Roll of Thunder does an even worse job that usually is done. It would be hard to replicate the experience of that wonderful story, but this movie does so little for the viewer that it is not worth the time to watch. It is slow and drags on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Judge a Book by the Movie","review":"The Movie is totally confusing. It leaves out important scenes that are relevant to movie. I jumps around. The casting is all wrong. Cassie looks 15 instead of 9. She's much bigger than Stacey who is 12-13! I've shown this movie to my students over 10 years and none of them like it at all. They actually get angry while watching because they know scenes are not correct. It is a good lesson in compare/contrast and how a book can be so much better than the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not a good movie.","review":"This movie lacked the chronological order that the book had. The movie started with what the book had right in the center. It started with Papa breaking his leg, and the book has Papa breaking his leg in the middle or close to the end of the book. Uncle Hammer doesn't have a Packard, he has some older car and it wasn't silver like the book said. Mama loses her job at the school in the beginning of the movie and miraculously has it back at the end of the movie. This movie also lacked the characters the Simms. Lillian Jean was Mr. Wallace's kid, and Jeremy didn't appear more than twice in the whole movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roll of thunder","review":"I think this movie was horrible.

It would make more sense to read the book and forget that they ever made a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"That was the worst movie I ever saw","review":"This movie was horibble. All the scenes were out of proportion. I was so disappointed. After our class had read the book, we were all pretty satisfied with it. So we decied to watch the movie. It started out with the movie starting in the middle of the book. Some of the parts were left out of the movie. I just have a little note for the director; read the book and make the movie right. And to the author: why would you let them make a movie of the book? The book is already great without the movie. I think this movie is the worst movie ever; they missed out on the beating up on T.J and when Cassie beats up Lillian Jean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roll of Thunder Review","review":"I believe that the movie was really bad. The movie was completely different from the book. For example, the kids were talking about the bus and the movie never showed the bus in the movie. So if you never read the book, you would have absolutely no clue what they are talking about. I did enjoy the book, but I was really disapointed by the movie. I honestly think that the movie was about the worst movie ever made. I am kind of wondering why Midred D.

Considering the fact that as a class we read the book first than watched the movie, it was all out of order.

This is why I do not think any body should watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie was Whack","review":"I feel that this movie was not so good. I like some parts like when Uncle Hammer came to thier house. He had a nice car. I didn't like how he sold his car. However, Uncle Hammer had to sell his car in order to make payment on the land. I also liked when Cassie pulled Lillian Jean's hair. The parts I didn't like was how the charachters didn't look like they were suppose to. Another reason I didn't like the movie was because it skippd alot of parts and it stopped too much. I wish the director would have showed more completed scenes. If I was to rate this movie, I would give it a one (1)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie bites the big one","review":"easily one of the worst movies i have EVER seen.

We would reccomend reading the Newberry Award winning book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Disappointing :-(","review":"My fourth-grader and I read this wonderful book together and I hyped her on watching this movie, which came out when I was in the fourth grade in the seventies. How disappointing! What a rip-off! This video takes edited scenes as a montage at the beginning and then starts in the middle of the story. Entire scenes critical to character development and plot are lost--the beautiful relationship between the siblings, Stacie's relationship to TJ, how the Logans got their land and why they were so different than the other sharecropping families, the role of Mama and Big Ma in keeping the family together, etc. You'd be lost watching this movie if you hadn't read the book. My daughter and I were eagerly awaiting the scene when Cassie gets her revenge on Lillian Jean, which is shown only as a ending montage of scenes. How unfortunate--with DVDs out now, there's no reason for this movie not to be available in its entirety. I should have heeded the warnings of the other Amazon reviewers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Hoped It Would Be","review":"I wish I could get ahold of the original uncut version of this. In the editing process, events have been placed in the wrong order and much of the emotionalism we should feel has been eliminated. My students are very disappointed in the film adaptation. It does not do the book justice at all. Is there any way to find the original?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves a big, fat zero!","review":"This movie was made by someone on a diet of white bread and packaged vegetables - bland, blander, blandest. Whereas the book is moving, if a bit over-reliant upon the narrator Cassie overhearing everything and all the children getting into the action, yet again, the movie makes you want to yell obscenities. One example will do. The book is set in the Depression-era Deep South, rural Mississippi - it didn't get any worse for blacks - and the sharecroppers are desperately poor. Yet the characters all look as though they're just shopped off the rack at the country store. There's no fire, no emotion, no tension.I urge another attempt at a movie of this book because it could be outstanding - the plot is there for people to do something wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was almost as good as the book , but not as detailed","review":"I loved the book and the movie. It shows how a family w/ not alot of money can/could survive. It also shows how young children have to listen to all the racism, and also be abused because of the wrong skin color. It shows to be strong and that no matter what someone thinks of you, does not matter. What matters is that you a proud of who you are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I have just finished watching this book at school because we have been studying the book. The book is very good; it is gritty, down to earth and tells it like it is (in some parts it is quite violent). But the film is very disappointing. The acting is wooden, the children all look wrong (Cassie is supposed to be 9 but she looks 15) and constantly have cheesy grins on their faces. The film is too sentimental and cheesy. The film also cuts out a lot of the swearing and violence as well as other parts of the story. For example, John Henry Berry is badly burnt and in the book he is still alive and the children see him badly burnt but in the film he is buried under the rubble of his house and you do not see him.This film not only badly acted, overly sentimental and inaccurate, it is also quite unfaithful to what is a quite short book. Do not watch this!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could put 0 stars","review":"I hate this movie. It was wack. I wish the actors didn't get paid. I thought the lighting was horrible. You can't even see the people. It was like a horror movie like this. In the scene where Cassie gets back at (Miss) Lilian Jean she only pulls her hair. Also the guy who played Mr. Morrison isn't 7 foot tall he looks like a leprechaun compared to how they describe him in the book. Ithink Mildred D. Taylor should not have let them make the movie after she saw it. If they remake it I hope its way better!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adult Reader and Viewer","review":"I saw the original version of this movie. I thought it was pretty good. This edited version made this movie frustrating to watch if you read the book first. The original version followed the sequence of the book. Like any movie adapted from a novel, not everything was included, but it was good. This version is horrible. Even the box says it has 115 minutes running time. But thats not true. I don't think anyone should buy this version. The flaws in the editing are just to horrendous. I hope that a DVD will be produced to enclude the original version because the story is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Rather Roll Over and Die","review":"The movie is horrible. The movie takes moments from the book and puts them out of order. Events that happended at the beginning of the book were put at the ending in the movie. The movie also leaves out important details from the book that should have been used to describe events in the movie. Without those details the event makes no sense what-so-ever to someone who has not read the book. In summary, read the book and forget the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry","review":"This movie is so out of sequence. The movie starts out in the middle. You didn't even get to see Cassie beat down Lillan Jean. The book was way better. I liked the book, but the movie was so stupid. Mr. Morrison wasn't even burnt. The Simms and the Wallaces were like the same faimly. There was no point in making this movie if it was so out of sequence. You would have to read the book even to understand the movie. I hope people read the book before the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie was such a let down!!","review":"In my opinion the movie Roll of Thunder Hear my cry was terrible! I didn't like it at all. It didn't even compare to the book. It was so off, if you wouldn't have read the book, you would have had no idea what was going on. The time sequence was so out of order. Why, if you are making a movie about a book would you start in the middle and then jump from different scenes. It was so confusing and just plain dumb. They might as well of not even made the movie and wasted the money, because it just messed everything up. All I really had to say is that it was a terrible movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Roll of thunder Hear My Cry","review":"This movie was way different from the book.

My advice...don't watch the movie!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good","review":"I think that this movie did not live u[ to the book not because of he actors or the scenery it was because of the skiping around that it did, showing parts of the ending at the begining also the actors were not so life like please redo the movie as the book (in oder) or you will not get one cent out of me agin if this movie dose not go as well as it should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry","review":"Beware!The book by Mildred D. Taylor is powerful and riveting. I have used this book in my classroom and the children have loved it. The chance to use the video to enhance the book motivated me to buy it. Imagine my surprise when the video proved to be edited sloppily. The video jumps from one scene to another out of order. I believe the video, if in correct order, would be worthwhile. Morgan Freeman is always worth watching, and the rest of the cast is excellent also. This was a deep disappointment to me.Since I was foolish enough to throw away the packaging, I cannot return it. If you purchase this video, save everything and check it out immediately.

It looks great but there are two problems. The mechanism for the drain is not very well designed (I got the plastic option). Maybe it's the sink I installed it in but there is no good setting so that the drain opens enough to let the water drain quickly. The second and most important issue is that the aerator is not very well designed (it's an insert) - it doesn't soften the flow of the water and from that height the water splashes into the sink and onto the counter. The thread is a non-standard size and you cannot get a replacement at Home Depot - I'm trying to see if there are other options.

Not only that, but the writing was so awful I felt like I was reading something written by a high school creative writing student. No, I take that back -- I think a high school student could have done better.

We knew what we were looking for when we checked prices on Amazon and other sites. It was least expensive here, and shipped in its original factory sealed packaging.

I figured I'd \\"give it a shot,\\" and man am I sorry. Both cd's are sleepers from start to finish. Disk 1 lost my attenetion 2 minutes into the first track, and never regained it. Disk 2 was equally mind-numbing, and I doubt I will ever listen to them again...If you like Tiesto and Paul van Dyk, then I do not mean to discourage you, this may be a good buy for you, but it is just not my style of music.If you want to hear some really interesting, creative music, check out both editions in the GU's 24:7 series by Danny Howells and Lee Burridge, amazing!!!

But overall, it was a delightful CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC","review":"Tiesto has created a Classic with Nyana. Indoor / Outdoor has captured the vast divergence in style that exists in the genre of trance. Outdoor is raw and powerful while Indoor is subtle and refined.

I'm a spinning class instructor and use this CD and the Search for Sunrise 3 CD every day or so, and my class just loves it. It pumps up your adrenaline and it makes you wanna sweat and burn fat!

This mix does have some rather good tracks such as \\" Let the light shine in (Darren Tate's one hit wonder) or Holden - nothing (93 return etc.) This is the mix of a fallen star (Dj Tiesto aka Dj Tiesticles ) back when I was about 15 or so the name Tiesto meant something. It stood for an individual who dedicated his life to the sound of the underground . Tiesto had magic by all means. Little by little he began selling out, playing worthless songs in the top ten list, trying to please the majority of the club goers around the globe.... it's a shame he's in the number one slot. I've seen talent that smokes tiesto away (ex James Zabiela)So if you want a retrospect of top club hits from 2003, I would recommend this cd. Its tolerable but the mixing is borderline average"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's alright","review":"I was expecting a little more from this album. CD 1 is very good, but kinda slow and floaty. CD 2 has too many vocals. Almost all of the tracks up to number 10 are vocals but they are nicely done. The last 3 tracks are much better and pick up the tempo. You can say they are hardcore compared to the rest of the CD's slow moving tracks.

I rarely write reviews, but I think these Cardinal gates are much better than other baby gates on the market!Easy for my wife and I to quickly open and close -- with just one finger.

It's installed at the bottom of our stairs and my toddler loves the way the metal sounds when she shakes the door (it stays closed, despite her best efforts). The one-handed open is easy to use, even when my hands are full of kids, laundry, whatever. The auto lock works great. The only downside is that for the autolock to work I have to let the gate \\"slam\\" behind me. Since it's metal, that makes a loud noise.

Every train in the geotrax line that we have purchased has stopped working. I have sent trains back at least four times. The last one was given to him at Christmas and it stopped working before the end of Jan. My son loves this toy, and he hasn't thrown them or beaten up on them or done anything to cause this. The trains usually stop working after being stored( without batteries) from 1 week to 2 months.My son is really frustrated, because every time he tries to play, something doesnt work. At this point only 1 train works, and the last train, which I sent in to be fixed because they didnt have any to replace- they never sent back. Its been 8 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"The engine and the remote did not work.

The engine light would come on but as you screwed the door in it would go out and the button didn't work. Fisher-price is replacing the original engine and remote. They didn't have the other engine I bought in stock so they gave me a voucher but it wasn't equal to what I paid. This was one of my son's \\"special\\" presents for Christmas.

At 1-1/2, he just wanted to swipe the train and push the button on and off. He didn't want to build the tracks, play with the train controller, let the train go on the tracks, and he was oblivious to the tracks and would step all over them even if we built them. Now that he is three, he plays with it appropriately, and his little brother who is 1-1/2 does all the same things my 3YO did at that age. But they do fight over the train cars so I bought an extra train!!The windmill is so cute; they both love watching the track pieces with \\"gadgets\\" on them! This is one of the few things my 3YO asks to play with EVERY DAY. I will buy them the crane attachment for the holidays."},{"rating":"2","title":"great train","review":"We ordered this for our almost four-yr. old son, who wants a \\"real\\" electric train but is not ready for one. This was perfect since he can control it with the remote (and thinks it's electric). It is also very durable and easy for him to take on and off the track. Best, it doesn't come off the track easily when he operates it, so it's not frustrating at all. And the sounds are realistic but not loud and annoying. I've already ordered other Geotrax accompanying products for his upcoming birthday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Toy for Both Kids and Adults!","review":"My 3-year-old nephew got this set from me for Christmas along with another GeoTrax train set from his grandmother that didn't come with a remote control. For the most part, I think he really enjoys both sets, but he's not sure of the remote control thing, so he just pushes the cars around on the tracks which is fine. His dad seems to play with the remote control alot, so hopefully my newphew will learn to use it by watching his dad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy for any toddler to run this train","review":"My 3 year old granddaughter had no problem running the train and working the tracks in a matter of minutes.

I think Thomas The Tank engine has met his match!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great train set!","review":"We got this train set for my 2-year old for Christmas and he was instantly in love with it - he got to help us put the tracks together and really likes being able to operate the train remote all on his own. It is much, much sturdier than some other, more expensive train sets (*cough, Thomas, cough*), shuts itself off automatically when it is not in use to conserve batteries, makes cool noises (not the really annoying kind that some toys make), and is designed so that toddlers can play with a parent or friend or all on their own without getting frustrated- my son got the hang of how this train works and can do almost everything on his own already (except for totally reconfiguring the track set-up) but is not in the least bored with it.I definitely see myself buying some of the expansions that go along with this set as well as passing it on to my younger son when he is old enough for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality product & LOADS of fun","review":"All the Geo Trax sets are great. We've had them for two years now. My son has thrown, stomped, twisted, and abused these sets and not one piece has broken. We have had great times putting them together over and over again.

From the books prologue wherein a pregnant woman goes to a ramshackledbuilding to consult with a \\"gris-gris\\", the authors descriptive writing as to the characters, and their environments, impressed me and filled me with a sense of dread/worry. LeBlanc is what I'd call a good \\"set-up\\" writer: presenting well developed characters existing within an atmosphere of believable \\"other-wordly\\" scenarios. I usually read at a steady, methodical, pace. However, as the book came to a close, I found myself reading faster and faster to eagerly get to the book's end; it's the \\"what happened next?!?!\\" syndrome :)The story does, unfortunately, conclude with an over-the-top resolution.

She has a brother locked up in a sanitarium, tormented by a force he doesn't understand. Turns out it's a demonic entity who's also torturing some bayou dweller named Eli, who has the same healing powers as Jessica. Jessica has a son, and of course that somewhat ruins the whole thing, as kids tend to do, and in the end there's lots of bloodletting and nonsense.

The eye relief is perfect for use on a compstock using a 0 moa extended weaver rail with the scope mounted all the way forward.

It also continues to show a red light and some beeps if you miss a dose (very good thing). The price is reasonable.Not so good, you have to use another clock/alarm to set it, no built in timer. So when your clock says 3PM you set the reminder and then again at the next time point. It also does not hold in memory so when the batteries go you have to start over. Also, if you need to change an alarm you can only delete ALL of the alarms you've set and start over. I still like it, because of the ease of carrying, the reminder you missed a dose, and size. Just wish setting was less difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crafting a romance story","review":"The best part about Author Lanigan's book on writing the Great American Romance is her section on outlining. She advises you to dedicate one page per chapter when you outline. To this chapter page staple information on setting, decoration, or history pertinent to that specific chapter. She also stresses the importance of character sketches before you write of up to 20 pages for each major character. I also liked her advice on creating genealogy trees for the heroine and hero so you could include heartfelt information on their family - aunts, cousins and so forth.

In it is so much information, so well thought out, and so, well, full of information that a good DM NEEDS for games that I wouldn't mind listing it under \\"Core books\\" for this genre. I could list for you the multitude of different feats/classes/items/NPCs/etc, but this can only be 1,000 words, and that's not nearly enough to do this book justice.

In plain, simple English, you are walked through the architecture and set up of ASP and the environment in which to run it. The modules are well thought out and easy-to-follow. You don't get lost.If you already have some ASP experience, then this book will probably be a little basic. for someone like me who needed to do some form-submissions using email and page counters, the book is ideal. I was up and running in a couple of hours (you can skip bits).My only complaint is with troubleshooting. The writers tell you what results to expect which is good, but they don't tell you what to do if you don't get the results you expect. This is particularly the case with the database modules where I had some problems writing to a database and I had followed the instructions to the letter.However, an overall good starter book and I recommend it thoroughly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.

The battery goes dead after 10 minutes of talking, and it gets worse, it beeps for the last 5 of those minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Bag","review":"Having now had the opportunity to use this slepping bag, I can say that I am very impressed. The bag kept me warm and comfortable. Also, it takes up very little room when compressed and weighs next to nothing. My only complaint is that I wish the zipper were longer. The zipper only extends about 2 feet down the side of the bag and makes it somewhat difficult to get into the bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag for price, stuffs down to nothing, but wish zipper was longer","review":"This is a good bag and an incredible price. It stuffs down to barely bigger than cantaloupe size with compression straps on the stuff sack, and is featherlight too.The one complaint is about the zipper. I'm guessing they saved money by only extending the zipper half way down the bag. This makes it a little harder to get into, especially in a cramped space like a bivy or 1 man tent, and also prevents you from being able to regulate heat by opening the zipper. Since this bag is intended for warm weather, you may find that it's _too_ warm at some point, but you're kind of stuck inside it from your waist down...Still, it was so cheap for a nice down bag that I can't complain too much, so I'm giving it 4/5 stars. If it had cost $100 I would have given it 3/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for the price, but a few flaws","review":"i ordered these a week and a half ago and recently received them, and i have to say that i am satisfied for the ... price for which i purchased these headphones. however, the LB1S headphones look like they are grey here, but actually end up being more bluish tinted. also, they feel a little awkward at first and a bit uncomfortable, but after a little while, i guess i will adjust. they are lightweight, but they are also a little flimsy and wobbly. but i am very satisfied. they look cool and i am the first kid on the block to get them, becuase amazon.com is the only place i have ever seen them. they are stylish and just downright cool. so buy them, kids, today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Unless you are buying these for a child or you have a small head, don't buy them.

Furthermore, the book wasn't even updated to algebraic notation. Reinfeld only managed to be one of the most prolific chess authors at the expense of quality and depth. Your money would be better spent on a higher quality (and cheaper!) book by Chernev or Pandolfini. Reinfeld's coverage of the openings is not complete either, as the title would suggest. It isn't even very insightful. Fine's 'Ideas Behind the Chess Openings' would be a better (and again, cheaper) alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"The all-in-one book written for all.","review":"While written some time ago, the book's lessons still prove invaluable today. Covers everything you want to know, a to z. I also recommend Pandolfini's Weapons of Chess, an excellent book of short lessons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Several out of date books have been rebound into one volume.","review":"The analysis *frequently* leaves out the best moves. Some of the answers to puzzles in the tactical sections are not correct. (I verified this fact with my computer.) At least the principles Reinfeld espouses are useful for the beginner. Most of the individual volumes were originally published in the fifties and the analysis is often out of date. The publishers could have at least corrected the outright mistakes and updated the notation to algebraic. You would be much better off with a new book by Chernev or Pandolfini."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced, Outdated, Overhyped: Look Elsewhere","review":"Try the \\"Mammoth Book of Chess\\" for a complete chess course that is far less expensive (about half Reinfeld), current, and more balanced in presentation. The Mammoth Book provides you with an excellent single volume introduction to tactics, openings, planning, endgames,etc. It is truly amazing. I'm not saying Reinfeld is useless but your time and money I sincerely believe would be better spent elsewhere. Were I just learning the game, this time around I would use \\"The Mammoth Book Of Chess.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"CAUTION !","review":"This book may teach you something if you don't even know how the pieces move. I have never seen such a large book with this much \\"Fluff\\". Fluff is basic, useless, words and diagrams meant to do nothing but take up space on otherwise blank pages. I purchased this book along with many others while living in Nevada. I purchased books and awarded them to the top students in our local chess tournaments. The \\"winner\\" of this book donated it to the school library after just a few days. After taking a closer look at it I couldn't blame her. This is an overpriced hardcover book.If you click on my name you will get my personal information and see a recommended study list.

Reinfeld loved the game, explained it in simple and clear terms and made a reader believe he could play better chess too. This is a book for novices and lower-rated players looking for concepts and simple themes. For me this book has nostalgia value only (I'm rated 2150 USCF now) but I'd recommend this book for people who are casual players not looking for serious annotations with riqorous analysis, but do want something instructional that won't be over their heads. As a kid, reading Reinfeld WAS FUN!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Breath of Scandal","review":"If you're running short of clich��s, you can find the mother lode in this book. It's fraught with unbelievable characters making idiotic choices. Women in particular are portrayed as incapable of rational thought. By the time you've read chapter one, the ending will be obvious. If you're determined to read this embarrassingly bad piece of bumf (look it up!), I recommend you get it from the library rather than spending actual money on it. What a waste of perfectly good tree!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bodice-burster with soft-corn porn sex","review":"This is a typical bodice-burster with explicit sexual detail that qualifies it as soft-core pornography. Why have none of the other reviewers mentioned this? If that's what you want (and apparently a lot of people do because it sells) buy this one. If you don't want your brain to turn into mush, and if your have or want to develop transcendant values, read something worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This book was not a run of the mill reading. It offered suspense, sadness, tragerdy, lauaghter, sweetness, love, fullment and all of the \\"life\\" things that can happen to a person. I fell in love with the main characters. When they finally got together, it was so sweet, it almost made me cry. The whole book was a page turner. Great job by Sandra Brown. It just needs to be on CD so that I can listen to it while I am sleeping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding! Brown outdoes herself!","review":"This was the 4th of Sandra Brown's books that I have read. I have several more on my shelf that are awaiting attention. This is by far my favorite of her books that I have finished. I love Brown's writing and have been enthralled by each of the stories I have read so far, but I think she has outdone herself with this one.Breath of Scandal is engaging, suspenseful, emotional, and extremely hard to put down. Ms. Brown is an expert story teller and has filled this story with deep, interesting characters that you can't help but love or in some cases hate. You will be mesmerized by the twists and turns that leave you wanting to know more! There were several nights that this book kept me up far later than I had intended to be up!This book is an absolute must read for Sandra Brown fans. If you've never read Sandra Brown, this is an excellent book to start with! If you're overwhelmed by book choices, pick this one. You won't regret it. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am a big fan of Sandra Brown","review":"I have read and kept most of her books so any you have listed for me to read, I probably have read. This is one of some very interesting twists of intrigue and I found this to be one of my favorites. Horrible things happen to good people and sometimes the bad people receive their justification and sometimes not. This is also a very sexy and erotic book that later on takes place and it's just one book you can't put down because you have to find out how the story plays out. Reading the ending is 'taboo' but you also miss so much when you do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever turns you on","review":"This is the first book I have read by Sandra Brown. She writes well, creates interesting characters though a bit too \\"fit the mold\\". I wish I could say I enjoyed the book, but I didn't. Revenge is a strong emotion, but the way this lead character devoted her whole life to it (taking some extreme risks in so doing)didn't endear her to me. I found her actions stupid at times and boring at others. If you like pink passion, this is a book for you as there is plenty of that--so much it distracts from the story itself. I suppose the reason a good author like Brown writes this kind of novel is that it sells--and selling makes money. More power to her. I will try another of her books before I judge her work on this one book, but right now i have my doubts that I will find anything different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a credible story","review":"She gets gang raped when young, and as an adult, goes back to get revenge. She exposes her beloved rape son to the poisonous tongues of a small town. Hard to swallow. She is terrified by well meaning men, but not by her rapist when she stops her on a lonely road close to the place where the dirty deed occured. The book has a lot of nice moments but the inconsistencies are overwhelming. I gave up on page 337 so I do not know if it gets any better or even worse at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Captivating Story\\"!","review":"I Couldn't put this book Down! I think those 3 boys Got what they Deserved For the Horrible thing they did to Jade. I Enjoyed this Book Very Much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one was tough.","review":"Rape, assult, betrayal, abortion, lies, heartbreak, defeat, revenge, victory, joy, and love. ... it's all here.I was torn with this one. It starts out slow, but then suddenly you crash into everything. Horrible things just all happen at once, and I could not stop crying. I had to put it away. This one really hurt to read.It drew me in, but let me down in the end (hence only 4 stars) What heppened to the mother. I wanted that to be tied in at the end. And the reaction the son gave when all was revealed, that was not really believeable. All in all a very moving book. Certainly not your run of the mill romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliches abound about the South, very outdated descriptions","review":"This book is so cliche-ridden that it takes away from the writing. It has a poor girl from a small southern town, a rape by good ol' boys, a rescuer in the form of a poor black man in overalls, poor girls with stringy hair, poor men with greasy hair, etc., etc., etc. I did eventually get interested in the story, but had to suffer through an outdated view of people in the South. Not one of Ms. Brown's better works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY TOUCHING STORY","review":"This is more than a story of revenge. It is a story of courage and triumph. For Jade, it is about revenge, yes, but also about learning to truly LIVE again. For Dillon, it is about forgiving himself. Finding each other was the best thing that could have happened to Jade and Dillon. This is my favorite book by Sandra Brown. Be Blessed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, even if sometimes unbelievable.","review":"This book was pretty good. I thought the plot was pretty believable, with one exception: Jade's son's basically nonchalant reaction to being informed that he was the product of a rape was completely unbelievable. Such a revelation would have had incredibly damaging psychological consequences on a 14-year-old boy. I thought the fact that Jade had kept this important fact from her son was very irresponsible and selfish, and the author basically chickened out and failed to hold Jade responsible for this. Other than, an entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"And Justice for all.","review":"Sandra Brown is one of my favorite authors because her books have substance, plot, and believable characters, this book is no exception. But be warned, the entire first half of the book is setting the stage. The two main characterd don't meet until well into the second half. I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because it was so hard to read tragedy after tragedy with only mildly pleasent moments inbetween. The story is about revenge and redemption. Both the main characters come from tragic pasts and are pounded at every turn by more. Though, at the end, all ends well. Getting there was painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of tragedy, but a solid story","review":"This is a story of revenge, redemption, healing, and a little romance. I'm still fairly new to Sandra Brown, but this was a really good one. Both the highs and the lows in the story are equally great. The only issue I had is that she uses the \\"sudden tragic event\\" as a plot device a little bit too much. There's a lot that happens in this story... rape, betrayal, pregnancy, suicide, AIDS, terminal illness, allergic reactions, accidental death, car accidents, heart attacks... it's a lot to take in. And I found myself getting frustrated with Jade when she wouldn't share what happened to her with those that cared about her. I wanted to yell, \\"For cripe's sake, just tell them already!\\" Yet, I could hardly stop myself from listening. Brown knows how to write sexual chemistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Page Turner","review":"Even though this book was written in 1991, the story is still relevant today. I read this book based on the reviews here in Amazon and I wasn't disappointed. While the story begins with an unspeakable act that goes from bad to worse, there are some good things that eventually come out of it. Jade Sperry was a terrific heroine and I loved her eventual relationship with Dillon Burke. Both of these people have tragic pasts that they manage to deal with together. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and have to say, that it is one of Sandra Brown's best that I've read so far. I'm looking forward to reading some of her newer novels like Chill Factor and Ricochet."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars for Just Being on DVD!","review":"Yep. I havent seen the DVD yet, but after years of trying to locate this movie (Cast a Dark Shadow) on DVD, its wonderful to find it issued with two other movies. Cast a Dark Shadow is about a jerk who basically marries women for their money. He meets an old lady and then inherits her money, but with a catch. He ends up marrying another woman, who turns out to be his match. GREAT, FANTASTIC, DARK movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Appears Accurate but Detached","review":"While reading this I never felt Ume Tsuda leave the page and come to life. The book seems to have accurately researched the original letters from which most of this biography is sourced but then it is written with a detached perspective. Ume Tsuda should have written her own biography or had a close friend write it during her lifetime because this is so dry and antiseptic. Perhaps that is what you must get when the sources have all passed away and are not available for questioning."},{"rating":"2","title":"King James Version, Alexander Scourby","review":"This is an excellent reading that I have wanted to have for a long time.

I really like the King James Version, so I am happy about that. However, the overall quality of the product is poor. The recording levels are quite low meaning I really have to crank up the volume to hear Mr. Scourby. Also, I have two CDs (so far) with completely dead tracks. In other words, Genesis Chapter 21 and Samuel 30 are noise and nothing at all respectively.If you're looking for Bible on CD, move along. There are too many other decent products on the market to settle for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A. Scourby 6 disc set","review":"The A. Scourby six disc set had a rattle before case was opened. Two of the discs were floating loose and free, with related scuffs and scratches. A piece of foam would have kept them snug on the hub. The mystery is how each of the other discs were damaged. They weren't spinning on their hubs during shipping, so the ring scratches must have happened while being place in the case or prior. Ridiculous. The content is great. Discs play ok, and are going to lending library. Hope the next set will be in better shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Was a Requested Gift","review":"My daughter wanted this for Christmas.

There have been some amazing readings produced and recorded of the bible by James Earl Jones, Johnny Cash, Lawrence Olivier, Gregory Peck, Stephen Johnston, etc. but this is the best in my opinion. Scourby reads so well in fact, that the King James English comes across as quickly understandable and dynamic- I mean it just flows! A good actor can make the complex scripts of Shakespere come alive to a kindergatner, so if you have difficulty with the King James, this Alexander Scourby version will refresh and amaze you.This easy and quality 6-Disk MP3 pack quickly loads up on your computer and then, Presto!- Every morning you can grab your cup of Joe and hear the best Bible reading done to date!Great product, Great deal through Amazon and Great customer service, Thank You."},{"rating":"2","title":"great study tool","review":"I use this to listen during my Bible reading.

I would be better to have Dora use a potty chair and then graduate to a potty seat for the toilet. My daughter does like the flushing sound button but it is too distracting and is all she wants to do rather than listen to the book.

Yes, the book is cute, it makes sounds (oooh!) and of course my daughter loves it. Please note that there isn't actually a picture of Dora on the potty, just a \\"before\\" and \\"after\\", which is not very educational. Just don't be fooled into thinking that this book is actually going to aide you in the draining process of potty training.

One of those overlooked despite being possessed of pure GENIUS is Yabby U. Yabby's message, riddims, and harmonies are divinely beautiful, and there is not a slow minute on this pack of originals, dubs, overdubs, toasts, and versions. Yabby U says he started singing because of divine inspiration; given what he's created, I don't know who can argue that he wasn't. --On a side note, in addition to the amazing tracks that will be in store for you on this, the liner notes are among the best I've ever read...just a thought.

First off, the balls delivered do not match the balls pictured in the advertisement. Traditionally each ball's number would be printed in black -- as in the product pictured. But with the product received, in order to (presumably) pinch pennies on dye, the manufacturer printed each ball's number in the same color as the ball. This means each ball only needs to be printed with one color instead of two, but it also makes it hard to read the numbers on the lighter colored balls, and it makes them all look really cheap. What you see is not what you get. Recommend you try another manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap - Chipped Quickly","review":"Pretty cheap built set. Even excluding the fact that the colors are different than in the photo (numbers have same color as ball), these balls chipped pretty quick. After I got them I used them for an hour or two daily for maybe a week or two and the outer paint started chipping off the ball, which wouldn't be a big problem (I really don't care how they look) except that it causes them to not be perfectly round and every now and then it affects game play.

So too is Dana Andrews as the chief petty officer who will become the linch pin around the eventual acceptance of the new leader by the team. In between, however, there is a lot of friction between them,As an avid SCUBA diver, I found it interesting how primative and minimal the UDT teams equipment was.

I'm totally disappointed, not only because of the small size, but also how it sounds and the price I paid. I looked at the drum, it says \\"made in U.S.A.\\" and I was thinking to myself, this company is a shame to America ,and this is the reason why China made products are good, because they are priced less and worth every penny we pay.My baby can't even hold this thing, it is that tiny.

The drum did not look like a toy so I called the company Remo to ask about product safety.The customer service representative was very nice but gave me bad news. She said that she would never let her children put this drum near their mouths. In the manufacturing process many chemicals are used.

It is not a serious film by any means but it has a lot of humor and a lot of heart. The timing and delivery of some of Kevin Van Hentenryck's lines are brilliant. It is a very stream of consciousness film in which several scenes seem improvised almost. This is not a film for someone who only likes thrillers or really frightening horror films, this if for a horror movie fan who also likes goofy spoofy horror films like Evil Dead 2 and Return of the Living Dead. This is a very typical Frank Hennenlotter film. If you liked Frankenhooker you'll love this. Do not prejudice against this film because a few people didn't like it. It is a very specific type of film for a very specific audience, and just because some people do not see the brilliance of it does not mean the brilliance isn't there. Judge for yourself.

Not only was it extremely heavy and hurt my back from carrying it every day, but it was DULL. He somehow managed to make history tedious. When we had to take notes on a section, one would literally have to copy every sentence.

No warning -- just dead when I plugged it in. I used this roaster about twice a month on average, so I don't think I overused this product. Nesco customer service was nice, but it will cost me shipping both ways (about $30) plus parts and labor to repair. I bought it mainly because of its stainless steel insert (supposedly easy to clean and trying to avoid the lead that is found in ceramic crock pots). The stainless steel was NOT easy to clean and you are warned in the manual to not use abrasive products to clean it as it will scratch. That is a great dilemma. It did cook well and I especially liked it for cooking large batches of refried beans, but reflecting on the price, the difficulty in cleaning and the fact that it died 6 months after the warranty compels me to leave 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roaster quit after 3rd use!!","review":"Roaster quit after 3rd use!

You will read a lot of reviews commenting on the smoking of the roaster and yes, this roaster does require you to do a smoke out...Don't let that discourage you...Just get an extra long extension cord and the minute it arrives, take it outside plug it in and turn it on as the directions tell you and let it do it's thing. I did it just like that. I let it cool completely once it was done and then the next time I used it was for the Thanksgiving Bird and I did not experience any bad smells.

I seasoned it just as I would if I was putting it in the oven. The estimated cooking time (according to the book) was 5.5 hours. It cooked much faster...approximately 4.5 (I used a digital thermometer). I only opened it once toward the end to add a bourbon glaze (which helped with the browning). No basting required!!!!

Yes it smokes and it's very pungent (do it outside or in your garage) but it's only one day in the probable very long life of this roaster. The high quality is hard to miss when you examine it.

How long is she going to talk about the size of her new husband's testicles?She always insults the audience to laughs, but this time her insults were predictable and ho-hum... and many aspects of her approach to this show made it an overall lackluster performance. In fact, it wasn't until 50 minutes into the show, during which she actually did her own little roast that I actually found it hilarious. Ironically, she was reading from a script.I hope she gets it together, or just realizes what her limitations are as a comedienne.

Her husband seems to have a lot more crowd appeal than she does but the same could be said of her dog, Mr Parker. I'm not sure a lot was gained by repeating lines which were in the act in the bonus features or by faking a roast for those who should be roasted but aren't.

Not only does it not give any truly helpful information, but I found it almost pornographic. It is not a book that I would want to share with my 2 year old child and probably wouldn't want to until my child is a teenager.

The second half of the book, \\"My Fall\\", ascends in pages up to page 148 where, on the following page drops back to page 117 and then reprints everything between 117 and 148, then picks up at page 181 skipping everything between page 148 and page 181 altogether.

The film gracefully moves along its comedic gestures towards a critique of aristocratic life. But like the best of Renoir-Ophuls refuses to reduce his work to a dry analysis of classes. Madame escalates into a divinely written tragedy with moments of transcendentally inspired dialogue. This is an indispensable gem of the cinema, though it will undoubtedly remain overly saturated with sentiment for today's audiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUSICAL SCORE INFORMATION","review":"Although I can add little to the agreeable reviews of this magnificent film, perhaps I can save some Amazon patrons the time I spent in finding a soundtrack CD containing three or four of the film's beautifully haunting waltz compositions.Just search Amazon for the Georges Van Parys (et la cinema) soundtrack.

On this outing Ex Models trademark post-punk sound sprawls, ravages, and romps unchecked by convential song structure. The atonal guitar interplay, is accented by yelped vocals from Shahin Motia and Zachary Lerhoff. The excellent Kid Millions anchors the harsh guitar dueling with a dexterous percussive foundation. Rhythm is key in each soundscape, as the scorching and unearthly guitar lines lock and battle.This album is abrasive, loud, and feral. It is relentless and excessive. If that sounds appealing to you purchase Chrome Panthers immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comfortable Imported shoe","review":"Nice feel, comfortable walkers, oxfords.

You pay more than other gate but it is all worthy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"strong baby gate","review":"I do not know if my husband set up this gate correctly. The lock mechanism is a little difficult at times. But I love how wide the gate opens (I got the extension and it opens with the gate). I do feel secure that my little one cannot pry this gate open or figure out the lock mechanism. I've seen locks that seems just as childproof and much easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"Relatively easy to install. Very sturdy. Once you get used to opening it with one hand, it is a piece of cake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive rusting gate","review":"My husband installed this gate on our deck 3 weeks ago, and it took well over an hour. We had to buy the extension piece, but the stair's opening is too wide, and we cannot use the latch to close it which defeats the purpose of the gate. Lastly, parts of the hinge are already rusting. I would NOT recommend this gate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Engineering disaster","review":"The gate has the rounded corner at the bottom towards the floor and the flat edge at the top...this results in four exposed ends with plastic caps which may result in water eventually entering. The latch assembly is horrible and anyone not familiar with it won't know how to enter...maybe good for burglars! The stainless steel parts didn't arrive with the gate so I will have to disassemble it later. My solution was to turn the gate upside down and have the rounded end on top, which I think looks much better anyway. The materials are good, but with the expandability feature of the gate there is a lot of potential standing water on the gate and a weakening of the structure. All in all I would rather have a single size gate with a latch that is well designed. I would not suggest purchasing this gate for any medium or large dog that wants to jump on the gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful gate!!","review":"This is an excellent gate. I think the previous reviewer must have installed it incorrectly because my gate opens very easily ... easily for an adult, anyway. You can open it with one hand while you have your child in the other. It is a high quality product. You can tell it is very sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice gate...Poor quality","review":"We got this gate for our deck to keep our dogs and children contained during outside time. We paid extra to have the gate ASAP, we get it and \\"install\\" it, the first time we go to close it the eye hook snaps. We're are very unhappy, that is a lot of money to pay to have sometihng break before you even get to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gate","review":"This gate is easy to install, works perfectly for outdoors, but the only drawback is that the latch mechanism isn't the smoothest operating piece and that it takes some time to get used to opening and closing. Overall, a great gate so far, but we shall see if the construction of the gate makes it last over a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for those new to poetry","review":"As one who is trying to learn about poetry, I found this book way beyond me. For those who are well-versed, looking at the sound of poetry may be a wonderful new way to approach the matter. The book begins, for example, with a long discussion on how words are accented. The word accented has a stressed first syllable, while example has a stressed second syllable. While I'm sure this has a profound effect at some deep lever, for those who simply want to know how to understand poetry at the most basic level, this doesn't help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pinksy is dry, dull, and overrated","review":"Much praise has been heaped upon this little book, and I would like to say that, in my experience, it doesn't hold up. Pinsky's prose, much as his poetry, is dry and preachy; you can tell there's something there behind it, some honest impulse, but the man is unwilling to let it loose. Many treat \\"The Sounds of Poetry\\" as if it were the first of its kind, which is rediculous, or the first to cut to the chase and do away with technicalities in favor of the true nitty-gritty, which is even more rediculous. Pinksy his a hyperdull prosodist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Beneficial","review":"I purchased this book because of my interest in metric poetry but to my disappointment I learned almost nothing from the book.

I first read this book when taking an undergrad poetry-writing course, and I found it immensely helpful.Pinsky takes a great deal of potentially clunky, academic information and distills it into a fast, easily-digestible handbook. In just over 100 pages, he outlines the essentials of rhythm, meter, the meaning carried by sounds, and the interrelation of all three. For anyone who has read, studied, or written poetry before, there won't be much new here, but having so much good advice in such a concentrated form makes this little book an excellent read. Even several years after taking that course, I still find myself browsing this book, looking for helpful reminders and inspiration.Pinsky's book is not only helpful and informative, it's a fast, fun read--it both delights and informs. Horace would be proud.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This movie was terrible... Nothing like the first one.

Unlike other shelves which only work for shoes of a certain length or size or require you to precariously balance you shoes on them, this allows you to toss shoes in, or use shoeboxes, or use as a shelf for other things besides shoes.

Other reviewers, who are apparently just argumentative, or who are related to the seller, suggest \\"reading the details or reviews would have shown me what the product actually was\\", but thats not acceptable to me even *if* the accurate details really were printed in that section. The image shown is that of a TWO TIERED SHOE RACK. Either modify this picture to show whats actually being sold, or perhaps enough crappy reviews and equally crappy sales will remind the seller of what integrity is all about.

After just one trip, the bag would not stay sealed. It turned out that the wrinkles introduced when the air was removed from the bag caused holes in the bag.

I bought about 30 space bags to \\"plasticize\\" everything I had in storage. Only 3 of the bags held the seal and remained airtight. Fortunately, I have the space to use the bags anyway, but I sure wish they would stay compacted. Another product that is a good idea but is cheaply executed.

The concept is great, but the design of the bags are terrible! The \\"zipper\\" does not zip and it rips the plastic as it goes over it. I was able to close the zipper with my fingers, but it was quite a project. Attach the vacuum and it does shrink the bag and contents to a very thin, easily storable size, but as soon as you put the stopper on the bag starts to leak and fill back up again. This is okay if you vacuum, put the stopper in and IMMEDIATELY put the bag where you plan on storing it. If you want to store several bags on top of one another you need to work FAST to get them all in there before the inflate again.

Let's not kid ourselves, pop's standing as a legitimate musical genre has been cemented by Scott Walker, Ray Davies, Damon Albarn, John Lennon, Danger Mouse, Syd Barrett and others. However, every once in a while, a band challenges this long standing high pedigree. The recent flood of poor poppists has done its very best to eliminate pop's legitimacy. When I first noticed this album, I was excited, it seemed to have glowing reviews that went on and on about it's '60's sounds and classic vocalist, an excellent recipe for a pop album. After I listen to a few tracks, it became rapidly clear that this was not going to be a good pop band, but rather a tired, derivative, and, at its worst, shrilly unlistenable album. The '60's sounds that were noted were nothing more than the occasional mod sound or flourish. The vocalist, while not bad, isn't actually that wonderful and certainly is not original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrifically bad","review":"I listened to this at the prodding of a friend.

The characters are very vivid, and easy to picture. What really made me enjoy this was that it was based on the actual lives of the three main characters.

I recently installed a very noisy air conditioner in my apartment and as a result I could not hear my TV without blasting the sound. Not wanting to be \\"that neighbor,\\" I invested in this cord so I could watch TV with headphones. I'll echo what others have said: the cord transmits sound very well even through my rinky little iPod headphones, though the coil is pretty tight and reaching to 20 feet is a stretch (pun slightly intended). I'm fine with that because the jacks on the cord are very secure (no slipping) and I only need about 10 feet of extension, but if you're looking to use this for longer distances, then I'd suggest buying two cords. Still, ten bucks is a good value for this handy little product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cord Socket has problems","review":"When I first plug my 1/8\\" headphone male connector into this cord's female socket, there is terrible distortion.

I drink coffee practically all day, and I always have coffee left in the tank at the end of the day. It also brews quickly. The Cuisinart was painfully slow.After over a year of trouble-free operation, the caraffe started to leak, not at the valve, but around the metal disc at the bottom of the tank. I googled Hamiltion Beach, sent them a nice e-mail, and even though it was outside the warranty period, they shipped me a new caraffe for free, plus $6.95 S&H.;The leak is a common problem, but I'm satisfied with the customer support I received. You can't fill up a travel mug unless you scoot it to the edge of the counter, but I've read they've redesigned it. Otherwise, I love this coffe maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad coffee, excess repair costs","review":"would not recommend this coffee maker.

Made good coffee. Kept it hot. Mine never had a problem with leaking. About a month ago I noticed that there was mold growing in between the two layers of the carafe. Now it doesn't touch the water or coffee at any point. But still. It's really gross. And there's no way to get it out apart from unscrewing the two parts of the carafe to clean it. And it doesn't seem worth it to do that everytime I use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best little coffeemaker in town","review":"For the price, this may be the best coffeemaker in the world. It consistently brews a fine cup of coffee and, due to its unique design, the last cup is always as good as the first, since the coffee doesn't continue to cook after it's made. The unit is good looking, if a bit large, and it's the easiest to clean of any I've had. It has only 2 shortcomings: water condensate drips out the back when the lid is raised after the coffee has been made (easy to fix with a strategically placed paper towel); and the heating unit doesn't heat the coffee quite hot enough for me, so I have to nuke my cup for 30 seconds before it's as hot as I like it. Otherwise, it's a fabulous coffee maker--the only one that's better is the model with a timer. Buy it, you'll love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesnt Work, The coffe tastes horrible!!!","review":"the coffe maker had a nice idea about potless, but the coffe tastes horrible we tried five times to get it right but it was either too strong or too weak, My advice is dont waste your money.

I am about to throw it away after only six months and bring the old Bunn cofeemaker that I have had for 15 years out of storage and had kept \\"just in case\\". The concept of the auto shut off is great but if I don't drain any left over cofee out of the machine it all winds up on my counter --so I might as well just turn it off anyway.

However, we have been using this machine for a few months and the coffee is really taking on a 'plastic' flavor. Aside from cleaning the container, I don't know what else to do. We changed coffee brands a few times thinking that was the problem, but no, it is definately the plastic lining that is causing the problem. We are in the process of looking for another coffee maker.

In the past I have usually ended up breaking the glass carafe that comes along with traditional coffee makers. At first, I was very pleased with the unit and thought I made a great purchase. Eventually it started to drip and leak at random. The handle in the water/coffee holder broke. The top of the unit that lifts up broke off completely and now just sort of sits there precariously. Finally, this week it decided that it was not going to work at all. It will not make coffee. It will turn on, but not brew. I have only had this for a year and a half or so.

So, he shuts the machine off for a few minutes then turns it back on and the darn thing finishes pumping the rest of the water out and into the tank.I'll reluctantly send my brewstation back to Hamilton Beach for repair or replacement.

The dispensing spout on the coffee reservoir has a slight drip ... about five drops in a two hour period. I use a small plastic dixie cup to catch the drip. A significant amount of condensation accumulates on the lid of the unit. When you open the lid, some of that condensation runs down the back of the unit on to the counter top. Have a towel ready. The clock has an LCD display with black numerals that are difficult to read in anything other than direct light. Back lighting the display would have eliminated this nuisance. None of the foregoing are show stoppers, but if I had a do-over, I would not have purchased this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"One year life span","review":"This worked great the first year, with only a few hiccups. If a coffee ground got trapped in the hole, then it leaked. Messy, but easy to fix by flushing with water. Then it began leaking all the time.

But, I wouldn't buy another one until some improvements are made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointed purchaser","review":"Don't waste your money on this! The first one I purchased came cracked - it was made with cheap plastic parts. I had the second one for over a year. It leaked many times. Although it was fun to dispense the coffee into a mug, that is one area where it started to leak. You would pull your mug away and coffee would continue to drip. But that was only the beginning of the problems. It is now such a complete mess - leaking from all the various seams - that we had to throw it away. Even when it wasn't leaking it did not prevent the burnt coffee taste. There is still a warming pad which burns the coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big and Leaky","review":"This is a neat idea ruined by shoddy manufacturing. First of all, this coffemaker is a lot bigger than most regular ones, especially the height. I can't fill this one without pulling it all the way out to the front of the counter. This takes up a lot of room for small kitchens or crowded countertops. The whole thing is also made out of plastic with a very cheap look and feel as soon as you take it out of the box. In just about 3 months of daily use, I've already had water or coffee leak out of the dispenser four times. Between the constant waste of space and having to watch out for leaks, I'd rather go back to pouring my own cups. The only reason I haven't thrown it out is because my wife bought it and I don't want to hurt her feelings."},{"rating":"1","title":"To big even for the biggest kitchen","review":"The Brew Station makes decent coffee at best. You still waste too much coffee when there are only 2 of you in the house that drink it. In addition, the brewer is huge. Even for my large size kitchen it is way to tall and bulky. I did experience a burnt taste with my maker but was lucky not to get a brewer that malfunctioned (of course I only used mine for about a month and returned it so I may have experienced the electrical issues if I'd have kept it longer).

Picked up a 3rd one that worked wonderfully for about 2 months then had all the electrical problems that others talk about. Turned it in for something on the shelf next to it, the Mellitta (spelling) One:One and that thing rocks!!! Similar concept but no mess at all!! One cup at a time in under 45 seconds!!! AND the big seller ... IT WORKS!!!!! If you're thinking about the brew station, look to the One:One, you're limited to the Mellita coffee but it's good coffee. and much easier!!

The first was great for about 6 months and then the seal came out and it leaked all over the place whenever water was put in it. Because it was such a great coffee maker in every other aspect I thought maybe it was just a bad one- got another and within 6 months the same thing happened. So it makes a great temporary coffee maker but if you don't want to spend money every 6 months for a new one- it just doesn't make sense. I should note that we are big coffee drinkers and were making 2-3 pots per day. As another reviewer noted the plastic gets really black and it is too hard to clean- you just can't see how much is left in the pot.

Barry Bostwick is now Captain Ahab Captain of the finest of America's submarine fleet, the \\"Peaquad\\" Bostwick \\"Ahabs\\" around with enough ham for Easter dinner with enough left over for sandwiches. It's pretty silly having the murderous whale being chased by a submarine instead of a rickety, beaten down boat. To compensate they make the whale ten times bigger but the CGI effects are so soggy that Moby looks like a giant, white turd with teeth. As expected Moby eats the rest of Ahab that he had missed before. Apparently Moby Dick is partial to ham.But my question is where was Ishmael? Unless Ishmael was supposed to be the bikini clad scientist who is \\"requested\\" to join Ahab and his merry band of whale chasers.A total waste of time but what can you expect from The Asylum whose movies always smell a little fishy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as bad as you would think","review":"This modern retelling of the classic Moby Dick is a bit cheesy. The problems have more to do with all the information we now have about whales. The writer had to create a super monster that would never act like a whale. So they made it a combo between a shark and a whale and used recent stories about a humpback whale breaching that took down a small boat. The acting is fairly good a nice combo between the book and Crimson Tide. The problem becomes when they get to an island the story quickly becomes a unreal unstoppable monster against humans movie. It can breach onto land and crawl around can take gun fire and a rocket powered harpoon. Finally they nuke the island, which being so close to Hawaii would cause people to glow in dark and the scientist survives we presume to get cancer later. The whale survives to kill again. This would have been a much better story if they had done it on another planet, it just doesn't work as a modern retelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste time and money","review":"Do not even think of buying this movie or any other from \\"the Asylum\\".If you have nothing better to do with your money at least rent it or buy it used (if it costs less than $5)."},{"rating":"1","title":"lol!!! stupid MOVIE!!!!!!","review":"lol this movie is like a parody!! jajajajajajajaja!! horrible CGI! lol!! scary movie has better CGI than this piece of garbage! of SCI-FI! ! prefer donating the budget of this movie to a children's hospital!!! this movie makes me................. lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't worth time","review":"Just like the other Asylum created nonsense, this one is not worth time watching - very cheap effects, horrible play.

Very disappointed. I entered the GPS coordinates for my house and it turns out I live smack in the middle of the busy 4-lane main road which is 2 blocks from my house. I looked for Hocking Hills State Park (Ohio), which is where I do a lot of hiking and what do you know...It's now a state park. It's also, according to the contour lines, pretty flat. Funny, last time I was there I seem to remember a lot of hills and ravines. I realize there will be some degree of inaccuracy in any digital map that covers the entire U.S., and I realize this is no substitute for a paper map but the level of errors I found so far does no give me much confidence in this product.

Try zooming in or panning the map, or transfering to your GPS and 90% of the time it will crash or tell you an error occured.

The told me I need to use TOPO USA... I loaded the program, but it needed the CD, I found out in here how can I install so never ask for the CD. This is nasty! The trail detail is that it will give you a point! I hope at least the trail is crossing it!

Its a waste of money!!!!Attila Csakberenyi"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my GPS","review":"I bought this software mainly for use onscreen on my new 60CSX GPS, and so far it's been great for that. I've also sampled some of the trip planning features on my laptop, and that's worked out well, too. My only compliant is that the back roads aren't labeled on my GPS screen, so it makes it hard when I'm driving and want to know quickly what road I'm looking at, but the routes are pretty accurate, so I can usually identify by that. Also, some of the data is out of date for those remote roads. I've found a couple so far that are listed as roads, but have been converted to hiking trails, or reverted to elk trails, many years ago. Coupled with a more detailed (and sometimes more recent, though not always) Forest Service map, it's just fine. Well worth it for adding detail to your onscreen GPS maps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such fun to get your old waypoints displayed on a map","review":"I had collected nearly 500 waypoints with my old Garmin GPS II Plus, which of course has no mapping capability. Enter MapSource along with my new GPSmap76CS for Xmas. What great fun it was to review, edit and classify those old waypoints in MapSource, recalling the history and local lore of each one as my memory was refreshed by seeing each properly mapped. Of course I could export any or all of the old waypoints into the GPSmap76CS, and that's useful.Then, constructing routes and seeing the corresponding elevation profiles for trip planning was really special. And to top it all off, view your waypoints and routes in Google Earth for a really mind blowing experience.I do wish there was an easier way to print elevation profiles along with the various named waypoints, but I couldn't find that.In sum, this is a fun product, and very useful too."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to have a specific need for this","review":"Only get this mapset if you have a specific need for terrain information. I was a little disappointed about how painfully out of date the trail information is and this only leads me to believe that some of the terrain information is probably outdated too. Certainly, mountains don't change often, but some trail land does. I got it for terrain information of Hawaii and it was adequate. In this instance, there wasn't the option of using the National Park mapset. I can't say personally, but I would hope the National Park mapset is more up to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin MapSource Great for Idaho Outdoors","review":"I went to the Ponderosa and Sawtooth Mountains with my new Mapsource.

Where quadrangles have been spliced together, the roads, railroads, rivers, and contour lines do not meet across the join. Line signatures change at quadrangle borders. Also, the data are not up to date. In Hamden, the Canal Rail-trail is shown as an active railroad. Finally, there are very few identified streets.

Bummer. I'll stick with printed USGS maps."},{"rating":"1","title":"really low detail topo maps","review":"For hiking purposes these low detail topo maps are just barely OK. There's so little detail it isn't easy to create waypoints on your GPS if your hiking trail isn't already represented on this CD, and believe me, the trail data on this CD is not remotely up-to-date or detailed. I honestly can't reccommend this product unless you need just very general representations of topography. Garmin offers higher-res topo maps but only for very selected areas in certain USA parks. One should always rely first on a godd printed hiking trail map, but sheesh, I was expecting more from these garmin maps."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Agree Too - Not Enough Detail","review":"We bought this software for the purpose of locating hiking trails and downloading the info. into our eTrex Vista (the Vista, by the way is a great little unit, this TOPO software is NOT).

I have heard many people praise ms Mahy's talent, but this was my first touch with her - I must say I wasn't disappointed. This book contains some clever dialogue, it has a great attitude and it is well-written too. Of course, the story is quite escapistic, but I don't personally mind reading about beautiful girls falling in love with desperate losers. According to my own experience, such things don't happen very often in the real world, but as light entertainment this book functions very well. And if we keep in mind that it's meant for people aged about 14-16, I think I'll let the author get a bit educational. After all, this is an intelligent book. It speaks of human relationships with good taste and doesn't stay too middle-of-the road. The characters are all a little strange, which makes it all more interesting.

A \\"meme\\" is a thought implanted by others to advance their agenda. Think of it as a sound bite. Memes that are easily implanted, he calls \\"good\\" memes. Because the word good has its origins in the word God, I got on my high horse right there on page 15! The example he used was the denigrative propaganda of Jews by the Nazis prior to WWII. I found nothing \\"good\\" in that!

It seems he does not have a clue about neuroscience and information theory either. Even Darwin in 19th century without knowing anything about DNA and bio-chemistry had more logic in formulation of his theory.

The interesting part is those who don't know about these different levels, can be trapped in a lower level without being cognizant of it. At the pinnacle or level three, a person sees through issues and establishes a purpose for their life.An interesting idea about meme's is that people will hold steadfast onto their beliefs, and will fight and some have even killed to keep transferring their memes to others.

The author is probably targetting the consumer of pulp science and, from that viewpoint, he does an OK job. The worse side of this book is that there is little effort to provide hard evidence on its theories. (What's Richard Brodie's background on genetic evolution or biology!?)If you like science in general and want something really light to read during summer by the swimming pool, then this book is alright.

Going on about memes as some kind of battle between good and evil, with examples like \\"unwed mother\\" (bad meme) and \\"the traditional american family\\" (good meme), he just proves that the idea of memetics has not passed the filter of his own his cultural bias. Memetics is not a question of ethics or vague self-improvment mumbo-jumbo, but a serious attempt to understand consciousness.If you are truly interested about memetics, read Dawkins and Dennet critically, and make up your own mind.

That's why I picked up Boone's Lick; it sounded like a winner - a strong female character leads her family West. Shortly into the book, though, I knew I'd been duped. Although there are some pioneer elements to this story that I liked (I especially appreciate the family's struggle to keep their wagon together), this seemed like a long, pointless journey where the scenary hardly changes and you can't get close enough to anything to see any detail. With six chapters to go, I found myself thinking, \\"What's the point of this?\\" When I finally got to the climax, it was so hurried and emotionally flat I felt quite let down.

But \\"killing off\\" one his most potentially interesting characters -- Grandpa -- so early leaves you wondering why he was introduced in the first place. It gets worse with the treatment of the Indian and the priest.The hard cover edition is dreadfully short. Maybe it should have been classified as a short story. The book's large type and larger page margins do not make a novel.Come on McMurtry, you are capable of so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"McMurty writes a simple story.","review":"I have read just about everything by McMurtry and like the man. His nonfiction work 'Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen...' moved me. Larry suffered and did not feel like himself after open heart surgery. The writer who entertained was struggling just to be, let alone worrying about writing. Now he writes a simple story. 'Boone's Lick'. Maybe not an epic, but hopefully Larry is feeling more like himself. It is nice to see Larry writing and maybe he has another epic up his sleeve, and then again maybe he doesn't. It was nice getting to know Larry McMurtry and the man will always hold a special place in my heart. Anything he writes deserves to be read, just because he wrote it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't recommend it","review":"Boone's Lick held my interest long enough to finish reading it but if it was twice as thick I probably would have given up.

I cannot quite imagine the same person writing both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boone's Lick","review":"Having read and very much enjoyed Lonesome Dove, I was disappointed by Boone's Lick. It's the story of Shay, who travels with his mother, uncle, and assorted other relatives and followers from Missouri to the West as part of his mother's attempt to locate her long-gone husband.The book has some of McMurtry's strengths: the humor, the clear, spare writing style, the appealing working-class characters (including the mules). But the plot is shallow, the characters are never really developed, and the end sudden. Overall, the book feels as if the author were just going through the motions; as if he were bored with the work. Mary Margaret and Seth, particularly, might have been interesting people, but the reader never gets to know them. I'd skip this in favor of McMurtry's more carefully written work."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book must have been rushed by a deadline...","review":"I bought the unabridged cassette tape version of this book, to keep me company on a long business trip in my car. I had visions of another Ned and Zeke, another book on tape that I treasure, from McMurtry. For the most part, being from the same part of the country the book is set, I enjoyed it...as I got to the sixth and final cassette tape, however, I became worried...how can this story end now???? And it did...just like he had run out of paper in his word processor, or ink, or ideas, or his advance....he sews the story up and ends it just when things are getting exciting. The book ends up like a book that was salvaged from manuscript form when the author died suddenly. Larry, I love your writing, but I want my money back for this one.

Well....the POTENTIAL for a good story is there...the good story, however never gets fleshed out. It's like the difference between intricate tapestry and big clumsy stitches...Boone's Lick being the second. This book really belongs in a magazine as a short story...one that does not tax you with details, rather than as a full-priced book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boone's Lick","review":"A BIG disappointment. It's not much more than an expanded outline for a made-for-TV movie (287 large print & wide margin pages). I made myself finish it only because I had $24 invested in it and wanted to see if it was bad all the way through as it was in the beginning. It was! It has good potential for the development of memorable characters, but McMurtry didn't come through as he usually does. The story was boring and I really didn't care if the Cecil family made it to Wyoming or not. Bottom line: I felt this was presented to the American public as a commercial venture to entice the Christmas shoppers to spend some more of their money and to fill the pockets of the publishers and McMurtry. I'm sorry I fell for their tactics and I am VERY disappointed that McMurtry would present such a weak piece of work to his loving readers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on Larry, Your Better than This!","review":"This story and these characters could have been another \\"Lonesome Dove\\", but Larry McMurtry wanted us to \\"show him the money\\".

The quality of the writing is right up there with \\"Texasville\\" and you will die laughing on several occasions. On the bright side for Mr. McMurtry, it is perfect for a movie instead of a mini-series, so he'll reach a much larger, royalty paying, audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"If you have a little appreciation for the west after the civil war you will love this book particularly you will find it humorous and leave you wanting more. I will read anything McMurtry writes."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read","review":"No one writes a better Western Novel than Larry McMurtry. While this book does not match Lonesome Dove, it shows that he still has what it takes when it comes to a story about the old West. He can take simple situations and weave an interesting story with characters you can't help but fully visualize in your mind. My main complaint is that the story was too short. I think he could have gone deeper into the lives of many of the family members. Nonetheless, when you finish this book you'll have met a really unusual bunch of people. If you like McMurtry, I'm sure you'll enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential reading if you want to understand Taiwan.","review":"Although the book's organization resembles a textbook too much, the information is invaluable. Given that there is a mountain of books available on China it is extremely helpful to read something about the first Chinese democracy. While I enjoyed the book as a whole I was particularly interested in the story of Taiwan's evolution from dictatorship to democracy. This is especially cool because Taiwan is still strengthening its democracy. No other book examines Taiwan in such depth, which is not as great a compliment as it sounds since only a handful of books really examine modern Taiwan."},{"rating":"2","title":"helpful overview with some holes.","review":"Copper presents a solid overview of Taiwan, its history, culture, politics and trajectory. If you are looking for a substantial and factual look at the island, this is a good place to start. The writing has an unfortunate tendency to plod, as Copper seems to often be merely relating facts and not necessarily telling a story. That makes the sections on economics and geography particularly excrutiating. There is also the problem of bias, as Copper seems to nearly be a Kuomintang appologist. Democratization is attributed to Chiang Ching-kuo, Chiang Kai-shek's dastardliness is dramatically played down, and the \\"White Terror\\" is not mentioned in the book at all. Thus, in some ways, the historical account doesn't gel with what many in Taiwan would tell you actually happened over the last 20-30 years.

The Mafia is a subject that has been covered copiously in a variety of media. It is, however, within the lifestyle of the residents of the Gold Coast that DeMille does his thing introducing the mob world and its values through the back door. To this add a narrator undergoing a middle life crisis, nasty in-laws, hateful parents, a crazy-looking-for-revenge IRS agent and a tax lawyer in the city's biggest criminal prosecution and you have a great read . DeMille's protagonists sizzle with sardonic wit. His most recent work is good but not this good.

The next few chapters had me engaged but the rest was a total anticlimax. Most of the relationship between the Blue Blood WASP lawyer and the Mafia don was totally unbelievable in that no Godfather would ever share with an outsider what Frank don Bellarosa does in this book. The gratuitous sex scenes between the lawyer and his wife were kinky and totally unnecessary.

'The Gold Coast' had an interesting premise and characters, as well as a touch of humor. Unfortunately, the book suffered from too much detail about everything, whether or not it was significant to the plot.The gradual shift in tone as John and Susan's life begins to fall apart eventually leads the book into cliched 'mafia thriller' territory. By the end of the book, the reader is left almost exhausted, yet somehow disappointed, that a book that promised so much didn't quite deliver.Much like those tasty but not entirely healthy Italian delicacies that Frank tells John 'you gotta try', this one is best read in small doses until it's finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and winding novel -- a sleeper","review":"I was suprised to see how well this book has been rated by others. I could barely keep my eyes open throughout. I LOVE most of Demille's books especially Charm School and Plum Island. However, in The Gold Coast, Demille spends the first 150 pages going on and on about the lifestyle of the Gold Coast, while only occasionally stopping for a sex scence.......The book never seems to lead to anything worthwhile. I found it impossible to like the characters, and in fact I grew to dislike John and Susan. The plot seemed to have potential, but I kept waiting for it to get exciting. I kept telling myself to read another 50 pages and maybe it will get better, but it never did. I will certainly give Demille another chance, but I hope the next book I choose is nothing like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing plot and interesting historical perspectives.","review":"It not only is a well-writen novel of suspense and intrigue, but it also includes an interesting history a section of the East Coast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, engaging, and, as always, DeMille witty!","review":"This third book of Nelson DeMille's that I've read, \\"The Gold Coast\\" is different from the previous two, in that it doesn't build on a mystery with a suspenseful ending. Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable read and much longer in length than the others. The Gold Coast stretches along the North Shore of Long Island that once held the greatest concentration of wealth and power in America. Here two men are destined for an explosive collision: John Sutter, Wall Street lawyer, holding fast to a fading aristocratic legacy; and his new next door neighbor Frank Bellarosa, the Mafia don who, like a latter-day barbarian chief, draws Sutter and his regally beautiful wife, Susan, into his violent world."},{"rating":"1","title":"What should be an interesting story is BORING!!!","review":"The Gold Coast should have been a great story. Set in one of the most beautiful and interesting places on the East Coast. The characters are some of the most one dimensional, unlikeable, and uninteresting that I have encountered in a long time. John Sutter, embarassingly takes on the affectations of a Mafia boss, the characterizations of which fall flat and fail. His wife, Susan, is a spoiled rich, nymphomanic, disturbed girl. The Mafia boss, Frank, lends us no new insight into the psyche of a gangster - his wife is a one dimensional character whose main job is to cook, clean and blubber around.Watch reruns of The Soprano's for more interesting character studies. The Gold Coast is a beautiful place. This book does the region no justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"de Mille has to be one of the top novelists of our time. Gold Coast may be the best of the list. He can weave together a thriller, drama, comedy and timeliness like no one else publishing today. A long novel I wished would never end. I keep looking for more from him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demille Almost Delivers a \\"Gold\\" Medal Performance","review":"After reading all the positive reviews and the synopsis I was determined to read this book. It turned out to be a great book with a lot of twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat. However, I was a little disappointed with the ending.John Sutter and Susan Stanhope Sutter live a fairly simple and boring life now that their kids are no longer at home. Their mansion on the Gold Coast (well Susan's parents' mansion) is too vast and unkempt to live so Susan and John live in the guesthouse. John is a Wall Street lawyer and Susan spends most of her time riding her horses on their property, gardening or at some local association. John and Susan's marriage seems to be slowly falling apart, despite frequent sex fantasies. John and Susan both need a little excitement / change in their lives. Enter infamous mafia don Frank Bellarosa. As John and Susan slowly become involved with Frank Bellarosa's life, their lives take a spin for the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel like I've been here before","review":"I enjoyed reading it, so maybe two and a half or three stars.That being said, much of what I liked about this book was borrowed and adapted from Robert Penn Warren's classic \\"All the King's Men\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"childish","review":"I was disappointed with this story,as it was silly and childish. The ending left me cold, and the characters were one dimensional.I had enjoyed \\"The General's Daughter\\" immensely, but this book as well as \\"Plum Island\\" did not live up to expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nelson Demille is the greatest!","review":"Nelson Demille is the best! I have read them all! My favorite is The Charm School."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gold Coast","review":"I'm an avid reader of both fiction and historical works. The Gold Coast by Nelson Demille is a 700+ page novel that was a 400 page work at best. Never have I read such a conglomeration of inane prattle that offered so little to the story line (such as it was). The main character developed by Demille is an immature reverse snob that never achieves adulthood. One reads on in the hope that the \\"hero\\" arrives -- he does not. Unless you are adevotee of sarcasm for sarcasm\\"s sake; this tome is a waste of time. I expected far better from an author of his high caliber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring - I couldn't wait for it to end","review":"While I have considered Nelson DeMille one of my favorite authors for years, I was incredibly disappointed with this book. There's not much of a plot and, while the main character is laugh-out-loud funny and sarcastic, the story, told as a narrative, misses a lot. Why is the Don so appealing to John & Susan? Why did what happened at the end happen? I just couldn't see it. Also, there's way too much description of places and history - so much so that my eyes tended to glaze over. Half way through the book (over 300 pages, at the halfway point), we had just gotten through introductions of the masses of people and into the basic \\"plot\\" of the story. Maybe that was my problem - there was no plot. I'm used to DeMille's books going somewhere - but this was much different. I'm so disappointed I don't know if I want to crack into the 3 other DeMille books that I haven't read yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Struggled to complete","review":"Probably a case of not my Genre but I struggled to stay with this book and did not end up completing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was just okay.","review":"It did hold my interest for the most part but it gave me a headache. I t seemed to ramble a bit for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting story about a part of the U.S. I was not aware of.","review":"It was fun living in the world of the wealthy of Long Island. Good story that kept me interested to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Interesting Enough","review":"This departure from Nelson DeMille's usual subject was disappointing for me. I didn't think that any of the characters rang particularly true. If you spend time in neighborhoods such as the famous Gold Coast, you know that neighbors, especially next door neighbors, usually go out of their way NOT to get to know one another until they've met at some club. Certainly a nice couple like the Sutters, from an old family, would have nothing to do with a notorious mafia chief. Good grief! Another secret of these type of people is that they spend a lot more time secretly or not-so-secretly working, which John Sutter, lawyer, hardly seems to do. I didn't finish it because I found another Nelson DeMille in my local library to read instead. Suggest anyone else do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"The Gold Coast is a great book. You can't help but enjoy the main character - John Sutter. His sarcasm and cynicism are funny, legitimate and sad. From beginning to end, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's a good plot with well developed characters but the way the DeMille tells it from John Sutter's perspective is GREAT. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can hardly believe Demille actually wrote this book!!! What a sleeper...","review":"This book was very difficult to get through. The first 150 pages were a complete waste of time, which is why it took me 3 separate times to finally get through the book. Don't discount Demille's books because of one bad one. He's still one of my favorite authors. If you haven't read any of Demille's books, then stay clear of this one. It's his worst yet. If you're looking to try out his books, I would recommend the following books, which are also my all time favorites: Charm School, The Lion's Game, Word of Honor, and Night Fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Genius","review":"Honest to God, campers, if you don't like this book, what a miserable human being you must be. This is the kind of rich, nuanced work that many great authors can write just once in a lifetime -- how DeMille knocks them out every 18 months is beyond me. This is like Bonfire of the Vanities for grownups -- real wit instead of verbal jumping jacks, real insight instead of sociological blather. This book touches all the bases of what a great work of fiction should be: atmospheric, resonant, funny, tragic, poignant, lots of action-without-consequences, yet not so much of it that the reader suspends his willing disbelief. The protagonist, John Sutter, has a midlife crisis, but he has it with balls and panache instead of loads of whiny reflection. You can't go wrong with any of DeMille's books, but this one is simply great."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mold Coast","review":"This is my first and last DeMille book. After plodding through 630 pages where very little happens, I am left wondering how DeMille became such a blockbuster author. Are his other books better? I am stunned by the number of 5 star reviews here. The writer seems to think that a regional history lesson and overstuffed descriptions compensate for unbelievable characters and a thin story. Athough DeMille tells us it's a satire, I suspect that's just his way of trying to repackage a boring, unsuspenseful thriller.The pompous, self-congratulatory foreward by the author doesn't help either. If you're going to compare yourself to Tom Wolfe and F. Scott Fitzgerald, you'd better have the goods to back it up. Gatsby must be rolling over in his grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe you people liked this book, it was terrible","review":"I started this book because someone had sold me on the story line. I only finished it because I was hoping it would get better. I can't believe the publisher even published it. I wanted to send a letter to the author and tell him he was the worst writer I had ever read. This guy try's to engage you by bringing you into the old money society of the East Coast. He clearly loses sight half way through the book when he runs out of his old wealth \\"candy\\". This book meanders on and on. He brings in different possible avenues to take the story because he is clearly lost on where to go. None of these avenues ever get developed. I am only sorry I finished the book and that someone would publish such garbage. Nelson Demille should be ashamed of himself. Nelson get a new job, writing is clearly not for you. Sorry for the scathing revue, I have been carrying around a feeling of disgust from wasted time on this worthless book"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gold Coast","review":"A 400 page story (such as it was) stretched into 700 pages of inane prattle. The \\"hero\\" acted throughout like an immature reverse snob who never achieved adulthood. One expects far better from Demille. Unless you are into sarcasm for sarcasm's sake this tome is a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lead me to purchase another Demille book!!!!","review":"Well once again I have read another Demille book and purchased another. The reading is quick and the plots are good. They keep you guessing right until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORTH ITS WORTH IN GOLD","review":"DeMille is a master at keeping you riveted to a book while thewhole world continues functioning without you. While I've only readthree or four of his books, he has yet to disappoint me. I wasparticularly drawn to this book because of the locale -- the gold coast of Long Island where old money rules and the descendants of this old money, who have inherited these estates, can't even afford to live in them. You can just imagine what happens when the don of the largest Mafia family in New York moves in next door to one of Lattingtown's long time residents. This is my favorite DeMille so far. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite!","review":"This is the first book I've read twice and will very soon read again for a third time. Its a book that you will never ever forget, it will always be on your personal top ten list. So stop wasting your time and reading all of these reviews (it will only ruin it for you) and go order this book, then come back and vote on whether or not this review was helpful to you. Trust me on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Evil is Seductive","review":"\\"Remember John evil is seductive\\". Where have we heard this before? And never more so than to John Sutter as we watch his life disintegrate page by page. I really liked Word of Honor but Gold Coast is even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A passionate and suspenseful story","review":"The \\"Gold Coast\\" is that stretch along the northern shore of Long Island where once America's wealth and power had been concentrated. It's also where Wall Street lawyer John Sutter is holding onto a fading aristocratic legacy and Mafia don Frank Bellarosa is establishing himself. The two men collide in a passionate and suspenseful story of friendship, seduction, love, betrayal, and violence. Very highly recommended for community library audiobook collections, The Gold Coast is dramatically narrated by Scott Brick."},{"rating":"2","title":"extremely engrossing ...","review":"Having never read demille before I was pleasently surpised at the great depth of this novel. This novel is truely a modern classic ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent and culturally telling","review":"I had avoided reading this book for a long time. I am into thrillers, mystery novels and action--you see. But, oh my. I listened to DeMille's Plum Island and liked the witty dialog, but read this on my planner. I was ammazed at the storyline, the secenery, the cultures, the sexual tension, the violence and many other things. John and Frank were great characters and Susan was hauntingly delicious.Wonderful book. It drags a little in the beginning and the --forget about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it","review":"Save this book for a long weekend. Once you get into it, you won't be able to put it down. If you want a real page-turner with a perplexing storyline and wonderfully complex characters, pick this up. I read this book several months ago, but even now I sometimes think about it. The ending is so unexpected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Characters You Want To Know","review":"Demille creates characters you just want to know! He drags you through their conscious and sub-conscious until you know more than you may want to...he gets to the edge of kinky sometimes, but it's alright. It's within the relm of reality. He makes the reader a part of the story, in that you genuinely care about the characters and can't stop reading - for you must learn their fate! Another benefit of reading Demille is the attention to research and local history of the East. I learn something from all his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great resource for one-liners.","review":"Portions of this book were very enjoyable because of the imaginative writing style of Mr. Demille. But the characters were not imaginative and the story not credible. So, overall, the book fell flat for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised at condition of Gold Coast","review":"I recently purchased a copy of The Gold Coast and was happy to receive it quickly as stated on the delivery schedule. But when I received it I was a bit surprised that the entire book had old and yellowed pages.It reminded me of a book I could have gotten for 50 cents at a yard sale rather than one that I had paid $6.00 plus the shipping to receive.Also I guess I had made a mistake in ordering, because I had thought that since this was an older book, I was receiving a hard cover rather than an old paperback. I was disappointed but DeMille is lots of fun to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gold Coast","review":"Difficult to review since I have not received this book yet!!!My review would have to be ZERo satisfaction"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Period Piece","review":"This is a great book if you like character development and period pieces.

The knowledge DeMille has of the development and decline of the only real Gold Coast in our contry is remarkable and enlightening. This story brings together a period in our history of excess and grandeur with the mid-life realizations of an intelligent, accomplished man willilng to rise and fall on principle. I first read this book 10 years ago and returned to it recently. The Gold Coast taught me more during the second reading and proved its timeless value. Kudos to Mr. DeMille."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love DeMille hated this book","review":"I am only about 1/2 the way thru this book and it is really boring.

You cannot stop reading and getting surprised with the incredible ability DeMille has to catch you and make you laugh with his fine irony. A must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Read!.","review":"I purchased this Book \\"The Gold Coast\\" after I had read the sequel \\"The Gate House.\\" Liked the \\"Gate House\\" so much that I had to buy \\"The Gold Coast.\\"to see how all this got started.I was not let down..It is a great book. I like the way this author tells a story,Gets right down to it without annoying unimportant descriptions of things that loose a persons interest in the story.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, engrossing, intriguing. A great read!","review":"The Gold Coast beats both Plum Island and The General's Daughter, which is saying something. This is an earlier effort, and the overt wit of the later novels is present in more muted form as an occasional wry observation or subtle irony. (It's as if DeMille wrote better when he wasn't trying to deliver a punchline in every paragraph.) The plot chronicles the subornation of a respectable Wall Street lawyer into the Bellarosa crime family, but the story is not a tragedy, just plain fascinating reading. This one is to be recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and not one of Demille's best","review":"I usually give a book about 25 pages to get me hooked. This one didn't make it past page 20. I usually like Demille's work from Night Passage, to Wild Fire most of them are a good read. This one I found read like something out of Harlequin romances. The story was way to slow. Action almost nill. I see that some people liked it toward the middle. There are a lot of great authors which I can read so don't have the time to slug my way through a book that doesn't move."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I like to finish books that I start. I haven't quite finished this one yet, and I'm having a REALLY hard time getting through it. I keep waiting for something to happen. I'm about 3/4 of the way thru it and nothing yet. This is a really boring book and nothing like Plum Island. I wish I had read the 1 star reviews before I purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Par","review":"Normally I'm a big fan of deMille, owning all his other books. But for me this one was definitely not up to standard. The plot is as predictable as the characters. What happens when old money meets nouveau riche? Infidelity of course. Hi hi, kiss kiss, bang bang, bye bye. It's more into Barbara Cartland territory than that of a respected thriller writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, unconvincing, and meaningless.","review":"After about 50 pages, I started to wonder if John Sutter was going to quit making sarcastic asides. As someone once said, cynics are a dime a dozen. I didn't find Frank Bellarosa to be a seductive man, so I don't understand why John and Susan found him seductive. Ultimately, what is the book about? Is there any redemption or even any growth in the characters? The plight of Jay Gatsby is universal; how do we handle loss? This book shouldn't be compared to the Great Gatsby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise but became slow reading","review":"The idea of this book is a fantastic one-- Mafia don moves next door to snobby \\"uppah crust\\" couple whose lives are the last of a dying breed. They all should have been living in 1930 in an 80 room mansion, and the accumulation of details on this dying lifestyle at first was fascinating but then began to bog down. The couple's unusual sex life (anywhere and everywhere, on a horse or on a statue) became tiresome and the man's repeated rude wise-cracking to the Mafioso became more and more annoying, plus the beautiful, rich wife became boring to me. I wish this book had been cut back about 30% to get to the story, and I wish the characters had more going for them. They seemed so vacant I couldn't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinky","review":"I loved it, all of it. The kinky fantasy fullfillment of man & wife on a galloping horse in the wealthy region of Long Island made me smile, in more ways than one. A modern F. Scott, Demille gives a great look into lives of the old money families, including the maffia, with much wit and intrigue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gold Coast: Perfect on my Maui Vacation","review":"Nelson DeMille's Long Island swan song to lifestyles of the rich and decadent is an excellent beach read. A Gatsby companion, hardly. Successful at capturing a few moments in time of the late eighties and providing a sense of place, DeMille's \\"Gold Coast\\" is a nice diversion and entertaining. It is not great literature; some characters come to life through his exposition, some simply ride on their horses, and some just walk alone, to borrow from Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter. It filled hours in the sun on Maui for me; however, there is a lighter tanned spot on my chest where the book lay when I napped between reads!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Four hundred pages could have been edited out","review":"I am a true DeMille fan, but Gold Coast was a real disappointment. Character Susan Sutter added little to the book, in fact, was very annoying.I found the story slow and meandering. I would catch myself thinking how the book could be rewritten to tighten the story to keep it interesting. It was a little story that took forever to get to the end.At least Frank (Mafia guy) was interesting.But, I didn't care for the Great Gadbsy, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gold Coast - Big Disappointment","review":"I seem to be in the minority, but I hated this book. I couldn't care less about the boring characters, their problems, their lives, their horses or what happened to them. The middle of the book was especially boring and laborious, so by the time I reached the end I had completely lost interest. The story was too long, too boring and fell far short of the \\"Great Gatsby\\" it tried to immitate (or salute). In fact, I recommend you read F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece instead and save yourself the aggravation.I was totally disappointed with The Gold Coast - especially because I totally enjoyed Plum Island and The Lion's Game, so perhaps I read the wrong DeMille book. I also don't like mafia stories, the Godfather or the Sopranos, so it could be me."},{"rating":"1","title":"So slow to develop that I gave up","review":"Don't get this one. ALL of Demilles's other books are much more entertaining. This is not a page turner. It's torture to get to the next chapter where you are just hoping something actually happens... but half way through the book nothing ever did. Snore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep Your Friends Close, But Your Enemies Closer. Capisce?","review":"This is another great piece of writng by DeMille. At first I found myself a little disappointed because the story line seemed to drag with the rich history of the Gold Coast described in detail.But the story got much better and DeMille's words flowed easily through my mind and created a wonderful story. This story was based in the rich Gold Coast of Long Island, but the heart of the story was not about The Gold Coast. It was about a Mafia Don, Frank Bellarosa who bought a huge mansion next to John Sutter, a Wall Street Tax lawyer. The heart of the story was not the Mafia Don, but it was about John Sutter as told by him and how all of this came to intertwine. John Sutter was bored with his life, just as any of us could be and he got involved with his new exciting neighbor and it changed his life forever.I really got into this story and it was a very good read. It also had insights into the Italian culture in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Novel","review":"Amazing book keeps you awake at night.

The characters are fun, naughty and evil. A very good story that pulls one along to the finish. Ah, but the story is not finished, as DeMille continues the tale with The Gate House, the finish to the mini-saga and even more exciting than The Gold Coast."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gold Coast","review":"Another excellent novel by Nelson Demille. This story brings you to the edge of your chair most of the time with gut wrenching drama, some spicy sex, and dramatic action.

A classic that I will read again some day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow paced book. It took more than a month to finish.","review":"Although the life through the eyes of a middle aged tax attorney was somewhat entertaining, the story plot in this book seemed a bit too slow. This story is used to portray the differences between cultures and people that are caught between the boundaries of these cultures; interesting points are brought out about Italians, the mafia and a high society neighborhood on the east coast. The two shall never meet in the middle. Nelson Demille should clearly stick to spy novels as this book clearly demonstrates that Italian Mob history is not his forte."},{"rating":"2","title":"De Mille at his best","review":"This is cleverly written through the eyes of a preppy noveau riche ( well, married to old money) lawyer in one of the most elite parts of New England/ New York state.

Only a couple of proofs are missing, so the whole book is mostly self-contained. There is almost no balance between understandability and academic rigor, and the book makes as good a read as a novel.

While he offers alot of good technical info the book is utterly lacking in medical and surgical treatment options, something he apparently doesn't believe in. The medical evidence points to better results and better health for mother and babies when medical/surgical intervention is used--lower reimbursement but much better for everyone involved except centers that promote IVF and tech based medicine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flattering for QR, but PAINFUL to listen to!","review":"It's flattering that QR is so well loved that tributes are warranted.

It's appealing at times when the day to day grind starts to get to you. There were times when I could really relate to Samantha (although I do know how to cook and clean for myself, despite being an attorney). In an engaging and entertaining way, Ms. Kinsella addressed the deeper subject of finding what is really truly important in your life and taking the direction that makes you most happy - even if it's unpopoular or if others don't understand. Who can't relate to that?And, honestly, who hasn't fantasized about a relationship with the sexy gardener at some point? :) :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Summer Light Read","review":"Charming book, will laugh often. The plot is a little unplausible but funny. I can see Renee Zellweiger playing in the movie.

Another book in a similar genre but not British is 'Match Me If You Can' by Susan Elizabeth Phillips. Another wonderful book to take to the beach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I bought this book off of the bargain table...I was wonderfully surprised...it is a great quick and easy read.

I intend to read them all now as I found her writing very funny, light hearted, and very entertaining. So much lighter in substance than the past few books I've read,\\"the undomestic goddess\\" is the story of Samantha Sweeting and her downfall after making a grave mistake at her job as a lawyer in a very prestigious law firm in London. She is mistaken as an interviewee for a housekeeping job after she make a mad dash away from being fired. After hiding out as 'the undomestic goddess' she figures out what she really wants in life....A fantastic fun read!!!

I bought it in hardcover solely on the strength of how much I enjoyed the \\"Shopaholic\\" books and was disappointed. This is not to say that the book is not entertaining; just not quite as much as Ms. Kinsella's earler works. Buy the paperback!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great read by Sophie Kinsella!","review":"I adored and loved this!! Each book that Sophie Kinsella graces her readers with, just seems to get better and better! This is a stand alone novel full of fun and a great choice for anyone looking to relax and escape a stressful day, at least for a while!It was so easy for me to become engrossed in this story and experience Samantha's struggles to come to terms with her past. To me, this story seemed to have a bit more depth than the Shopaholic series (which I loved, also)It was fun to go along for the ride, as Samantha learned how to deal with the everyday things such as cooking and cleaning, which she never had to deal with before. Also watching her \\"bloom\\" into someone who learns to enjoy and love the everyday simple things - such as the scent of flowers, just sitting and appreciating nature around and maybe even a colorful hot air balloon!I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fun and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fun read by Kinsella","review":"I read this book in a day and a half and enjoyed it. It is another fun, quick, light hearted read by Kinsella. Surprisingly, I took quite a few lessons from the main character, Samantha. Samantha leaves her work-aholic life behind for a job as a housekeeper. It opens her eyes to a work-life balance and defining herself as a person, not a career woman. It is a good read that many can relate too, which is uncommon in novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, romantic, sweet summer read","review":"This a sweet fun romantic comedy that reminds us what we really want from life. Hint, it's not always what we have always desired. Sophis Kinsella is a gift to the over worked over stimulated working women trying to find her way in the urban fight to be on top.

A treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"It made me laugh and it made me cry!","review":"I was magnetically drawn to this book yesterday at the bookstore - mostly because I too am an Undomestic Goddess.

Duh. If you must read this, go pick it up at a library. Don't waste your money buying a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Absolutely recommend this book. It is fun, funny and romantic. Totally recommended. Read it you will love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic author scores again.","review":"I absolutely adore Sophie Kinsella and began reading her books just a few months ago. This book is simply fun and enjoyable to read. She creates female characters who are smart and determined- no weak minded women here!I will continue to read this author over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"C","review":"Kinsella drops the ball on a novel that, in its last fifty pages, cannot sustain its own plot. With a promising premise and a quirky enough female protagonist, The Undomestic Goddess starts off as a vaguely amusing escapist adventure. Everything about the novel is average - the situations and humor are enough to keep a reader interested but unhappy at the conclusion. The sentiments are transparent and treacly, and the funny situations don't quite hit their mark. Kinsella's work is usually hilarious, but the book is soon lost to plot twists that become overwhelming, as they all occur in the final act. The awkward moments that are supposed to carry the novel are unnervingly contrived and absolutely unimaginable. A suspension of disbelief is unbelievably hard to procure. The romance is sweet and comfortingly moves along to its obvious finale. The entire text is a piece of cheap chocolate: soothing yet bland, fun while it lasts, but in the end, doesn't keep you satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly disappointed","review":"This is my least favorite of all of Sophie Kinsella's books. It is VERY predictable, and as other reviewers have noted, leaves a lot of loose ends, like what happened to the Geigers? The author made it sound like there was something going on with them earlier, but that just dissolves.Also, this is the first male love interest out of all of Kinsella's books that I couldn't stand! I was surprised. I couldn't even picture what he looked like in my head, and actually didn't want them to end up together.It was also lacking in humor. I'd recommend it if you're a big fan of Kinsella's, but if not, don't bother picking it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very much enjoyed","review":"I liked this book very much, but will not give it 5 stars because in my opinion it pales to Kinsellas wonderful Shopaholic books and the glorious Becky Bloomwood. I did think that this story was fun and cute and just what I was looking to read, once again Sophie Kinsella does not disappoint. I love her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Money Maker to Not","review":"This was my first read of Sophie Kinsella got to say that I loved this read. And made me laugh as well. I enjoyed reading about this woman who makes all this money then all of a sudden makes very less. Yet she finds solace in what she is now doing.She finally see's that what she was doing before was basically killing her, she was becoming someone she did not want to become. But becoming a housekeeper changed all that. She seen that there was more to life then this old job she had. And plus she finally found love for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"Like some reviewers, I also read Can You Keep a Secret and enjoyed it. So I picked this up and was terribly disappointed. The story is just ridiculous! I know it's fiction, but good writers have the talent to make the reader BELIEVE the fiction they write...this book wasn't believable in any aspect. This high-powered, genius-IQ lawyer has NEVER ironed a shirt, or cooked a meal? And then she throws away her years of school and her job to be a housekeeper? Come ON! Why she wouldn't just tell this family she works for that it was all a misunderstanding from the very beginning just doesn't hold water.Another thing that bugged me was that it was written like a romantic comedy screenplay! The scene where Nathanial gets off the train and they're on opposite sides of the tracks...it was so clearly written like one of those sterotypical chick flick movies. So predictable and lame. Ick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and simplistic.","review":"I took a chance on this book and was completely let down.I could have written this in a weekend, it was that predictable and silly. I knew the entire plot by the time I got to page 20. The relationships are murky and unresolved. The main character is vapid beyond belief and unbelievable in her stupidity. She can't operate a washing machine, boil an egg or iron a shirt, yet we're supposed to believe she can swing multi-million dollar deals.There was ZERO chemistry between Samantha and Nathaniel. The characters are cardboard cutouts, stereotypical dummies, molded to fit this ridiculous storyline.I think my IQ actually dropped from reading this.What a clunker of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME","review":"I am a huge fan of Sophie's Shopaholic series & \\"Can You Keep a Secret\\", but this one is a complete waste of good paper.Take Becky Bloomwood, remove the shopping addiction and just change her job description to that of \\"lawyer\\", and here you have the basis for the heroine of the novel Samantha Sweeten.The notion that a successful attorney wants to give up their career just because they are suffering from burnout and turns to housekeeping as an outlet is a bad one. It's even more irritating to read that even though she has the opportunity to take control of her life she never really does. The book would have ended far better if Samantha somehow managed to change her work environment to suit her needs better instead of just running away from it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...","review":"I really enjoyed the Shopaholic series, for the most part, so I was excited when I saw that Sophie Kinsella had another book out and hurried to purchase it in hardcover. However, I was really disapointed. While most chick lit books suffer from being predictable, this one was EXTREMELY predictable and just felt like it had no \\"meat\\" in the middle. To me the tone and voice of this book made it feel too similar to the Shopaholic series. Don't get me wrong, I love chick lit and don't take it too seriously, but I think other authors like Jane Green have done a better job at writing several books with a similar tone, but in different, unique voices. I like that Kinsella took on the character of a successful, headstrong woman, however I hated where it ended up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure fun reading.","review":"I loved the Shopohilic novels and decided to give this one a try to.

I was sorry when it ended and I had to return to reality and couldn't put it down long enough to make it last.

I read it on my Kindle:))"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another hit by Mrs. Kinsella","review":"This being her latest book, Sophie Kinsella, does not withhold any of the 'magic' that is in all her books with each main character - from Becky to Emma to Samantha. This book is an entertaining and flabergasting story of a girl who is so stressed out with daily life as a lawyer that finding time to relax is impossible. Throughout the story we find out how this workaholic makes it to relaxation through, shall we say, less than normal methods! This book is a worthwhile expense!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Usually a Fan, But Was Just Bored By This One","review":"I'm usually a fan of Kinsella's books as light, escapist romps. But this one just bored me. The plot can be summed up quite quickly (SPOILER ALERT - although honestly, you learn this much in the first 2 chapters) - Samantha is a hotshot London lawyer, makes a big mistake, and ends up in the country as a housekeeper. Much chaos ensues, as she has no domestic skills, and of course there is a love interest. I think the reasons this book doesn't work for me are 1) the 'country' setting is dull, compared to the hip, urban settings of most of Kinsella's books (the 'scene' is half the fun, usually), 2) the domestic chaos is not humorous but absurd (this woman got through law school?) and has all been done before on sitcoms (bad ones), and 3) the love interest is really dull.So, for me, this just didn't have the characteristics of the usual fun Kinsella romps. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to normal standard.","review":"I found this book abit slow, and i got frastrated with it. The main charector seems abit silly.

Samantha's sudden jump from the city to the country was quite harsh and not very well coordinated. It wasn't even believable.The book has a solid back bone but unfortunately the muscles holding it all together were weak. Key points that could have and should have been expounded on were left open leaving the reader to go back and reread wondering what she had missed.Lastly, why wouldn't the author have shared bits of the love note that was given to Samantha? It's Chic-Lit! I was so disappointed! It is like leaving out the key ingredients in a recipe.If you can read this book and not get caught up in the details you will be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOPE!","review":"This doesn't come NEAR her other novels. This book was tough to get into, never really went anywhere, and honestly, it was boring. I could barely finish it. I say avoid it. This happens with alot of successful writers.

Not typical of her great reads.","review":"What a silly book! I love Kinsella's other books, particularly the Shopaholic series, but geez...the situations in this book are laughable (and not because they're funny).

Even if you're a fan of Sophie's like I am, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Uninspiring Read","review":"A longtime fan of Sophie Kinsella and the refreshingly witty, surprisingly relatable \\"Shopoholic\\" series, I was disappointed by this book. I expected it to be predictable and even unbelievable, but not plain boring and poorly written. The vocabulary was that of an elementary school student and she must have used the phrase, \\"Never...in my life...\\" a thousand times! It was tough to take. I sped through it to put myself out of my misery. Sorry, Sophie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two dimensional disappointment","review":"Enjoyed the shopaholics, but this struck me as not fully developed. The characters are not properly fleshed out. I am a lawyer and find her stupidity not believeable. With access to the internet, any intelligent person would download instructions for any household appliance or recipe. Similarly, if she had the firm by the neck at the end, why didn't she negotiate a half-time position with an office in the country, even forgoing \\"equity partnership\\" to get it. Anyway, a firm like that would NOT take someone back no matter the mistake, if she had run away in the manner of the heroine here. Maybe they would have offered her a cash settlement, but take her back, no way.The premise was cute, but the characters were flat and the particulars of the story did not ring true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I found this book sooo predictable, well I know this kind of books are predictable but this was way over the top, and so dull It make me feel like I was a Kindergartner reading a story so unbelievable.

It was a good book. I love Sophie's books. I would love to see this one in a theater one day. I could just imagine what it should be like the. Sophie's writting style is that way. She makes to where you could imagine (with ease) the world she has created. Even after two years of not touching the book I still have the images in my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun read!","review":"I absolutely loved this book! It's my favorite book of Sophie Kinsella's besides the Shopaholic series. Samantha is funny and so lost when it comes to domestic duties that I was laughing out loud while I was reading.

It was kind of typical, and I could pretty much guess the ending. Still, I enjoyed reading it. If this book weren't funny and didn't have Sophie Kinsella's unique writing style, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much. But as it is, it was fairly enjoyable and entertaining.

This was really a fun read and contrary to some of the reviewers perception of the main character as over the top, I actually found her character to be fairly reflective of corporate life for women and men on the career ladder here in the US. I found the message to be very refreshing, that women have choices and options that don't make us any less of a person if we decide to opt out of the rat race. I think the ending is clever in the sense that the author leaves it up to our own imagination to create our own ending and provides a pretty realistic picture of just how difficult it can be to make career and personal life fit together. Once I picked up the book, I couldn't put it down until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinsella has done better...","review":"As a big Sophie Kinsella fan, I was quite disappointed in this recent release.

When this career woman makes a big mistake at work, and later on gets mistaken for a maid, and can't seem to be able to tell her new employer that she isn't and just stays there... Now I have this other book from her I didn't read yet, Can you keep a secret, I might get to read it someday, but I'm just not interested anymore.

That is the only thing that i would have changed.Very similar to 'can you keep a secret?' instead of the shopahoic books.Loved the characters and the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"What if a grownup ran away from home?","review":"What happens when a hotshot London lawyer from a workaholic family of overachievers suffers a cruel twist of fate and finds herself working as a maid in the country? Like SK's other famous character Becky Bloomwood, our heroine Samantha Sweeting finds herself in one pickle after another. I honestly couldn't put this book down - for two reasons: I was a workaholic Washington lawyer who recently left it all behind for a simpler life in Florida (no I am not a maid). The other reason was laughing myself silly as one lie after another escalated into the inevitable train wreck. The book builds up to a climax, has a little twist, then there is yet another climax. In true ChickLit fashion, the endings are predictable - but you had so much fun with our heroine, you don't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Star Read","review":"I'm not a fan of Kinsella's usually ditzy female characters but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Samantha is a top-notch lawyer at a prestigious firm who makes a mistake for the first time ever. In desperation, she flees the city and becomes a blue-ribbon housekeeper (unbelievable) and falls for the gardener, leaving behind her overachieving family and dream of making partner at the firmSPOILER:While on exodus, she discovers a scandal that's big enough to win back her job and fulfill her dream. Now she must choose between her career, complete with a budding romance to a fellow lawyer or her new life in the countryside with her new love.1 star for believability but hey, its just chick lit. So overall 4 stars for its warm, fairytale ending and strong heroine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chick lit","review":"I sped through this book -- my first by this author. I used to be a \\"city attorney\\" and I felt like Kinsella must have been spying on me to get it so right. The hours, the messy desk, the partners, the lack of a personal life, everything. The character's abrupt change of occupation might have seemed far-fetched in a lesser author's hands but I thought Kinsella wrote it all with great humor and believability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good entertainment...","review":"I love Sophie, her books are always pretty good. This it's not a must read, but it's a good book. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought as a gift for the love of my life. .","review":"My other half loved the characters introduced in the Sophie Kinsella series and wanted to read everything she had ever written. She read this particular book within a day and was disappointed that she had finished it so soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Undomestic Goddess","review":"From the beginning, it's easy to detect your standard Kinsella novel. A successful woman finds herself facing some unexpected change. She falls in love, some bad event happens, they break up, and then a few chapters later, everything's peachy. Now ordinarily, Kinsella puts enough personality into the book that makes it okay, but I don't know, something was just lacking in this one. I felt like some of the characters had great potential, but were ignored, like Freya or Sam's breakdown brother, Peter. There were parts that were so predictable that it got, quite frankly, boring. It's an interesting idea, but everyone knew how it would turn out, and all the flip-flopping in the end was absolutely unnecessary. There was just too much lacking in this book, plotwise, characterwise, just overall, for it to have been a truly enjoyable read.Rating: 2.5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Undomestic Goddess","review":"I thought the book was very entertaining and it definately held your interest. Can't wait for the spin off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read","review":"This book is entertaining from start to finish. If you liked Sophie's other books you'll like this one too. Samantha is quite outrageous but that's what makes her so endearing and this book so enjoyable. I can't wait for Sophie's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophie Kinsella - Goddess!","review":"If you're a fan of the shopaholic series, you'll love this one. It's a great light read with a totally unbelievable female character that you can still somehow identify with. It's fun, it's frivolous, it's not meant to be taken seriously and that's why I love it. Looking forward to her next book already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth my $7","review":"Well was it worth my $7, compared to other books I have gotten for $0.99, or even $5? no sorry. Not even close. It was Ok, had Ok characters, Ok storyline, and I liked two characters a lot Nathanial and his mother. I have read other books by Sophie Kinsella and this was my least favorite. My apologies"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Undomestic Goddess","review":"I enjoyed the Shopaholic series tremendously. I will never forget bursting out in laughter in the middle of my doctor's waiting room when Becky Bloomwood tried to speak in Norwegian (or whatever language she'd pretended to know on her application!)I was very excited about this new book of Kinsella's and I must say I was rather disappointed. While the book has its moments, everything about it sounds so highly improbable that I was not put into a state of willing suspension of disbelief (like I was with Shopaholic) - so the book started to really drag for me barely a quarter into the story. As I said, there are a few salvageable moments and some good lessons to be learned about enjoying life and stopping to smell the roses, but I am hoping Becky Bloomwood will make a comeback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Read!","review":"This one isn't as good as the Shopaholic books, but it is still very good! The plot was simple, but it was still entertaining and an interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny!!","review":"I have read all of Kinsella's books and this one is equally as delightful as the rest. It is hilarious at times if you can stop yourself from saying, \\"That would never happen.\\" about some of the scenarios the main character gets into. In fact, the main premis may make you think that as well. Overlooking this fact, it is fun to see the contrast between the main character's old job as a lawyer and her new job as a housekeeper. Very enjoyable read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A summer book, great for lazy days","review":"This is your typical chic lit. Great for a lazy summer day. As a lawyer working in banking and finance just like the main characther, I'm very impressed by Kinsella's background check and how she captures the work in lawfirms. This book will not change your life but it will make you laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate reading & I loved this book!!","review":"A great light read. I normally hate reading, but I devoured this book! Maybe it's because I'm a lawyer at a big firm like the lead character in this book, so I found it particularly funny for that reason. I think anyone would enjoy it though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"After reading \\"Can You Keep a Secret\\" by Sophie Kinsella, I wanted more. I got this book, and when I started reading it, I could not put it down. I was drawn in by the character's law firm job and thought the description of that life is accurate. The book just kept getting better, and I lost sleep because I needed to finish it before I went to bed. Kinsella tells a great story, and kept me intrigued the whole time. It starts with a woman completely immersed in her law firm career, with no time for other things, such as family. The book has some turmoil, some humor, and some romance, and in all, and I loved it. I highly recommend this book, and will be checking out Kinsella's Shopaholic series next."},{"rating":"2","title":"I WANT TO SEE THIS AS A MOVIE!!!","review":"Excellent light read. Couldn't put it down...more than a 'beach book'...less than a romance novel. It's real people. I love the way Kinsella writes. Samantha's thought process when her life is falling apart is so realistic. I found myself thinking for Sam...only to read down the page and have those exact words fall out of her mouth! Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Readers if you like Janet Evanovich Books, you will like this book. Sophie Kinsella is an English verison of Evanovich. It is funny, easy to read and very enjoyable. I would highly recommend it.Funn"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Favorite Book","review":"This book had the potential several times to be a really good read, but just when you think the plot line is going to pull together...it doesn't. There were so many loose ends and hanging threads. I was also disappointed in the choice of narrator for the audio version as she gave Samantha a bit of a pompous, too-old-for-her voice. Not my favorite Sophie Kinsella book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny moments, but not my favorite!","review":"I love the stories of Sophie Kinsella and her characters! However, this book was not my favorite. I agree with the other readers saying the situations are very unrealistic. And I believe that she made the main character a bit like Amelia Bedila in that she has no common sense when it comes to some well known domestic tasks. The ending does drag on, but if you are looking for a quick paper back read, this one is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I think \\"Undomestic Goddess\\" is my favorite of all Sophie Kinsella's books I've read so far. Although totally predictable, this book was a pleasure to read.The main reason I enjoyed this book so much is probably because I can totally relate to Samantha. She is a lawyer and workaholic. She thinks that she will be happy after reaching the next step on the career ladder and all her hard work and sacrifices will pay off. Only while working so hard towards her goal, she fails to enjoy her life. A series of events finally forces her to stop and take a long hard look at her life and evaluate what is really important.Of course, predictably there is romance and happily ever after, but aside from that I think this book has a great life message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too predictable","review":"The Undomestic Goddess was a fun, light read but it was too predictable. If you want to be entertained for a few hours of fun, enjoyable reading, then this is it. You'll know by page 20 exactly what is going to happen to Samantha and who she will spend the rest of her life with. If you are looking for something a little more intriguing that will keep you guessing, then look elsewhere.Linda C.

I just hated it! so many things in it are just not right.First of all, while i am not a particular fan of time travel, i can enjoy it, but 400 million years in the past is a little too much! It's almost like the book is making fun of time travel and those that enjoy it!!Then the characters- even if the writers had only seen the pilot episode they should know the characters a bit more! Neeklix is portrayed as a total idiot and coward, Harry as a total novice, Belana was slightly better but a little too agressive. All the characters in general were not well developed or portrayed.The dialogue! Particularly the dialogue between Tom/Tuvoc and Janeway giving orders on the bridge was almost redundant! Not well developed at all.I generally hate writing bad reviews, but this book was way too disappointing. It even had spelling and grammer mistakes in it! Sorry, but I just did not like it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! A return to the Regency classic!","review":"Candace Hern's Regency novels have always charmed, but this one is special. It's an old plot -- rake reformed -- but Hern breathes new life into it with Rosalind and Max. Die-hard Regency readers require historical accuracy in their romances, and this one will meet their highest standards. Unfortunately, the genre seems to be a dying art. If more authors wrote at this level, perhaps that would not be the case. This one is delightfully romantic. A beautiful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most fun!","review":"Miss Lacey't Last Fling was the 7th book by Ms. Hern that I read. It was fun from start to finish.Read it!

Believing that she only has months to live, she travels to London for the season and proceeds to break every rule of society.

I paid more and don't mind.","review":"This is my favorite of CH's Regencies on kindle but all share the same sprightly spirit and deft storytelling. You cannot go wrong at $1, get them all. I paid $3.99 for this one I think and don't regret it.Why I loved this one: I just found myself rooting for Miss Lacey and enjoying her bold choices. Don't we all have those \\"take this ____ and shove it, I'm doing what I want!\\" moments in life? Well, having a Season, no holds barred, was at the top of Miss Lacey's bucket list. She wanted to wear a daring gown, dance, say and do as she wanted, because she believed she was terminally ill. Who wouldn't fall in love with a woman living life so fully? The hero loved her for her boldness. My test of 5-starness is whether it was as good or better in the second reading. THis passed in the 3rd reading too. Not long but choice. I paid more for it and don't feel annoyed. I'm happy for others they can sample it for much less."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.2 Stars for the End Of The World","review":"When the world ends, I'd like to be listening to this album. It has a certain feel to it, like a Don Cheadle movie or a walk in the rain. I give it 4.2 out of five, but I disagree with myself with that rating because I feel that there are a couple of cracks in this album's veneer. Nevertheless, there are several standout cuts on the record, including Disconnect the dots and the british tour diary - great lyrics combined with an unmistakable sound make this a mature effort, and one that desperately craves attention. Of Montreal may be the equivalent of a child you love to hate, but one that you always come back to when the sun sets and the cotton sack is full."},{"rating":"2","title":"blissfully and happily great","review":"this is my first introduction to this band, and i can say that it is a happy one. i look forward to trying out the bands earlier albums. favorite song: lysergic bliss. this had me grinning and tapping toes, while trying to remain quiet -- i am in the office of course. i love it when a song makes me burst with happiness. The Beta Band did it with \\"Round the Bend\\", Mummy the Peepshow did it with \\"Skip! Skip!\\", and Of Montreal does it with Lysergic Bliss.Probably the funniest song is \\"Chrissie Kiss the Corpse\\". listen carefully to the lyrics of this one. Hilarious.On top of all that, this album is very energetic. I think this band must be outstanding to see live.I've left room in my rating for their other albums, and lots more listens of this one. In my book, with only a five star scale, four stars is pretty darn good. try this band out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hyper Intelligent","review":"For a lot of musicians a genre has a macro feel to it. It's something that they fall under somewhere. Of Montreal converts the macro into the micro by playing genres as if they were as accesible as keys on a keyboard. Satanic Panic in the Attic is experimental in the sense that it effortlessly swirls between genres within each song. They really come off as musical experts here. At first listen it was too much for my brain to comprehend, but I love getting used to it. It's very complex and smart. You'll recognize parts of songs as if they were samples from the sunny pop of blur, beatles, or beach boys and that other band that you won't be able to put your finger on. Playful like Odelay, this album comes highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute best Beach Boys record.","review":"In my opinion the best Beach Boys record.

I regret why I spend my [money] on something so worthless. When playing the game, there is no real thrill as you would find in games such as FIFA 99,00, 01. This is a game for anyone trying to put someone to sleep. Sure you have all the teams from around the world and all the names of the palyers on most the international squad, yet that does no mean that the quality of the gameplay is going to be good.

Half-life wasn't really revolutionary - it was just a top, top quality game. It has got everything - huge attention to detail, great graphics, great storyline, realism, atmosphere, excellent A.I., great multiplayer (see Counter-Strike), great challenge.

It was the very first game that my husband and I bought for our first computer and it was wonderful! The graphics were truly amazing, the storyline was great, and the progression was very good also. It was well worth the 40 dollars I paid for it.However, there were a few problems. Because the game is so layered, multidimensional and realistic, I felt it was necessary to have the guide book to walk me through it. For me, the game was impossible to play with out it. The other thing I didn't like was the ending of the story. I won't spoil it for any one but I will say that I felt the creators just sort of gave up at the end. The last few levels and especially the way it ends are very abrupt. I thought it would be a lot better than it was. So--in some ways it was a let down.But--overall this is a truly great game.

The graphics are a little out dated but thats okay the gameplay more than makes up for it. It isn't perfectly realistic but it comes very close to it. For one, you can carry 8 weapons at a time but thats the case it most shooters. And head shots don't kill. But besides that the game is very realistic. Guns are in logical places not just lying there as with health, health power-ups aren't just sitting there, instead you get health at refill pump which also are in very logical places. Now as the plot goes, the most brilliant part in the game. You are a scientist who works at Black Mesa Reseach Facility and are working on a very big project which goes very wrong, warping aliens to the lab. Now the lab is infested with deadly aliens and you are the only one who can save you fellow scientists. Wanna find out what happens? THEN BUY THE GAME!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aww, Yeah","review":"This game rules. I don't think I've ever had so much fun beating things with a crowbar. This game is also scary. What makes it scary is the perspective. In all the Resident Evils out there, the enemies lunge, jump, or shoot at a few thousand pixels on the screen. In Half-Life, they're after YOU. I have fond memories of crawling through a pitch black air shaft, my flashlight energy all but gone, 40% health, and having a bug-thing with claws jump at you from around the corner. Not for the feint of heart, but worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game has so many ways to have a blast!","review":"The script to this game comes from a movie screenplay writer, and the plot is actually interesting in this game and it really set standards for what first person shooters have to be in the future to be any good. Its VERY easy to get addicted to Team Fortress Classic, part of this game's release, and one of the most challenging computer games I've ever played online is Counterstrike, a very detailed version of Team Fort, which is a downloadable MOD for the Half-Life engine.

This game has lousy controls and is frustrating to play. This game also suffers from cheap setups that you as a player cannot avoid until it is too late. Things like falling office equipment, the floor falling out from under you, all kill your player no matter how good you are. Only after you KNOW about the traps can you avoid them.

The original game does look a bit dated by the standards of 2011 but bearing in mind that it was first released in 1998 it still looks pretty good, and in it's day it was truly ground-breaking. It also used a physics engine that was the best of its time and an AI that performed far better than any other. Almost everything you could want is here: a good variety of environments, some satisfying puzzles, and some challenging combat. It also has, within the obvious limits of a shooter, a solid and engaging story. All of this makes for a game that keeps you entertained from start to finish and never outstays its welcome.

Unlike other games, the arsenal is realistic and the setting is realistic. you can use your surroundings to help you kill the aliens. Warning: this game is very addicting. The only minor flaw was the graphics. don't get me wrong. the graphics were great but not up to my standards. After playing games like Morrowind, Splinter Cell, and the Unreal series, the graphics weren't that great. Another thing that bugged me was some of the wierd things you have to do. Sometimes you have to go back to where you started because you got lost. It happened to me once.

If you have popcorn and a cold and a good book and want something to run in the background... not a bad choice. The acting isn't bad so much as the script is just boring and trite and predictable, with none of the cuteness that could possibly sell it. They've tried to remake the first story, but lacking all of it's charm and seemingly written in about 2 hours.This movie is most notable in that is has a fantastic soundtrack, particularly Hold Me In the Moment by Gerald Brunskill.

I watch movies for entertainment only so am no great critic as some people seem to be. I just could not get into this one. After a couple years I decided to try The Cutting Edge - Chasing the Dream so I rented it from Netflex. I liked it so much I purchased it for my collection.

The glass beaker needs to be cleaned after use, every time (of course), and it's easy to tip over. It's also easy (if you're not paying attention) to yank the glass beaker out when you're about to clean it, and because the suction is still on, the beaker can come out with the plunger, exploding on the ground. Great.Still, it's the original, and it's an awesome way to make coffee.

With the press method, the steeping process means the ground coffee is in contact with the hot water for a longer time, releasing more flavor from the ground beans. You've probably read about how paper cones can absorb some of the oils and it's true. You'll taste what a difference it makes not using paper filters right away.I also like that on a day to day basis, I'm not consuming a paper product, with all the associated environmental effects.The retro look is cool.The \\"3-cup\\" size makes 12oz of coffee, which is perfect for an individual coffee.

As others have mentioned, a coarse grind works best. I love having a french press for the quality of the coffee and convenience. This one is made from some seriously shoddy glass, though. I've had IKEA glasses that are tougher than this. I replaced the beaker after the first break, assuming it was just a defective unit. But the second time it broke while just sitting in the top rack of the dishwasher. Must've been the temperature changes.If you buy this, expect to shell out money for new beakers in the future. And take a look at the replacement prices on Amazon - they aren't cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh - plunger stops too far away from the bottom","review":"I had a french press before that I loved to use when I traveled. It broke, and I got this one. Well, some bozo decided that french presses shouldn't go to the bottom because someone might push too hard and break the glass, so they all seemed to be designed now to stop way before the bottom. The result is that you can't really press the grinds, and when you pour, a lot of the liquid remains with the grounds at the bottom. You have to hope it \\"drains\\" eventually out if you hold it upside down. It doesn't taste as good either.Ugh. Think I will look for another brand where the French Press can actually do what the name promises. Press the coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the coffee, hate the beaker!","review":"We love the coffee we make with this press, but the spout of the beaker breaks off too easily. The first one broke when I was turning the beaker to face front. The second one broke for no apparent reason. A piece literally just fell off with no one touching it. All of this happened within only a few months of use. We are considering spending more for the stainless steel one, or a looking into a different brand altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic item","review":"I heard a lot about French Presses over the last few years and recently decided to try one.

Phone will only use default ringer for text message alerts if that option is chosen.* No automatic controls for camera flash.

For starters, there is no backlight on the phone, so you can't see the LCD readout or the keypad without independent lighting. Moreover, there is no way to completely turn the sound off when you receive a message, so you still hear the speaker even when you are sleeping (and have the ringer off!). Next, there is no MUTE button. The handset is very heavy and bulky and gets very tiring to hold next to the ear for an extended period. Programming the phone is OK, but you have to make some unecessary steps just to do everyday things, such as turning the ringer off and returning a call from the callerID. For example, if you locate the number in the memory, why can't you just press TALK? No. It couldn't be that easy: You have to remember to press callback. This is an unnecessary step, in my opinion. I would not recommend this phone at all to anyone. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fable out of Thin Air","review":"I was really disappointed in the writing style used in this book.

The woman is a real whiner.And there seemed to be parts missing, parts that make it a romance novel. This was supposed to be RJ and Sara's romance, so then, where is the romance?? Romance between them was sadly lacking. No kissing, absolutely nothing! And what about professing their love for each other?!What happened in the cave, for goodness sake?!!!How Sara gets pregnant is a mystery.The secondary characters, Ariel and David had a better time in my opinion.I felt thoroughly cheated with this book.

The characters are shallow and unbelievable. You never connect with them or buy in to their story.The storyline is ridiculous, boring, and childish. It felt like it was written for a much younger audience than one would expect for a Jude Deveraux book. It is so bad, I couldn't even make myself finish it. I threw it in the trash.

I have to agree with another reviewer who wrote this is written on a high school level. I would have to agree it is like a Nancy Drew novel. The characters never develop and the story is down right childish. If Ms. Deveraux wants to write mysteries, she should read a McNaught or Garwood novel, they are all wonderful.

I can not believe she wrote this. I'm a fan of Jude's and I enjoy most of her books, but I can tell you that this is the worst book she has ever written. Maybe she was up to a deadline and trying to rush through it.The characters were briefly described and seemed to all be a whimp, especially David and Ariel. The book was more a mystrey than romance. I'm usually okay with any kind of books, but this ending was too plain. Ariel found the treasure, without any attack. The lawyer mysteriously got captured without a fight. The ending was too plain and direct. I was expecting more, maybe a surprise ending. I usually give Jude's book a 5 star or more if I can, but I'm sorry to say that I can only give this book a 2 star.

It's an interesting plot to begin with, then turns a bit predictable, but still worth reading.It made me laugh and smile. I think Jude has a good sense of humor and writes her male characters with a bit of cynicism, but the enjoyable kind, not the insufferable type. She writes the woman involved with a good sense of humor and well rounded enough to put him in his place yet is still emotionally involved to which other women can relate.I enjoyed it.

I remember looking for anything I could get my hands on that featured a Taggart or Montgomery. But a few of her recent books have me questioning whether I was just imagining how good they were. I know she can write interesting characters, relationships, and intrigue better than this book. I remember thinking when I read Forever that there were a lot of incomplete thoughts. There wasn't a real fulfillment of her intentions. That was the same if not worse with Carolina Isle. She started storylines that never really played out to their full potential. We didn't even get the benefit of reading the main characters ultimate \\"I love you\\" scene. Instead we got the sucky secondary couple's scene.I don't know if this is an early work that got printed or a ghost writer to help produce more books.

And yes sometimes this does include quotes from Jewish mystics. If you're looking for a book that excludes the world at large and focuses on Christianity then perhaps you should read The Purpose Driven Life.

Now I know why and I'm glad I listened. It has been life-changing. I read her foreward at least once a month just to remind me of her purpose for writing this incredible book. I wonder why so many women identify with this book. We must all be connected by our souls. I have put two away for my daughters (5 and 11) because the writings are timeless.

I am wondering if anyone else picked this up - at one point we are asked to think of one woman we admire. I was thinking of Eleanor Roosevelt or Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Then SBB asked us to think of her personal style. Personal style of Eleanor Roosevelt? Like what she wore? Ridiculous. That is not exactly what I admired about her. But of course, the author assumed you would pick a beautiful woman to admire and then analyze her jewelry and makeup and hair...Anyway... at the same token, there were parts of this book I really enjoyed. I would read it at night and think about how to take more time for myself and I would actually sleep better. Blissfully almost.

They're merely the messengers. Adopting a daily attitude of gratitude is the key for moving us to a better, more peace-full world."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to change your life in one year or less","review":"This book has been my constant companion during 1997. I first checked it out at the library but hated to have to return it, so I rotated between two libraries for a couple of months, and then I broke down and bought it and I'm planning to re-read it during 1998. The bibliography alone is worth buying the book: I've never seen a list such as this where I want to read all the books mentioned! SBB is wonderful, creative, compassionate, very human in the way she's not afraid to share her weaknesses with her readers and encourage them to overcome theirs the way she did. She's the mentor I wish I'd had forty years ago, and now, thanks to her, I can try to be a mentor by sharing what I've learned from her.

While religion is mentioned over and again, it isn't from a Christian perspective. It is from a New Age perspective and from what I did read of it, doesn't actually refer to God very often. When she does, it is in a blasphemous way. Here is a quote from March 3rd: \\"If this is not what the Great Creator intended when She created the Sabbath, then I have no idea what is Sacred.\\" I was wary when I began this book and now I see that it was with good reason. I do not recommend this book. I will be disposing of mine and saying a prayer for the misguided author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading for all women, all ages","review":"I recieved this book as a gift last year when I was going through a very painful time in my life. Reading a meditation every day gave me a sense of discipline and hope in the midst of chaos. I could do without some of the Marth Stewart-ish decorating ideas, and in many ways this book applies more to women at midlife rather than a \\"twentysomething\\" like myself. But Sarah Ban Breathnach's fundamental truths (be true to yourself; listen to your own heart rather than the confusing and contradictory voices of those around you; happiness comes from within, not without) apply to all women of all ages, everywhere. I wish someone would have given me a book of daily meditaitons containing these truths when I was 13 years old; it would have saved me a lot of heartache. Maybe someday we'll see \\"Simple Abundance for Teenagers and Young Women.\\" I know I'd love to see it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Are Your Own Treasure!","review":"Sarah Ban Breathnach has definitely spent time in searching for her soul. Her words breathe life into those who are tired, discouraged, miserable and unhappy but do not know why. Sarah unravels the mysteries of the real answers by sharing her own inner struggles and how she went about discovering what she was looking for. She was looking for the truth about herself. I have found that it is a long journey but one worth taking--this road to wholeness. And I firmly believe with Sarah that you cannot truly give yourself fully and freely to anyone until you have given love to yourself. It is the most unselfish thing any woman could do and it is imperative that women learn to make themselves (their emotional, spiritual, mental needs) a top priority. If we take care of our own souls first, we will have the energy and vitality to do more than we have ever dreamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black coffee with a shot of whiskey...","review":"is my best thought on how to get through a book like this.

I faithfully spent the days of the year 2000 on it, waiting for it to get better. There were occasional insights, but overall it was much of the same self-help stuff that is and has already been out there. If someone is just embarking on a journey to authenticity/spirituality it mey be a good starting point, but for one who has already been active on such a journey, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Must Have Guide for All Stepford Wife Wannabes","review":"My mother received this book from my aunt who was thinking this would be a guidance to find personal peace. No go. My mother happens to be caring for my aunt's mother (my grandmother) and is quite stressed out about it. In fact my aunts have contributed nothing for their own mother's care and haven't forked over any money, which would be the REAL helpful thing to send. Not spend $22.95 on this useless waste of a tree. This book is not the answer; it's beyond insulting. This book is so incredibly insulting to women (kitchen, cooking, cleaning) I can't believe more women don't grasp that it's repetitive and mundane and so obviously meant for those who walk around in a trance while they clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"still solid","review":"Altho the author has exhibited \\"flaky\\" behaviour lately, this book remains a daily companion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"More delusional mind-numbing happy talk from the New Age continuum.

Now, I use it randomly -- and it still \\"speaks\\" to my heart and mind. I can't thank Sarah enough for giving me permission to enjoy my home, and, well, my life as a woman. She has introduced me to many wonderful authors that I would NOT have found without her guidance. In fact, many of the books I've purchased here on amazon.com, have been introduced to me in Simple Abundance.This is a wonderful path.

Only Bret or Bart could personally tell you where they had come from. You may even be suprised to see that you have a different take on the whole album as well.

With over 30 military subtypes, they've covered everything from gladiators to templars and beyond. Each category is thoroughly layed out with a description, requirements to play that class, skills, and special features. In addition, there are skills, equipment, spells, and creatures that are described in great detail to fill out any campaign. A special treat included is a breakdown of heraldry and suggestions on how you can apply it to a classic D&D campaign setting. I can't help but recommend this text to anyone who wants to add a little historical flavor to their game."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best d20 sourcebooks available.","review":"This book is an awesome resource for any campaign and one of the finest d20 system products out there.

There is no doubt about his talent and musical vision, but the quality of musicianship is inferior to the newer bands. Whoever plays keyboards in the band sounds like he just bought his first keyboard the day before. As a vocalist, Kuti is not much better - his english is awful and he does not know when to stop - he can take a phrase or a word and repeat it until you see stars and stripes.

You may recall that Jek was shot down during the Battle of Yavin. An R2 unit droid is included, again not R2_D2, but visually the same. The X-Wing is the real star here though, as it is the proper scale for the Micro Machines figures, and the pilot fits perfect in the cockpit, and the droid fits right into his own spot. The cockpit opens, landing gear is retractable, the wings open and close to the X formation. The design of the X-Wing is a very good likeness, and it is painted in the Red Six colors. It also has a nice display stand, hidden under the packing material. Do not throw out the box without digging for it. The fighter is about 7\\" wide x 7\\" long.

With the research Bender performed, she could have given us a vivid account of how the language is used today. But only limited quotes or paraphrases of actual Cherokees make their way into the book, along with very few specific examples of the syllabary in use.

If you want to play like Yngwie, Vinnie Moore, or the rest of the bunch this book will put you in the right direction. 12 or 13 years ago this book would have helped me but today it surely won't.

It worked fantastically well, it was quiet, and really cooled down all four rooms from the central area between them.My only complaint is that, unless things have changed since we got ours, the instructions were minimal and almost incomprehensible. It was a Chinese translation, if I remember right, and I ended up having to go on their web site to puzzle out how half the controls even worked.That aside, highly recommended as an alternative to a window-mounted A/C, especially if you ever need to move it to other areas - an almost impossible task with window-mounted units."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mastering English: An Advanced Grammar for Non-Native and Native Speakers by","review":"The book explains a lot but lacks of examples.

However, after having replaced all my flooring with hardwood, I sought a mop that could keep up with the daily dust burden imposed by two parrots. The California Duster literally sucks up dust better than any microfiber product I've used, requiring only a quick once-over. While the parafin in the mop has a faint odor, there is no deposit on the floors, keeping them even cleaner. I like this product so much I purchased the small version for my vehicles.

Having started his professional carreer as a journalist, Churchill returns as a straightforward and candid narrator of events.

But it's 2002, and maybe it's time to move on a bit?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-indulgent","review":"I expected this book to be a self-indulgent attempt by Manzarek to fulfill what is probably a huge fantasy for him. No problem, I wanted a little indulgence myself. But this book goes far overboard into nonstop self-congratulations.Rather than simply embrace the fun notion that Morrison is still alive, Manzarek has Morrison apologize (over and over) for how poorly he treated the other band members while constantly giving them credit for making him the icon that he was. Manzarek even has Morrison compliment the albums that The Doors produced after his departure. It's actually a bit embarassing to read such a transparent attempt to assure the world that the rest of the band was worthy of Jim Morrison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic and Predictable","review":"Poet in Exile reads like a thearpy journal masked as fiction.

It was a total disappointment. The text is self indulgent and overly emotional to the point where it bores the reader. How the characters parallel those of the Doors is enough to enrage a true Doors fan and the events are totally unbelieveable. Ray Manzarek is a very talented musician and should stick with what he knows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than one star","review":"This book is embarrasingly bad. It reads like a highschool fanzine/blog. Perhaps that is the intention? Do we really need to be TOLD who Audubon was or have yoga positions and zen concepts explained to us like a child?

I was a huge Doors fan back in the 60's and have recently started reading the many books on them, including this author's memoir, \\"Light My Fire\\", which I liked very much. This novel, however, was so ridiculous that after the fist 30 pages, I should have known what was coming. By about 50 pages in, he had found and solved the mystery. Come on! At that point, I had my own (better) ending picked out, skipped a bunch of the middle, and was laughing sadly at the actual conclusion. The \\"disguised\\" names he gave people and places were so silly, and the way he referred to the other 2 band members as simply \\"the guitar player\\" and \\"the drummer\\" was actually a favor, although I'm sure he didn't mean it to be. I would love to believe that somehow Jim Morrison faked his death and is alive and well out there somewhere, but I know it's not true and this just seems to be a way of making money from a long-past tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Jim rest in peace!!!","review":"It is absolutely unbelievable that a man like Ray Manzarek, who claims to have been the close friend of Jim Morrison, has written this book. Manzarek should have kept this fantasy to himself; by writing this book he has only exacerbated all those false rumours that Jim is still alive. How could you have done this, Ray? And you call yourself a friend of Jim? What was the point of writing this? I'll never know, but I know Jim Morrison is dead and may he rest in peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"INTRIGUING","review":"I loved the book, Ray did a very good job if this a fiction book, makes you wonder? But by the middle of the book I knew kinda already what was going to happen in the end, which was the only part I didn't like. But without giving away anything about the end, some of it just didn't seem to make sense, but very predictable..But still a very intriguing book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Francesca100","review":"I bought this book not expecting very much. I got so much more than I expected. Manzarek wrote this under the fairy tail that Jim Morrison was still alive. I found it to be a wonderful story, true or not.

Wait a while because right now I have a cool device that can't hotsync... Poor customer service on Palm's end, in my opinion.

All of the programs load and launch ok. Some crash shortly after launch while most crash instantly when you try to select the menu icon for the program. You would think that Palm would make sure that the majority of 3rd party apps would be backward compatible. Seriously, I have never had a palm unit that crashed as much as this thing.The screen also seems to have little brightness adjustment. I started all the way to the right and didn't notice a change in brightness until I was 3/4 of the way to the left.

It provides clear evidence of the fact that life after death does exist. The graphics are very good and the audio is also very good. It is a compelling documentary. I only wish that it would have spoken about Hell a little bit more. It only spent a couple of minutes on the subject of Hell but I guess that is to be expected since this documentary is about Heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased","review":"This is a fairly good documentary. It includes some of the well known NDEs. My only complaint would be that the actual experiencers didn't get enough time to give enough detail (in favor of commentator time). But its a professional production and well worth the few green-backs I paid. I wish someone would produce a quality DVD that is more experiencer and less commentary such that each experiencer discusses every detail he or she can recall. And Producer, when you do it, go light on the A Minor, emotion manipulating music. OK?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragnet 1968: Season 2","review":"Wow! I absolutely love this DVD set and the terrific job Shout! Factory did in producing it! First class job by Shout! Factory, including topnotch bonus extras. \\"Dragnet\\" (Joe Friday and Bill Gannon) was such a classic & entertaining 1960s TV series, and it is a must-have addition to my DVD collection - I am thrilled with this set, and highly recommend it! I can't wait for Shout! Factory to release Season 3 and Season 4 of \\"Dragnet.\\" Great show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Job !!!!! A must for all Dragnet fans !!","review":"I was so happy to finally see a continuation of the Dragnet seasons being released on DVD !!! 3 or 4 years ago \\"season 1\\" was released by Universal & stalled after that. This company, (Shout Factory) did a much better job than Universal did on season 1. First of all, the entire season 1 was done on just 2 \\"double sided\\" discs. I don't know about anyone else, but I had trouble playing these on both of my DVD players. Video quality is very good & Season 2 also had more in the way of bonus material, most important was the 1966 pilot move which I haven't seen in ages !! The look at Jack Webb by some of the original co-stars was also alot of fun. To Shout Factory: Seasons 3 & 4 WITHOUT DELAY !!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Edits","review":"While I'm glad that Season 2 of Dragnet is finally released, I was disappointed to find the Pilot movie to be edited. It's missing the 2 minute Prologue that leads into the Opening Credits.The Uncut movie begins with Jack Webb doing his \\"This is the City...\\" and shows scenic L.A. including the Crime Scenes that Joe and Bill are going to encounter. Also, rather unique for Dragnet, is the showing of one of the victims right before she gets killed. All of this leads into the Universal logo and the famous Dragnet theme. In this DVD version, the movie begins with the Universal logo and Dragnet theme and skips right over the first 2 minutes of the movie.When AMC was showing the movie a couple of years ago, they showed the complete movie. TBS also ran the complete movie back in the 1990s.I understand the movie is included as a bonus, but edited movies on DVD are no bonus.I haven't watched all the episodes yet, so I dont know if any of those episodeshave been edited as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgia... those were the days!","review":"Love watching Dragnet and catching things like - prices of homes, gas and food prices, and what people made.

I tried to do some research on the author but found very little, if any, on the internet. I should have suspected something was up at that point! Nevertheless I slogged my way through the book cover to cover and it was very difficult to read. Some of the flaws are as follows: Characters come into the book with little or no historical context, the author constantly repeats himself, there is little or no organization to the authors book. You get the feeling he did an immense amount of research and just compiled his notes with no thought of how it would read. The sad part is this could have been a great book considering the subject matter, characters and events surrounding Quantrills life. I am beginning to see that many of the reviews on Amazon cannot be taken seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"SPEND YOUR MONEY ON ANOTHER BOOK","review":"AFTER 100 PAGES OF REPEATING MURDER AFTER MURDER, I WANTED QUANTRILL TO COME BACK AND SHOOT THIS BOOK.

What could go wrong? Well, the script and the direction. The story is kind of cute, but the script and direction are unbearable for anyone over 10! I'm giving it two stars because I think it deserves one and my daughter thinks it deserves four."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but ultimately irrelevant addition to the Casper saga","review":"It's a shame that the makers of Casper movies have apparently decided to release all the new episodes straight to video. In this case, the standard the creators set for their work is clearly way too low; the result is a terribly straightforward, disappointing tale that is usually funny and full of hilarious wordplays but totally lacks any hidden meanings or subtlety that almost seemed to have become a trademark of the series after the first two movies. The series seems to have become somewhat exhausted, and the creators seem to desperately lack new ideas. Consequently, the third movie looks too much like a the first one, only not as inspired. If the Casper legacy is to continue in the future, it absolutely needs to go in some new direction, because the old one is clearly not enough at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Halloween Movie...","review":"This movie is so great for Halloween.This moive is also great for the family.Hilary Duff(Wendy)did a great job acting in this plus she's so cute.Go get this movie or watch it on TV it comes on ABC Family sometimes.Hilary Duff Fans Rule Hilary Duff Haters DroolHappy B-Day Momma"},{"rating":"1","title":"shtinkey! yuckies! barf bag please?","review":"FIRST of all, Wendy has got to be the youngest teen-age witch I've seen in a looooong time! And what was up with that red thing? It seemed to me like the movie makers got bored with this whole idea. The Josh kid was retarted, he acted like he owned Wendy after talking to her for less than a minute, and the witches attitudes were pointless and farfetched. The whole basis for the movie was weak, the witches and ghosts reasons for hating eachother were totally stupid. I must admit that the scene at the dance was funny, but this story moved much to fast, and was all in all retarted. Wendy didn't seem at all upset when she found out about the Mystic Abyss, and the oracle and the warlock was pointless. Hilary Duff did a good job as Wendy, but the plot was a sad excuse of a Casper Movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casper Meets Wendy","review":"this movie was great because hilary duff is such a great actor! and do NOT listen to anyone who says that she stinks because she rocks! she's a very successful young actor and is admired by millions. she is wonderful! it deserves weigh, weigh more than 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"suprisingly good","review":"i was flipping throught the channals, on cable, and i got in on the last half of the movie. i remember in the casper comics, wendy is refered to as \\"wendy, the good little witch\\". it does not say that she is teen witch. i loved casper the movie. i think the idea is original and fun. im 29 years old and love all types of movies. i fell in love with cathy moriatry (sp) when i saw her in soapdish.

It had state of the art effects, great plot, great acting. Then the sequals rolled in. Instead of grabing the original cast and creating a good theatrical sequal they make a A Spirited Beginning. A movie with terrible acting and a story that did not fit with the original at all. The next effort Casper Meets Wendy was even worse. I can't believe they turned Casper into some bad Bewitched spin-off. It doesn't fit in the Casper universe. If that wasn't enough the acting was just as bad as A Spirited Beginning if not worse. When the witches use magic everybody sees nobody cares. Yeah right. When the kids find a magic wand they try to destroy it instead of keeping it. Special effects were terrible you think made years after the effects would be better not worse then the original. They were worse. Much worse. Any enjoyment Hmmmmmmmmmmmm no none. Stick with the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casper Meets Wendy","review":"It was as advertised. Quality was good, everything was just fine as usual.

It takes place after the first film. Casper and his uncles are on vacation and Casper is not having a good time and his uncles are scarying everyone and bullying him a little bit. Mean while Wendy and her aunts are on the run from Desmond Spellman an evil wizard who want to kill Wendy so he can be the most powerful sorcerer in the world and Wendy won't. Wendy and Casper while they get upset all of a sudden meet each other and have a fun day and plot to get Wendy's aunts and Caspers Uncles together so they can get a long cause ghosts and witches don't get a long. I won't give away too much because not everyone has seen the movie. But this film is great for all ages and you'll laugh a lot during it. This is also Hilary Duff's first movie as Wendy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly cute movie","review":"Out of the direct to video Casper movies, this is definitely the best of the lot. In the world of Casper, ghosts and witches are incompatible and are always fighting, but Casper befriends Wendy, and the two of them get along just great - though this can't be said for Casper's uncles, or Wendy's aunts. However, the conflicts between the grown-ups are fairly amusing, and the ending while cliched is appropriate for this film. Definitely a good Casper movie, if you're going to watch any of the direct to video sequels, then definitely choose this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Security Lock","review":"This lock does not provide any security.

My family has lived in the house for 40 years. We have had bikes stolen off the front porch before, so I wasn't kidding myself about neighborhood safety.

They are a nice looking and functional way to secure school bikes. I particularly like the interchangeable keys. The new rule in our house is \\"if you loose your key, don't call home, find your brother\\". They work fine, even my 6-year old can lock and unlock his bike.I almost didn't buy these because of the comments about cable size here on Amazon. If you have some zillion dollar bike you probably want a thicker stronger cable, maybe with GPS tracking and some of those dye-packs that tellers throw in with the cash in bank robberies. These locks are extremely strong, no one is going to break them without serious bike-theft tools. They will certainly deter any but the most ambitious, professional and prepared thief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal. Ease of use.","review":"My son wanted something to give him some peace of mind when he goes to his friends on his new bike. I saw this 3-pack set and thought it was a good deal.To use this product, all you have to do is wrap the chain around the bike and a post. There are 3 chains and 3 keys; Any of the keys will work with the three chains so it doesn't matter if you accidentally mixed them up. The chains are wrapped in plastic hose tubes in 3 different colors. The hoses cover the bare chains to prevent scratching the paint of his new bike.One thing to bear in mind. This is not a foolproof way of protecting your bike. Any determined thief who has the right tools will have no problem taking your bike. But if he has a choice and see your bike with a chain on it, he will probably pass on to the next bike for an easier ride. Also, most of the times, it just another kid who wants to swipe your bike for a joy ride in the neighborhood and leave it in middle of the park."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bike stolen","review":"On the 2nd day I parked my bike at the metro north station, it was stolen.

From the rotating laser cannons to the hidden power core, this set is truly amazing. For starters, it comes with Jango and Boba Fett, who has shorter legs that can't move, and removable helmet and armor. The ship also has many hidden compartments and gadgets. It has rotating laser cannons at the bottom, a cockpit that moves with the landing gear/wings to make Jango face forward, two hidden, four barrel guns that come out of the sides, two missles (that you can't hook on anywhere), a little blue power core, a compartment that holds Jango's cool little blasters, a bomb bay that comes with three bombs, and a smuggling compartment that clings to the ship by a magnet.The only defaults in this ship are that the wings come off easy and it's hard to find a place to hold so you can fly it.A must-buy for Star Wars and/or Lego fans!

First, when open, it does not lay flat, but at an awkward angle, thus the weight of the open pages and CDs rests on the end of the zipper. The zipper did not last long. Second, the slots for the CDs are a bit too tight. If you use just one side of each page, it is marginally acceptable, but using both sides makes it too tight and binding on the CD. Even using just one side, the top 1/8\\" of each CD on the bottom row overlaps the plastic slot from the row above instead of resting all nice & safe on the material.I think it is a great buy and unit for storing CDs in at the office if you do not have to use it daily, but on the road or frequent use will destroy this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"five for the idea","review":"The 'Case Logic' wallet holds 'only' 264 cds, compared with 320, but that is a -lot- of cds. The loose-leaf design, stronger construction,(the handle especially), and greater ease of access make it the first choice. I cut down the booklets,etc, and was able to fit the the full 264 with all the extras, still with good access. To have all of my boxes metamorphized into one sleek package (not much larger that my full-size binoculars' case), makes me happy every time I look over at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for me","review":"I use this to store CDs and DVDs at my office and it has worked fine for me with no complaints for over 2 years now.

I spent an hour loading all of my CD's into it. I showed it off to my friends, all of whom admired the stylish look and professional features. That is, until the stitching holding the handle on came loose two days later, leaving the handle attached at only one end. To top that off, a day after that, the zipper's stitching came loose as well, meaning that not only was I left with a CD case that I couldn't pick up easily, but now it couldn't close either. How utterly delightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge case but inferior to caselogic","review":"I just bought this case about 2 weeks ago and after loading it up, it is just waiting to break. The handle is not reinforced nearly enough, and, although plentiful, the cheap attachement of the pages within the case is going to be a problem. If your csae pretty much just stays in the house and lives an easy life than this mammoth case is for you, but if you are like me and your case goes out and about to see the world then I am telling you to go with the case logic. This case was put together cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have six of them!","review":"These CD binders are pretty good. I use them for my DVD backups. They do not SCRATCH discs at all unlike the CDPROJECTS binders. But I found that you can only fill them up with 160 discs because the discs in the inside pockets will bend if you close the binder. The outside handle looks like it would break off and you can't open this book all the way. Fellows made some poor design choices with this binder but it doesn't scratch the discs and that's all that matters to me. You shouldn't buy this if you want a binder that you can carry around. I will be buying more of these in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fellows CD Wallet","review":"At first I couldn't wait to get this. I ordered 2 at the same time. As I started to fill the pages, I started seeing the first of several problems. Pockets were tight and it would be very easy to scratch a dvd on the zipper. Speaking of zipper, it is very hard to work when the wallet is full. The other day, I wanted to see about getting more CD wallets (not necessarily Fellows) when I read the reviews here for this wallet. I read the part about not putting cd's in the inner pockets because they would bend. I went home and checked mine. Sure enough, when the wallet is full, the cd's are slightly bent. I would imagine if they were left that way for a period of time, they would probably stay curved."},{"rating":"2","title":"For CD Booklets Only","review":"I recently purchased a 300-disc cd changer and needed a way to organize the music I put in there. I'm using this album as a way to set up my music in jukebox form by only using the cd booklets in the album and numbering them. This way I can flip through the album and find exactly what I want to listen to. Since this will not be taken outside my house and will not be having disks put in/taken out repeatedly, it will be great for my use. However, if I were to use this as an actual cd album, I don't think it would make it for long. It's just not sturdy enough. The spine seems particulary succeptable to being pulled apart by the weight of 320 cds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good item for the price, if not used for portability","review":"Bought this after I realized twelve years of computing equals a heck of a lot of optical disks... The sleeves are at least as soft on the disks as the newer Case Logic carriers I have, and definitely softer than the pre-1997 Case Logic carriers! It seems durable enough, and with a carrier of this size the sewn-in pages are probably better than a binder. This carrier is probably not the best for portable storage - the carrier really doesn't open well unless it's sitting on a flat surface. But for my purposes - sitting under my desk as an archive - it fits the bill just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Priest of California","review":"The late Charles Willeford isn't for everybody and if he were judged by this book he'd just be another hack writing bad books at an alarming rate. You gotta love the day when writers were paid by the word. This one features a car salesman with no ethics and only one goal in life- to seduce an innocent lady just trying to get along. He, like the book, has no redeeming merit. If you're new to Willeford, try Miami Blues. That's the acid test. But be warned, Willeford didn't hang around in nice neighborhoods with virtuous people."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"my boys loved it .. i bought a few more sets for the kids for christmasthe boys play for hours with this toy.. and that makes me very happy.. thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Dissatisfied!","review":"Since June of 2009, I have been waiting to receive my book.

It's worse than merely useless and moronic. Not only are most of the concepts worthless and dated, the author made the unpardonable sin of making it monotonously dated by constantly taking swipes at Ronald Reagan on every other page. It's like reading a book about revenge written by a college freshman who hated Herbert Hoover. \\"A good way to stick it to the Hoover-ites is, when you get on the trolley on the way to the silent picture show, pass gas and blame the old lady next to you! That's the cat's pajamas!\\" \\"Another way to frustrate the Hoover administration is, when the milk man comes by, feed his horse straw instead of hay!\\" \\"If you really hate Herbert Hoover, crouch down behind your mark's radio cabinet, and when Amos and Andy comes on, bark like a dog and set fire to his curtains!\\" You get the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"This is a tremendous disappointment. I would strongly advise against anyone over the age of 7 buying this book. It illustrates some pretty infantile methodsof getting even. For example rubbing human waste all over there vehicle.

I'm mad at myself for wasting the time to read this piece of excrement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Unenjoyable Pompous Baloney","review":"Endlessly digressive, intentionally complex and, simply put, one of the most displeasing books I've ever attempted to read. When I first read a short review of Great Neck, I'd hoped for an interesting story about Long Island teenagers and the turmoils of the 1960s. But Cantor's not interested in telling a story as much as showing off his non-linear, intentionally complicated writing style. I'm not impressed. Not one person in my book club could finish Great Neck, and we're not rubes; Middlesex by Jeffry Eugenides and The Known World by Edward P. Jones were two of our favorites. Sure to be loved by post-modernist poseurs and English professors, but probably not by many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like it...","review":"I had such high hopes for this book. I think I gave it a fair chance (I stopped on page 122). At 700 pages with a smallish type set, there is enough material here for a few books. Cantor's style of tangent-laden sentences, skipping through multiple time periods without much segue make for slow-going work. MANY different characters with similar sounding names and all with secondary names as well add to the confusion. Might pick this back up in the future if feeling more adventurous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twenty Pages and I Quit","review":"Kudos to those who managed to get past one hundred pages or, remarkably, actually finished this book. Every paragraph is crammed with ten or twelve ideas, a few worthy, most not, each competing for coherence, none succeeding. I plowed through the first chapter in hopes that it would simmer down thereafter, but the second chapter showed that Mr. Cantor's writing is entirely out of control and that he was ill served by an indulgent editor. How many teachers of freshman writing courses have had to reign in this type of overblown, undisciplined junk? Too bad Mr. Cantor missed that class. The book is simply unreadable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatdreck","review":"Lemme tell you, this book has everything. Shrinks who knew Freud. Holocaust survivors. Mad Bombers from the seventies. Jewish heroes who freedom march and then get buried under a few tons of soil. Harvard. A snot-nosed super cartoonist And with all that, it stinks! Mr Cantor invents situations. Then he drags them on and on until you gotta got to the bathroom so bad that-- Mr. Cantor, if he were from Keokuk, would never be published because he cant write. He is dull, dull, dull.

If you wonder why, read this book. The idea is simple: A picture and a reminisience. Thomas Hoving conducted a series of interviews with Andrew and placed the artist's insight into his own work next to the work itself. The format is as austere and magnificent as the paintings themselves. The plate qualities are excellent and all of the pieces are shown in their entirety. This is not an autobiography of Andrew's life but rather a penetrating look into sixty years of peerless artistry. The book contains no detail plates nor does it attempt to explain Andrew's often cryptic commentary, but it takes you into the mind and soul of the artist. Delight in this. It is a treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Be aware that you are buying the very most basic of players. This DVD/CD player is called a \\"changer\\", but it will not automatically advance to the next disc. It's really just a storage device for multiple discs. It stops when it reaches the end of a disc.....for example, there is no way to have continuous play of CD music. It must be manually advanced to the next disc. Also, for music CDs the \\"repeat\\" feature only repeats one song.....no option to repeat an entire CD of music.From my perspective, I was embarrassed to give this as a gift....."},{"rating":"1","title":"More plastic for the landfill","review":"Bought this player at the local Wally World. It was cheap and flimsy feeling from the beginning. Slow physical loading and initial reading of the disk, regardless of type (DVD, CD). It finally stopped being able to read any disk of any type after about a year. If I turn it off and let it sit overnight, then the first DVD I try to play works fine.

My boys bought it for me so I hardly felt I could take it back even though that was my first thought on seeing the RCA label. Surely this model would be better? NO! This one has done the same thing though it gave me no warning. After turning on the power it does nothing except say WELCOME. Of course it was one month out of warranty.

While The Net is an outstanding movie even though now a bit dated (look at the cell phones and 3.5 discs) imo, the Net 2.0 is not in the same league dropping the package a star.

He was almost 4 years old, and he has enjoyed playing with it. We had no problem getting ours to work. The sound and picture quality is great. This Viewmaster is different from the classic kind in that you have to insert the plastic case (it has a little cartridge attached to it) into the back of the toy to get the sound to go along with the picture reels. Each of the reels has three discs with 21 pictures total. Right now (August '07), the supply for this and the reels is low, so Amazon's price is not the best.

Design aesthetic must always be balanced by playability, practicality, and durability. So, even though many collectors may lament the fact that this model isn't completely accurate in its design, it's still a whole lot of fun to build and play with!For me, building large Star Wars Lego sets is, frankly, therapeutic and very relaxing. This set in particular has a lot of \\"heart\\" and some great design features. Several hidden hatches, a removable flying section, sliding doors, a magnetically balanced tool compartment, three clone troopers, a Jedi, two super battle droids, and one three-legged destroyer droid make this set a huge winner in my book.I wasted a whole evening putting this thing together -- time WELL spent! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish this stuff was around when I was a kid","review":"To me, the one redeeming point to AOTC was the arrival of the Clone Army to save the day. The Clone's themselves were very cool in their armor, and the support vehicles they used made it even better. Lego's adaption of the LAATi Republic Gunship is on target. Extremely well designed, fun to build, loaded with extras such as compartments, gunracks, maintenance hatches, and superbly detailed. The tail-gunner station and controls were a great surprise. The Clone-trooper figs are great, as are the droids and droideka. The nameless jedi is also an nice addition. More Clone-troopers would have been better. Like everyone else has mentioned, the price is steep but well worth it. A must have for any SW fan or kids reinacting (a fancy word for playing) SW AOTC.

I read it in one sitting because I couldn't put it down. The main character is a total original - a manic depressive painter who tries to control his psychotic tendencies with medication, but keep himself a little bit insane for the sake of his art. It was a very accurate portrayal of bipolar disorder. Unfortunately the last third of the book quickly loses credibility and ends in a most unsatisfying way. I can only recommend this book for those who suffer from bipolar and are perhaps looking for a character they can identify with. This book is a lightweight mystery with Hollywood ambitions - nothing more, nothing less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superfly Meets the Staples","review":"This is a must-have cd for fans of Curtis or the Staples Singers. It is a slight detour from most SS albums, in that this one is all about love, lust, and funky good timing. Curtis really teases out beautiful performances here, highlights include the smooth title track and the sexy workout \\"Funky Love.\\" I really love \\"New Orleans,\\" and was hoping it would get remade or re-noticed in the wake of Katrina. The song where it all works, though, is \\"I Want to Thank You,\\" where Curtis's groove, funk, backbeat, and production meet the overtly spiritual nature of the lyrics (more traditional SS territory). A great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doing it again and again","review":"This is an excellent album. The combination of the staple singers and curtis mayfield was brilliant.

Mavis' voice is just perfect; she has all the frustrations of a hormonal teenage girl mixed in with some determination to get what she wants. There is no bad track on here.

Perhaps the most fascinating tales are those from the start of his political career, when dead men could vote, often. He was not on the side of the Kennedys early on and those stories are enlightening. Massachusetts has been blest with giants in politics. Tip was one of the biggest."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was duped!","review":"I was so interested in reading this book because we had lived in Seattle, and I thought \\"Red Rose\\" was an actual house. As I got into the book, which I thought read like a badly written romance magazine story, I began to suspect this was another Blair Witchtake-off.Why an author feels they have to do this, I can't imagine. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy, trite, exploitative but a page turner","review":"Who was it that said there's a sucker born every minute? Never underestimate the sophistication of your audience? I am giving it two stars just because it is SO creatively contrived, and there is such an essence of authenticity- Down to the fake website with pen and ink drawings of the characters- yeah, like dozens of people just disapeared because an entity which is in fact a building itself called RoseRed, gets jealous. er... right. The fact that some academic phd found a diary at a flea market ...!! oh this is very clever.needless to say I read the book cover to cover .It's worth the 75 cents I paid for it. Good gimmick I say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped-off!","review":"Call me stupid if you want, but I bought this book thinking it was an authentic 1907 diary! I didn't bother to bring my magnifying glass with me to Waldens so I didn't see the tiny \\"fiction\\" on the back cover next to the bar code! I'm a King fan, but I am thoroughly disgusted with him and Hyperion! This is fraud! I would never have bought this book knowing it was fiction! I hope someone sues the pants off King and Hyperion!I see that some reviewers say that the book was sold in the fiction section of the bookstore.......it was in nonfiction at the store where I bought it. I returned the book...the manager had no idea what I was complaining about until I explained tha it was misrepresented as nonfiction. Last time I checked it was still displayed with nonfiction titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Flop","review":"Well, I watched the movie on TV (the end was very dissapointing) and figured maybe the book would make up for it but I was very wrong. While some of the parts were somewhat interesting to read the rest was simply words to fill up additional pages.

Oh well, life goes on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting....better than that mini-series!","review":"The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer: My Life at Rose Redby Joyce Reardon is a good book.

After reading everyone's VERY HELPFUL reviews, I now realize that the documentary was just a trailer for the Stephen King series.What makes me angry is the fact that one was led to believe that the diary really existed - there were interviews with the \\"editor\\" who talked about Ellen Rimbauer's writing style, etc. etc. And even though the pictures of Ellen Rimbauer looked too modern to me, the documentary managed to convince me that this was all on the up and up.Now I wouldn't buy this book for 25 cents. Many thanks to all the reviewers who warned me off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I highly recommend this book if you watched Rose Red on tv. It explanes why things happened.

Though the book says fiction it truly is not if you pay attchen to what it is your reading then you'll find clues about its truth indians, gun room, having to always build so spirits stay happy, doors that go no where,paths inside of walls, a fire... Think about it?!?!?!? Its telling the story of Winchester Masion so the story is very real just differnt names and settings, but all in all I would read the book agian. it was the best 18 bucks I've spent on a book in a long time.....P.S. Steven King didn't write the book....It was written and edited by Joyce Reardon Ph.D.(she is real)"},{"rating":"1","title":"prepare to be bored","review":"you would think a diary would contain serious introspection & detailed depictions of personal events. not here. you would think that a tie-in to a ghost story which is supposed to be a ghost story itself would be scary, spooky & spend lots of time detailing supernatural phenomena in depth. not here. here you get boring and repetitive narration full of cliches, & where it touches on the supernatural, it is cliched as well. a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book ever","review":"I love cheddar cheese and bacon bits.

I was thrilled at the idea that an old diary had been discovered that was written by a woman who resided in a haunted house. I read the introduction to the book that was supposedly written by a person researching the strange goings-on in Rose Red. I started reading with great anticipation. As I began to read I wanted to believe that this was the real thing but immediately began to doubt; it didn't seem like a diary at all, but rather a complete novel, which is exactly what it turned out to be.What a cruel hoax. I'm putting the book on the market immediately.I couldn't give it only one star because it is so well written, but the hoax and the tawdry sexual depictions made me despise this book.Mr. King - could you have sold the book without the hoax and the sex?"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is a reason to feel Duped","review":"First of all I did not find this in the \\"fiction section\\" and those of us that don't read a great deal of fiction (I prefer the historial non fiction genre) would have no way to be aware of the fact this was a \\"King\\" fabrication, then to lend authenticity with a bogus web site seems underhanded.

This fictional diary goes into detail of the history and mystery of Rose Red (a haunted mansion in Seattle Wa.) I personally thought that Stephen King wrote it... before I actually read it. After reading it, my impression is that Tabitha King (Stephen's published wife) actually wrote it, with a little input from hubby.This book is a great read stand alone, if you never saw the movie, or it is a great read in concert with the movie. It is pretty accurate in it's descriptions of the late 1800's- early 1900's, and is in a beautifully bound and cut hardcover edition. WELL WORTH THE PRICE!Shawn M. J. Mann"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful, regardless of authorship","review":"We can waste time talking about who really wrote this book, but, frankly, I would remain pseudonymous too if I had written this book. This is a dreadfully tedious novel which contends at its core that it's all about sex, sex, sex. If there are unexplained psychic phenomena, then they must spring from sexual repression. If the main character gains power and confidence, it must be because of good sex. If a house goes bad -- well, must be bad sex. The story moves at a glacial pace, the characters are wooden, and the terrifying cases of disappearance are, well, dull. My advice is to skip this unless you enjoy combing through layers of pseudo-Victorian language to uncover precisely nothing of value."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"what a disappointment this book turned out to be .I had purchased this book thinking that it sounded interesting ( not knowing of the telemovie or of Kings involvment)but as with a lot of new releases the back page is more interesting than the novel.If one was to take out all the unnecessary sexual references there is little left to read.However, this is supposed to be a diary and the personal touches are needed,but I don\`t know many people who include dialogue in their personal diaries! The idea was great but the author failed miserably in trying to sustain any form of suspense or horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definite Page Turner","review":"This book flowed so smoothly I couldn't put it down. Every spare moment I had I was reading this book. I finished it in two days (including working and going to school full-time).

Regardless I enjoyed it. However one thing was most dissapointing - On page 244 of the paperback it says it gives you a special website to read excerpts from the diary not included in the book. However the link is not listed -only the main webpage that includes only generic information and 3 photos (the book says it contained several. Either way I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible. What a disappointment","review":"After getting over the anger and disappointment that this was not an actual diary, but a work of fiction (dispite the fact it was being sold in the non-fiction section of the store) I decided to give it a try, figuring that if Stephen King is involved somehow (and even possibly the original writer) it must be good. What a HUGE mistake. The book was terrible. The plot doesn't flow or grab your attention in any way. The characters (especially Ellen herself) are pathetic and underdeveloped. The actual ghost story of the book isn't even good. It was a complete waste of money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"http://www.thornewoodcastle.com/movie.htm","review":"Does Blair Witch ring a bell?

Otherwise, don't waste the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not worth the money.","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. This is a haunted tale, please. This book should have Fabio on the cover instead. There is nothing scary about this book. If you want to read a better book read Burnt Offerings, or the Other by Thomas Tyron.

Bad, Bad, BAD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Dumb","review":"To start off I was mislead and was told by someone that it is based on a true story. So you can imaged when I started doing research to learn more and found nothing I was pretty disappointed. Non the less, I continued with the book. I found that the book had it's interest moments, but they were few and far between. I was also just as annoyed, as a reviewer had stated before on this site, when looking for the missing excerpts and finding that they were not missing ones but a few pages from the book. This book is clearly not worth the hype or the money to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"rose red","review":"i feel rose red is an excellent book. i highly recommend it to anyone. i saw the movie based on the book and the movie doesn't even compare. however, with reading and seeing the movie i fully understand how ellen felt on a daily basis. the movie does the book no justice. this is one journey that i was glad i took in my mind not in person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upset by Deceptive Synopsis","review":"I am extremely disappointed that the author of this book chose to deceive buyers by pretending that this is a true story. I prefer nonfiction, and purchased this ... book after reading the back review stating that this is a true story about a diary found in Washington. I eagerly read the first chapter, and immediately had serious doubts about the integrity of the author's description. Soon, I realized that the book was a complete fabrication, full of paranormal garbage, and I returned it immediately. I find it strange and sad that the author must lie to the audience to dupe people into buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A house of horrors.","review":"This is an account of a diary, a real one this time. Yet it is not like one you would enjoy as it is so sordid. Ellen relates the deviant behavior she learns from her older, disreputable husband and her unhealthy relationship with her foreign maid.It also shows how a house is constructed against all odds and its deadly consequences. Murders occur which are never explained and people disappear.I want to think that this is a true story, but how could a well brought up woman write such filth? It is not easy to read unless you want voyeur feelings into the lower life of the very rich and the things they can get away with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I found this book interesting and entertaining.

Ellen also takes the reader on a journey that will leave the reader wanting more information on Rose Red."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased!","review":"I think this book was wonderful!! I was unable to put it down and finished in three days. However, I was quite disturbed to read on the internet somewhere that the book was fiction and that Beaumont University does not exist. This information was a little disheartning and I was wondering if anybody knew the truth? Is Ellen Rimbauer's diary a made-up story just to intrigue readers?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Duped? Fiction? Not fiction? Who cares?","review":"I am glad that I read this book before I read the reviews. For awhile I thought it was a true story, but then it seemed to be a cross between \\"The Exorcist\\", the Sara Winchester house, and \\"The Haunting\\". The story itself is chilling, not just the house, but the demise of the marriage between John and Ellen. What is a good story anyway? Do we have to be told in advance that it is true or untrue? I take it for what it was, an enjoyable read, enough that I didn't want to put it down until I finished. I don't think this was written by Stephen King because there was a tender side to it that a female could better understand and describe. Whoever wrote it did a great job and a visit to the website is every bit as interesting as the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Stephen, you've been a bad boy.","review":"I think everyone who has shelled the bucks for the \\"diary\\" and subsequently smelled a rat is taking it pretty well, if these customer comments are any indication. As an ardent student of history, coming face-to-face with and recognizing said rat in the first two pages of the \\"diary\\", I felt as one might upon trying to cash in a phony lottery ticket. Betrayed, angry, cheated, bereft....and then full of admiration for the (----) it takes to construct and pull off a hoax of this magnitude. Paying reader zero, and one for the rat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King's touch","review":"\\"The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer\\" in the early, hardcover edition was placed on the non-fiction shelves of my local library, before it became apparent that this book was part of an elaborate marketing device involving a tv miniseries by Stephen King.The book is a well-written, gripping thriller of the haunted house genre. It appeals to the bodice-ripper-romance women's market, although it is crafted several notches above the average in that niche. Stephen King's touch is apparent, although reading this work did not give me bad dreams as many of his novels have done. I stopped reading them for a time because of that effect.\\"Diary\\" is finely spun, a cotton-candy treat of a suspense novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Illusion","review":"Okay I admit I was suckered in!! The book was absolutely awesome, and I even went so far as to look at the website given in the book for further diary entries. Hmmmm...that's funny, the only section that opens on the \\"university\\" website (where Ms. Reardon is evidently one of 3 professors!!) is the information page for Rose Red. Before I figured that out I actually gave my e-mail address for Ms. Reardon and her colleagues to keep me posted on supernatural occurences in my area. (storm watch for ghosts?? sign me up!) Nonetheless, I was so impressed with the book that it doesn't matter if it's true or not. Although, now I have to cancel my plans for a trip to Washington in hopes of a tour I suppose. Back to the review, this story gets you so involved in the lives of the characters that you actually fear for them (some of them anyway) and you can't stop reading until you see what happens. LOVE IT!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very Haunting tale.","review":"I could not help but see the similarity of this book to Edgar Allen Poe's \\"The fall of the House of Usher\\". A house that seems to be \\"alive\\" and how it controls the life of Ellen Rimbauer, to the point of madness. A very easy read and not boring or dragged out at all. This is a Haunting tale that really keeps you reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree that it wasn't written by Stephen King...","review":"It was probably written by an ABC ghostwriter, to tie in to the Stephen King miniseries coming at the end of January. The plot is a combination of \\"Haunting of Hill House\\", \\"Poltergeist\\", and \\"Amityville Horror\\". I found the diary format plodding, the characters uninteresting, and the emphasis on Ellen & John's sexual problems boring. Read it all the way through hoping it would get better, but it didn't. Would much have preferred a screenplay, like they did with King's \\"Storm of the Century\\". This will be \\"must reading\\" for those who watch the ABC miniseries, but do yourself a favor and buy Shirley Jackson's \\"Haunting of Hill House\\", and the superb 1963 b&w Julie Harris version of the movie \\"Haunting\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"You WILL NOT regret reading this book!","review":"Of every book I have ever picked up, this one left me with more emotional struggle than any!!!

It was a page turner that I was very hard pressed to put down until the less than satisfying end. It gives a lot of history on Ellen, her husband and how she came to be the person she became. It also gives some interesting theories of why Rose Red \\"is who she is.\\" I don't know if I necessarily believe in the paranormal but I would definately not be willing to test any theories by staying in that house!

Unbelievable voice-for a supposed diary of a turn of the century sheltered wife, it winds up resorting to cheap tricks to make any attempt at hooking the reader--her unexpected lesbian yearnings for her assistant, stupid pop culture references to upcoming inventions, etc. Heavy handed. Drawn out. The same story over and over and over again. Pass this one by. It is rare that a television mini series is better than the book, but, in this case, there are few things worse than the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but very slow","review":"The title says it all. This is not a bad book, but extremely slow and hard to get through (at least it was to me). I am not sure to what degree Stephen King is involved with it, but I don't like everything he writes either. I loved Desperation, Black House, Dreamcatcher, and many other of his books. I could hardly get through Hearts in Atlantis and From a Buick 8.

I'd recommend just forgetting about everything you've heard and get down to page-flipping!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Did some checking","review":"I did some checking, read what Stephen King said about writing the screenplay, and I believe he did write the book. It did take a little while before the truth about Bachman was out, and I believe it's the same thing here. There are a few references to Stephen King, such as \\"Poe\\" stories about a girl setting schools on fire and a possessed dog. I don't remember these Poe stories. The reason Stephen King is such a wonderful author is he has been able to write all manner of stories-Delores Claiborne was written from a female perspective, for example. If female authors are able to write from a male perspective, is it so far-fetched to imagine Stephen King writing such a story? Bottom line, I did enjoy the book, can't wait to see the miniseries, and would recommend it to anyone, since it is a fun, easy read. It didn't upset me that it wasn't true, it was just ABC and Stephen King cashing in on the same thing Blair Witch did a few years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"This was truly dreadful.

First of all, it's not silk, it's 100% Viscose, both shell and lining. The quality is therefore stiff and heavy, not light and flowing like I expected. The skirt reeks of plastic. It's actually too heavy for a summer skirt. I am usually a size 6, this one barely fits though it's a size 8, so you have to order at least one size up. The lining seems to be a size smaller than the skirt and fits very tight, clings to hips and legs. On the plus side, the color is nice and vivid, and the embroidered belt is a pretty detail, but all in all I am not very happy with it. It's not too bad a deal for 12 dollar, but it should not be offered as a silk skirt, when it's not silk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Idea Goldmine Without the Volumn Clutter","review":"I use these classic volumes for mining ideas that get me going when I seem to have run dry or have trouble starting.

This was fertile ground and I was excited to get my hands on the book. Unfortunately, while the author is a smart guy dedicated to his craft when it comes to golf he just doesn't get it. He's an author that might as well be talking about the periodic chart of the elements. There's no love of the game or emotional attachment from which John can draw in order to tell these stories. Furthermore, he missed so much of what was happening during this timeframe. I valued to fact that he followed some lesser known fellows... good work there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling","review":"Unlike the author, I'll be concise. The book was rambling, disorganized and lacked structure. There were several memorable anecdotes and one gets a good grasp for the life of a struggling professional golfer. However, Mr. Feinstein was obviously under time pressure to complete the book because it was difficult to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mark Twain said it","review":"You would think from all of the hype over the years that Mark Feinstein uttered the phrase, \\" a good walk spoiled\\".

Feinstein might want to find a ghost writer for his next effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"The PGA Tour in the Mid-Nineties","review":"\\"A Good Walk Spoiled\\" is a very good look at the pre-Tiger PGA Tour. The book relates the events of the 1993 Ryder Cup and the '94 PGA Tour season and profiles many of the big stars that were then on tour. Other issues examined in the book include what life is like on tour, TV contracts, Q-school, and the mental aspects of golf. The book may seem dated to those who began following the tour after Tiger Woods began his career, but most golf fans will find it an interesting piece of the sport's history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the interesting read I expected","review":"It was interesting to learn about life behind the tournament scene but to be honest, this book is way too long and what you gather in the first half is enough. The style of writing lends itself more to reporting of facts than to a dramatic one year in the life of the pga. Since Feinstein constantly jumps from golfer to golfer, I never really get a good sense of characters and personalities - which I think is what makes it interesting. Overall, the book was disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great","review":"This book which as one of the other reviewers mentioned, basically consists of scorecards and mini-bios, but they took the book for what it was publicized to be, not what it is, it is a journey into the PGA Tour and picking out several players to discuss with them golf and life.I liked most of it with the exception of Feinstein sometimes using abbreviations for long phrases. This seemed to me to be a feeble attempt at cleverness, but it just got on my nerves."},{"rating":"2","title":"A chronicle of modern golf without Tiger Woods","review":"This book is an interesting read, written during the 1995 PGA season. The timing of it is such that Tiger Woods hadn't really hit the scene yet. Because of his dominance in golf, the comparisons in the book are really out of date. This is not a reflection on the author, he worked with what he had at the time, and did a splendid job. At that time on the tour, a three win season was a spectacular feat, where now it is not the case any more for the elite players. The game has changed. A lot of the players who got extra attention in the book are still on the scene, and it was interesting to compare the perception of them in the mid-90's to what it is now. Still very much worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Golf Writing at its Best","review":"I have trouble sympathizing with the reader who complained of this book's length. Though it is true that you can't judge a book by its cover, you certainly can tell how thick it is! In my opinion, 500 pages was too few. I could have handled that many more, Fienstien comes close to capturing the essence of the mystery of golf ... and why so many of us are captivated by this frustrating little sport."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leif Garrett is worth the rental fee...","review":"But that's about it. This is a pretty pathetic film. 70's teen idol, Leif Garrett, who is all grown up (And quite nicely, might I add!) stars in this lame horror film that isn't in the least bit horrible! If it scares you...you are probably on Prozac! The plot is, a woman from beyond the grave whispers in people's ears an tries to get them to committ suicide...that's basically it. If you rent this mess and are NOT a Leif Garrett fan, you may end up committing suicide before it ends! Garrett has a look on his face through out the film that says, \\"Why am I in this movie?\\". That's what your fans want to know too, Leif!

I just didn't get the point in this,but Leif did look nice (wow!)and it seems like he added a little flavor to the movie as \\"Mrs. Dash\\" would to bland food.

The will power it takes from the physical, emotional, tactical and political aspects to accomplish this feat is astounding.

I was curious how it would play on the PS2 - which I normally use for action games. I was very pleasantly surprised.The AI is more than solid - it can be downright vicious on the hardest setting. The graphics are great. The voice lines add to the mix - I love the fact that the generals are talking as if they are around a Risk game.The online play is picking up - the game is only just out so it isn't a surprise that it isn't always full. I can often find someone and I bet that after the holidays there will be tons of folks playing.Highly recommended. It is a good change of pace for the PS2.

Are you Kidding Me!!!","review":"I bought this game expecting something similar to the previous playstation version of Risk. Easy playability, easy to understand set up screens... and most of all the ability to choose between increasing sets and fixed sets for the risk cards. Apparently the makers of this game did not see any of these as important especially the last one. How could you make a Risk game that forces you to always play some form of increasing sets? Well This game is going back to the store tonight."},{"rating":"1","title":"UHH THIS GAME IS NOT RISK","review":"OK THIS GAME DOES NOT WORK. THE CARD TRADE-IN CODE IS CORRUPT AND ATARI KNOWS ABOUT IT YET THEY CONTINUE TO SELL IT AT THERE WEB SITE AND IN THE STORES. CARD TRADE-IN IS A STRATIGIC PART OF RISK.

We used to just play the board game but I recently bought this one hoping that it would be a faster alternative...and maybe more fun. But, after playing this at home by myself, I discovered there are far too many bugs in this game to make it playable. On my 3rd game, I beat the game by completing the mission, or so I thought anyway, but then it gave the win to one of the other computer players who I had just annihilated. Also, I don't like the controls...its far too easy to accidentally end your turn or fail to move your troops by hitting the circle key. The designers should have implemented a yes/no command option for this reason. Honestly, I found the old Macintosh Risk computer game made over 15 years ago to be a better version than this one. Looks like i'm going to have to return to the old board game version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Letdown","review":"I love playing Risk. My friends and are fanatical about the Playstation version that was released years ago and is now hard to find. When we heard that there was new version for the PS2 we were so excited we could hardly wait. Oh, the possibilities. New maps, new opponents, new power ups and better music....oh, wait, sorry, someone screwed up. This was perhaps the most disapointed I have been in a long time. This game has less variety than the Playstation one version. No Ultimate Risk? Only one map? My god, no power ups or options. I was imaging things like, historical maps and warring with great leaders, but there is none of that. There are no gaming options. All you can do is play with the dice. That is it. I special ordered this game because no where around where I live was going to get it and I sold it for 3 dollars a week later. If only they would have called and talked to me...I could make a kick ass Risk game. This one sucked."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best strategy games ever!","review":"Unlike other people, my so called \\"dreaded\\" blue disk has never failed. And there are more than one map; try, five or six maps, once you've unlokced them all. The pargment map is the best, and looks the most real. You can speed the game or keep a close watch at the process of all the battles. Although the AI are programmed to do the same thing, you can change the outcomes by mixing the generals and levels of each one. The Game of Risk also offers many uniforms, but has no MExican General or uniform, which has been somewhat dissappointing to me, personally. Overall, this version of the famous game of Risk is one of the best to reach the stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah! The original PS1 version is so much better!","review":"I was really excited to get the PS2 version of Risk. I envisioned an updated ultimate section with new maps and cool ways to customize. I WAS REALLY EXCITED!! The PS2 version is a total wipeout. REALLY LAME!! Just a bunch of boring AI characters. Ohh, special dice! Who cares about what kind of fancy dice you get to watch. That just slows the game even more. Fancy uniform upgrades. Talk about WEAK! Not to mention the flaws with the actual gameplay. Save your money and stick with the PS1 version. Shame on Atari.

It's the kind of easy-to-pick-up-and-browse book that will entertain and inform on a moment's notice. It's accessibility is a positive -- its the kind of book that children can pick up and browse, take in a few vignettes and become attracted to the Revolution at their own pace without the intimidation provided by a more typical history.This is a well illustrated book making good use of period paintings and maps. The side vignettes on break out topics often provide fascinating highlights to the main story. The writing is good, although the amount of information provided classifies this book as an overview. The serious student may want the book for the illustrations, but the words cover the broad sweep of the war at a level they will already be familiar with. These factors make it an excellent introduction to the topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"White oleander","review":"I loved this book.

Just read it!","review":"I am so glad I read this book first. I watched the movie later and was shocked by how horrible it was. I think that is because what makes White Oleander such a wonderful book is Janet Fitch's writing style. She pulls you in and her descriptions are just captivating. The plot is so incredibly depressing but I would read this book again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - A Must Read","review":"I finished reading this book a few weeks ago, and have since recommended it to everyone I can.

A good read till midway though it simply fell apart. Too implausible, the ending seemed like a good reason to throw in some unrelated overglorified instances that had no bearing on Astrid's life. It tried to tie up loose ends but got lost in it's own language. I got bored. I wanted to see a solid ending...this one was not only unthinkable for this girl Astrid that I came to like--but unimaginable, and silly. Oprah, what were you thinking? Just because a story is about an abused foster child doesn't make it a \\"must read\\". Give us something with tooth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adjective abuse in an interesting but unfulfilling story","review":"I must have missed my calling in life if this and Anita Shreve's ,The Pilot's Wife, are examples of publishable writing in the 90s. Both have huge gaps in story and character development. I approached reading each book with anticipation based on Oprah's high praise however I found them to be lacking the in basic requirements of Composition 101. Anyone with a thesaurus could have penned White Oleander. The superfluous use of descriptive phrases and the lack of any caring humanity in this book was annoying and disturbing. Astrid ultimately was as cold and disconnected as her mother but at least we know why,--no mother, father or family--. And in Pilot's Wife that daughter was really cold and unlikable. What's the message here. And where is REALLY good writing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Personally, I don't get it.","review":"I kept waiting to like a character and it never happened.

I was told by everyone that this book was not to be missed...I wish I would have missed it. It was trite, shallow, and predictable. The author used too many adjectives and cliches rather than actual dialogue or meaningful thoughts. I found the ending to be a little too tidy. If you enjoy books in this vein, read \\"She's Come Undone\\" by Wally Lamb instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Hope. Or: Why Oprah Gave It Her Stamp of Approval","review":"Fitch has served the reading public a concoction of heavily steeped oleander.White Oleander is the most poorly written book I've ever read. Period. It seized my throat like a pair of sour pliers and juiced me like a lemon. And the ugliness of its prose made me sob like raw razors. Sadly, Fitch's diction has drifted over the valley of literary art like a vast headache and made people dumb with pain.If you mock my figures of speech, I applaud you. Oleander is overgrown with them. (Incidentally, I pulled these weeds from the fields of White Oleander.)Read this book if you want to expose yourself to today's literary allergens. If it doesn't bolster your appreciation for good writing by way of bad example, nothing will. You may as well read Louis L'Amour backwards and rave about the lyrical dreams of a foster child in search of beauty.Save your money (and health). Don't drink Oleander."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maudlin and ho-hum","review":"I'm trying to figure out why Oprah said this was the best book of the year. If you want a soap-opera story with no redeeming ending, you might like this. It certainly isn't 'spirit uplifting'. We all have 'our' story which was a childhood of abuse, mistreatment, molestation, etc. Some of us don't want to replay the past. If you are into victimization of self, read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy and overly dramatic","review":"As a first novel, I applaud the writer. I found it difficult to understand the character's choice at the end, it seemed obscure and self-hating. Janet Fitch's descriptions are over labored, don't flow from the heart, most of her descriptions seem to be heady...I don't think the writer was involved with her main character, Astrid. Good descriptions of Los Angeles...metaphors were overused and narrative did not get to the point..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Oprah Blabber","review":"This story drones on just as many of Oprah's others. Typical dysfunctional people trapped in their dysfunctional lives. How depressing. I debated whether to fnish this story, and had a hard time getting myself motivated enough to pick it up to complete. I am definitely not a prude, but found the explicit sex nauseating, shocking and unnecessary to get the story across. I read probably a book a week and count numerous other reads that were better written."},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting and compelling account of foster care","review":"This book moves me to want to \\"right\\" the \\"wrongs\\". You believe every bit of what this child goes through and I couldn't turn pages fast enough.

A great read and a great motivator to reach out and help someone today..even in the smallest way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I am a voracious reader, you name it I've read it, so for me to say a book is amazing, well, says a lot. I even saw the movie first, but that didn't ruin it for me, but only allowed me to picture the characters, and here there voices in my mind.The book is an artisitc masterpiece, beautiful and engrossing. I was actually sad when I finished, wishing there was more. The writing is absolutely enchanting and the characters,magnetic. Donot let this book slip by."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page turner!","review":"This was one of these books that I was pretty sure I wasn't going to like; I tend to be a bit snobbish about the Oprah picks. However, this book was a wonderful read with vivid characterizations that have really stayed with me. The heroine really grows as the story moves along, and the way her understanding of her completely self-absorbed mother develops and changes is very interesting and realistic. Her travels through the child foster care system are pretty harrowing, but what really engaged me was that even as a young girl she was a strong character, even when she was a \\"victim\\" she somehow wasn't - she was a real survivor. She just rang true to me. I loved this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enduring, Keeps you wanting to read!!","review":"This book was by far one of my favorite books that i have ever read. Astrid is a very unigue character and anyone could find something about her to relate to. White Oleander takes you from a girl lost in the world with her scicotic mom to many different foster moms and houses along the way. This book is a journey through life and really teaches you a lot about the way things are in this world and just how messed up people can really be. One thing i definately learned from this book was to be thankful for what I do have and don't take things for granit because one day they could be gone. I would suggest this book to any one who has ever been lost in the world and just not knowing what to do and i am sure that everyone has felt like this one time or another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readable but soapy, a nice beach book, maybe.","review":"Not as well written as I'd like, with kind of dull descriptions. It's a chronicle of a girl's experience in foster homes, after her mother murders a boyfriend for a bad breakup. Other reviewers have mentioned that the narrative voice is not convincing as coming from a teenaged girl. I have to agree. Also, the ending was forced and saccharine. I thought, after all that, that there would be some lingering damage, but no, the perky heroine lifts herself up and is apparently fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Janet Fitch is an excellent author. In White Oleander, Astrid seems to be alive, youcan feel her feelings, understand her pain, and even care about herlife chalenges. I have never read a bookthat was so amazing. I didnt want the book to end, unlike most books that i have read. The problems she faces like foster homes, being attacked, missing her mother, and even losing a simple bottle of perfume, made me want to cry. This book was amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't see the movie. Read the book.","review":"I finished this book in an afternoon. I loved it so much I then got out the DVD.

I wanted a great book to bring with me. I caught the Oprah show where she raved and raved about this book. I had to have it. The first week of my honeymoon was pretty much laying around the pool reading this gawd awful miserable book, the second week I didn't even touch it. I depressed me too much. I agreed with Oprah that the writing was really really superb. I enjoyed Janet Fitch's descriptive writing. That was the only thing that kept me attracted to the book. About a month after my honeymoon I finished the book, just because I wanted to see how it ended, hoping for somewhat of a happy ending. What a dissapointment. Absolutely gloomy. Maybe I live in a fantasy world, but I at least expect a happy ending. Sorry Oprah, I have to dissagree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say 'Letdown'?","review":"Hmmmmm. I'm still scratching my head over this one...I feel so disappointed and cheated, and I'm trying to understand what everyone else saw in this book.

Let's see, murder, underage sex, beautiful of course, shootings, mauled by dogs, suicide. What next, kidnapped by terrorists? White slavery?. Pretentious Ingrid to make us take it seriously. Huge plotpoints with minimal impact on the characters, little meaning. Would work better as soap opera or Jackie Collins; there wouldn't be the assumption that this is \\"literature.\\" You have to wonder about publishing criteria.

Throw in child abuse with father figures, verbal abuse with foster families, attempted murder, and dog attacks. Every character is extreme, every situation is extreme. There is no balance. Then after building to a climax with all these extreme characters and extreme events, all loose ends are tied up in a hurried few pages. The end result is an unsatisfying book. And the reader is left asking why. Why did I buy this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much","review":"I usually don't read Oprah book club selections. I find they are too much in the \\"triumph of the human spirit\\" mode to appeal to me. However I had heard this book described else where as \\"dark\\". So, I figuired I'd give it a try. This book is overwrought, over written and pretty much, just too much. There are some good elements in the writing and in the story, but they are buried in an avalanche of metaphor and melodrama. A more experienced writer may have pulled off the effect the writer seems to be going for- but the result here is just heaviness."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept waiting for something positive to happen to Astrid","review":"I have never finished a book I didn't like, until now. The only reason I stuck with it was because I was certain that something good, or positive, or uplifting was going to happen. I was sure that this girl was going to \\"rise from the ashes\\". Instead she stuck to a miserable life of uncertainty and poverty. I don't think she is a survivor. Instead she is just surviving."},{"rating":"1","title":"wate of time","review":"The first few pages had so many metaphors, I nearly didn't turn anymore pages. About 3/4 of the way through the book, I wondered why I was turning the pages and just stopped. Total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good","review":"I'm afraid I didn't like it at all. The dialogue between the the various Viking warriors was completely contrived and sophmoric. The battle sequences started off well but became boring rather quickly. Warrior-Chief Johannson's final monologue as he was succumbing to his wounds is, no doubt, the stupidest piece of writing ever published in the history of English-language literature. The author was trying to create an epic but only managed to produced an epileptic fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a chick book","review":"I'm the type of person that if the first few pages don't grab me, I'm not going to be motivated to read it. White Oleander did grab me, and with all of its poetic phrases and analogies it is the epitome of a book written for and by a female.

I can't believe Oprah recommended this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time, not even one star","review":"This book is probably the most over-rated book I've ever read in my entire life. The narration is corny and painfully slow. I didn't feel sympathy for ANY of the characters in the story, especially the \\"protagonist\\" who has nothing to show for herself except that she is physically beautiful and seems to take on the attitude of blaming the way she is on her circumstances. I didn't see any fortitude of character or any flawed yet empathy-inducing streak in Astrid or Ingrid. The whole time I was reading the book, I was wondering why the author even bothered to write about such ordinary characters and the ordinary things they do. We can get that from real life. I got the sense that the author was trying very hard to forge them into tragically flawed heroines rather unsuccessfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but this book was not a hit but a MISS.","review":"I think this was a book that had a lot of potential, but failed to come through. The interesting plot was plagued by excessive metaphorical and descriptive language. I found Astrid's internal dialogue to be a bit vapid and difficult to get through without boredom taking over. Although the characters had depth, I did not find myself invested in them. Maybe it's my instinct to being drawn to strong female characters, but nevertheless I did not enjoy the endless amount of weak female characters that allowed men to take over their mental and physical health. Astrid was an exception, as she was strong enough to break from her mother's hold. Fitch's writing style is irritating, as it seems as if she's trying to hard to impress readers with flowery language. It wasn't a terrible book, but I don't believe it deserved all the praise it received."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was great!","review":"This book has so much action!

This book is about a goofy mother and her goofy daughter's relationship with each other. The mother committed murder so the daughter was put into foster care and lives with a variety of goofy people. I won't tell you how it ends because I don't want to spoil it for you. I found it to be pretty unbelievable and exaggerated, but maybe that's just me. Not one I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"The movie was decent, but I hated the book. Catastrophe after catastrophe piled up, it was like standing on a bridge during rush hour watching a huge traffic accident. Maybe I was spoiled by seeing the movie first, but the book seemed dull (even with all the problems and violence) in comparison. Try as I might, I just could not see what was supposed to be so uplifting about the book. In real life, Astrid would probably be in much worse shape - even if she had her art - after going through so much trauma. Even \\"parental kids\\" need a bit of stability somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"If you've seen the movie, trust me it did not do justice to this book! Some of the most interesting plot lines were not included in the movie. The book is very interesting, I could not put it down. With a touch of fatal attraction and mommy dearest the character of the mother will make you want to find out how while in prison she continues to control the life of her teenage daughter. A very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHITE OLEANDER","review":"White Oleander, is one of the most captivating novels I have had the pleasure to read. Astrid, a stranded, young girl is left in foster care when her haunting and poisonous mother is put in prison for murder. As Astrid travels from foster home to foster home without the one thing she has grown to know and be, her mother, she realizes how trapped she really was. Astrid learns what it is to be frree and who she really is. I truly think that this is one of the most heartwrenching novels I have ever read. I think this novel gives you a better idea of how lucky we all are to have what we have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"I must confess,I am not an avid reader. I picked up this book to read on an airplane and could not put it down. I was a little hesitant to purchaset it and did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did. I was vacationing in Playa del Carmen at the time and was surprised to have that exact location mentioned specifically in the text, in one of Astrid's memories.. I looked forward to reading this book from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very over-rated tale.","review":"I agree 100% with the reviewers who found this book silly, filled with transparent melodrama and feeble development in plot and characterization. I suggest you take the advice of the many reviewers of this book and read something worthwhile like THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, or if Oprah books are your only fictional desires, MOTHER OF PEARL, or I KNOW THIS MUCH IS TRUE."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is very depressing and not very realistic.","review":"I found myself continuing to read this book just hoping something better would come along. The longer I read, the worse it got. At the end of the book, I got the feeling the author just got tired of writing and just stuck something in so it could be over. It could have been salvaged with a better conclusion. Oprah, try harder next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written & hits the mark","review":"If you are someone who has a difficult and conflicted relationship with a parent, this is the book for you! Astrid shows remarkable maturity and insightfulness through her mother's imprisonment and is SO powerful when she begins releasing her anger! I was a tad disappointed in the ending, more because I was hoping for a more powerful end to this powerful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent and poetic piece of fiction","review":"This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. I thought it was poetic and lyrical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story but poor writing","review":"I found the concept to be interesting and in the hands of a more experienced writer, it could have been much better. I found many grammatical errors, syntax errors, glaring continuity errors, and sloppy punctuation. Where were the editors on this one? It ruined the book for me...I felt as if I were reading a book written by someone without a high school education."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy handed , tasteless","review":"Heavy handed Anne Rice style prose, dripping with ersatz sensuality and crude sensationalism. Really seemed forced and base."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book just seemed devoid of plot.","review":"The book is so artfully constructed to say absolutely nothing new or different.

On to JUNK for summer reading.."},{"rating":"1","title":"It started out good...","review":"It started out cool and calm, like still water, but after Ingrid was put in jail, the book went downhill. Some parts of it were so slow and unmoving i wanted to stop. It disgusted me. But the book was like a drug, i wanted to go back and finish the rest of it. See what would happened to Astrid. And figure out what she wanted from life. The way the author strung the words together was elaborate. Otherwise i probably wouldn't have finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning debut novel","review":"In WHITE OLEANDER, Janet Fitch has crafted a beautifully written, unforgettable novel about the search for self and love, and the painfully poisonous relationship between a mother and daughter. If you are looking for something substantial to read, please put this book at the head of your list."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a book I read without realizing I was reading.","review":"Each page of this book painted a picture. While not realizing I had read a single word, my mind focussed on pictures both terrible and disturbing on every page. It was a book I could not bear to read and could not bear to put down. There is hardly a day that some scene from this book does not appear in my mind's eye. I eagerly await her next endeavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does anyone need an almost new book?","review":"I started this book and simply couldn't finish it. I kept imagining the mother to look like Glen Close in Fatal Attraction (her actions were even more far fetched). I have read lots of \\"dark\\" books but this one held no attraction for me. I simply didn't care for the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read in a long time","review":"Although this book could have been depressing because of the subject matter, Janet Fitch choose to portray the experiences of this young woman through beauty and humor and human introspection. Her use of words and descriptions are phenomenal. I literally couldn't put the book down. When I finished, I looked at my surroundings in a different light. I highly recommend this book to anyone who needs a lift, or needs a charge in their life."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books of the year","review":"The writing is superb-Astrid is an amazing character. I read 1-2 books per week and thought the writing was as good as I have read this year. Thanks Oprah-I want good books-nothing silly or simple like the Pilot's Wife. We can find those books on any best seller list."},{"rating":"1","title":"What ?","review":"This is the most over-rated book I've ever read. It can't hold a candle to \\"The Triumph and the Glory\\" or \\"The Reader\\" or \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" or \\"The Testament\\" or any of another dozen fine novels out this summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a bore","review":"I bought this book because most of the books Oprah has recommened have been very good. This one however left me wanting much more. \\" Why\\" thats what I wanted to know. Why did Astrid's mother mistreated her so badly? What happened in her life to make her the kind of evil woman she was. Why if Astrid's birth was planned why wasn't she maternal toward her.? Was it because her husband lost interest so that gave her the right to neglect and dislike Astrid? What's going on? Didn't care for this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIQUID POETRY, YES I DO BELIEVE","review":"When Oprah said that this book was \\"Liquid Poetry\\" I thought that I should go out and buy the book, since it had been a long time since I'd picked up a good book to read. I think she was right. The book encaptured you from the moment it started. It was very intersting to watch Astrid (the main character) grow throughout the book. My only complaint was the ending. I felt it was a little short, leaving me with a \\"now what happens\\" kind of a feeling. Pick it up though, I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair but boring at times.","review":"The story starts out slow and eventually gets interesting only to become dull at the end. The story dragged on at times and I was waiting for something to happen. It seems to me that the author could have told the same story in half the number of pages. Not a book I would highly recommend and I was surprised Ophrah recommended it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fitch writes in mirror-stricken words","review":"Janet Fitch is a beautiful writer. Her characters are real, jumping off the page and into the reader's soul. All her characters share thoughts readers may have had at sometime. Fitch opens minds to new thoughts. Her main character, Astrid, is a dynamic character who slowly grows stronger through the play of the book. The strange relationship between Astrid and her mother is beautifully sad. Fitch accomplishes greatness in White Oleander."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Oleander","review":"I bought this book, then it sat on my shelf for over a year. I couldn't even remember what the jacket said it was about. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. Although other reviewers found it to be farfetched in some instances, I found it believable. The foster care system in this country is quite lacking. Although this book was fiction, I've heard worse stories that were true.I really tend to enjoy books where girls grow up in these less than ideal situations, but instead of losing their sanity, they somehow survive and thrive. They become very self-sufficient and strong women. The mother in this story is also incredibly complex. At some points I found myself liking her, then in others I couldn't stand her for the poor choices she made and the manipulation of her daughter.I'll be excited to hear from this author again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whit Orleander: by Janet Fitch","review":"Wow! This book was intense! A little depressing but so engrossing and well written that I was willing to suffer the blues for this great find!"},{"rating":"2","title":"White Oleander","review":"I wasn't looking forward to reading this book at first. I went to the bookstore to buy something else, but I'm thrilled that they were sold out of the other book. This is the most beautiful piece of fiction I have read in a long time. The character Astrid is so real, raw. The way she changes, her emotions swing, and the pure artistry of her voice is amazing. Each charcter has a distinct voice, which is rare for modern day writers to pull off. Also, Astrid's blossoming through her sexual experiences, pains, love and observance of human nature is gripping and touching. I loved everything about this book, the vivid descriptions, the painful beauty in everything. A must read for men and women alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic yet disappointing","review":"I found this book to be very beautiful, and poetically written. I believe the author put a lot of detail and work into this novel with her descriptive words. I feel that it it was an informative story of one child's life as she grew up in a cruel system. Yet, as a fosterparent I was very disappointed in the portrayal of fosterparents and the representation of the caseworkers and other individuals who are involved in caring for children while they are in fostercare. With many professions, there are individuals who should not be in the type of work they are in. Yet, for the many who devote their time, patience, heart and families to such a demanding career, it is often degrading to us as foster parents who do our utmost to help neglected, abandoned or abused children. When only negative situations are portrayed in the media, it gives society a distorted view of all foster homes and cripples our reputation as meaningful assets to the world of lost and forgotten children."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was fascinated, why would Ophra narrate such trash?","review":"I would be more careful about Ophra\\"s recommdations. I bought the taped book, by the third tape I pulled my car over and threw it out the window It sounded like the Saturday nite news that happened to six people. Do the people really need this trash to be entertained?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks true grit","review":"Let me caution you....this books runs a distant third to a luke warm bath with NO bubbles. It drones on and on and weighs the reader down with teenage self pity. The mother in this story is truly egocentric and pitiful with her \\"poetic banterings.\\" I kept reading it, hoping for a light at the end of the long, dreary tunnel...there was none.....don't waste your precious time on this foolishness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish prose","review":"At some point, Janet Fitch must have taken a creative writing class that urged students to cram an awkward simile into every single sentence. For example, when one character tosses a pen to, she writes \\"The pen stuck in the tabletop like a javelin.\\" I tried tossing a pen across the room to see if this comparison fit. Sure enough, my little ball-point grew to the size of a telephone-pole and smashed through the table's surface, sticking out at a crazy angle. I had never noticed that phenomenon before. Kudos to Janet Fitch for her keen powers of observation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A promising beginning but after that...","review":"not so much. I was intrigued by the characters at first and the idea that the mother would actually murder this man. For some reason, maybe because the prose was so whimsical and romantic, I thought perhaps Ingrid wouldn't get caught. Of course she does, which leaves us with Astrid.Astrid on her own is a lot less compelling. I find it strange that during this coming-of-age story the changes in her body, a normal part of adolescence, are never once mentioned. She has no qualms about pregnancy even though she, if I recall correctly, engages in unprotected sex a number of times.I guess I just wasn't too interested in her. This book was highly recommended but I was quite disapointed in it. I'm glad I got it from the library. Listening to it on tape eased the pain somewhat because if I fell asleep I didn't miss much."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Oleander","review":"Janet Fitch has made a grand entrance for her first novel. I must admit I couldn't put it down but I did find a few faults in the writing. First off she is too wordy, I found myself skipping over many of the adjective loaded prose to get to the meat of the novel. It was a little hard to get started but once Astrid's mother met Barry the novel picked up. The tragedy of the story is very believable, following poor Astrid through a Foster Care System that is exactly how I've heard it can be. This story carries you along at a fast pace, once you get past all the overly descriptive wording, and the ending leaves you flat! She wrote this great tragic story with no ending. It just fizzles out, what was the point? I felt cheated due to the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I'd give this no star if I could. I can't believe Oprahrecommended this book getting the National Book Award. The story isvery boring and slow moving. The prose is hardly lovely. And the characters don't undergo any great change by the end- esp. the mother/daughter dilemma. Is that really resolved as is written? If you want a languid book with 'liquid poetry' with a slow moving story that you can't put down, then read Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha. Or The Grapes Of Wrath. Or The God of Small Things Or Moghul Buffet by Cheryl Benard. This book is a sheer waste of time. I can't emphasize that enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISSAPOINTING AND DEPRESSING","review":"I tried to read this book, and I hated it. It was so depressing and too melodramatic, and far fetched. Ingrid goes through a string of foster homes with all strange characters. The writing is too poetic and the story is depressing and boring with too many holes in it. It made you feel sad when you read it. It belongs in a soap opera. Hated this book. I don't know why Oprah picked this one since it's so terrible. LOSE THIS BOOK and SAVE YOUR MONEY and it's way too long also."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star only because she finished it.","review":"you asked we not be profane or obscene even tho. the book was. Miss winfrey said it was the best bookshe ever read. I should have sent her a sympathy card. she surely didn.t mean it. I gave my copy to the local library. I didn,t want in my collectionbe careful who reads it if you have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"one star is one star too many for this","review":"I read the first 41 pages of White Oleander & decided to give up, it was so boring. The language was not appealing or descriptive, more like excess baggage---get to the point! I could not care for the mother or daughter character at all. They seemed so distant & apathetic to their own lives. I have read many of Oprah's picks & this one was a huge disappointment, as was River Cross My Heart. Guess I'll read Tara Road again."},{"rating":"1","title":"great book.","review":"This book is amazing.

Amazing. It will haunt you for a very, very long time. Read it at least twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb writing leaves the reader wondering what happens next","review":"Janet Fritch's tale of life in America's foster child care system is breathtakingly colorful. My mind was kept busy with the descriptions of life through Astrid's eyes. The writing played on my emotions and made me feel like I was Astrid, feeling what she must have felt, and wondering how it must be to not know what life was going to hand you for a challenge from minute to minute. As you read this book, you want to reach out to Astrid and let her know that life isn't always this complicated, or unfair. For many people this story will make you appreciate the finer things in your life. Excellent, excellent, excellent!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start weak ending","review":"I really enjoyed the begining of this book. I thought the first part of the novel had a good story and was touched by Astrid's problems.However, by the time she entered the third home the story became another typical Oprah novel. The imagery becomes syrupy and forced and the end once again glorifies marginality.More problematic is the charcters transformations. Fitch does not potray the evolution of these charcters in a belivable manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing--is this what we want for our daughters?","review":"I expected something worth reading when this book was recommended by Oprah. I've read several Oprah selections and now think Oprah ought to stick to talking and forget about reading. This book was a failure. When are novelists going to stop giving us poor, abused, downtrodden, children as heroines? Do they think all of America is sexually active at age 12 or 14? I won't be taking any of Oprah's recommendations in the future. If you enjoy incest, child abuse, violence, depression, suicide, and adultery--all from a child's perspective--you will love this book. Otherwise, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still wondering why I bothered!","review":"I decided to start keeping up with the Oprah books because there were so many that she had picked that I thought we worthwhile. The Pilot's Wife was very good and I also enjoyed \\"What looks crazy on an Ordinary day.\\" But this book I must admit was really super horrible. I am usually pretty open minded about books that I have read but this one was by far the worst book I have ever read. I was so confused that it was a struggle to finish the book. I have a theory that if I wait long enough something will come up that will keep me reading the book. Sad to say I think I wasted a lot of my time on this book. I had to laugh because I don't believe there is anyone in this life that talks the way Ingrid does. I was waiting for something wonderful to happen to Astrid but was sadly dissapointed when it didn't. I think Oprah needs to start picking some books that can be uplifting without being so tragic. I look forward to reading the new one and hope it is better than this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and dangerous..handle with caution..","review":"the people in this book are DANGEROUS!!!! no really!!! Ingrid ( the mom) is scary as hell and Astrid (her daughter) is pretty weird. very erotic novel. oh yeah there's obsessive love and possibly murder (gasp!) nothing really goes right for poor little Astrid who goes from family to family as her mother is in Jail and can no longer take care of her. Did mommy ever love her?? Did mommy ever kill that foolish man??? Who IS Astrid?? Where's her daddy???? these are the questions the book poses. very good. i encourage you read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"A beautifully written novel! Fitch's best work yet! This novel shows what it is like for a child in a foster home, not only the lifestyle, but also the mental damage that is caused. A young girl is forced to survive without birth parents; she believed her mother to be an amazing woman and she looked up to her. Only after her mother being thrown in jail for murder of and ex lover, did she realize that her mother was the enemy. This was a memorable book, and it is one of those can't put it down kind of stories. Fitch shows how you never know the truth about something or someone until you are forced to live without it. This book explores issues such as sexual, mental, and physical abuse. The young girl finds herself in many difficult situations and grows a little more with each one. Fitch is a great writer and this book is a must read!JF"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too easy to put down...","review":"If you have limited reading time and you have read every Oprah book, this is perfect for you. I found this book too easy to put down... easy to only read on weekends. I was relieved when it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like the genre","review":"I think the reason I did not like this book is because I don't like the genre - alternative hippies or poor trashy people mad at society, always assuming any sort of conformity is evil and wasting all their lives trying to \\"find themselves\\". The writer seems to be very talented and if you don't mind these type of characters, I'm sure it's an excellent book. But with the exception of the little girl, who I'll only hope grows up to not be like her mother, that's the setting. I ready about 50 pages and think I'll just move on to something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"This book is easy to put down. There is no excitment or any anticipation in it. It is a well written B O R E ,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet Fitch \\"Make(s) Magic\\"","review":"This is not an uplifting novel, but it is a beautiful one; America's first compelling tragedy of the Digital Age, it is the antithesis of L.M. Montgomery. Astrid Magnussen is the most convincing anti-hero of literature since Nabokov's Humbert Humbert, and Fitch's critical stance toward contemporary American life is as timely and valid. \\"White Oleander\\" is American myth, flipped; justice, beauty, perserverance, success, triumph, even survival are shown to be dreams of the entitled classes. As poetic and murderous as the ancient Norse Valkyries. Don't pass this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"From an avid reader","review":"This book is simply amazing. I read on average 3 books a week and I was so engrossed in this one that I read it all in one night. It is written so beautifully that I fell in love with the descriptions, which were so vivid, that one can smell the violet perfume, see the blooms of white oleander, smell the fires, feel the pain. I couldn't put it down. What a truly incredible and moving story. I recommend it to everyone I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book first then watch the movie!!","review":"Movies rarely make exactly like a book, and this is no exception, but I think that in order to get a glimpse into the meaning of the movie the book has to be read first. First, Michelle Pfieffer is a dead ringer of her character, Ingrid. It took some patience for me to get through the whole book because everything is very descriptive from the weather, to the the places, to the characters, and especially to the feelings and thoughts of Astrid. This book gives insight into the foster system and how it shapes a person. One doesn't have control of where they might live from day to day and whether or not they might eat. But its also about the bond of a mother and daughter, one that is hard to break or sometimes to even bend. Its about control and the consequences of your choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda disapointed","review":"Oprah raved so much about this book on her show, that I couldn't wait to get it. True it was very poetic and lyrically beautiful, but that was all it was. The story itself was nothing new, and that was disapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I'm still reading this book. It did start out slow, but has since picked up. I am enjoying reading this book and can't wait to see how it ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"I absolutely love this book. I read the entire thing in one day. It is beautifully written - like a long poem. The author's use of metaphors is frequent, but they never become sickening. They are so beautifully written that I was in awe of her abilities. Not only is the book very well-written, but the story is captivating. I was able to identify with both Astrid and her mother in various ways. Although the story did not end how I had wished, I was able to find a lot of hope in it as well as wisdom that I intend to apply to my own life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better the Second Time","review":"I read White Oleander twice. The first time I really appreciated the insight Fitch seemed to have into the minds of foster kids. After the movie came out, I read it again, and was impressed as much by the poetry in her writing. I highly recommend it. I'd also suggest it as a good choice for mature teens.

I am an English Literature major and by the fourth chapter I felt ashamed to be reading this book. If you like the writings of V.C. Andrews you will probably love this book. I can't for the life of me understand what people see in it. The writing is drippingly sentimental and the plot is like something off of a daytime soap opera, only worse. I wish Oprah would recommend truly good writers rather than brainwashing people into believing this kind of trash is great literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oleander Schmoleander","review":"I can not tell you how much I disliked this book! It wasn't so much the narrative that I disliked, but the actual plotline. I found myself thinking that the main character was overdramatized and boring.

I really wanted to see how it would end and felt that it was building to this big surprise ending. For instance, all of a sudden Astrid remembers this girl Annie but can't remember much about her. And then there's the loose ends with her father. I didn't feel satisfied with how those issues were resolved. I felt cheated. And, Fitch uses too many similies. After reading this book and Memoirs of a Geisha (which I truly did like) I wonder if authors think they aren't good writers unless they fill their books with loads of similies. It gets tiring and distracting!

I loved Astrid, but felt her character inconsistent, even for a teenager. I loved Ingrid, but didn't get enough of her to improve this read. Everyone else was just a flash in the pan of dark decaying life. There is so little beauty in this book. Astrid becomes so scarred, both emotionally and physically, that the puny ending hardly could be interpreted as a triumph. I had hoped the movie would redeem the book, and aside from a stellar cast, it too was a great disappointment in unfulfilled potential. To Janet Fitch: this had all the makings of a legendary Mother-Daughter journey, but lacked sincerity and true depth of character. I'm very glad that others had a better interpretation, but as much as I tried to love this book, I just could not."},{"rating":"2","title":"realistically thought-provoking","review":"I do believe that this was one of the most beautiful books that I have ever read. As the story unfolds you begin to feel the emotions of Astrid as she travels from one home to another. You celebrate in her joys and are deeply saddend in her despair. Her journey will make you laugh and cry simultaneously as if you were right there with her. The plot will captivate you from page one until you finally finish. However you musn't completely go by what I say, pick up a copy for yourself and see what you think!"},{"rating":"1","title":"White Oleander","review":"I didn't like this book.

I have cried for her, laughed for her and have been mad at her adn have loved her like a part of my own family. Twelve year old, Astrid Magnussen is forced to go through the foster home system when her self centered mother comits murder to her ex boyfiend. Astrid, who go throughts the next six years of her teen life incounters many new people who leave you all full of emotion. This is a great book for anyone who has never experienced this or who can relate. It has truly made me look at life in a different light."},{"rating":"2","title":"page turning poetry","review":"I'll never forget Astrid and her mother. What a magnificent feat to bring these people to the page. I'm an author of young adult books, myself, and plan to order Janet Fitch's Y.A. novel, entitled KICKS. She obviously knows about the heart of a teenager. And also looking forward to reading her next book. And the next and the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty, coming-of-age story","review":"The protagonist of White Oleander, Astrid, becomes very real for the reader. She is put in impossible situations and does the best that she can. Watching her grow and come to terms with her mother and herself was inspiring. Her decision that comes at the end of the book is a brave one and shows that she has become the kind of woman that her mother always spoke of, but never was herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"So pretentious...","review":"Although I'm not done with the book yet, so far I would like to second the comments of the reviewer below. Ingrid belongs in a bad melodrama"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have rather poked my eye out with a sharp stick.","review":"I thought this book was one of the most depressing books I have ever read (and I have read a few). The writing style was elegant and poetic, but the story was extreme and contrived. The only reason I kept reading was to see what other horrific event would befall the protagonist. By the end of the book I was ready to get a gun and shoot her myself just to put her out of her misery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your average summer beach read","review":"This book is enjoyable not only because of the detailed descriptions which the author helps to paint a picture in your mind, but the story is absolutely engrossing. The characters in the book are well-developed and the situations are completely illustrated through words. I would tend to recommend this book for women over men, as the situations the main character faces can more easily be recognized by a female audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"What happens next?","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. Very well written, touching story, although it felt like the author was rushing at the end, like someone trying to meet a deadline. Astrid's mother had the power to hypnotize, control her daughter all her life. Even from behind bars, with long accusing letters of judgement on what her daugther was doing, who her daughter was with making a 13 year old even more fragile than all kids are at this age. She did all she could to lower her daugther's self esteem, her sense of self. Astrid made it through 6 foster homes after being shot, starved and hurt. Astrid did find herself, first by wanting to just be a survivor then by becoming a fighter. I would love to know what happens next...?"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FIRST EFFORT","review":"Ms. Fitch paints Los Angeles and the many disjointed lives that reside in it as well as James Ellroy. I was particularly taken with the narators search for her identity through those who surrounded her. a good read that left me wanting to know more about Astrid."},{"rating":"2","title":"An astounding book, compulsively readable.","review":"This s a GREAT book, highly reccomended. The language is somewhat startling, somewhat enthralling, and Astrid is probably one of the most memorable characters to come out of modern literature. Run out and buy this one now, you will not be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"WELL-WRITTEN BUT DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH LIKE I DID","review":"I like the way she writes; however it is difficult to believe that all foster homes are that bad. I didn't like the ending either; maybe too much time spent on the poetry (got long).It was a depressing book. I can't believe Oprah talked so highly of it. I'm glad I didn't buy it just borrowed from library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensively bad","review":"This book makes me ashamed to be female. It is a perfect example of character-as-accumulated trauma. Like, the part where Astrid gets attacked by dogs? Come ON. Someone send Oprah a copy of the Crying of Lot 49 already. That has a tortured female heroine too; maybe she'll dig it. Know that I would never have read this book unless forced."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Weep For The People Who Consider This Good Literature.","review":"I can't believe the follow-the-leader style in which these reviews were written. This book is a waste of paper, ink, and time. For those of you who are impressed, try reading some REAL literature for a change. Sure, compared to all of those \\"novels\\" that feature Fabio on the cover, this book was a change. However, to an educated reader, this garbage doesn't fool anyone. This was fluff... boring and dreary fluff. If someone out there said, \\"Sure, it's fluffy, pretty writing, but I liked it anyway... \\" that is at least respectable. But calling it great literature? Being \\"shocked\\" that others can find fault with the author, or even worse, the queen of queens, Oprah? Having your own talk show does not an appreciation of fine literature make.If it is so good, why do I feel like a fool for having purchased it after I read it? I can't wait to give it away, hopefully to never lay eyes on it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a dissappointment","review":"I have read three of the Oprah bookclub books and won't read another. White Orleander was something I kept reading thinking it would have some redeeming value otherwise Oprah wouldn't have stamped her approval to it. I heard some reviews and women raved about how the author opened their eyes to look at the world differently. To me, their coments were like saying a porno wasn't so bad because it had good music. The book was tasteless. The topic was not uplifting at all, there was no social value to be gained. It was trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"It goes into the trash.","review":"Pelple may have to live this way but I feel dirty reading it. I should have stopped sooner but keep thinking there is some redeeming qualities to find. I am almost finished and have found none so far. I wonder if I am alone in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books i have ever read","review":"I think that White Oleander deals with many situations that people often hear about but don't pay much attention to because the problems are so common. White Oleander puts Astrid in these situations and shows how awful life can be for so many people. I couldn't put the book down because I have never read about life portrayed in that way. I loved this book and I think Opera recommended this book because it realisticly shows the foster care system and what life is like for alot of people today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, even better book","review":"I saw the movie first, and loved it. My friend insisted I read the book, claiming it was a lot better. Well, she was pretty much right. The book develops the characters a lot more, and goes into more detail about more of Astrid's foster homes. Marvel and Amelia aren't even mentioned in the movie, and the ending was different. I really liked the character of Olivia as well. She learns different things in each foster home, and her character changes so much throughout the novel. It is very well-written. The only part of the novel that is bad is that Oprah Winfrey reads in on the audio tape, and frankly, it would be really unnerving to hear her say those sorts of things. But that doesn't mean I don't recommend it. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read.","review":"I read this book in a matter of a few days. I thought the storyline was wonderful. After talking to many of my friends who had been through the foster system, it felt like they were telling me there life story just with different charactars and different times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure magic....","review":"Janet Fitch has written the most inspiring, beautiful, magically written book i have ever read.\\"White Oleander\\" is my favorite book, i haven't read a book so cleverly written for ages, she is truely a gifted soul.white Oleander tells a story of a young girl 's life and the many disturbing and difficult situations she endures.You will fall in love with Astrid the main character and find it hard to come up with a wrod for her mother, you will feel through this storytelling how it feels to be Astrid, this book will grab at you and it won't let you forget, i loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a real life story, sad, but totally believable.","review":"In one way, I found this book sad and depressing, but in another way, uplifting because of how the human spirit can endure and even thrive under terrible circumstances. I thought it was a fabulous story and could not put it down. Made me aware of how many children like Astrid are out there, just trying to survive, and hopefully, succeeding."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Depressing Book I have ever read.","review":"The book was extremely well written but left me very upset"},{"rating":"2","title":"heartbreaking and inspiring","review":"really enjoyed this book - the pace, story, detail level and feelings were perfect. i followed the main character on her journey and enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, drawn out, lacking excitement","review":"This was one of the most boring books I have ever read. Had difficulty picking it up again after putting it down. I only kept reading it because I thought for sure there was going to some kind of suprise in store for the reader. Did not happen. I found the story unrealistic; one foster home disaster after another. This was the first book I have read from Oprah's recommendations. I found myself even wondering if Oprah had actually read this book. What did Oprah find appealing about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Message","review":"The author's romaniticizing the sexual abuse of a young girl was very disturbing. Flowery language doesn't compensate for a terrible message."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought a plot was a vital part of literature.","review":"The only reason I completed this novel was shere diligence. Not only were there very few likeable characters in the book, their actions were as unlikeable as they were. I am stunned that Oprah believes this is one of the best books she has ever read. This book read like a diary. One event following another, but nothing was ever resolved or no lessons were ever learned. To me, there was no point to the book. I am disappointed I wasted time and money on this book. Janet Fitch better thank Oprah for making her a best-selling writer, because her book certainly didn't make her one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic, Profound, Rich and Lingering","review":"I'm not one who would ususally write a review, but this book has had such a profound impact on me that I feel compelled to discuss its merits. I found myself underlining sentences that were so poetic they were like a delicous meal that I would have to sit back and digest before continuing on. Astrid's personal reflection of her journey was so real to me that I feel as if I learned and grew right along with her. My enjoyment of this book was such that now that I have finished reading it, I miss Astrid. Although not a \\"happy\\" story, it is a story of overcoming obstacles, learning to cope with the struggles of life and defining one's identity. Janet Fitch's writing got inside me and I could not put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful work by Janet Fitch.","review":"I had heard many great things about this book and finally decided to read it. From the beautiful and poetic word usage to the story as a whole, I was nothing but amazed. Read the book before attempting to watch the movie, it's much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the movie","review":"The book was able to go into greater detail than the movie which made it more engaging. I found the subject matter of foster parenting interesting and shocking at times. The book is great on character development and makes you think about human motivations. If you tend to like psychology, you will enjoy the book as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"I highly recommend this beautifully constructed work of art! I don't think I'll ever forget the magnificence of this story!!","review":"White Oleander is one of the most captivating books I've ever read. I was hooked from start to finish and am left wanting to know more about the author and the making of this story. This book can't help but make you feel strongly about your own will to survive and the aspects of life you may carelessly take for granted like safety and family. Janet Fitch does an amazing job wording this composition by adding beauty, wisdom and a sensitivity to real life details. All of the main characters in this novel are incredibly brilliant in their description and structure of demanding personalities. It's not impossible to read each sentence and truly know how to relate to every thought and feeling, piece by piece. Real or not. Astrid is my hero!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I read this awhile ago and definitely need to go back and read it again when I have the time. A friend recommended this book to me. I read the book first and then watched the movie. I thought the book was a lot better. The movie only touches on a small portion of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Compelling Novel of Laughter, Heartache and Tears","review":"Janet Fitches novel \\"White Oleander\\" is a story narrated by Astrid, a teenager growing up in several different foster and group homes after her mother is sent to prison for life, convicted of killing her ex-boyfriend. In each home she learns something new about herself and life. Sometimes the lessons are harsh, brutal and a wake-up to reality. Every family Astrid boards with is different in their own way. You will fall in love with Astrid as you watch her develop from a gentle young girl into a strong crafted woman. This book has a realistic balance between joy and heartache and you won't want to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attack of the Simile","review":"I very much wanted to like this book, as the prose was highly recommended. But I couldn't get past the first 10 pages because of the over-writing. A simile is thrown in every other sentence and has a gagging effect. Such as: \\"I sat at the empty drafting table next to my mother's, drawing the way the venetian blinds sliced the light like cheese. (!?) I waited to hear what my mother would say next, but she put her headphones back on, like the period after the end of a sentence.\\" This is only one example of an obvious writing trick that gets in the way of the story telling. I couldn't stop rolling my eyes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A delicious read","review":"I give this 5 stars because Astrid is so believable, so real. There are books better in the world, but I read quite a bit, and this one still stands out. Well written, well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great and Moving Story","review":"So I'll be the first to admit that I resisted this book initially becuase of the huge Oprah book club stamp on the front. It was until my work partner badgered me enough that I relented and read it. Wow was I glad I did. This is a beautiful, haunting first novel with a collection of unforgettable characters who represent such different worlds.At the center of them like the sun is Astrid, a young girl whose brilliant and artistic mother murders her lover sending her to jail, and Astrid into a string of foster homes.The book succeeds because although there are some horrible things that happen to Astrid the character never wallows in self pity. She just keeps moving forward, and we with it like witnessing an accident site you can't turn away from. Michelle Pfeiffer should be near perfection as Astrid's mother in the feature, and Alison Lohman who plays the title role is already receiving outstanding reviews. If you liked Wally Lamb's books you'd probably enjoy this as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"From having a very good friend who was raped constantly in her foster home, I can definitely understand the woes of Astrid. The writing is complex, and holds so much in one sentence--one gets used to it, because it flows like a river, and it's so beautiful. Janet Fitch has an incredible gift; this is and will remain one of my favorite books. It shows what really happens, shows the horrible state foster care is in (especially here in California!), it shows the hard relationship between a mother and daughter I know so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Oleander: an amazing and thought-proking novel.","review":"In one word, this book was awesome. The writing style alone was oustanding as well, mostly because of the vivid metaphors. You get to know each character so well that you hurt for them, are happy for them, etc. I definitely recommend this to anyone above the age of 15 who doesn't mind reading a \\"girl book\\" (I say this because the book is from a girl's perspective). And even if you do mind (I did too), try it, because you'll get sucked in. The only reason I gave this book 4 stars is because it tends to get the tiniest bit slow-paced towards the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had to read it twice, it was so beautifully written.","review":"Reading Janet Fitch's 'White Oleander' was like listening to beautiful, soothing music. I WAS Astrid. This story touched me in an way I've not been touched before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starkly Written","review":"Beautiful yet searingly harsh at times (like Astrid), the writer does an amazing job of conveying the confusion underlying Astrid's life. The writer is remarkably versatile in painting each chapter with distinctly different hues, and in providing detail on the very diverse communities in Southern California. A wonderful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very depressing, way too long, somewhat unbelievable story.","review":"I looked forward to reading this book, found it only in hardback and paid the high price for it at a local warehouse store. What a mistake. It was totally depressing, a very hard read and was not of interest to me at all. I have now read at least 5 of Oprah's best picks and this one is by far the worst. I still have a hard time believing Oprah or anyone 'recommends' this book....ah well, to each his own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerfully poetic with a strong story line that delivers.","review":"Janet Fitch has accomplished with her first work what I have been trying to do for 25 years. Her work is one of the most masterful pieces I have ever read. The characters are bits and pieces of all of humanity.She has managed to create metaphors that not only nail the moment but transcend any author I've read. Having read thousands of books, both classical and ordinary stuff, I'd have to say Janet should feel free to take her place among the finer works of our century. Thank you Janet for opening up my past and freeing my demons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disturbing material.","review":"I bought this book after Oprah raved about it on her show and when I got to page 68 I decided to return the book. The contents I found to be disturbing, and depressing and haunting. Not an enjoyable book at all. There is enough sadness and trouble in the world now without reading about another hardship. Wouldn't recommend this for those who are emotional or very sensitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of \\"Hype\\", I was expecting more","review":"I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie. I don't think I will see the movie now. Usually the book is better, so I have my doubts about the movie. Although, I really like Michelle Pfiefer. This could easily be an \\"Oprah\\" book if that still existed. Most of those books are depressing, although some of them have been very entertaining (i.e., The Pilot's Wife). This book never makes you \\"feel\\" good. I did want to read it to find out if it ended better than it started, but I was also disappointed in the ending. I was glad when I finished reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm exhausted.","review":"I FINALLY got to the end of this book last night and I'm totally exhausted. I found Fitch's writing style refreshing.....at first. Her refusal to use common discriptions ran me down. I started looking/waiting for phrases that were more recognizable to get a handle on Astrid's reality. It seemed as though ALL the characters were \\"deep\\" and well in control of who they believe themselves to be. I think the goal of Astrid was to get to that point as well. By the end of the book she (Astrid) was still in process. This was the ONLY realistic point of this long, drawn-out novel. I would not recommend this read to anyone NOT on caffeine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Single Best Novel i Have Ever Read","review":"I can't finish long books. So when my friend recommended White Oleander, i moaned and whined about how long it would take. i finished it in a week. It's ever so good. The language is pure poetry, the characters so real you can taste them. It's addictive, so much so that i almost hated to finish it. i can't recommend this book more emphatically, especially for young women like myself. It's really something special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written.","review":"I found this book to be enjoyable, realistic, and very well written. I do admit that I picked this up because it was an Oprah pick. The only other Oprah pick I have read was 'The Reader' and I hated it. I really liked this book though. I am surprised that Oprah would pick this book as well as the other I read, though. She's so into looking into our spirit and lifting ourselves up and these books didn't really make me feel enriched after reading them. White Oleander was a very good read, but I don't feel it left me with anything other than a new outlook on the Foster Home environments and program. It is true that Astrid lifted herself up and recognized her worthiness, but even in the end, she is left wanting and sad. I do, though, recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a \\"good-for-you\\" book","review":"This is probably the best book I have read from Oprah's book club, and I read a lot of books. It takes you on a ride through a young girl's life, and eventually lets you see who she becomes, and how she becomes that person. It reveals one of the most important relationships in all our lives; the mother/daughter bond. I think the author did a great job of transforming Astrid from a dependent person to an independent one. How would we feel in the same situation? She eventually blames her mother for putting her in the position of living with strangers, while all along her mother is in prison feeling sorry for herself. Each person Astrid encounters makes an impact on her life and forms her into the person she eventually becomes. I wholeheartedly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So depressing - nothing to enjoy - not for me!","review":"Because this was Oprah's overwhelming recommendation, I thought it would be great. Iwaited and waited as I read the book, for onedecent thing to happen to the \\"star\\" of the story. It was just too much sadness and couldsee no reason for the story at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read; saw the movie first.","review":"I was always curious about the book because I have watched the movie numerous times. It was great and received fast and promp service on my book. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrible life","review":"This is such a beautifully written book, full of pathos and half truths, telling the story of a beautiful girl and her equally beautiful mother. Scandinavian blondes, with startlingly blue eyes, the women attract attention from everybody, but the mother, Ingrid, is mentally flawed, living in a world of her own creation and writing poetry, which makes her a kind of cult figure. She poisons her lover after he is unfaithful to her and is sent to jail for a long sentence so that her daughter, Astrid, is placed in foster homes until she is 18 and able to fend for herself. Some of the foster parents are kind and well meaning while others who are in the program purely for the money they recieve, are mean, selfish and cruel, emphasising the aloneness and loneliness of the little girl. It's a stark read which points up the dangers facing a girl child alone in the world without a protector and the ease with which a child is able to slip into a world of squalor, sex and crime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I really liked White Oleander. This was a fast paced interesting book almost all of the way through. The author could have left maybe the last 50 pages or so out. The book was great up until the last few chapters, and then it became repetetive. I would recommend this book though, and did pass it along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"I bought this book to read during a trip and couldn't put it down! Janet Fitch is an amazing writer, with a poigniant story and a poetic manner. A must read book even for those who don't read for pleasure that often."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH ALL THE HYPE","review":"\\"White Oleander\\" is the story of a mother (Ingrid) and daughter (Astrid). The mother being in prison for murder and the daughter being bounced from one foster home to another.Astrid's journey through life is interesting, but some parts could have been eliminated from the novel.I am not a fan of this STYLE of writng, within each chapter are paragraphs that span time (weeks,months,etc.), and just when certain parts get interesting the novel shifts, and it does this throughout most of the book. It seems as if the author tried to fit too much into the novel. Sometimes, LESS is MORE.\\"White Oleander\\" has been hailed by critics and readers, as well as being an OPRAH pick.I don't usually read this type of novel, but with all the praise it has received, I gave it a chance. I wanted to like this book more than I did.The book is just an okay story that will hold your interest, but it is NOT a novel that will make a huge impact on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautifully written and haunting","review":"Janet Fitch's novel is written with extreme vocabulary and feeling. As I read the book, which I had a hard time putting down, I began to feel like I knew Astrid or wanted to know her, help her, love her. The story line is a mother who murders her lover who spurns her for various women. As a result, Astrid is forced into random foster homes where she is treated merciless and loveless until she meets one who will change the way she views her life forever. Try as she might, Astrid cannot shake her visions of her early life with her mother and bad memories. Poignant ending and fabulous story. I reccommend this wholeheartedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little disappointing","review":"It wasn't awful but I thought it suffered from lack of plot especially in the last third of the book. Maybe too chick-lit for this reader.I found Astrid's young character hard to track with and I'm not sure the author did a good enough job connecting her with a good storyline.The adult characters were well written (Ingrid, Clare and Star) and interesting and I was hoping something cool would resolve in the story, but nothing really did for this reader..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Imprint","review":"As a young adult, I found the journey to maturity that Astrid, the main character, undertakes to be one that hit surprisingly close to home. Janet Fitch writes honestly while remaining creative, which is no small accomplishment. When I finished the novel, I felt that I had gained a new appreciation for the world Fitch describes. Though it has been several months since I finished 'White Oleander', the characters have stayed with me; I find myself wondering what they would think of different situations. The imprint of characters onto my consciousness is one of the greatest compliments that I can give to a literary work, and this novel certainly achieved that distinction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Naration...","review":"I really enjoyed the way in which Janet Fitch used a teenage girl to narrate White Oleander. The first person narrative added great depth and insight to this story of discovering oneself. The novel was written in percise detail and captured the essence of Astrid's life beautifully. However some parts of the book seemed to be a bit long, while the ending was way too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking and Beautiful","review":"I haven't read a book I liked this much in years!!! Although Astrid's experiences themselves were nothing like my own life (thank God!) the feelings of isolation, love and loss are familiar to anyone who grew up in a less-than-perfect family...and didn't we all? I couldn't put the book down, and felt more drawn to Astrid with every page. Even at 12, she was an inspiration. Janet Fitch's writing is gorgeously clear and lyrically beautiful without letting her love of language overtake the story she has to tell. Absolutely perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First she recommends it, then she reads it aloud.","review":"I've loved a lot of Oprah's choices (Stones from the River, etc.) and was ready for a good listen on this audiobook. But Oprah's voice was just too deep and mature to be convincing as the voice of a twelve year old no matter how sophisticated. I didn't get past the first side of this audiobook.Will try the book version."},{"rating":"1","title":"An inspiration for budding novelists everywhere","review":"Although it was a total piece of trash, this book did have one redeeming quality. It made me realize that if junk like this can get published, certainly I can write something publishable! The \\"lyric\\" writing was forced and annoying, the similes way overdone, and the situations improbable and ridiculous. I have to admit I enjoyed the first couple of chapters about Astrid and her mother, when their life was normal but pleasantly quirky. But then some murder, sexual abuse, and shootings were thrown in for obvious shock value and the book just went downhill from there. Oprah, what were you thinking? This was possibly her most ridiculous selection yet, and I've read \\"Back Roads.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"White Orleander","review":"I found this book, incrediably depressing. I am tired of sex, drugs and I thought I would scream if I read another \\"like\\" or \\"as\\", in just about every sentance. I found her weary. I skipped pages of uneasy plundering. One can weave a good tale without all the wordiness of needing a dictionary or good review to past authors of the 20's. Horrible! I kept reading in hopes it would right itself, but it did not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had Potential....","review":"I spent 3 months trying to finish the last 100 pages of this book. In the beginning, I was intrigued. I really got into it & was eagerly waiting for the story to thicken. Well, I'm still waiting. I got tired of the main character, Astrid's, attitude & actions. I tired of her mother descriptive letters & her thinking patterns. I thought the book was good in the beginning, but towards the end, it became so dull, I placed my copy on the shelf to collect dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"While the writing can be lyrical, the book is immoral.","review":"This book is about a mother so self-absorbed that she does not nurture her young child. She fulfills her need for revenge and, in so doing, abandons her child to a world for which she is not prepared. And the child becomes bitter and tainted and unable to fit into the world as it really is. \\"Search for self\\"? I don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haunting and Hopeless","review":"While I found the imagery beautiful, I found the story to be hopeless, as one mortifying thing after another happens to Astrid. Just when you think there may be some light at the end of the tunnel in this story, the writer informs you that this is a train tunnel and you're about to be smashed flat! I finished this book like a dose of medicine...because I felt I should. However, I would not recommend it to anyone because it is not an enjoyable read. I felt despair and tension when reading it. My primary goal after the dog incident was just to be finished. Fitch went too far in ruining this girls life! With her eloquence, she could have written a beautiful novel but instead settled for something that Ingrid Magnussen herself would have written!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragedy after Tragedy after Tragedy....","review":"In this book the main character's mother murders her lover and is imprisioned. Her daughter floats from foster home to foster home and is submitted to horrible tragedies. She grows to be a bitter and dysfunctional woman. The world is sad enough without having to read a very long book that focuses on how horrible humans can really be. Unless you LIKE to be sad or shocked, save your time and read something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Can't Put Down Book","review":"I read this book and found it to be one of the best books I have read. The story I found to be so real. While there was some parts where there was humor, parts of the book almost had me in tears. It was like you could feel the things that Astrid was going through and could feel her fear and pain. Definetly a book worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic!","review":"There are many books that readers enjoy, but few that leave the reader certain it will become a \\"classic\\"...one still available and talked about in years to come not only of its subject, but the writer's gift of prose.White Oleander is amazing enough to leave you with that thought.It is written with keen insight and character development. It is realistic without being trite--in fact, the writer makes some uncanny subjects seem deeply real by her descriptive ability and insight into character and plot development, often with quite a large dose of humor. I realized the book's impact when I began recommending it to my large circle of friends only to find most of them had already read it--even the \\"non-readers\\" in the group! Which, once again, is the characteristic of a true classic.A must read...if you read only one book this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG What a Great Book!!,","review":"This is one of the best memoir style-abuse related books I think I have read. You feel what the peron feels, see what the person sees. I would rate this book as up there with \\"Nightmares Echo\\" and \\"Running With Scissors\\". But I would also include \\"A Child Called It\\", \\"Lost Boy\\" and \\"Lucky: A Memoir\\".What a powerful story this is....draws you in and keeps you there turning the pages through to the end. You will not believe the courage and determination...Amazing! If we could give higher than 5 stars...I certainly would!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read","review":"I LOVED this book. I work with foster children and am in the mental health field by profession. I read this book due to the nature of its plot (foster homes/children etc). Astrid the central character has many of the same qualities as the children I work with (depression, suicide attempts, love/hate stance towards parent). I could not put this book down. I read it about a month ago and every single character rings clear as a bell in my memory. You will never forget this book. The characters are so deep and carefully constructed. I've read other souther literature: Ya Ya Sisterhood, Redkneck way of Knowledge, Crazy Ladies, and more. But this is by far the best book. New Orleander is a lovely book and you will regret the time you will close the book when you get to the last page. You will mourn the death of a friend. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Although most Oprah devotees would choose this book as their novel of choice just because Oprah chose it, it's still a great novel no matter what kind of book genre you are used to reading. My advice to you while reading this book, is to keep an open mind, and not read it for what everyone else is saying about it, but simply because YOU want to read it. Janet Fitch writes with a great, unique voice that sadly is often rare in this day and age. Some people may criticize Astrid in this book for some of the things she did, but like any other human, all she was doing was looking for love and a place where she could be herself, and feel safe. Although me and Astrid are the same age, I feel I learned a lot from her because she has lived things most of us have not seen or experienced yet in our lifetime. She is a real and honest character, and if you want to learn more about another side of life and love, than you should definitely read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A simile lover's dream","review":"The story itself is interesting and somewhat engaging. However, the writing style drove me nuts. You really get a lot of similes and metaphores for the money. I mean a lot. So many similes that I felt compelled to drag out some old reference books to remember what a simile was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and unforgettable","review":"This was a beautifully written book. The book was very uplifting in that it shows how someone can bring a positive result from even the most negative of circumstances. It gives hope and inspiration. This book has given me a much deeper appreciation for my own children and an insight to just how powerful an influence I am for them. I see the importance of making them feel secure in my love for them.The writing was so wonderfully descriptive; it forces you to ponder the beauty in the ordinary, as Astrid did in her artwork.This book has certainly changed the way I view life now; I see my many blessings. This was truly one of the best books I've ever read in my 44 years, and there have been many. Thank you Janet Fitch."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most captivating poetic prose I have ever read.","review":"Where has Janet Fitch been hiding?! I am disapointed there are not more of her books to gobble up. White Oleander is pure poetry about real life agony, despair, acceptance, and survival. Fitch uses words to tantalize your senses to every experience of every character. You see, hear, taste, smell, and feel every move they make and every thought they have. One of the most marvelous, wonderful, and moving reading experiences I've had - I still find myself drifting back into the scenes and feeling the feelings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"I loved the majority of this book and the way the writer wove her words, however I thought the ending was terrible. There could have been a thousand other ways (better ways!) Astrid could have turned out. But reading the rest of the book is definatley worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entrancing lovely prose and an all too true scenario","review":"With respect to those who don't believe that Foster Homes can be that bad, They Can. I worked in the system for several years. I had to get out because I felt so depressed about the poor options kids have in this kind of situation. There are lots of wonderful pages in this book though. It gives hope to read about a girl who could go through the things in this story and survive. I thought the writing could have been tighter and some of the chapters felt like they were filler. But when I got to the end of the book I felt bereft. I need to know how this girl turns out in a few more years. I hope she makes it all the way to actual happiness. I wonder how some of the kids I worked with did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely enthralling, I couldn't put it down","review":"I was given this book as a gift from my mother in law and had no idea what it was about, and no expectations. But from the first page, I could not put it down. Literally. I lost sleep, I read in the car when I stopped at a stop light, my husband yelled at me for ignoring him. As a writer, I was overwhelmed with Fitch's poetry, her gift for the English language, the intensity of her descriptions, the incredible insight into each of her characters. The descriptions did not slow the plot. Instead, she weaved everything into a perfect cloth of words. What can I say, I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perils of Pauline Return","review":"Oprah has done it to us again. Astrid has soooo many bad experiences that they start to become unbelievable. The ending, too, reads like something that must be\\" continued next week\\" so that we really know what happens--a cheap trick in my book. Why must we always be exposed to the sadness of life in Oprah's choices? Is it because she needs guests that share the characters' experiences? Give me Ann Tyler or Gail Godwin any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Descriptive Prose Is Useless If One Has Nothing To Say","review":"I'm relieved to read many of the reviews of Janet Fitch's _White Oleander_. While it is true Fitch has a descriptive, \\"showing and not telling\\" quality to her work, she has no story-telling abilities whatsoever. I haven't been this depressed by a book... ever! I am depressed because I spent $12.00 on this book. I am depressed because such a gift of eloquence is being wasted. However, I am most depressed about the fact that I am near the final words of this book, and I can see no hope for closure. I have spent my time reading colourful and striking words that, just as Ingrid's poetry didn't reveal who she was, didn't make one bit of sense. This is no masterpiece. It is a facade... all smoke and mirrors. In the end, it's as satisfying as jello for dinner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Dissapointed","review":"Recently I began reading books from the Oprah bookclub. Some I could not put down other's I couldn't wait to finish, mostly because I was tired of them. \\"White Oleander\\" is one that I could not wait to finish. The first chapter of the book was excellent and enough to get me to purchase it; however, the more I read, the more boring it became. I got the point the Author was trying to make after the second home Astrid lived in. It was the relationship with the mother and daughter that intrigued me most and I must say I found the mother's character more interesting than Astrid herself. I wanted to enjoy this book so much but the only thing that kept me reading was the fact that my husband paid so much for it as a gift for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Average, 3 stars is generous","review":"This book was mediocre. I found \\"The Triumph and the Glory\\", \\"Cryptonomicon\\", \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\", and half a dozen others I've read in recent weeks to be far more deserving of acclaim. \\"White Oleander\\" is weak in many areas and excruciatingly painful at times--there is only so much suffering a character should endure before it becomes pointless stupidity. This book could have been SO good, but unfortunately it was sent to the printer only half-developed."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my kind of book","review":"I thought the writing was a bit amateur and the plot a little too soap opera dramatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother-daughter relationship at its most complex","review":"The book explores the complexities of the mother daughter relationship as well as the downfall of the foster care system. Astrid (a 13 year old girl) is shown going through many foster care experiences after her mother is sent to jail for killing her lover. Throughout a span of years, Astrid grows and changes with the help of the various characters she meets in the system. She grows and changes but always hears the voice of her mother. No matter how much time has passed or how much has happened, Astrid says \\"my compass always points west\\" toward her mother. Wonderful novel showing how evern the most beautiful things can be the most poisonous and deadly.

At long last we can go discover the mystery surrounding the Senator's attacker. With Obi-wan as our guide nothing could go wrong...OR SO I THOUGHT! When Obi-wan and I hoped into our Jedi Starfighter I noticed something rather peculiar: the wings and landing gear don't work! The Landing gear is not strong enough to hold the ship up! The \\"wings\\" and flimsy and break off! I hope we never have to fight the mean ol Jango Fett! Now maybe I got a bad set (fingers crossed) but I felt it was my duty to inform you.

The R2 unit is built-in just like in the movie, and Obi-Wan is very detailed, he even comes with his lightsaber. My only gripe is that the cockpit is just a little too cramped, the arms don't fit quite right. Obi-Wan looks a bit odd flying around with his arms up in the air.

Putting it together was a breeze, except for the lid which was a bit tricky to get the hinges correct (pre-drilled holes as guides would be helpful). My husband and I put the top on incorrectly several times which led to the lid not closing all the way. The trick is to attach the hinges with the lid at a 45 degree angle (not 90 degrees) as the top does not open a full 90 degrees when it's put together correctly. A very nice feature - the lid supports itself and stays open on its own (preventing little fingers from getting pinched since it doesn't slam shut)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a quality product","review":"I just bought these earrings and noticed as soon as I opened them that the backs did not fit closely.

I then read and read the section on installation and administration.Other topics I looked were packet filtering, setting up multiple servers on the LAN and the client installs, having proxy server and exchange server work together, how and what to monitor, how to optimize the server and there was even a section pertaining to the troubleshooting of the server.Overall this book has been a big help to so far.

As other reviewers have commented, this book is a little more geared for the person working with the product day to day. It gives you a good grasp of proxy. I used it as a certification book, and it was also pretty good in conjunction with other material that I used...namely transcenders. Proxy is a big subject and there are a lot of things to cover. This book covered them well, but it could be longer. Actually most of the books out there on proxy could be longer too. The writing of the authors could be a little bit better. Give me a little more narrative in parts before jumping to the technical details right off. Other readers may prefer jumping right to the details right away though. The bottom line though is that this is a very good book that didn't leave anything out. If there was a better answer and question section, it would get a five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I was expecting","review":"From the overall glowing reviews I've read on this book, I expected to read and comprehend the subject fairly quickly but so far when I finish each chapter and take the review questions I've felt like I must have missed something.

With the Sybex books I felt pretty comfortable at the end of each chapter and answered most of the review questions correctly.

On this particular DVD, almost all the dialog is meant to come out the rear speakers and I have no such speakers. A small part of the dialog comes out of the front speakers, but the volume is much too low to understand the speech. If I turn the volume up to try to understand the speech, then the background noise of the movie is way too loud. I've watched other surround sound DVDs before on my equipment and there has been little problem. With this DVD, it ruins the movie. Unless you have a surround sound system with your TV, my advice would be not to purchase this DVD.Gary Peterson"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Net 2.0ut of 5 stars","review":"I agree with everything the reviewer before me said. The movie started out slow and a bit amateurish. It was a little bit predictable (except for maybe one part... I won't spoil it for you). Nikki Deloach (from the New Mickey Mouse Club and the former music group Innosense) did an ok job with acting. I guess all in all the movie was just kind of so-so and bland where it should have been more exciting and suspenseful. Putting the Sandra Bullock version of \\"The Net\\" in a different setting (Istanbul) doesn't really change the movie all that much. Still the same basic plot: people steal someone's identity that doesn't have any family or friends to vouch for who she is. You didn't feel anything for any of the characters in the movie.

She tries to correct her self and noone seems to believe she is telling the truth. They all think she is this Kelly Roos woman. Well, all I can say this is that The Net 2.0 is totally boring and complete waste. Deloach is simple rendered dull here as she screams and runs and yells....to put it to simple terms, her acting sucks and what a waste of Neil Hopkins (TV's LOST, Aimee Price) who always does good work but here he doesnt have anything to do.

The videographers did a great job cutting from one soloist to another in a seamless manner. The lighting added to the ambiance of the music and the sound was every bit as good as the CD's. Bonus features include interviews of several members of the group. This gave the audience some insight to the children's personalities and aspirations.

So, needless to say I am being very careful. I am applying as it has said (twice per day). The scar is healing nicely so far (about 1 month), but it is difficult to say whether it would have been worse without it. The surgery was 6 weeks ago, so it is still a young scar. The ridges that formed quickly are just now going down and the redness is lessening each day.In contrast I have been using it on a scar I have had for 10+ years and the difference is slim to none, but I will keep using it there.

Its main aim seems to be to persuade that both sides were morally equivilent - that the Cold War was caused by misunderstandings and politics rather than a clash of civilization vs. barbarism. No one would, or should, treat the conflict against Facism and National Socialism (Nazism) in this fashion; monsterous crimes should be recognized for what they are. Communism was equally wicked, not just another point of view.For a more accurate portrayal of what was at stake in the Cold War I recomend \\"The Black Book of Communism\\" and \\"Architects of Victory.\\" If any sources should be used to educate children, it is these books (especially \\"The Black Book of Communism,\\" which is thouroughly reasurced by scholars in the various fields that are covered), and not this Turner effort to re-write realities underlying the Cold War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative, often chilling","review":"COLD WAR brings it all back to those of us old enough to have experienced those long years of superpower nuclear stalemate.

While it is comprehensive, well-photographed, and well-edited, Ted Turner's Team just can't help taking the revisionist's view that the Cold War was fought by morally equivalent superpowers. The US certainly didn't wear a white hat during the Cold War, but putting us on the same moral level as a reactive, authoritarian regime that crushed all dissent, inside and outside the country, is pure folly. A good example is the coverage of Stalin's Gulag and the McCarthy era. McCarthyism was truly a dark spell in US history which led to careers and reputations being ruined.

The wires in the center went so high that it separated my breasts and the wires on the sides pushed my breasts toward the center in a minimizer fashion. Similarly, I found the shoulders to be uncomfortable as it was pulling my breasts up at the same time as everything else was pushing them in. I usually wear bras that are full coverage and wire. They have all been very comfortable and I am not sure what my problem was with this bra. However, I never wear minimizer bras or bras that have wires this high around the breasts.

But, unlike Backlash, by Susan Faludi, which was almost totally negative, the authors also look at women's strengths in negotiation, and give some ideas for how to put their ideas into action.It's not a how-to-negotiate book; I've spent the last 23 years practicing corporate law, negotiating sophisticated legal transactions and running an in-house department. This book goes beyond \\"how to\\" into \\"why\\". Essential reading for any woman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Familiar, But Well-Supported","review":"There isn't anything surprising in here to any woman who has been around the business world for a while. However, the book's real value is that it provides empirical evidence to support Everywoman's anecdotal observations.What I found most useful about this book is evidence cited that women's \\"tend and befriend,\\" cooperative approach to negotiation results in greater gains in the long run, in part because of women's ability to reframe. It also confirmed my impression that women are more successful in business when they soften their mode of delivery (although not their message).The authors further reframe the scope of \\"negotiation\\" to include women's personal, including homemaking, lives, to remind us all that equality should not end at the thresholds to our homes.Ultimately, every negotiator has to find his or her own personal style.

In fact, men negotiate four times as frequently as women, and get better results. Men are much more apt to make demands and ask for benefits, pay increases and so forth. Men make more money not necessarily because the system is overtly discriminatory - though it well may be - but because men demand more. The book tends to belabor its point, and sometimes the evidence does not seem as well-presented as it might have been, but We found that it sheds useful light on a knotty social problem. Perhaps it will spur more women to fight - or to continue to fight - on their own behalf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much-needed research","review":"An invaluable reference took, the authors have delivered much-needed research to support their arguments.

I really felt like I was back in the medieval times, and with a very different spin. Catherine's view is different than any I have read. Who would have thought to comment on the number of teeth left in one's head? I thought it was hilarous. Catherine somehow got everyone to lighten up.

It put me through every emotion while reading. I would highly recommend it to just about anyone ! The story has a good sense of humor that is carefully woven with a gripping drama and wonderful romance and that is why I just couldn't put it down until I had finished. It has a little something in it for everyone with some intresting twists, rather than being just another romance novel. I look forward to reading more from this author but for now may have to be content with reading Knight Of Honor just one more time.

This is only for those brides who either have thick wallet for their wedding or those who can only dream about it and keep on dreaming.

I could hardly agree more.Alas, I could not prevent myself from imagining numerous future brides becoming completely carried away after having seen so many photos of luxurious, ornately-clad tents and page after page of hugely expensive and rather risque flower arrangements.Preferred the book for Cowie's advice rather than the very lavishly staged photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was very disappointing given the reviews I read on-line.","review":"Sorry ladies, but I have to disagree with all of you.

My ultimate purpose for writing this review is to warn people of the very poor customer service provided by Daewoo. I have received ultimately no help after calling multiple times to have the above-mentioned problems fixed. Finally, after the warranty had expired, I received a phone call- only after months had gone by. Overall, I do not recommend this product.

There are so many things, from appetizers to full meals based on this staple.The old classics are presented here, of course, and instructions to make sure you get it right, but fancier, more elegant dishes are also here, so if you only have that carton of eggs in the fridge and not much more, you can still whip up something interesting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I was very disappointed that this cookbook is basically the same dozen recipes with some minor changes in added ingredients. I was hoping for some new ideas on using eggs, and got same old. If you have never cooked with eggs at all it might be useful, but every basic cookbook has omelets, quiche, egg salad, custard, etc. and anyone with imagination can come up with their own flavoring and add in ideas. I bought it along with the \\"Totally Eggs Cookbook\\"for 1/4 the price and with less than 100 pages, and got more new ideas from the latter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music to buy","review":"This is a very good lay back and let the music massage your mind album.

According to Ms. Hernandez, getting into \\"highly selective\\" colleges such as Dartmouth, her pet school, and others like it is virtually impossible. Furthermore, she paints an extraordinarily bleak picture for the \\"average guy\\" type of high school student- a person who is NOT the captain of the football team, the editor of the school newspaper, and/or a refugee from a destitute foreign country. Sorry for being so cynical, but if she's right, most people have got to log off and hit the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"College, Here I Come!!","review":"I found this book extremely helpful in my quest to get into an Ivy League college. It explains what the colleges are looking for in your class ranking (The higher to the top the better), the truth about minority students (They have to meet a certian quota of them), The truth about AI (Used to figure out if you will be accepted into an Ivy league), and many more helpful hints. This book also gives you sugestions on what to do on those high school years leading up to college that look good on your application. A is for Admission tells you the dos and don'ts of essays and interviews. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you could ever want to know!","review":"This book answers every trying question in a young college bound person's mind. Every small thing that is looked for and other things that are not liked are let known to the public. Simply brilliant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor grammar and syntax makes information seem dubious","review":"This book is interesting but frustrating. It explains in excruciating detail the admissions process at ONE Ivy League school (Dartmouth), and purports to offer this as a general guide to admissions at the ten or fifteen most selective colleges in the country. It is questionable whether (a) any such analogy is really valid and (b) this is a true glimpse of even Dartmouth's process. Ms Hernandez's biography states that she has an advanced degree in English but you could never tell that from her grammar and syntax. Even my 17-year old son threw down the book in disgust at the sentence structure and the childish prose.I know that many parents view this as the Bible of admissions books, but I think it is more like the Apocrypha or the Book of Mormon--a pretender or a fake, or, at best, an adjunct to more serious and intelligent books such as Bill Paul's Getting In and Bill Mayher's book on the admissions process."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Place to Start","review":"I checked online through several college sites to find a book that gives a concise, informative review of the admissions process. This is the title that kept coming up. \\"A is for Admission\\" has the details that flesh out the generalized articles in annual editions of U.S. News & World Report's \\"America's Best Colleges\\". Now the system actually makes sense to me, and the book is an easy read. My son just signed up for 9th grade and I wondered if I was starting too early, but after reading the book I believe middle school is the best time to start. The way I see it--our kids tell us their goals and we give them the support they need to reach those goals. This book helped me as a parent to better understand how to support my son. I would love to see a book of this quality that described the admission procedures at California's top universities and colleges."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK GOT ME IN","review":"I was accepted to Penn early admission. I believe I got in because of the helpful tips I learned from reading this book. Luckily I read this book two years ago and was able to start setting myself apart from the rest as Ms. Hernandez recommends. I was a good student with very average college board scores. Through my own dedication and Ms. Hernandez' advice, I was a competitive applicant. This book is an honest account of the admissions process through someone who knows. If you have the motivation to do what it takes to get into a great school, this book is a MUST!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative but Very OUTDATED!!!","review":"I've purchased few college admission related books in preparation for my daughter (Junior). This book will be decently informative if you are not so updated on the latest college admission process & requirement. I am sure this book was a sensational hit back in 10-12 years ago!BUT, this is 2009!!!Book cover said \\"Updated and Revised\\" but I can't tell when it was updated and what was updated. Many details are from 1995 and the latest data is from 2000.It doesn't even cover SAT 1's Writing part. Acceptable SAT score used is way too low and an acceptance rates are too higher for 2009-2010 since data was from before 2000. There has been many new changes since 1995-2000 that this book will not help much (book will give you some \\"general\\" idea)."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real downer...","review":"This book made it seem like if you didn't have a 4.0 GPA and a 1600 on your SAT that you didn't have a chance to get into the top colleges in the US, which is not true! She DID explain the admissions process, but didn't give any tips on how to increase your chances. the book was also poorly organized. Try another book besides this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative and insightful","review":"This book is great for getting an insider's perspective into how Ivy league admissions offices actually work.

I'm a straight A student and I am involved in lacrosse and volunteering, but some of the featured examples were of students that were nearly perfect that got rejected. But like I said, the guidance she gives is useful and very goal oriented. I hope that by using this book I can get into a great college."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of a Common Sense","review":"This is a good book to take a peek at the top college selection process.The information is a little old, but the general principles still apply. The author might have overstated the value of the \\"Academic Index\\" a little bit, but I can see it as a first round \\"qualifying\\" score."},{"rating":"2","title":"It&#65533;s like having a friend in the business","review":"This book arrived at the ideal time to help my family with the college application process. High school students who dream of attending an Ivy League or other highly selective college need to understand the real selection process. Michele Hernandez let the cat out of the bag when she wrote this book. The insider knowledge she provides is like having a friend in the business. If you are new to the college application process and have a starry-eyed high school son or daughter, do yourself a favor and read \\"A Is For Admission\\". It can help you and your student set realistic objectives and improve chances of acceptance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Admissions by the numbers","review":"As a tutor who helps prepare students for high-stakes admissions exams, I found A is for Admission extremely useful, particularly for students aiming toward the Ivy League. In an illuminating appendix, Hernandez breaks down the formulas that admissions officers use to rank candidates. She specifically explains the importance of SATI and SATII performance, showing how the difference between scores of 500 and scores of 700 affects a student's chances for admission. Likewise, she gives the formulas used to weighh class rank, grades and the difficulty level of high school courses. The information is especially useful for sophomores and juniors trying to chart their high school careers with college in mind. Her thoughts about personal essays also are useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for teachers and those preparing to teach","review":"I read this book to prepare for my elementary education content test (EC-6, Texas).

I found this book to be extremely well-written and organized, and the explanation of terms helped me tremendously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of promises; little delivery","review":"I've always liked to sing, but was pretty sure I didn't sound very good. Buying this book was my first attempt at improving. The first third is diagnostics (so far so good). The second (short) third is exercises that I found hard to follow. The final (long) third is really fluff--developing style, etc.Going through his book did motivate me to find a voice teacher. After a couple of years, two teachers with pretty different styles, and some significant improvement in my posture, breathing, enhanced resonance, etc, I thought it would be ineresting to go back and read Love's book again. This time I was even more disappointed because he deals so little with real issues, and many of his exercises were actually counterproductive (at least for the problems I really had).I'd give it one star, except that it did encourage me to try out a teacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roger Love disregards 25 years of vocal research.","review":"The author's voice sounds strained and high pitched. He comes across as arrogant and self-applauding. Worst of all, as other reviewers have mentioned, he perpetuates myths about the voice that we know are false. He should be ashamed of himself. We've known these are myths for decades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not enough.","review":"It does give you some hints, but it isn't that technical. It's more an \\"imitate me\\" book than a \\"understand it\\" book. To me it wasn't very illustrative...The exercises are a little bit ridiculous, so it's kind of hard to try to practice if you don't want to bother any nearby person or neighbor, or if you get easily embarrassed.Right now I'm reading \\"The New Voice: How to Sing and Speak properly\\" and it seems more reasonable, it talks about making your voice before singing, instead of making it as you sing... like in this book.I will give it a 2, because it does help you improve, but this book doesn't cover the \\"understand everything that is happening\\" part good enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Set your voice free","review":"Excelent book, the information is clear and easy to understand and there is even more than what I expected. The CD is divided for female and male vocalization and that is excellent when you are practicing -and singing- on daily basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have access to a top-notch vocal trainer 24x7","review":"When I purchased this book, I had not heard of Roger Love or Donna Frazier. Not even one week into using the book, however, I feel like I am cheating them by paying so little for the critical knowledge contained in this book.This book will give you tools and confidence you need to develop your own ability. Even if you have had extensive vocal training and think you know it all, I believe you're certain to learn something worth at least the cover price of the book.The bottom line is: This book provides an excellent road map to becoming a better singer. The work is still yours to do, however, and I'd say that anyone who doesn't see positive gains from his/her investment in this book either already sings like Ella Fitzgerald or simply doesn't practice enough.Oh yeah - and don't be lazy about using the CD...it is an integral part of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great voice lessons from a \\"private teacher\\"","review":"This is a great set. The book and CD are informative, helpful, and very down-to-earth. The CD is very encouraging, and enthusiastic. The excercises are the best method that I've seen to teach me how to breathe and sing in the middle and upper register of my voice properly. After I worked on the excercises for a few weeks, I successfully extended my useable range by several notes. I could sing tenor parts that I could never sing before, and I'm a pretty horrible baritone.

This might be a good book for someone who wants to sing with a microphone for a basement rock band and have at least some resemblance of a trained voice, but for someone who is serious about singing (e.g. opera, Church choir), get the McKinney book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be free. . . but don't believe everything you read","review":"Snake oil? No, not quite. Ripoff? Nooo. Lack of research? Definitely!Mr. Love likes to drop names of singing stars to obfuscate his lack of research in physiology (and very little in anatomy). Why he didn't consult with ENT's or speech language pathologists is beyond me. His wild and absolute certainty about \\"middle voice\\" and its \\"zipper\\" physiology is unforgiveable when experts on the subject of voice like Sataloff, Colton, Casper and, Boone are accessible.There is so much that is wrong physiologically in his firm representations it would take another book to refute them all. Mr. Love should stay with the mental imagery he professess, such as imagining your exhaled air the color red, etc. When he leaves this domain and tries to explain physiology he runs smack into this thing called science.Before Mr. Love writes his next book I highly recommend he observe singing vocal cords via stroboscopy first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good writing and eye opening view on the original Gulf War","review":"This book has a slant on the war and how it affected people which is different from what I have seen before. People compare it to Vonnegut or Heller, but it is original. The story of the soldier who switched into the body of his daughter made me cry. People who think that is cheap humor are idiots. When I think of our soldiers over in Iraq and Afghanistan now, who are away from their loved ones, and unable to protect them when that is probably what the want to do most, it makes me very sad and angry as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive","review":"A surprisingly juvenile book of stories that only loosely connects itself to the Gulf War--the humour is embarrassingly weak, the writing is steeped in cliche, the political references are thin and empty. Without that linking motif of the Gulf War, this book would be seen for what it is, a barely capable, immensely derivative, work of fiction by a young writer blissfully unaware of how sentimental he is."},{"rating":"2","title":"So It Goes","review":"This book kind of blew me away. It's a wild ride through the Persian Gulf war, and definitely in the same league as Vonnegut and Joseph Heller. The marines recruit high school seniors with \\"brainmail.\\" A green beret deserts his team and ends up wrestling monkeys in an underground bunker in Iraq.But absurdity aside, there's something totally emotional going on here with the characters.

The elements will be familiar to readers of the sub-genre: a poor relation, an heir reluctant to marry, a managing mother; but Farr combines them all in a touching and funny little souffle of a novel. It's the perfect book to curl up with on a blustery winter's night when the Christmas lights are on, the hot chocolare is warm, and you're looking for a sweet and tender read."},{"rating":"2","title":"poignant, touching, also funny","review":"This is one of my favorites by Farr. Made me cry, made me laugh, touched my heart. The characters are VERY well drawn, plus feature a couple of characters from her first book, The Nobody. They are nasty people in The Nobody and in this book she shows you a glimpse of what their lives are really like and you understand more where they are coming from. Brilliant. Even the nastiest character in this book, the duchess, you can't help sympathizing with to an extent. This reminded me of Jane Austen where every character is flawed even the heroines, and every character has redeeeming features even the villains. By the way, Farr excels in writing beta heroes who aren't wimps. Anyone in her right mind would fall in love with Jack. And Manegold the cat acts exactly like my own cat, he's great. I promise you will LOVE THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy These!","review":"I bought a 50 pack spindle of these HP CD-Rs that worked with no problem, but then I bought a 100 pack spindle, burned 20 CDs and 12 of them played with a few seconds horrible noises.

Meanwhile your three year old keeps asking \\"are you done yet?\\". I was so frustrated with this stupid toy.

Then we have to look at the directions to find out how to put it back together. Couldn't be more aggravating. I had purchased the Bat Cave first and it was so well put together in the box, I figured this would be the same. Beware.

Once assembled, playing with the mountain will cause it to fall apart again since it is held together with shallow pegs. I wanted to shove it all in the box and return it, but my husband claims that my son plays with it sometimes. I am the only one that seems to be sitting on the floor with it, as I constantly try to piece it back together. It is a cool concept since all boys love dinosaurs and mountains, but it is not very well thought out in the design. Who needs more toy pieces every where?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Parent's Nightmare! Don't waste your money on this one!","review":"My 3 yr old son was given this by his Aunt and Uncle as a Xmas present. They have been taken out of my will.This is by far THE WORST toy I have ever assembled!!! Where do I start?The instructions are HORRIBLE. No list of contents, and only vague installation diagrams (the shading of the parts are even incorrect).The 8 screws needed were missing (#4 x 3/8\\"), which required a trip to the hardware store.Pieces don't fit well togetherAt least the thing makes loud, irritating sounds (like burping).I'm too frustrated to keep going...all I can say is...PARENTS, STAY AWAY FROM THIS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"$25 in the trash would have been just as effective","review":"This was a Christmas gift for my 4-year-old son. Unfortunately, his dad and I were attempting to assemble it in the middle of the night on Christmas Eve. Turns out the box contained NO instructions, so we could only go by the pictures on the outside of the box. Of course, the photos on the box did not actually depict every single piece contained in the box. After 1.5 hours of work, getting only half assembled, and of that only half that would actually stay together, we put it all back in the box. Yes, on Christmas Eve. In the middle of the night. When no stores were open to allow us to pick up a replacement gift. If two 30-something adults cannot assemble this product, how is a 4-year-old going to? I am very disappointed in the lack of quality offered by Fisher-Price's Imaginext line."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate t rex mountain","review":"Don't buy this toy unless it is for a 15 year old who can rebuild it himself everytime it breaks. It's great to look at, but don't make any sudden movements! My son received this as a Christmas gift. I was crushed to discover it in a million pieces that needed to be assembled. I knew it would not survive my 3 year old. He begged me to put it together, so I finally did. Two hours later. It fell apart at the very end when I tried to put all the plants and accessories on. Fell apart again when I moved it to his bedroom. He now probably knows every curse word and then some. I know that I sound crazy, but I need to vent. How else can you get revenge on a toy, but give it a bad review?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps falling apart","review":"This toy looks like it could be alot of fun... if it would stay together.

Just don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointed!","review":"My 3 year old son got this for Christmas. The instructions are not clear and hard to understand. You can't tell from the pictures which piece goes where. It took me 2 hours to get it all together then as soon as he touched it it completely fell apart. He was crushed and I was frustrated. This toy is more of a look but don't touch toy. The \\"accessories\\" are too big for the set as well. The cave man doesn't even fit in the dinosaur skull. Plus, the screws that you use to attach the skull were not the right size and would not go in all the way. The skull also makes it top heavy so that doesn't help it stay together very well. I would not recommend buying this for any child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome dino toy","review":"My son got this last year for Christmas and he still plays with it often. Sometimes some of the gates or plants do fall off, but he just puts them back on. He also likes to take it apart and re-arrange the pieces into different configurations. This toy is great for the imagination.Although, if a child played rough with this toy it would come apart a bit more often. No toy is made to be pounded on or abused.

It took me over an hour to put it together and with the cool sound effect I thought it would be so much fun. I am not kidding when I say that it literally falls apart whenever you touch it. I could not find any way to keep it together. Very disappointing to spend that money on something that is sitting in pieces all over the floor. I hate to write anything negative about a toy, but, I really felt that I should warn any parent who is about to spend their hard earned money on this item.

My 2 year old loves to tear it down which in turn means that I have to reassemble it since there is no way a 4 or even 5 year could do so. I have to makesure I am constantly reading the directions in order to get it back together. There are multiple \\"set ups\\", but the instruction book only provides detailed instructions for the set-up pictured on the box and on amazon. I would recommend this toy for older children, maybe between the ages of 10 and 12 due to the level of assembly. The added accessories do not really stay on...and typically pop off once you think you have them assembled. As an earlier review stated...it is very cool to look at, but unless you are going to put it in a safe place after assembly...not so user friendly...for the \\"user\\" that is intended, (i.e. small children)."},{"rating":"2","title":"He loves it","review":"My 3 year old loves this but it requires an adult to build it everytime they decide to tear it down until they can do it themselves.

This thing is just a big pain in the butt to put together. The directions are terrible and once it is together it falls aparts constantly.

I have seen many imaginext sets and have liked all of them until we opened the box on this one. Its in 10,000 pieces, literally. The screws are too small and strip out. There are entirely too many pieces that can fall apart. The set is supposed to be \\"interchangeable\\" but there are too many components that work in tandem for this to really be the case. I am really disappointed in this set. My advice, is to either buy some super glue or just give your kid a cardboard box and some crayons. Not only would it be more fun than this contraption, it would cause less frustration on mom and dad..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good but it's a waste","review":"Unfortunately this toy looks good but it isn't durable at all!

The most interesting part of this portrait is the pain Donny experienced throughout his life, which is more apparent through what's not written than what is. He's so easy to like. Biggest disappointment is that there is not a big enough emotional catharsis. He seemed to get over his anxiety disorder rather quickly, although in real life, I'm sure it was a painful road to recovery. Also, my only question was --- if he was bankrupt and didn't have any money coming in, how did he support his family and who paid for his travel around the country? It never seemed that Donny was ever down and out --- just not in the celebrity limelight. Still, this is a great read and makes you want to call Donny up on the phone and invite him over for a piece of cake."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE","review":"Donny Osmond is nothing more than extraordinary!! This man has gone through more changes in his personal and professional life that noone could ever imagine, and he has handled those changes with nothing more than exceptional grace!

The book did not come across as real. He spent too much time trying to spare everyone's feelings. He spent too much time talking about how great his family was when they very clearly weren't.There didn't need to be dirt, but it seems the author still has not come to terms with his family situation while growing up.

Oliver sternly embraces the life of affluence he has been born into. Igby fights with all of his might to free himself from it. Neither one of the brothers is entirely winning their battle. Mi Mi their mother is cold and superficial. Oliver cherishes her; Igby hates her. Igby's father is in a nut house driven there in Igby's eyes by the life Igby is now fleeing. It was wonderful and smart. It is a life you should eavesdrop on. Watch this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Igby Goes Down","review":"It will be said repeatedly that this film or piece of literature is remniscent of the story of Salinger's rebellious Holden Caufield; in this case, however, it is true. If literary fans will recall what made Holden so popular, it was his uncommon nature, which took the form of depression/failure/complexities; contrary to popular belief, it was not, in fact, the depression/failure/complexities. The same can be applied to Igby--what makes him so wonderful is not solely the depression or the failure or the complexities, because every other movie has a main character who posesses all of those traits. What makes Igby, and his story, so fascinating is the unusual circumstances his life takes place in.

But while Holden was intelligent and likeable, Igby is just down right annoying. Along the way he meets characters who are so pretentious by trying to be weird and strange.I really wanted to like this movie. The title is very interesting and the cast made me want to see it.

The worst part is that this should have been good; I wanted it to be a good film, as there's a real lack of stories of this nature. The only saving grace was the performance of Jeff Goldblum, and a few snatches of nice dialogue that are wasted on the end result.

I was disappointed that Igby's motivations were never explored or even hinted at. He simply appeared to be just another rich kid rebelling against society. While the cast of this film is impressive, only the father (Bill Pullman) provided an exceptional performance as the mentally ill father. Otherwise I failed to feel any sympathy for the others and didn't care what happened to them.Maybe I just don't get it? Maybe I was in the wrong frame of mind when I watched this film? Nobody knows.

Who are these editors? This movie doesn't simply lack a heart, it doesn't have a head, either. It pretends to be clever and edgy, but it's derivative without even understanding what it's trying to imitate. Try to care about the characters in this film--it's not possible. Don't waste your time with this steaming turd of a movie. Instead, read (or reread) Catcher in the Rye; or watch Rushmore, Tadpole, Harold & Maude, or Donnie Darko. Do situps in a dark room, or just watch bowling on TV while eating some pork rinds.

Ultimately, Burr Steers' movie is intended to be some sort of hip comedy -- the ribald music sountrack would clue you into that -- and I didn't laugh. The humor, however black, is the entry point into this movie through which you reach the deeper, sadder veins. That way, you can see Igby the way Steers does, as troubled but brave, and brazen, as a kid jerk trying to keep his head above the fray by his wits and fears.Because I snuck in the back door, so to speak, I found Igby depressing and his sophiscation juvenile. I was like the shrink in the movie's opening scenes, who smacks Igby upside the head. You can't really like a movie that's this frustrating, can you?The movie's opening half hour, I have to admit, put me in a foul mood with all its itty bitty scenes and tonal shifts. Steers takes a long time to settle down, and by then, I've had it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, but what's up this video?!","review":"Did I get the wrong video somehow? One of the best things about this movie (in the theatre) was the haunting refrain that you could also hear on the Igby Goes Down website. It's been a while since I saw the movie in the theatre but I couldn't have remembered it *this* incorrectly. Specifically, the music that helped make all of the scenes multi-layered and somewhat sad has apparently been replaced with the score from \\"The Parent Trap\\" -- you know, that kind of \\"screwball comedy\\" background music. Um, huh?It seems to me that maybe even some scenes have been spliced together differently -- was the beginning really like that in the theatre? Maybe I'm wrong there. But the goofy music...If anyone can solve this mystery for me, please do. I'm considering sending this tape back to Amazon for my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!!!","review":"I just got back from seeing this film at the theater, and I was just blown away.

He does horribly in all the schools he is sent to, and he decides to live with his god father's mistress secretly while avoiding another military school. I don't want to give much away, so I'll just end here. I highly reccomend this film to anyone who can appreciate great acting and an overall great film.

I suppose I thought this character capable of intelligent thought, but unfortunately, the script makes him do two so unfunny things, I can't reveal the horror without blowing the script.Look, I know everyone thinks Freud was wrong about homosexuality's derivation related to weak fathers and strong Ethel Merman like mothers, but this film is set up in such a way that I am convinced that the two brothers could not possibly be straight. I think that is a defect in the plot. Sexually they are normal, having sex with two beautiful girls, but, nahhh, I don't believe it from all the perversion of their world; why would they be straight?Black comedies are by definition laughs from unexpected sources, but we at least have to like the characters in a film to care about their problems.

It had some parallels with \\"Catcher in the Rye,\\" most notably, the main character, Igby. \\"Igby Goes Down\\" and \\"Catcher and the Rye's\\" main characters [Holden Caufield] were both outcasts with troubled lives. Although other than that, the similarities ended. The reason this movie worked is that even though Igby made some bad decisions, one still cared about him Kieran Culkin did an excellent part as what has become his niche, the sarcastic, troublemaking pariah. The supporting cast was also excellent with actors in roles one might not expect them to inhabit.

I love Claire Danes and Susan Sarandon, but even they couldn't hold my attention away from the fact that this movie isn't entertainment, it's not thought-provoking - it's just nothing! I thought \\"Vanilla Sky\\" was self-indulgent, but I'd watch that 100 times over before seeing this again.Don't get me wrong: I can deal with teen movies, and I'm a fan of \\"Catcher in the Rye,\\" but this movie is the most pretentious [movie] imaginable.

Cross also paints Kurt to be relatively weak and fearful. Maybe this is truly how Kurt is, yes, but I don't think it's fair to make assumptions about his mental processes as a therapist might do.

The only thing that was clear to me by the end of this \\"book\\" was that the scene of the crime screams that there was successful research done by the killer to make it look like a suicide, which also bolsters my deep suspicions of a certain widow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thorough and Moving Biography","review":"I don't know when I have been as deeply moved by a biography. Charles Cross did an excellent job of presenting Kurt Cobain in a way that neither glorified nor condemned him. I felt he did his very best to delve into Kurt's life and get to know the man behind the short, all-too-familiar tragic rock star legend. The hundreds of hours he spent interviewing those who knew and loved Kurt really came through. But what impressed me most was how he presented the unvarnished truth but in such a compassionate way. Of course I knew how Kurt's story ended, but I was nonetheless taken aback by how deep my grief was and how many tears I shed over the closing pages of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Information but supports Courtney Love","review":"In my opinion, this book has good biographical information but has wrong information concerning Kurt's death. Cross talks about Kurt based on information from Courtney Love, a contradictory liar and [woman]. ... Eldon Hoke was offered [money]to kill Kurt Cobain by Courtney Love. There are many inconsistencies and contradictions in the whole case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense","review":"I was pretty amazed at the amount of detail that he included. The research effort placed into this project must have consumed years of the author's life. I cannot think of any detail that one could have expected. It wants to make you think that he took several liberties, especially in the description of the suicide. Courtney Love makes out pretty well reputation-wise and one thinks that the author spared her in return for her cooperation, which was considerable. It is a must for all Cobain fans as it is definitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great decoration! I really like this.","review":"The voice is perfect.

This thing ranks right up there with the Forrest Gump cookbook: a rather uncreative way to milk even more money from a popular franchise.

Perhaps a student film?Just didn't do anything for me & the stalker factor was a turn-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my god is this movie dumb","review":"First time I have ever bothered to review anything, anywhere but this movie was so bad that I had to do it.

I threw the DVD in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and talent","review":"If you rent this for a buck, you MIGHT not be disappointed - it all depends on your expectations of a movie which stars two superb actors: hilary swank and jeffrey dean morgan. and like a previous reviewer stated, the cinematography, score, direction, are all above average. what's totally subpar is the absolutely derivative writing and lack of any real character dimension(s). For what you would assume would be a highly intelligent person in the role of an ER doctor, Ms. swank acts completely doofus while mr. morgan wanders around like an updated quasimodo...the only exciting(and hardly that!) moments occur during the last 10 or so minutes of the film - but you already knew what was coming - unless you fell asleep much earlier!! the two stars are for the two stars; without them carrying the movie, this would be a total and utter disrespect for one's own time...."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Resident\\" evil","review":"We who were happy to see Hammer resurrected after thirty film-less years may wish it'd stayed dead after seeing \\"The Resident,\\" the first film produced by the notorious schlock-gothic-horror production company since the 1970s. There are two core faults. The first is the casting of Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the antagonist. Morgan is just too lovable, too blindingly charismatic, to play a character we're supposed to fear or hate, although Morgan's performance is almost astonishingly good considering the material. The second is the script: co-written by the film's ruthlessly unimaginative director, Antti Jokinen (this is his first film), the story was a dead horse two decades ago, and the writers can't even fathom why it might need to be injected with something fresh or original. Who can't predict every point of the plot progression? \\"The Resident\\" is offensively dull, a sure disappointment for Hammer fans.

Hillary Swank is a very good actress, but any guy being obsessed with her is incomprehensible to me, much less one that looks and acts like a cross between Robert Downey Jr. and Huey Lewis on crack. She looks hot on the box cover, but you put the movie in and it's the winner of the Kentucky Derby all over again. I'm sorry, but talent and looks don't always go together, and this movie was a bad showcase for her talent. Just like Obsessed, Fatal Attraction, Mother May I Sleep with Dummy, and Sleeping with the Idiot, this is just another in a long line of predictable thrillers with no thrill at all. You've seen it before, heard about it before, smelled it before, etc. Pass this one up. If you want a good thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat the first time you watch it, check out The Perfect Host with David Hyde Pierce."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad return for Hammer","review":"Just saw this and have to say it was vastly underwhelming. Swank is a greatt actress, and the rest of the cast was decent as well, but they just had nowhere to go. What could've been a highly suspenseful, edge-of-your-seat thriller was marred by terrible dialogue, extremely predictable situations, and every cliche of these types of films in the book. And one of the saddest things was how Christopher Lee was wasted. The whole thing was painful to watch. Yeah, the camera work was a bit above par, and the reverse sequences were interesting, but the first went on way too long after we all got the idea. Hopefully, Hammer will improve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Bought this DVD thinking it would be pretty good since I like movies that are a little scary but filled with suspense.

What was I watching before I put in this? Captivity. What was the movie coming on after that? Sliver. Swank, a great actress, is her usual solid self but Morgan is just too good looking for the role, you know? Lee Pace is barely in the film, darn it all. And while I know New York is expensive, could Swank's character, even as a doctor, afford a $3800 apt? What about all her student loans? And, well, when Swank is all dolled up, she's good looking but rarely is Swank all dolled up in this film. The movie is actually not a B movie, by production and acting standards but it's such a recycled same old story that it can't be elevated beyond B status.You want to see a really good stalker/prey movie, see P2.

See it and you'll now what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Hilary Swank: FIRE YOUR AGENT!!!","review":"First off, I'm not a fan of Hilary Swank, nor do I hate her. It's just that after doing what most actresses can only dream--winning multiple acting Oscars--you would expect her to have a good sense for bad scripts. How this one slipped through is beyond me. This is your standard stalker movie, complete with the cliches of The Talking Killer and The Killer Who Looks Dead But Really Isn't.Kudos to Mr. Morgan, he was a little bit creepier than your usual stalker, and Christopher Lee did a nice job in all of the 2 minutes he was onscreen, but they weren't able to save this stinker. Save your money, watch some paint dry (it will be more entertaining too)."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"A\\" ACTORS IN A \\"B\\" MOVIE","review":"This is your classic \\"B\\" grade peeper movie with high priced actors. Hillary Swank plays an ER doctor looking for an apartment. She finds the idea place with a good looking landlord. The drawback is that Christopher Lee also lives there. The movie then shows you blurred views of Hillary naked from camera angles that make you think she is being watched. It also makes good use of shadows and noises to add to the effect that someone is in her apartment. Unfortunately this doesn't last long as the peeper/creeper is revealed way too soon, and it is not Eric Roberts. The movie short changes us on the nudity/sex scenes normally in a B grade movie and opts to give us some groping. They attempted to create a first class peeper film, but fell way short. I can't believe Hillary Swank isn't getting better movie offers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my time.........","review":"This movie is very poor, plain and simple. I was interested in seeing it because Christopher Lee was again appearing in a Hammer film and I thought perhaps that would be a good thing. Well, he IS, but the film is NOT! Every now and then I found titles that have gone direct to video that were worth viewing. IN this case, it just isn't so. How in the world did Hilary Swank get roped into this one? It must have looked good on paper, but this movie goes nowhere and it take a LONG time to do it.ON the plus side it is a good looking transfer with decent sound as well. But in the end that will not save it from having a very poor story that leaves you unfulfilled and wondering why you wasted a couple hours with it.

You say you haven't? I beg to differ. If you have seen anything like Lakeview Terrace,Fear, Unlawful Entry, Pacific Heights,The Crush, or any other number of movies that fall into the same genre then you have seen The Resident. The Resident does not bring anything new into the genre either. It follows the same boring and trite formula.

I agree with a previous reviewer who commented that the writing is self serving at times, but Austin's passion for his plants can be understood.

Being in something that you can't get out of is pretty hard but he made a choice he decided that he wanted to finish school and to stop hanging out with people that he knows he can get in trouble with or is bad influenced. I think that being in a gang is a big road block and an issue that's stopping you from succeeding. Being in a gang isn't important as being in college and making something of yourself in life.

During this 30 minutes this \\"mud\\" drips and runs. If you do light exercise, as I did, to increase results, anywhere you have walked, stood, or been will have this \\"mud\\" all over it and it does not clean up easily. I probably lost more weight cleaning up the mess than using the product. I now firmly believe if you want a body wrap treatment, pay a professional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virtually a keyboard","review":"The first one I received would work for ~15 minutes and then all the lights would come on and it would lock up. It did this on 3 different computers. The replacement didn't lock up but only half of the keys would register without significant pressure on the keys(as in old manual typewriter.)

They worked very well for me and I may order another. But before you rush to purchase one, you should clearly understand a few things.ONE: You have to hit the keys HARD. VERY HARD. These keyboards turned me into a very loud typist when using a more standard keyboard. On the other hand, these keyboards themselves are very quiet even when you are pounding away.TWO: I am a very poor typist. I have lousy technique and make a lot of errors. I suspect that one of the reasons why I like soft keyboards is that they force me to slow down and thus make fewer errors. I suspect that a great typist would not like a soft board.THREE: Yes you can wash these things with soap and water, but they still wear-out just like any keyboard.Where these devices excel is in a very dirty or wet environment and in healthcare setting where they can be sterilized quickly and easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor response","review":"I don't believe the keyboard is that functional if you want to type quickly.

The jelly like keys take a lot of getting used to, you have to press about twice as hard as regular keyboard keys. Though it looks cool, it gets filthy very fast and very easily which is why the best feature is the washable part. After owning this for only 9 months none of the 3 spacebars work and the E key stopped working entirely. Many of the working keys have to be pressed numerous times to work (at random). This keyboard had never left my desk and had only ever been wiped down with a slightly damp cloth. I had never curled it up, dropped it, spilled anything on it, twisted it or mistreated it in any way. It didn't even make it a year. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Keyboard.","review":"I've been using this keyboard for 4 1/2 years and I still love it. I really like how this keyboard is very quiet, that the keys are soft on my fingertips, and that spills do not result in having to buy a new keyboard. I do type slower on this keyboard than I would on a hard plastic keyboard, but the trade off worth it for me.It's held up really well over the years. Everything, including the backlighting, still works and the rubber is still soft and flexible. The printing has worn off of the keys I use for video games, but I've found that to be a consistent problem with all keyboards that make it to this age.I recommend this product to anyone adventurousness enough to try it AND willing to take a hit to typing speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool keyboard, but hardto use.","review":"I've beenusing this keyboard for over a month.

You have to push stright don on them with a fair amount of pressure, or they don't register.

The keys are too difficult to strike correctly; if you do not press them down directly in the middle you will not get a keystrike and instead hit a 'glancing blow' that produces no result.And the ultmate deal breaker: The ON/OFF switch for the light is exactly where the CTRL key should be! I only used it for an hour and in that hour I must have turned the light on or off 6 times when trying to copy/paste.Please, unless you have perfect finger control, save your money and look elsewhere for a lit/backlit keyboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe someone would give 5 starts","review":"I got this keyboard based on the good reviews it got.

The only way you can type on this keyboard, is if you looking down on the keys and firmly press on each key. If you like me, who types without looking on the keyboard, this keyboard will drive you nuts as you realize that you mistype because you didn't press the key hard enough.

I like how I can roll it up. For some reason there are two extra unmarked keys that don't do anything to the right of the space key, which is smaller as a result. The keys are also a bit far apart and you have to hit them pretty hard and dead on in order for them to register. Given the key spacing the the stroke distance, this is not a speed typing keyboard. It is a good portable keyboard for your laptop that can be used in the dark and basically jammed into your bag. So for limited purposes, where you want a full size keyboard that does not take up too much space, this is a good product. Also nice that you can just rinse it off (haven't tried this yet)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this keyboard..","review":"I really wanted to like this keyboard; really I did.

I have always had German Shepards and I took them to basic training, then the rest was easy. But, I got a male German Shepard puppy, who took me to the brink. He was biting everything, including me, and I couldn't stop him. I bought this book for HELP. It actually gave some great suggestions, but there was one part that I didn't like. Brian seems to tout that it is the owner's 'fault' if the dog is problematic. I disagree, just like with kids, dogs each have their own personalities. Some dogs are easy-going, gentle, and easy to train. Other dogs are tempermental, aggresive, and tough to train. In fact, I would go so far as to say, that some dogs have emotional problems, just like some kids do.So, I would recommend this book, but with the reservation that he is a little too hard on owners.

I refused to read it, but before I knew it, I was searching for it all over the place at home. When I finally found it, I took it to my room, read it, learned it, and put it back where I had found it. The next day mom saw me training the pup, taking it for a walk, bathing it, taking it to the vet for vaccinations, and all that. Mom was surprised all right. So she asked me how I knew so much on dogs. I had no option and so I told her that I had read the book she had bought for me.

The book is based on the idea of dominating your dog. A terrible and cruel approach. Instead of this book get \\"Culture Clash\\" by Jean Donaldson--the BEST book I have read about dog training. \\"Culture Clash\\" involves treating your dog with respect and affection, using a POSITIVE instead of a PUNITIVE approach.

I personally feel like many methods in this book are harsh. For example some uses of the shake can are somewhat upsetting to me. It is suggested if your puppy is crying in his crate to hide around a corner and throw the shake can on the floor near him. Using this method you frighten your dog every time they cry. I have two dogs I have trained with positive reinforcement and it hurts me to think about training them using fear. While I'm sure this method works I personally do not agree with it.

It gets hot while you're using it and for the length of time keeping it in one area, it doesn't remove much hair at all.

They expected me to use the same hair removal pads as a previous owner which is disgusting. I attempted to contact them multiple times by e-mail and phone. They always promised to send me a pre-paid return shipping label, but even after confirming my address multiple times, I never received anything. After three months of unfulfilled promises, I was left with no choice but to file a claim with amazon. Be aware of this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"$11.55 for shipping?!?!","review":"They must be shipping this product from Mars! I wish Amazon would do something about vendors that lower the price of products to get people interested and then charge unrealistic shipping fees to increase revenue. It is poor business and it damages the reputation of Amazon partners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not work","review":"I got this in hope would find something that would be an alternative to expensive and painful waxing or irritating shaving. I used it, I was very patient, i probably spent about an hour on my legs. I tried varying pressures, mostly attempting to keep it light like the instructions said but also mixing it up. It sis not work at all. I was left with lots of hair that I had to shave off right after which hurt. the pads wore down before I was done with my legs. I am not skinny but I'm not fat either athletic track runner build. I am black with sensitive skin, not sure how this might affect it but just though I would put that out there. It works okay for exfoliating, a bit painful, good for the feet I suppose. Its not really worth the hassle but I will use since I spent my money already. I really hoped this product would work but it did not. Guess I will have to save up for laser."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse hair remover product","review":"If you have sensitive and thin skin, don't buy it. It left my arms bleeding. I prefer waxing and shaving a lot more.I can't return the item and am going to throw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"KEEP AWAY!","review":"I bought this hair removal system in the forlorn hope that it would actually work well to remove body hair. After reading through the instructions a few times and trying it out, I found this product to be a complete waste of time and money. I tried to remove hair using the booklet's method of light fast passes across the area in a clockwise motion. This did nothing. it removed no hair whatsoever. When I tried a more agressive approach, I found my skin to be red, irritated and downright painfull for the next three to four days. This product does not work. I dont know if the people who gave this thing five stars were bribed or what, but this product simply doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but doesn't cut it close","review":"I have very tough and coarse hair like nylon fibers. This product did the trick and left me smooth in the areas where I wanted. The product manual states that one hair removal pad is good for 30 uses. That may be true. However, with my experience with the product, it worked very well and quickly the first go around and if you used the same pad a second time [it took me] it can take 30 minutes to one hour of trying to remove a small area of hair with poor results. If you bought a bundle of replacement cartridges and changed it every time the pad wore out it would be a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"I found this to be an entirely useless product. You are more or less SANDING YOUR SKIN! And when I say sanding, I don't mean like microdermabrasion. Pointless, painful, sanding of the skin. It does sand the hair down, but not any different than shaving does and it grows back just as fast. Don't waste your time or money. Buy good wax and a warmer instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"did not work!","review":"did not like at all when you press down to lightly nothing happens and to hard causes bad scratching of the skin ouch, maybe I am just not skilled with it yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sham","review":"This sander barely did more than sand my legs. If I persisted long enough to actually remove hair, I paid for it for the next few days with sanded skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I don't like it! If you have sensitive skin, beware! It burns your skin. I didn't press hard, just followed directions.Not a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective","review":"One mostly empty of fluid, one okay...very unreliable.

The first two, from well known companies, never worked consistently with all of my peripheral devices and never worked at all with a few of them.This one works perfectly all the the time without fail. I don't have to give it a second thought which is exactly what a usb hub should do.And when I do see it, it looks good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does exactly what I need","review":"I went to Amazon.com to buy the Belkin stackable USB hubBELKIN F5U237 Hi-Speed USB 2.0 7-Port Huband found this one instead. I really like it. One of the biggest problems I was having with the old hub I was replacing was that it was so darn small and light that it kept falling off of my computer with the slightest movement of cables. The weighted base on this hub is a really big plus. Also, having a rounded base makes it easier to plug in USB cables because there is actual space between the connectors. Not a huge benefit, but it is nice.It works great as a usb hub and I have not had any issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hub USB port Do Not Mirror Computer USB port","review":"I purchased the Kensington HUB expecting all of the USB ports on the HUB would mirror the computer USB ports. Found that neither my iPhone nor my HP Simple Save work when attached to the HUB. Service tech department at Kensington suggested I read the specs a bit more closely.
