Its pretty good and its was nice intro into the world of the Green Lanterns history. Of course its about the Green Lantern Hal Jordan and some of the others in the corp.

Animation is done well and the voice acting is right on par with some of those other animated series like Batman animated series and Superman series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film","review":"With the telling of GL's story done so many times it's nice to see a slightly different spin. It was also nice to see Hal get his training. Now with the live action movie coming out soon this would be a good movie to watch to introduce the GL to those who may not know him. This way when they see the live action they will be better prepared to appreciate the special effects.

I like the character but I don't follow comic books, so I mostly see stuff when it gets made into movies. (I have some graphic novels, but none with GL) To me, this is a good movie because it shows some more about the other characters in the GL universe. Instead of focusing on Hal Jordan, you get to see some of the other GL regulars in personal stories and even a story from the beginning of the GL Corps. Plus, the movie's overall plot is a good setting for \\"story time\\" between Hal and the young GL he's mentoring. I mostly bought this because I was already buyingGreen Lantern: First Flight (Two-Disc Special Edition)and this was listed as \\"frequently bought together\\" and it looked good.

While there are some weak stories, there are some really good stories. My favorie story is one where Atrocitus makes an apperance.

In 2007, they've made the Quantity and Total Cost fields required on recurring investments. So now if you're tracking your 401k or any investment where you're doing fixed amounts you have to put junk data in there and then deleted when it auto calculates the actual values each month which is always frustrating because if you don't do it in the right order it goes back and fills in fields you just cleared.Other than that, no noticeable difference between it and the older versions except they rearranged everything.This is basic buy cost averaging investing 101 done by anyone with a 401k or monthly investment regiment.

While the above described bug has been fixed, new bugs are now present. Further, MS Money 2007 no longer integrates with MSN Money online; hence, all the portfolio data for investments must either be entered manually into MSN Money's online portfolio feature, or one simply accepts that the portfolio can only be accessed and maintained with MS Money 2007 on one's home computer.

I assure you your time will be better spent using Quicken, www.yodlee.com, or Microsoft Excel to do your finances. This product line is, quite simply, crappy. If only I could bill Microsoft for the hundreds of wasted hours I've spent trying to feed information into this software, only to output hundreds of colorful charts whose data I don't trust.

Microsoft realizes this is a problem and if you go to their online help center, they have a fix for it. Actually 11 different fixes. You start with Method 1, go through all the required steps, then try Money. If Money still doesn't log on to Windows ID, then go to Method 2 and on and on and on until you get to Method 11. This takes several un-installs, several new installs, lots of searches for hidden files that you need to delete, and lots of restarts. You will spend hours of your time trying to install a computer program. After Method 11, I still couldn't log in (but my installation on my Windows XP computer works fine).

The application frequently stalls, it will not reopen files it has created and Money's file repair features do not work. It sometimes asks for the same updates to its software, and many times it will not close properly. Money's customer support does not appear to have the necessary tools to resolve these product issues. I have personally reloaded Money Deluxe 4 times on advice of MS Money's customer support and created nearly a dozen new files because the previous Money files failed to open for some unknown reason. The software has too many bugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer supports Pocket PC's","review":"If you want to upgrade and continue to use Money on your Pocket PC, don't bother.

There is absolutely no new feature except some good graphics that may please people who bought new LCD monitors rather than those who are serious about their money. How ironic that Microsoft expects you to spend money on a recycled software to manage money.I guess Microsoft thinks that if they increment their version number to the next year (just like US car manufacturers do), people may buy it thinking that they are ahead of the game. That's why they keep releasing new titles with the version number of next year though their software is year behind compared to other products.If you have Money 2003 or older, don't buy this package"},{"rating":"1","title":"READ BEFORE PURCHASING","review":"WARNING IF YOU DOWNLOAD MONEY PLUS FREE TRIAL AND USE IT, THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT WORK FOR YOU.

Well im gonna cut this tape some slack. Its awesome, especially if youre a beginner moving up to and intermediate exersicer. There are 3 instructors, Lisa Kay, Allie del rio, and Nancy Tucker. If you have the BSS1 FIRM tapes then you are familiar with them. They each take turns teaching different segments, which range from high impact plyos to slow dips on the short box. The one thing i love the most about this tape is the ab segment with Lisa. Its one of the best the firm has ever done and my abs are always sore after doing it. This tape is easier than past firm tapes so if you are an advanced exerciser then you might want to look elsewhere for a challenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best","review":"I have lots of Firm videos, and this one is my least favorite. It is very dated, and is spliced from other videos. I myself, like new videos to add to my collection, not re-mixes of old ones. The moves are also very 80s; grapevines, plyos, etc. Lots of jumping so it's very high impact. I would recommend you buy a different Firm tape, or at least read the reviews from other tapes first before you buy this one. My faves are: Crosstrainers, Total Body Shaping Mix, Time-Crunch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and misleading.","review":"I was very disappointed with this FIRM volume. I have several other FIRM workout tapes and this is by far the worst I've seen. The floor aerobics portion is continually billed throughout the workout as being \\"low impact aerobics\\". It is not at all low impact except for the occasional marching. Mostly it is actually high impact with jumps, jumping jacks, and leaping side lunges. Aside from this, the music does not match the workout pace and could be confusing to some. I am also concerned about the safety of the abs section. They do something called a rocking crunch that can't be good for the back. It certainly hurts mine, so I won't do them that way. I love the FIRM and they have some great tapes. This is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"A friend got me into the Firm tapes. I have viewed 3 of the ones she uses and really liked them. They all had good overall workouts that really make you sweat. So I ordered 2 different videos then the ones I had viewed, the Fat Blaster being one of them. The camera work is terrible! The camera would move before a foot sequence was complete, so I had to stop several times in mid-step not knowing what the next move was. I also found this video to be too easy in comparison with the other videos I viewed. A fat blaster it is not!I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I viewed this tape and sent it back. It's very difficult and unmotivating.

I bought this video and have been using it for about two months. I like to alternate it with other Firm videos that use heavier weights because I don't think it's good to use the heavy weights every day. The Fat Blaster workout gives me a good aerobic workout, and it has a great ab routine. I'm still working at mastering the step routines, which move very quickly. Some of the routines use a dowel to help with balance, but this is probably not necessary for more advanced exercisers."},{"rating":"1","title":"by far the worse Firm video!","review":"This is not a total body workout. It has a strong emphasis on aerobics & very little body scuplting. The instructors are horrible. I agree with some of the other reviewers that this video has unsafe moves. This is not up to par with other videos in the Firm series.I have 9 firm videos - this is the worse. Better ones to try: Firm Aerobic Mix (if you're looking for a aerobic workout) or Total Body Abs Hips and Thighs Sculpting."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've changed my mind!","review":"I gave this video a bad review, above,when I first bought it.I got it out again, and did it a few times, along with another Firm video called Tough Tape.These are both excellent workouts.

Go figure.I use my two Firm videos more than all of my other videos combined.:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I wasn't in the best mood today, but since I usually love the FIRM, I thought I could do it and it could lift up my spirits. Boy was I wrong. The aerobic sections with Allie were okay, but I really did not like Lisa Kay. I felt like they were making the workout choreography way too complicated. I have never been good with L-steps, but I tell ya, I just did not like Lisa Kay's cueing. Also, Lisa Kay looked, I wouldn't say pudgy, but not as fit as the other instructors. Looked to me like she had a belly. Anyways, overall, I did not like this tape. I will probably give it one more try in view of the fact that I was in a bad mood, and if I like it better, I may come back and give it a better review, but I doubt it.

If you are in any kind of decent shape at all, this video will do nothing for you. I was expecting more work with weights--there was hardly any. I have wimpy muscles and it was still too easy for me.The instructors talk constantly, only they're calling out moves you won't be doing for a few more seconds. Then, moves are only repeated a couple times and as soon as they're caught on to, you're off to another brief set of moves--again, with instructors talking about something else.Too choppy, too confusing, too wimpy, too fakey. I felt like I took a brisk walk around the block when I was done, not like I had a \\"Total Body Workout\\", and I'm not exactly a fitness machine.Hope the other Firm videos are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite workout! EVER!","review":"I love all my firm tapes but this is my favorite because it is 45 min. (instead of the usual hour) It has a good amount of weights/lunges/abs etc. while focusing on cardio--big time! I don't usually like jumping around to much but the hight intensity segments are balanced with lower intensity step work. But, the best part of this video is the upbeat and interesting music--it is VERY motivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"great tape","review":"This is an oldie but a goodie. The ab section is fantastic!

Gillquist knows how to write and his forthright style is unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!","review":"Nothing but kudos and congratulations on a wonderful book, perfectly geared for Americans wishing to know more about the Orthodox Church. Christianity in the United States tends towards appreciating 'conversion stories' (actually, it's a phenomon in the Orthodox Church as well, but of a different ethos), and if you are an American looking into the Orthodox Church, this book will give you a small taste of what to expect, and will inspire you to go forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"One man's journey","review":"I was hoping for more of a \\"how to guide\\" for protestants to enter the Orthodox church, but this is more of a questioning and exploration into the Orthodox church which most of us who are seeking to actually become Orthodox have largely already been through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of mixed emotion...","review":"While the enthusiasm expressed in this work is encouraging, as is the energy witnessed in its expression, it is nonetheless wanting in the extent of its content.Written while the author and his colleagues were new to Orthodoxy, it expresses much more of the 'coming home' sentiment and excitement than it does a detailed description of Orthodox theology or the Church. It is the author's 'conversion experience,' and not so much a discussion of what he was converting to, that is the focus of the work.Yet this book will still find a strong readership in those who are from a Protestant/Evangelical background and are considering Orthodoxy, or are simply intrigued and interested in it. From that perspective, 'Becoming Orthodox' offers insights that will strike close to home, and address many of the issues that are encountered when viewing Orthodoxy from such a background."},{"rating":"1","title":"an american conversion","review":"as these reviews should try to help u make a decision regarding a purchase i will say this. this book is about a group of evangelicals who attempt NOT to join orthodoxy directly but, to have their INVENTED church brought into the orthodox family of churches. after their studies they did not go for chrismation at the local church; they wanted their own still. if you read this book carefully you will see that this is a wonderful and unwitting comment on american religious conversion. their church is called the EVANGELICAL orthodox church, take note. is it any wonder they were received with hostility in constantinople? by the way, i like the orthodox faith so i wouldn't wish any of our evangelicals on them. this is a mixed development. already you have people droning on about homosexuality et al. as usual, an interest in early christianity sparks a conversion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evangelicals who journey East..........","review":"and it makes sense.

My review for Trio HLP applies even more to this recording. This is great bebop jazz violin. Ponty's playing here is best described as a mixture of Bird and Coltrane.

This is JLP's first album, originally released in 1964. The quartet also includes Eddy Louiss (keys) and Daniel Humair (drums), which have played on many early JLP albums, while Gilbert Rovere and Guy Pedersen take turns on double-bass duties.Some of the songs performed have been penned by people like Charlie Parker, Django Reinhardt, Duke Ellington and Dizzy Gillespie. Tracks are 3-4 minutes in length, so include no extrapolation or development like found on, for example, \\"More Than Meets The Ear\\" or \\"Electric Connection\\".The sounds have this \\"club\\" feel to them, and most of the material is classic jazz, with the addition (odd for the times) of violin.

It required my engineering hat, (something I have had to learn how to wear... not a natural talent,) to figure out. Even so I feared it would release the phone, so I was glad to read of others confidence based on their StarTac experience.I can appreciate that it is difficult to ergonomically design a carrying device for a flip phone. The current clip holder works, it is just too bulky and requires a lot of practice to smoothly release the phone from the clips.

Don't believe it? Then check out his performance here. Kilmer carries \\"Thunderheart,\\" which without his subtle performance would be just another thriller, and an overly P.C. one at that. You know early on that his character is going to undergo an epiphany during the film. But watching him do it is what makes the movie so entertaining. Like with his Doc Holliday charater in \\"Tombstone,\\" Kilmer shows the ability to completely submerge himself in his acting. He really is that good. Sam Shepard makes a good supporting character, even if he does become a cliche toward the end.

The book's pertinant underlying theme is the importance of the family unit, and the perserverance of the human spirit through times of hardship. It should not be forgotten, however, that the book is an idealization, a toned-down version, of pioneer life. Wilder was later accused of distorting and fabricating her stories, an aligation which shocked her because it had been her intention to write stories, not history.

I have a number of the tapes and use the Body Sculpting System 1 religiously. I must say that I didn't like this video at all. I actually sold it after one use. The moves were too choreographed and the cueing is awful. In addition, proper form was not emphasized in a majority of the segments. If you didn't know, the video is a compilation of the best of the Firm's Body Shaping Series. So if you think that it is 1 hour of Tracie Long, WRONG!!! There are at least four different instructors and everyone is not the best teacher!! Tracie Long is the best! Her segments come from the Firm's Maximum Body Shaping tape. Save your money and purchase that!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE FIRM Total Body Shaping Mix","review":"THE FIRM Total Body Shaping Mix is a great workout that uses weights I have all the Firm videos. But, this one will work you.So, if you want a good muscle shaping/toning/ strengthing workout this one is it. It's about 67 mins long It does have about 13 mins of cardio. and I love Tracie Long She is an excellent instuctor.It does use a barbell and the fanny lifter but, weights and any step up box will work.

I wish I could have been there, but this is the next best thing. The sound is superb, as is the clarity of the video. The shots are nice in that there is a fairly equal time on each musician and from different angles. If you're a drummer, you'll enjoy the shots and angles of filming Ginger Baker. He still rolls up his right pant leg to prevent the pedal beater from catching. I remember that trick from my bell bottom days and smiled when I saw this. This DVD is not like videos from earlier shows, like Cream's final show where the video's were painful to watch. The song selection is just right and everyone appears to be enjoying themselves. I highly recommend this DVD as one of the best of the last few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BOYS ARE BACK!","review":"I was initially skeptical,have read less than glowing reviews in the newspapers.

I bought this dvd on the basis of the reviews & I gotta say that as a big fan of the group, I was disappointed with this concert. The band was flat. Simple as that. I didn't even finish watching it. I understand that this reunion wasn't something that Bruce and Baker, who can't stand each other, really wanted to do (they've admitted that it was more for financial reasons than anything else) and it shows. The performances just don't have any enthusiasm. If you watch old Cream from the 60's, the intensity that they played with back then was seriously lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"tired old men","review":"tired old men who were never really all that \\"back in the day\\". Overrated in their heyday. Time hasn't been kind too any of the 3. A few (very few) of their tunes got to me back in the 60's.

The creme de la Cream, this is NOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone Give Eric Some Uppers!","review":"This would have been a great Cream show if Jack and Ginger had toured with a handful of great guitarists instead tired, worn out Eric Clapton. Eric's a bit of a bore -- it's obvious when he's interviewed -- but proved without doubt in his playing. If they had toured with Eddie Van Halen, Buddy Guy, Jeff Beck and Robin Trower - this would have been the show it should have been. There's just enough here to get you excited, then let down everytime you focus on Eric's horrible tone and thoughtless solos. If Eric had played a different 335 and SG everynight, he could have sold each for a small fortune afterwards, and made the show sound stronger. I don't think he ever even used the bridge position on his stratocaster!"},{"rating":"1","title":"True Cream fans beware!","review":"As a true Cream and British rock fan, this show is a complete disappointment. I had high expectations and was really let down. Clapton was, is, and will always be, one of my favorite musicians, but this was NOT Cream. It was more like Clapton's newer pop stuff. The 2005 show was completely watered-down, tired, and commercialized. Jack Bruce was excellent on bass, but it just did not come close the the edgy intensity of the early days. I guess I was expecting magic. I should have rented it before I purchased it. After watching this concert, I had to pop in the 1968 Farewell concert to get the horrible taste out of my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE - FALSE ADVERTISING","review":"Although the track listings on both Amazaon and the Cream 2005 site describe this CD set as being the complete show, IT IS NOT - \\"Sitting on Top of the World\\" has been dropped.

There is plenty of room on the CDs, and there is a very good recording of the song on the DVD, but for reasons known only to themselves the record company decided to omit this number.[...]This release is a disgrace. I wish I could give it zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleepy Time Time","review":"The lads really sound like it was past their bedtime. They sure put me to sleep. Just going through the motions for the dough I guess. Clapton's Stratocaster comes up short. It just doesn't have that tone. Maybe the drugs they were taking back in the sixties were better. Overall, a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going through the motions","review":"Jack is obviously not well. Ginger's kit sounds like an 80's pop band and Eric should just throw away that awful sounding Strat.Ok we can't have a replica I know.Eric's choice of notes is just not as good as it used to be. He was way more adventurous back in the day.No more of the lyrical phrasing, the calm excitement and melodies under extreme pressure. All gone and replaced with just going through the motions.I hope Jack and Ginger make a buck out of it. They certainly deserve it.The music died the day Clapton picked up a Stratocaster. He never really bonded with it.Anyway it looks like a lounge band playing covers. Very polite and laidback and nothing new to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"ultimate\\" classic rock","review":"Classic rock is a major quantity today on radio. Well, if you want to hear the true classic rock then purchase and listen to this grand effort by three of its finest purveyors.

The age factor is forever present. But, they still can play rings around the twenty year olds of today!

The song selection was fairly inclusive though Stormy Monday was a surprise. Clapton's playing seems inspired. Claptom seems to be avoiding the wah wah pedal which is especially noticeable on White Room. The sound is great and sounds as good as they did on the Fairwell concert video."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best live Cream","review":"I loved Cream as a youngster - the studio albums especially. On live recordings, Cream often sounded more like three guys competing with each other than a band. NOT THIS TIME!!!

This two-disc set is a wonderful document of a tremendous, musical performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm So Glad","review":"This is an amazing concert. To see Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker and Eric Clapton come together again is simply a remarkable experience. I taped this off PBS a while back, and loved every minute of it.

While it seems from a listening that Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker are primed to \\"rev up\\" Eric Clapton's playing is so uninspired and so careless, the original \\"supergroup\\" never takes off.While I may be criticized as a purist, Clapton's choice of his muddy Stratocaster sound cannot compare with his former Gibson sound - which is what this recording so desperately needs. CREAM stood out because of Clapton's tone - his phrasings on those recordings, 37 years ago.The closest I have seen him come to his original genius lately is on John Mayall's \\"70th Birthday Concert,\\" where Mayall guitarist Buddy Whittingham and Mick Taylor so challenge \\"Slowhand\\" he finally seems to wake up and play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Recording or Lack of Quality Control","review":"I have the second copy of Cream - Royal Albert Hall - 2005 from Amazon. The company replaced the first one when Disc 2 wouldn't play at all. Unfortunately, the second one arrived just after I left the house for a month, and when I returned and tried viewing it, both discs had the same problem as Disc 2 in the first shipment. Also, unfortunately, Amazon won't take anything back after 30 days, so I got a bum deal with both orders. Amazon was good about the first replacement, but not being able to even contact anyone about the problem with the second has me bummed out. After years of buying from Amazon, I will be shopping at Wal-Mart and Sam's Club from now on: they have real people who will really honor their warranties. Hasta la vista, Amazon.Tom Gennings"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Ever","review":"Cream live in 2005 has to be, even to the most jaded fan of Cream or Clapton in particular,a revelation.The playing on this far exceeds anything one could hope for or expect.The way in which they play together now is far more enjoyable to listen to,than the way in which they use to jam in their heyday.They actually listen to each other and play off of each other in a way that leaves todays jam bands looking pretty amatuer.The emotion and timing Clapton uses in his solos combined with the fluid bass playing by Bruce and the taste of the drum fills by Baker make it hard to pick out just a few moments as highlights.Everyone that plays an instrument, especially guitar players, should own this,not only is it enjoyable as a concert but there is alot to learn from it on a musical level.Take it all in and enjoy,simply spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A dream Come True\\"","review":"I can't put into words how happy I am that this reunion came to be. The band was great..We all have to appreciate the fact that ever since Cream broke up, it was only on occasion that each member played in bands with just 3 musicians..i.e. Most of the members band's had Keyboards, Rythum guitars, etc. My point is, for a great musician like Clapton, he had to resort back to doing all the guitar work, keeping the sound full, as a result of playing both \\"lead\\" and \\"Rythum\\". In any event, a wonderful job!!My only regret is that Clapton stuck to a strat for the entire concert, as opposed to using other guitars that he had played in Cream, such as a Les Paul, SG, Firebird, Explorer, etc. This is what I observed in NYC, at the Madison Square Garden concert. Even though he emulated the sounds pretty well, It would have been interesting to see him play the others...Anyway, all in all it was beautiful sight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and Nostalgic","review":"I really enjoyed viewing this video.

I was 2, 3, 4, 5 years old when Cream was doing their thing. I knew I was a baby during trhe wrong time but I was lucky to have seen Clapton live and Jack Bruce live in Ringo's tour. So, this concert was very hard to get tickets for and it never happened -- but thanks to CDs and DVDs in 2006.This double live CD of Cream's reunion tour of 2005 is amazing. In a great concert year where we had the Stones, McCartney, Queen with Paul Rodgers, U2 and Sprinsteen, Cream was the icing on the cake!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"subdued? i think not","review":"cream is one of the greatest rock bands of all-time.eric clapton,jack bruce,and ginger roger are greats in each of their respected categories. after all these years they're back and as good as ever.they're a bit more bluesy but that is what is expected of 3 guys in their 60's. and for these guys they can still shred,especially clapton.while watching this i could actually feel for their fingers,picturing them bleed at the intensity of their music,fond memories of the past.the best song in the set is probably \\"rollin' and tumblin', but \\"sunshine of your love\\", the closer has to be a close second as they jam away on it.if you're a fan of cream and eric clapton this shouldn't disappoint.only those who don't know what real rock is would disapprove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's catch our breath folks..","review":"Saw Cream at the Murry the K Show in 66. and six times before they broke up. Let me just say that this band was not just about music. It was part of an energy field that occurred at a certain point on time that may never be duplicated. Cream, Jimi,Dylan, Mick, the Dead, Jim and Janis..it was much more than music....To tap into that long lost energy field by recreating the music forty years later - a Stones Concert, this amazing Cream reunion, McCartney on stage, Dylan-its really a spiritual trip...Do you think thirty years from now, there will be REM reunion concerts?...Green Day in 2035? Think on it and just retap into the energy that is no more..btw, Clapton IS God..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey look at me!","review":"This dvd is'nt even released yet and I'm gonna write a review about it.

A few minutes after I started watching it I noticed parts were out of sync. Then I watched closer. Everything was out of sync! Clapton's playing a chord when you hear a ripping solo. That bad. Lips are moving, but no words begin to come out for a few more seconds. The music is awesome, but don't get this to watch Clapton rip it up. It just doesn't work.5 Stars for the music... Go and buy the CD instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this a collect call or did they at least pay the charges?","review":"Whatever the case, they phoned this one in.Because of who they are however, this call has to be justified. Clapton, Bruce and Baker are all top-flight musicians and whatever they do, together or otherwise, isn't likely to be really bad. All three are simply too good at what they do for that to happen. Their reunion, as such, was far from bad. On a purely technical level what they played was rock solid.But it wasn't inspired. Nobody pushed anybody. Bruce and Baker laid a foundation and Clapton played off of it. Nothing more and nothing less. Bruce never made Baker play harder and neither of them gave Eric anything to really react to. Yes, they were solid. This gets two stars for that. But they were just going through the motions.Anyone looking for inspired playing shouldn't bother with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Beef?!","review":"This is a really bad, lackluster performance. The songs are barely recognizable without the energy that these guys exuded in their heyday. Clapton's guitar playing completely lacks enthusiasm as does the entire performance. If I'd been there, I'd have fallen asleep. Their age is no excuse for this. The Stones are just as old and exhibit more enthusiasm. Hell, B.B. King, at 80, rocks stronger than these guys! Sounds as if they'd rather have been somewhere else, and probably should have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon people.","review":"I think the only reason this gets any good reviews is because it's new and the audio quality on the dvd transfers to our lil' home theaters so we can sit on our butts and watch these guys sit on their butts in concert.It's not completely horrible. They're all good musicians, but just a little too stiff and akward. We all know this was done just for money like most of Clapton's releases. Bruce and Baker were in need of some $$ and wanted to do this for quite a while.It's forgettable and lame. The choice of instruments for this show pretty much summed it up. When I saw photos on the internet I knew this was what it was going to sound like and feel like. I hope most of you bought it used-I'm glad I borrowed from a friend before he sold it."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"What a disappointment!

Some of the songs are classic, but the performances sound tired considering the importance of the gig! The picture quality is slick, of course. The sound quality is good and bad, almost too clinical sounding for its own good. Maybe I would have felt different if this was to promote a NEW album, but it's all nostalgia.My other favorite \\"classic rock\\" band Deep Purple does have a NEW album, \\"Rapture of the Deep\\" and it truly kicks arse! This is not only vintage Purple, it's modern day classic rock. One of their finest.What upsets me is that the American media will promote this recycled Cream dream, but completely ignore the new and innovative Deep Purple disc. Talk about the state of the art!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Strange Brew?????","review":"I'm a Cream fan, but I have not seen any of the reunion concerts.

This is why the man was declared GOD back in the 60's during his stint with the Bluesbreakers, cause he could play. He played like a GOD with Cream from 1966 - 1968 and in 2005 he proves he still has the chops! No 2nd or 3rd guitarist, piano and keys to flesh out the sound, just bass, drums and Claptons guitar. Easily the best Clapton related release in many many years! The rest is just gravy, Jack Bruce, I mean come on...Everyone from Lemmy to Les Claypool idolize this guy, and he he still terrific after all these years. Ginger, rocks first powerhouse drummer, what a great solo during Toad, very defined.If you close your eyes you'd think these guys have been playing together for the last 35 years. Amazing stuff! Great DVD to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"welcome reunion","review":"This video documents the reunion of Cream and it doesn't disapoint. Yes they are older and Crossroads is reimagined, but the band is in fine form. Audio on this disc is top notch.

The only drawback is that it will only play in a HD-DVD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cream Royal Albert Hall","review":"I bought the DVD for my boyfriend. I had never heard of Cream, even though I like Eric Clapton, I didn't know that Cream was his old group until I watched the video. I played it for a party and the 50 plus guys really liked it.

It's a good party DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cream-Tired Giants","review":"It's really sad to see these guys just going through the motions. Nothing in this DVD set or the associated CD set even comes close to the old Cream recordings from the '60's. The most glaring and obvious example of this is \\"Crossroads\\". Compared to the classic \\"Wheels of Fire\\" version, this new recording is yawn inspiring. Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce seem to have a hard time getting interested. All of the intricate interplay between guitar and bass on the earlier recording are just a memory. I guess that either Jack Bruce or Ginger Baker or both of them were running short on cash.

Burn a copy off of a friend. They are obviously all still accomplished at their instruments. The fact that the three of them are still alive & can play is immense on it's own right. We know, their all great-hall of fame,etc etc. One reviewer said they are all playing \\"like a band\\" now, thats not what we want from Cream! We want that abusive \\"crawling over each others parts\\" type of playing. Take I'm so glad. On the original, by the time Clapton's solo is peaking, Bruce is playing as high on the fretboard as EC. That \\"fighting\\" is what made them (in my mind) what they were. Now, it's a more polite version, its almost been reduced to a shuffle-which does not work! The overall performance sounds forced. If you happen to see the DVD, it's even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clapton Continues To \\"Phone It In\\"","review":"I'm so disappointed! Could these songs be any slower or boring?

Unfortunately, I was disapointed with the DVD in terms of the camera work and direction. So many shots were out of focus that you have to wonder whether the guys on camera were inexperiened or on drugs. The other issue was the director who switched so often between shots that I was disappointed not to see Ginger in particular in full flight and from a wider perspective.

Their talent, dedication, honesty, and musicianship blended, then and now, to create songs and a sound as unique as it is spellbinding.If you think they should have worn the same clothes and used the same instruments as they did in 1968, if you feel they should apologize for aging during the last 37 years, then you might want to skip this performance.If you love the songs and music, here is Fresh Cream. Amen.John"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy crap!!!","review":"If you are a Cream or a bluesy Clapton fan then you will regret not getting this CD. I always liked Cream but this CD made me truly appreciate the excitement of many of non-radio songs (Spoonful, Politician, etc.), which actually come off much better live than the radio staples. This is definitely a concert by three equals: Clapton is in terrific form in the role of a guitar player and occasional singer; Jack Bruce kills on the bass and lends his distinctive lead vocals; Ginger beats the hell out the drums and occasionally chimes in with his distinctive Cockney voice. I find myself listening tracks repeatedly just to follow what one of them is doing throughout the song without getting distracted by the better known licks! Would have been awesome to see live. Can't wait to check out the DVD.Come on, go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice! Finally!","review":"If you are looking for a Cream live in conert, this is the music DVD for you!

The cream of the crop in the 60's - Jack, Ginger and Eric put on a show of immense importance. To hear these super talented guys play together again was a gift and luckily they made a DVD of the event.SADDLY the video director had not a clue of the importance of the talent before him. The guitar player once referred to as GOD is in the middle of a blazing guitar solo and this inept director shows a close up of Eric face! Terrible camera angles add to the abysmal coverage.

This offering is far removed from the way I remember them. All of cream are the same age as I am, and it showed. Poor Jack was recovering from surgery and has lost is voice and stamina. Ginger was subdued but who would have expected him to still be alive. Eric, well he was just going through the motions. But the biggest criticism, as mentioned by others, was Clapton using the strat' instead of the Les Paul Gibson. They just didn't sound right. Having said this, it's Cream I bought the CD anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressive For Three Aging Survivors","review":"I was afraid I'd be disappointed if I bought this Cream collection mainly because of The Eagles - Farewell 1 Tour - Live From Melbourne. Instead of performing overblown arrangements of their songs with extra musicians and singers to help pad their vocals, it was just the three original members playing together. Ginger Baker didn't need another drummer to back him up while he sang his epic fairytale \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\". They don't frantically compete with each other like they used to, but the sound is full and their playing complements each other. This is the way I always wanted to hear Jack Bruce's bass. I don't miss the electric fart bass sound that Mel Schacher of Grand Funk emulated. I haven't heard Clapton play with this much spirit in a long time and you harldy miss the sound of his Gibson SG and Marshall Stack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out!

Dead format or not, there's no excuse for this high a failure rate.I'm still attempting to find a copy that plays properly, but this release still gets demerits for being show on video but processed with \\"film-look\\" to give it a slower film-like frame rate.

When given the unexpected honor of serving in the court of King Louis XIV, she leaves home with her father's blessing and eagerly accepts a position with the Duchess of Orleans. However, life at court is far more difficult and dangerous than she ever imagined, and a single misstep could cost her her position or her life. Then tragedy strikes the royal family, and Cecile is placed under suspicion. And a dark secret from her past is suddenly revealed.Superbly written, this book offers readers of today a glimpse of the splendor and majesty of the French court in its height of glory. Through the eyes of the heroine, readers will see important events in the history of France unfold. Highly recommended for readers of all ages.For further reading of the French court, I also recommend \\"The Royal Diaries: Marie Antoinette: Princess of Versailles.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy unless you really need it","review":"Its cheap but you can probably find the same topicsonline for free.

However, it is bogged down in stats, for instance constantly referring to players records and batting averages. While, each year is covered in this short book, I could not fall in love with the players. What made the Whiz Kids so special compared to the team of 1964? Why was Steve Carlton so beloved, and Shilling not so much? It reads like a history book, with no narrative. Also where is the Phanatic and Phil and Phillis in this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood's version is Unenligthening","review":"In the movie 'A Beautiful Mind' we are supposed to understand and sympathize with John Nash as he battles schizophrenia. But what astounds me about this movie is that it never explains schizophrenia. Most people still think it's that MULTIPLE PERSONALITY URBAN MYTH. They might think the imaginary roommate is personality #2.I must also add that I read the book and the movie and book are extremely different. The movie is the HOLLYWOOD VERSION. Most of the stuff in the movie is fictional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say What?","review":"How can I describe this picture? It would be like watching a Schwarzenneger movie with Arnold hanging off a building, shooting bad guys with machine guns, next thing you know he's being committed, with his wife mopping his forehead saying earnestly, \\"Honey, you need HELP!\\" And then you realize the guy was not hanging off of buildings, not shooting bad guys with a machine gun, he was just as nutty as hell. Then the guy recovers, but you don't. You don't recover the cash they took off you when you rented the movie, and you don't recover the self-respect you once had. No. You just emerge from the theater slightly old, slightly shaken with the vague memory of being rolled.To put it mathematically, let T represent the time spent watching the movie. Let W represent time wasted. T = W."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Pap?","review":"I think so! A Beautiful Mind is \\"Movie Of The Week\\" material that at times seems to parody mental illness. It misses it's mark from start to finish. Russell Crowe's job wasn't Oscar worthy in my opinion. And this is quite possibly one of Ed Harris' worst on screen performances. He's such a great actor. How did he get talked into this role? Since I wasted my $...at the theater, I don't intend on wasting double that to own this disappointment. A big blemish on Ron Howard's otherwise notable directing career. Use the $$ for a pizza and a movie rental from your local video store."},{"rating":"1","title":"*gag*","review":"i didn't like this movie at all. i was willing to give it a try but after the first half hour... i think its a little too sappy how everything turns out all right. and i think they should have included more about the truth of his life. they took out a lot about him thats actually pretty important. ok that and how it took home best adapted screenplay over lord of the rings is completely beyond me. howard totally remade the story while jackson stayed totally true. :( that and it's not very interesting, especially when you don't know what the heck is going on (maybe that's the point but some of us don't like it)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Beautiful Mind, but.....","review":"Perhaps not such a great picture. This is perhaps the dullest movie I've seen since Random Hearts.The story (about a brilliant mathematician who faces his own inner demons) has potential, but director Ron Howard fails to capture much of the spark of earlier films. There is little of the emotional warmth of Apollo 13 in A Beautiful Mind; were it not for the talents of the brilliant (and admittedly beautiful) Russell Crowe, this would not BE a movie. Crowe manages to carry it off, but the film fails to make an emotional connection with the viewer.Especially disappointing was the performance of the actress who plays John Nash's wife. She plays her role with too much stoicism: several times one can see Nash reaching out to her, trying to establish an emotional connection, but it never quite makes it.All in all, this is one film that proves that even a great actor can't make a film great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychosis shown more dramatic","review":"This movie \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" can show the viewers what schizophrenia under psychosis is like - how serious the psychotic person's case is. More serious than other psychotic patients, like digging out his arm. His wife importantly explained to him how to differentiate between reality and schizophrenia's false visions and false voices.I find this movie interesting that there are such people who are down with psychosis or schizophrenia, can be geniuses and even can be back to sane mind.This movie was produced by the directors of the movies who may never have experienced psychosis or schizophrenia so they produced such movies in their own understanding level, not psychotic experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very good film but,,,,,","review":"I really wanted to like this film,,,and i tried very hard. The story is excellent and the disease is protrayed in an excellent way. But i just couldn't get past Russell Crowe. I guess it's because i just don't like him as a person and that kept getting in my way. A good actor to me has a responsibility to the public just like sports figures do. But once your title gets to big for words i'll drop that person from existance.So my review is mixed. The real story is actually better. Hollywood does what they think happened. If you really want to know about this story, read the book. The movie however is pretty good and i have always admired Ron Howard but his choice for lead was a mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Ron Howard film","review":"If you like Ron Howard's brand of feel-good films, and I typically don't, then this movie is for you. I am a fan of Russel Crowe, and I think he did a solid job considering the material he was given. But I came away from the movie feeling that something was lacking. There was no information about John Nash's past, and too much time was spent on showing the effects of Nash's illness on his life. The scenes about his illness tended to get repetitious. And, the major plot device in the movie was taken straight from The Sixth Sense (probably an attempt to get people to see this movie again). Overall, this movie was disappointing--certainly not worth all the rave reviews it is getting now. I would have given this movie three stars, but I had to give it an extra star because of Jennifer Connelly. She stole every scene she was in, and her beauty is simply incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Hollywood Tripe","review":"Far and away one of the most overrated movies of the last few years.Good acting, terrible script and music; very predictible (in fact cliched). There are far better movies of this type out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another heroic role for Russell Crowe","review":"Having seen the trailer for \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", I thought I knew what I was walking into when I sat down in the movie theater. Little did I know how amazed and moved I would be. The movie is based on the truely extraordinary life of a math genius who because of the love and caring of special people around him, and his stubborn will to survive, overcame and triumphed over great odds. Russell Crowe playing John Nash was convincingly brilliant and noble. He deserves another Oscar. And Jennifer Connelly as his loving wife Alicia gave a strong and multi-layered performance. And the musical score added the extra mystery that surrounded the film. All of the secondary characters, especially John Nash's roommate at Princeton, were quite wonderful. And personally, having had to deal with this terrible problem for the last decade, I can only say that it is unimaginable that a better movie could have been made about living with this devasting illness. Bravo Ron Howard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Mind shines","review":"Russell Crowe has done it again with another virtuoso acting performance as genius mathematician John Nash, a victim of schizophrenia. This movie is very reminiscent of an earlier film, Shine, about a gifted, but mentally ill pianist who overcomes tremendous obstacles to make a comeback on the concert circuit. I did feel the ending to this film was a little over the top in its sentimentality. And who persuaded director, Ron Howard, to \\"age\\" Jennifer Connolly with what has to be one of the worst and phoniest make-up jobs in history! Aside from that, this movie must be seen just to appreciate Crowe's amazing performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blu-Ray","review":"Great movie. This Blu-Ray looks great. Loved the movie on DVD and this is sweet. Good stuff, buy it now. Ok? Yes, you should buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having read the book, I was quite disappointed with this movie. Sure, the movie is gripping because the story is tragically sad and the acting is pretty good. In this sense, the movie does a good of job highlighting the impact of serious mental illness and the need to help those who are dealing with it. But the problem is that the movie is about a real person, and comparison with the book (which I trust) shows that the movie left out and changed so many key elements that it represents an unacceptable distortion of the truth of John Nash's life. I could go into detail by giving many examples, but instead I urge you to simply read the book (or listen to the audiobook). The true story is far more powerful and interesting than this ridiculously popularized movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Test Audience Treat","review":"On September 24th I had the opportunity to see a test screening of this film. I really can't say much about it due to a confidentiality agreement the audience was asked to sign but this film is a treat. Very intelligent, very mature. Crowe and Connelly are superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but not truthful","review":"This is an excellent movie, however, it is not truthful. For example, the loving, caring, supportive wife depicted in this movie actually, in real life, left her husband only two years after he had schizophrenia. They only recently reunited. I was extremely disappointed to discover this. Also, in real life, he did not see visual hallucinations--he only heard voices. I guess this is typical of Hollywood to take a true story and twist the truth to make it sell. Excellent movie, but certainly disappointing in the above mentioned areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Mind?","review":"A fascinating movie with interesting plot twists. I'm not sure I would use the adjective beautiful to describe his mind.

It made me think, \\"My gosh, what if I'm like this guy and I've had a friend who isn't real all along?\\" Holy cow. Spooky.And the worst thing about it is the guy's hallucinations never go away. He just has to pretend they aren't there. What a bummer. And some of those hallucinations were his best friends at one point too. Geez. Star Trek The Next Generation could do six full-length episodes based on the content of this film alone.I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in psychology, philosophical logic, insanity, or any combination of the three. It can present you some mysteries, that's for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid movie if unfortunately inaccurate.","review":"For those more interested in the life of Nash, one should consult the excellent book this was based on. As it is, this is a very good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unreal","review":"I was taken on a wild ride I didn't expect. We would never know or understand life as the character in this true story led. I had to ask how can so many in this world function daily with this disorder. It was not understood in those days like we think it is today, but is it? People wanted him to act normal and expected him to be ok. He just couldn't and those that truely loved him came to understand him better and gave him the protection he needed until he grew beyond the extreme time of his illness. If you haven't seen this move get it and sit back and begin to be amazed by the Life and the sub-lives he led. You will see how this illness effect families and friends and even neighbors of those suffering with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful mind","review":"Hard to believe to see this professor in the trailer in such a good state of mind after so many shock treatments.

It's quite long and slow, and it moves along at the pace of a very large turtle. Again it was decent although I got bored after the first couple hours and shut it off, it really wasn't Oscar worthy.On a side note, if you do want this movie, I would suggest going with the widescreen version, who want's full screen? You lose thirty percent on the sides this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exceptionally irritating movie","review":"They don't pass out pens to revered professors at Princeton. And John Nash was, very briefly, a very good mathematician.This manipulative tale plays upon all sorts of prejudices --eg \\"if you're that smart something else must be wrong\\" and somehow manages to ignore the fact that during this period, at Princeton, the urbane, sane, funny, and more brilliant John von Neuman not only invented game theory (to which work Nash's is essentially a special case), but also was responsible for the architecture of the stored memory computer (still the model for our CPUs fifty years later), and designed much of the theoretical and practical system by for US command and control of its nuclear forces-- in short he did what Nash is presented as fantasizing about.So we have a celebratory film about a mathematician who did some good work, then went mad, and is now not so mad. That is not exactly a beautiful mind. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Oscars Got It All Wrong","review":"This movie was terribly slow. It reached a climax early on when he came up with his theory, and then declined. The three big awards that it received were undeserved (Best Picture, Director, and Supporting Actress). Jennifer Connelly is a fine actress, but the role was not incredibly challenging (see Requiem for a better performance). On the other hand, Russell Crowe's role was extremely complex and he rose to the occasion. He should have received an Oscar for this role, and not for Gladiator. Lastly, Ron Howard should stick to less dramatic, less demanding movies. He is better off making less artistic, more entertaining movies like Parenthood and Ransom."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best movies","review":"great movie, a must see. well written, great actors, makes you stop and think, had to by it to add to my collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Movie","review":"My complaints about the movie would have to be that it was too long, and in some parts I found it to be a bit confusing. However, I thought everything else about the movie was well done. The character developement of Alicia Nash was well played, and the delusions were amazing. They pulled you in, and you thought it was going to be some sort of spy action movie, but felt betrayed when you realized the truth. All in all, I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Movie","review":"This movie is the reason movies are made. It's an excellent film correctly portraying the life of a schizophrenic while still giving you the hollywood cinematography you'd expect.

A WV genius, John Nash, tries to prove his revolutionary theory on governing dynamics, while his mind takes a dark turn. He struggles to keep in touch with reality while battling schizophrenia.

The script, acting, footage, and music are not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"DID THEY SEE THE SAME MOVIE","review":"I have been reading some of the negative reviews about this movie. Reminds me how great works of art in history were often unappreciated. How this gem could be considered a waste of time or \\"pap\\" is amazing. The filmmaking, particularly the acting, direction, music, cinematography, etc. are first rate. If not for his boorish behavior at the British awards, Hollywood's chauvinism and the belated effort to right racial wrongs in favor of an outstanding actor who should have won for The Hurricane, Russell Crowe would and should have won. He is far and away the best actor working today. Ron Howard showed a depth and maturity comparable to Spielberg in Schindler's List, and Jennifer Connelly fully realized her star potential. But please...if intelligent, humane and sensitive movies are not your fare, and you want Arnold/Sly or How to Not Be a Mummy or Teenager While I Screamed and Saw What You Did In the Five Prior Sequels is more your fare, then do not waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"This was a great movie I loved the way it told the story of a man who really needed to be recognizedfor his great achivments.

Crowe is absolutely brilliant as John Nash, a gifted but troubled genius and his journey through life. Jennifer Gardner portrays John's faithful wife and is more than deserving of the Oscar she won for her role in the film. The movie deals with sensitive subjects, such as conspiracy theories and mental illness, but does so in a touching way that ultimately leaves the audiences feeling uplifted."},{"rating":"2","title":"All around great movie.","review":"Great acting by Russell Crowe combined with a great story and great direction make this a winner movie.

If you don't catch this at the theatre, be sure and check it out on DVD or video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reality would have been better than fiction","review":"This movie turned me off with its focus on Nash's schizophrenia rather than his monumental achievements. Three-fourths of the movie turns out to be Nash's delusion. I felt like a voyeur, entertained by someone else's pain. At the end, I wasn't even certain of exactly what it was that Nash had developed....just that he was a brilliant mathematician and severely ill. The barbaric \\"medical treatment\\" of the 1950s left me feeling sick.A documentary would have been far more entertaining. Nash is a brilliant man despite, not because of, his illness, and I found this movie (especially since much of it is fictionalized) to be exploitive.

Yes, it might get the facts about schizophrenia correct, and Russell Crowe's peformance might be an accurate depiction of the surface symptoms of schizophrenia, but that doesn't make it a good movie.The script is one gimmick after another.

Ron Howard has played Salieri to much more deserving directors, with the academy's approval. It will be quickly relegated to the \\"what was that movie about?\\" pile in a few years, just as Annie Hall has been. If it had not been awarded this undeserved high honor, it could have sunken into the obscurity which is its fate with a little dignity.

It has humor, unexpected twists and turns, heart-wrenching empathy, etc. It educates you a bit about schitzophrenia, and is an encouragement to loving bravely. If you liked \\"Sixth Sense,\\" I think you will love this even more because it is true. (hint: the book, however, is a difficult read, more like a scientific documentary covering the genious albeit immature minds of many math and economic geniouses, what Princeton is really like, and all of his steps to winning the Nobel. It rather skips over a lot of the personal story covered in this movie.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Beautiful Mind confuses my mind","review":"Despite all the great reviews, I must say that, while I washooked at the beginning of the movie, I slowly drifted into confusion. It was difficult for me to distinguish fantasyagainst reality, and so about maybe a third of the waysI couldn't understand who/what the heck the government agentwas and why he and the little girl kept on appearing and reappearing before Crowe's eyes.

All of the acting in this movie are done very tastefully and believably.

It is truly inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to see this one again!","review":"The movie cinematography, casting and story line were wonderful. Quite interesting. I walked away feeling sympathy for all with mental illness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, but far from accurate","review":"Ron Howard made an entertaining film, but opted to change the chronolgy of many events, completely omit others and substantially change facts. There is no mention of Elenor and John Strier, his first girlfriend and firstborn son. He never goes to RAND in California and thus is never arrested in a sting to nab homosexuals. John's trips to Europe and his attempts to give up his US citizenship is never depicted. His son Johnny's battle with Schizophrenia is omitted. His divorce from Alicia is also never mentioned. It is understandable that some changes were made in the screenplay, but the movie only resembles his real life in a vague way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tricky story","review":"I think this movie was kind of tricky because we didn't understand until the middle of the story. He met real people and unreal people, but finally it became clear. I think this is interesting point of this movie. After watching this movie, it gave us a feeling about \\"True love\\"and we will think about mental patients, love and what is most important in our life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly brilliant","review":"This is the story of Dr. John Nash, an eccentric and enigmatic student. Princeton University is of prime importance here as far as the beginning of his schizophrenia. For a man that could see the solutions to problems that others would have said were impossible - or genius, even miraculous - it is not so far a stretch that he also saw people that were not there and in fact did not really exist. The line between genius and insanity or brilliance and creativity is a fine one. And perhaps the people he hallucinated about, being his 'friends,' were what kept him from further demise (particularly the 'prodigal roommate' and his niece; the man in the hat, to a lesser extent). He was totally a self-made man of his own effort. As for insulin shock treatments, they supposedly were effective in about 50% of patients, and then perhaps due to brain damage.A wonderful movie. I am going to read the book next."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrific DVD of a deeply overpraised film.","review":"A very silly film. Russell Crowe appears to be channeling Dustin Hoffman in Rainman.Jennifer Connelly is possibly the most beautiful actress on the face of the earth.The real star of this overblown biopic-by-numbers is the stunning cinematography of Roger Deakins. I also quite liked James Horner's score.The film spends 2 hours telling us that Nash is a nut and then in it's final 20 minutes shifts gears and asks us to believe he is a genius.Connelly deserves better. This critically lauded script made me blush. How long does it take to write lines this cringe-inducing?Why doesn't it say \\"loosely based on a true story\\" before the opening scene?This quite handsome 2 disc DVD is stuffed with additional items. Alas I expected deleted scenes showing us Nash the anti-Semitic closet case. No such luck as this is Hollywood.How sad that some believe this to be the best film of 2001.And if I didn't say this before, Jennifer Connelly derserves better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest Attempt","review":"Director Ron Howard shows once again why every big star in Hollywood wants to work for him. Although not an original work of art, we are allowed to see the struggles of an individual who in is brilliance suffers from delusions of people and events that do not exist. A touching story about the struggles of life and the determination of the human spirit. I am not sure if this qualifies as a Best Picture of the Year, but with great performances by Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris, it was enjoyable to watch. Although I do not hail this as Russell Crowe's best performance, he was successful in his depiction of Nash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood again...","review":"The film emphasizes Nash's wild childishness and insanity, which apparently were true, but conveys no sense of either the depth or breadth of Nash's mathematical creativity and contributions. Nasar's book of the same title is far better and is far more informative, although it receives some reasonable criticism in Mirowski's 'Machine Dreams' (where the question 'What does it feel like to play a Nash equilibrium?' is posed). For an even better history of game theory, RAND, military funding of science, and simultaneously a biography of von Neumann, read Poundstone's 'Prisoner's Dilemma' (which Nasar quotes abundantly in her book 'A Beautiful Mind'). One interesting point conveyed by the film: that Nash managed his insanity by learning to ignore the voices in his head. If true, then this would be an impressive lesson for others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Performance by Russell Crowe","review":"A Beautiful Mind gives a glimpse of the struggles people face with mental disorders. For the most part, most of them are not aware they suffer from such a disease of the mind. The world becomes complicated to them and its difficult to differentiate between the imagination and reality. I saw this movie a few years ago and once it was released on blu-ray I had to have it. I am a psychology major and this brought life to many of the disorders I have studied. This is a beautiful movie not only about the complexities of the mind but also about love. Although he was suffering from this uncontrollable disease his wife stood by him and nurtured him. Many people are not that lucky especially when an illness arise. I recommend this movie to people who are intrigued by what goes on in the mind of someone with schizophrenia and also to witness what true love can bring to a persons life."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible and Inspiring Experience","review":"I saw this movie after it won the Oscar for Best Picture and was quite disappointed that it won at that time because I wanted Lord of the Rings to win. That view changed after seeing this. It is extroadinary. Each character is unique and portrayed with real emotion. Even though Russell Crowe's accent does waver and falter throughout the movie, the emotion between him and Jennifer Connelly had me sobbing. This movie is an incredible journey into the believable world of John Nash. I suggest that everyone sees this movie once. It's really confusing the first time through, as the plot takes a turn for the worst that leaves you shaking and trying to figure it out for the next half hour. See it again if it seems confusing, because then you can actually start dissecting it and understand why this movie won Best Picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Picture of 2001? Hardly...","review":"2001 - the year of Black Hawk Down, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, and Training Day... and yet A Beautiful Mind snags the Best Picture Oscar? I'm not saying A Beautiful Mind is COMPLETELY without redemption as a motion picture, but it comes complete with all the sappy Hollywood sentiment director Ron Howard could conjure. This isn't real emotion, it's melodrama, which is best left for daytime television. Is this movie more important than Black Hawk Down, more spectacular than The Fellowship of the Ring, or more original than Training Day? No. Definitely not. This movie wasn't made for an audience - it was made with an Oscar in mind. That's not good policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch as Entertainment Only","review":"This movie is an excellent movie, well written and directed and Russell Crowe's acting is outstanding. Unfortunately, Mr. Howard's vision of John Nash's delusion is way off base and pure hype to increase the entertainment value of the movie. It's still worth watching, but I'd recommend the book if you want to get a more complete perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful story.","review":"There is something beautiful about the way in which an incredibly intelligent mind processes information, and thanks to a fine performance by Russell Crowe as real-life mathematician John Nash, this movie succeeds in capturing it. It's also nice to see scenes from Princeton, which was my \\"dream school\\" when I was back in high school. It should also be added that Jennifer Connelly won best supporting actress for playing the protagonist's best supporting spouse. Without giving the plot away, let me just warn you though that despite the beautiful wife, Mr. Nash's life was less than beautiful in all its parts. See the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overrated","review":"Good film and performances from Crowe and Connely. Their best? I don't think so. You want to see their best performances...Go rent/buy L.A. Confidental or The Insider...go rent/buy Requeim for a Dream. Now, those are some fantastic performances and films.Oscar for Howard? That just proves that the Oscars are a huge marketing joke! Where was Spielberg and A.I.??? How about Lynch and Mulholland Drive??? What about Jackson and LOTR??? Where was Nolan and Memento?!?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Movie, But","review":"This was a very good movie but I thought that is slowed a bit in the middle. Many have pointed out the fact that it is not historically correct and this seems to be true, but. In my opinion this movie is not about historical correctness, not about the fabricated love affair on screen and the left out affairs with men. BUT (there is that word again) this movie is exceptional with it's interpretation of how strong the human mind can be. The old 'mind over matter' is something that most people do not realize the strength of. John Nash had an incredibly strong mind and it shows him overcoming mental problems, with help from his love. I don't think this is quite realistic but it is a good presentation never the less.Buy it, rent it, but watch it for what it is. Not historically correct, not entirely what folks have said but something that can be enjoyed and make you think. Make you own choice after the viewing (and write a review)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserving of all of its rewards","review":"A Beautiful Mind is everything a movie should be. It's plot is nearly flawless. The cinematography fits perfectly with the film's mood. The acting is great. And it warrants many additional viewings, even after the plot twist is revealed after the first viewing. I've never been a big fan of Russell Crowe, but he is great in this role. You'll find your self going back again and again trying to pick apart the details that you have missed before. I couldn't recommend this more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies, Lies,Lies","review":"This boring as hell movie not only lied, blatently and thoroughly, but it didn't even spell out the theory (beyond a hazy bar scene) that won him the Nobel prize..."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Cliché !!!","review":"This movie is so predictable. It's like the director worked backward: instead of directing the movie and then see what people think about it, he kept thinking about what people would like to see, and then made the movie (that explains why it won so many awards). He could at least have done this a little more subtle, but the whole movie is gross. Here's an example: Ron Howard needed a genius, right? So what did he do? Did he tried to narrow Nash's personality? No! He gave us the typical genius guy everybody would think of, you know, the guy who can't talk to girls, can't wear a tie... And there are so many other gross details in this movie, the worst being this \\"love-can-solve-any-problems\\" thing.This is soooooooo easy, so predictable, in a word, so CLICHE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected More","review":"I heard that this was a great movie, so I decided to rent it.

I thought he was less intelegent than his peers. As for the Movie...... I love Ron Howard but this one was a Dead film....I watched it again:This movie was alot better the second time.

After getting so many great reviews and winning 4 Oscars, I was excited to see this movie. What a disappointment it turned out to be! The acting wasn't terrible on the actors and actresses part, but the whole plot was horrific! I can't believe this movie got such great reviews! ... It's such a shame such an amazing and inspiring story was put to pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tired Parade of Cliches","review":"You've already seen this movie. You don't need to see it again. A Beautiful Mind never once rises above the merely serviceable. It never rises above the level of the usual fairly competently made TV movie.Emotional payoffs are telegraphed a full two hours in advance. The music swells dramatically to tell you to start crying. It's almost like a Spielberg film, except that Ron Howard doesn't have Spielberg's considerable talents.Russell Crowe does a fairly good job, but all too often is content just to bring out a series of ticks and grins and mumbles. He basically gets by on his considerable charisma and charm. If the film is at all watchable, it is due to him. Ed Harris does next to nothing, and basically makes the easiest paycheck of his entire career.There is really no reason to see this film. There are better motion pictures out there. You'll easily find one. Just look."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Beautiful Mind- Why Should I Mind?","review":"I started watching A Beautiful Mind expecting to be wowed away by a deep look at overcoming mental illness. Instead, the movie was plodding, predictable, and dull. It's pretty obvious Nash is having delusions. The only mysteries are what he actually did that was important, and how he put up with Jennifer Conelly's overexaggerated agitation. The movie was made to win awards, and I have a feeling some audiences (and Oscar voters) just couldn't admit to themselves that a movie about mental illness could be just plain bad. Especially \\"beautiful\\" are the glaring omissions of Nash's other problems that make him seem a little less of a gentlemanly genius. It doesn't matter how many special features are on the DVD. If the movie is bad, they aren't going to save it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Mind","review":"I'm sorry, but this movie just ... some serious eggs! I mean, it just went on and on, and by the end I was praying for someone to dig my eyes out with a carrot pealer just for a little entertainment. Russel Crowe was too bullish for this role. It was kind of like hiring a football player to act as a meek, mentally disabled person. And then there was Jennifer Connely, the human Barbie doll, practically perfect in every way. She was really dull to watch for almost three hours. The basic plot line wandered a lot. They could have edited about an hour out of the movie. Oh well. Its a hard knock life."},{"rating":"2","title":"I already want more!!!","review":"I absolutely loved this film, as I have loved all of Russell Crowe's movies! I own them all (and believe me, there are many). They cover a vast range of situations, personalities and styles. It is true, some are more worthy than others, but Russell's ability to create a new person, a distinct individual, who stays with you in each character he portrays, keeps me hooked on anything he does. I can't wait to add this to my collection and I am greedy...I want more! I am glad Russell is so young and never quite satisfied with his work because that means he will keep producing for years to come. Go Russell! I like his music too! Can you tell I'm a fan?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong, deep, impressive movie","review":"Perhaps one of the best movies so far this year. I'm still under deep impression from it. Definetily worth a spot in your DVD home collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies of 2001","review":"Russell Crowe's performance in A Beautiful Mind is awe-inspiring. An actor is good when he's believable, but an actor is great when he makes you forget that he's acting. His performance helps make this movie one of my favorites of all time. But, it isn't just the acting. Everything about this movie is great. I was depressed at certain points but overjoyed at others. Every element of this movie works magnificent together, and the final result is remarkable. Throughout the whole movie, Dr. John Nash (Russell Crowe) tries to reason his whole way through life. Yet by the end of the movie, the lesson Dr. Nash (and I) learned is that the only thing he couldn't reason, the only thing that he couldn't figure out, is the only thing he ever needed: love. This deserved to win Best Picture of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This movie was one of the best ones I have seen in a long time.

The only thing better than a good movie is a good movie based on true fact. The movie story was good. The fact that it really happened made it great.

While the first half of the film steers you completely and deliberately in the wrong direction... which is very clever when the secret is revealed, after this the second half of the film seems to go downhill toward a typical Hollywood-esque weepy finale. While I really tried to like the main character, Mr Nash, I found I didn't really care! After the closing titles rolled, I felt the film was desperately trying to out-do \\"Shine\\".. but with all the film's fancy camera work and ageing make up, it didn't quite manage it.

Watch \\"Shine\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"was it that great???","review":"i don't understand. best picture? best director?best supporting actress? and best adapted screenplay?there's nothing, absolutely nothing creative and amusingabout the director's filming, and picture.jennifer connely proved her talent in Requiem for a Dream,but i think anyone could have done this part.there were many many stories similar to this, and nothingmakes this man's life better than all the other peoplewho lived a dramatic life. yes, it's a good movie,a good story, but very typical and boring.it definitely didn't deserve all the attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about John Nash","review":"Did the screenwriter even read the book? Perhaps just a one paragraph summary. Nearly every important event of his life is left out, and almost none of the events in the movie are in the book. This might be an entertaining inspirational movie, if they hadn't used John Nash's name and the title of his biography. It's not about him. It is 99% fiction. The real story of his life is much more bizarre and would make a better movie. Crowe really knows how to play the part of a tortured soul, but he did it better in \\"The Insider\\". I think he could have done it here with a story actually based on the life of John Forbes Nash, Jr. I hope someone makes a movie or miniseries about the real man."},{"rating":"1","title":"ron howard never took an econ course","review":"this movie confused the hell out of me, probably because i read the book (excellent).unfortunately terribly inaccurate and unnecessarily sentimental fluff in hollywood = garner awards and praisethat blonde in the bar scene is just awful and a completely incorrect notion of a nash equilibrium."},{"rating":"1","title":"limited appeal","review":"I couldn't relate to or appreciate this movie.

Think of any successful page-to-screen translation (it'll come to you). Sadly, however, this adaptation of the book of the same name could only leave the viewer wanting rather than entertained or enthralled. Whether it was the leaden pace, the stilted, almost comical dialogue or the complete absence of any discernible direction I cannot say with any degree of certainty, having neither the desire nor the $3.50 to rent this movie. However, I can state with some assurance that as an individual who has experienced far more than his fair share of emotional, physical and financial disappointment that this film, like almost everything that has transpired in my life, would undoubtedly fall far short of even my meager, ever dwindling expections...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tribute to a slow movie","review":"I was very disappointed in this one. It was so slow in places that I almost went to sleep twice. The story might have been better if it were really taken from true life.

Realism is usually better than a contrived story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Insult to Artistic Decency!!!","review":"I should have walked out of this movie 30 minutes into the show.

The performances from all members of the cast were wonderful and I won't be surprised to see a number of well-deserved Oscars awarded to the film.

Trust me, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"diappointed","review":"Disappointing movie so I don't know why it won many accolades at the Golden Globes. Russell Crowe is a brilliant actor and his portrayal of a real schizophrenic mathematic genius was good. But Crowe's own seemingly charismatic, virile, and magnetic personality take away some believability. Jennifer Connelley gives a fine performance. Ed Harris and Christopher Plummer play minor characters but nevertheless are pleasure to watch. The guy who plays Nash's roommate \\"Charles\\" is entertaining as he did in the \\"Knights Tale\\". So I wonder why did this movie fell short of entertaining me? Maybe it took too long to tell a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece","review":"I am amazed by the carping critics who deride the skill of Howard, Crowe,Connelly, et al, in conveying a powerful, moving story of the redemptive power of human love and the strength of human character to overcome one's own demons,real or imagined. To have slavishly followed Nash's biography would have detracted and distracted from the focus and eloquence of this film. Watching these talented actors perform with a wonderful script under the skillful direction of Ron Howard is a rare treat. Crowe's performances through Insider, Gladiator and now Beautiful Mind confirm that he is a true acting genius. This film will be recognized over time as a masterpiece and will never become dated or maudlin.The viewers should immerse themselves in the beauty and stength of this film,and the important issues presented, and not worry if every character flaw or problem in Nash's life is explored. For that, the book serves the purpose. Meanwhile, we should appreciate this gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overcoming the Impossible","review":"Just when you think you have problems that can't be mastered, or overcome, not to mention the belief that there are problems inside you that you would expect NO ONE to ever want to share a life with you due to them, this movie comes out to send a valuable message. A very special person wanted me to see this movie, to express that the love felt for me was as strong as the love in this movie, and in that, there are no obsticles, just an adventurous journey. I loved the movie for that main reason. I have had Songs dedicated to me when I have been down, but to have a movie dedicated was sweet. Based on a true story, I love their monumental commitment and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic","review":"Ron Howard took a story with great potential and turned it into a sentimentally formulaic film that the stodgy Academy will most certainly adore. Too much time is spent leading up to Nash's breakdown. Howard rushes us through 30 years of Nash's life in 30 minutes time. The drama and true depth of this story can be found in Nash's lifetime attempt to manage his disease, and not simply in the events that lead up to his hospitalization and relatively brief treatment period."},{"rating":"1","title":"remarkably un-original...","review":"The Performances were exceptional, but that was about it. The pace of the film was really unbalanced, lingering in the wrong places, rushing through others. It didn't even cover Nash's life very well, leaving out a lot of key points, but focusing intensely on some of the less interesting aspects. A lot of things were never explained. It just felt way too long, but at the same time incomplete. Thus, it was very, very boring. Ron Howard has kept up his tradition of following strict Hollywood formulas, steering clear of any originality the script even had potential to offer. This movie wasn't terrible, but it's nowhere near worthy of the praise it's recieved let alone the Best Picture award."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, the Lord of The Rings should have won Best Picture","review":"This is a poor movie.

My girlfriend suggested it to me, and if I wasn't already in love with her, I would be after reading Niagara Falls All Over Again. McCracken's writing is flawless. She is funny without being campy or cheap. She writes tragically without being overwrought. The book blends that comedy and despair beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable character driven story","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. The characters were believeable and the vaudeville background and plot kept my interest. Ms. McCracken has the gift of a wonderful story teller as she recounts the lives of Mose and Rocky and the interesting family and people they experience in their dual biographies. There comes laughter and tears in the tale of these two fascinating men. The only flaw in the plot was the threat Rocky laid on Mose. I was really disappointed in him, as though Rocky were a real person. I enjoyed the ending as realistic and consistent, but some may see this part of the conclusion as a downer. Overall in \\"Niagra Falls All Over Again\\" I found an enjoyable read with characters that stay with you after the story ends, only to emphasize just how important empathetic characters are in a good novel. I intend to read other books by this excellent author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Details, Details, Details","review":"Elizabeth McCracken did a wonderful job portraying the risks and heartaches to becoming famous. She showed the relationship between the two main characters as almost a marriage. Their failures and successes were portrayed as real life. This book is full of so much detail that it was almost a turn off to reading it. McCracken did her research that is for sure. I suggest that you take a full weekend and dedicate it to reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read This Book Only If You're Trapped On a Desert Island","review":"The title explains it all. This book has a very slow pace with tons of extra \\"fluff\\" detail. The characters are quite likeable, but for me, that still didn't do much for the book overall. I'd say skip it unless a volleyball named Wilson is your only friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book about Friendship","review":"To be honest with everyone I did not like the book at all. Others may think differently though. It did not grab my attention nor my interest. I did read the whole thing and I found out that it was a very touching story. It talked about all the things the characters had to go through to become famous and the way your life changes when you reach that point. The relationship between the two main characters was really nice I liked how they worked together. It was as if they were married to each other even though one of them was the head of the two of them. The novel showed how friends can take advantage of you and your life and basically become the person you worry about when you make big important life decisions. I definately do not see this novel as being a new England Novel even though Elizabeth McCracken is from New England. A lot of my friends did enjoy the book so even though I mentioned I disliked it others will find it highly interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Believable Story That Starts Out Slow, but Ends Well","review":"Although the first 80 pages or so seemed to drag on forever, the end result is worth it. The book started out slow, and just when I felt like putting it down, it hooked me. The protagonist, Mose Sharp, is a very believable character, who causes the reader to sympathize with the horrible details of his life, such as the many deaths of family members. His character does not seem to embellish any details of his life. He tells the reader, that he reveals secrets to us that he does not reveal to the other characters.The character of Rocky, Mose's counterpart, is more comical, and more charming than Mose himself.

I have not used it yet, but I have set it up and I really think it will work for our backpacking needs. I know this is not considered a backpacking tent, but 7lbs. (indicated on website) is not bad when our other backpacking tent weighed 5lbs. We decided 2 more pounds would be ok.The only problem I have is that the website says it weighs 7lbs.The shipping weight on the box said, 11 lbs. I know that the box did not weight 5 lbs. So my husband weighed the tent at work, without the box, on a commercial scale and it weighed 8.5 lbs.So, you might be thinking 1.5lbs. is not a big deal. Well it is when you are carrying it on your back for 25 miles. Every pound is important when considering what you take with you.I think the weight needs to be changed on the website just incase someone else has the same weight considerations.Thanks,SandRaT"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor tent","review":"I went hunting this weekend and it rained and snowed.

The floor is a little thin, so I think I'm gonna get a footprint for it. The poles are aluminum and seem really durable. One thing to be noted is that the inside size is not 8'x8'. It's more like 7.5'x7.5'. The size of the tent refers to the distance between the ends of the poles, not the interior space. It's easy to put up, easy to take town, and easy to fit in its carrying bag.I haven't used it in the rain yet, so I can't say anything about its water resistance or durability.

Kari Wuhrer is certainly great eye candy as are Michael Vartan and Norman Reedus, but in this case, their looks do not make up for an unwatchable film.The story is a decent one, but it warrants a 30 minute treatment not a full length feature treatment. There is so much extraneous non-action that you will want to use your DVD player's fast forward button. The dialogue is not of a high caliber and the delivery is pained. Denis Leary plays a character exactly like.....Denis Leary. He rants and raves as if the director asked him to ad lib for an extended period of time just to use up some film. Poor Michael Vartan. He seems to have realized halfway through that this was a bad career move and just stopped putting forth any effort. Norman Reedus supplies a two-level performance unworthy of his past efforts.I wanted to like this film. I really did. I love a good thriller. Sadly, this isn't one.

Michael Vartan must have been broke when he took this part because it was just such a bad story.

Beautiful photography is completely destroyed by the DVD's dreadful pan and scan job (the film's format is obviously 2:35 to 1 Panavision), the kind of thing I thought had gone out the window along with the VHS format. As for the film, the effectiveness of the drama (a study of the violence-prone macho attitudes in our society?) is diminished by the characters' lack of depth, a deadly slow first 45 minutes and a disappointing, not quite believable ending. A good enough time killer, but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Michael Vartan is in it.","review":"Michael Vartan is my all time favorite actor but even he could not pull this one out of the bag but I did buy it for his sake.

As a teacher of world history I find this book to be a excellent vehicle for introducing readers to a world with which we can still vaguely identify. The political institutions that Americans once cherished blossom in their infancy on the pages of Bernier's book. As the Enlightenment ideas of freedom and equality spread from the cultured palors of 18th century France to eventually influence the world, it was facinating to see them clash with the realities of war, poverty and slavery. From Europe to the Americas to Asia then finally Africa, Oliver Bernie takes detailed snap shots of culture and civilization in the world of 1800.

What this means is that if this set doesn't fit your ear very well (mine falls out all the time unless I duct tape it on) you will have to hold it in by hand which is very annoying when driving or your hands aren't free (e.g., in airports while pulling luggage).

Nor is there any evidence to suggest that the historical Druids used athames or pentacles, or that they cast circles, or any of the rest of the quasi-Wiccish nonsense Ms. Knight tries to present as Druidic tradition. This isn't Druidry.

Pagans went underground because of the times, now is the time to bring forth the ancient teachings. In this book, Sirona Knight has gone a long ways towards making that happen. Because of this, \\"Exploring Celtic Druidism\\" is a great book, and as a result Ms. Knight has probably angered many of the people who feel the ancient teachings should kept secret, and as such, used to control and manipulate people who seek the teachings.

As someone who has been doing my work with the Goddess solitary, I found this book to be very helpful in my personal quest.

I read the cover and thought the thing would be a good way to fill in some holes on my reading, especially since it was on sale. The book was not unpleasant, but I'm at something of a loss to describe my reaction to the book. The thing seemed mostly to be a disjointed, meandering series of anecdotes.

Calloway, in this rather brief narrative, provides an excellent backdrop through his exhaustive research, as evidenced by his numerous notes.

An excellent and compelling duet on sarangi and sitar is the album's centerpiece. Recommended, but not if you don't already love traditional Indian music.Ravi Shankarr, Ali Akbar Khan, Bismillah Khan, Hariprasad Chaurasia, Ram Narayan, Alla Rakha, Ustad Vilayat Khan and other masters are all absent. But it seems to focus on younger artists, and those keeping the tradition alive. It even gives a reasonable introduction to Indian Bolywood film music style to someone like me who is new to it.

It is predicated on the assumption that the USA is \`right' and that France, au contraire, is \`wrong'. It makes many references to an Anglo-American view of the world, but British readers will have little sympathy with the authors' advocacy of federalism and will see little difference between the incapacity of local government in the UK and in France.The chapters on French history and the education system are interesting but not original.There are several howlers in the book. For example France has no active volcanoes, Norway is not a member of the European Union and it's preposterous to claim that \`In Britain, all doctors are civil servants'.To be fair, the authors occasionally concede that a lot of what France stands for makes sense, but ultimately this book is a justification for the prejudices of North Americans, written for a US audience and funded by a US trust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair and insightful coverage of my home country","review":"I truly enjoyed reading this book about my home country!

The hours the stores keep I cannot figure out, and the hours of the restaurants vary also. We see a sign that says(in French) open all the days, we go the next day and the place is FERME(closed). A Year in the Merde points out so many differences, I just laughed and laughed, as none are serious, just something you must deal with.We were told that 60 Million Frenchmen was also a very funny book.

This book is a very deep study of every facet of the French culture, going into the details of its so many quirks. Anyone who ever wanted to understand why the French are the way they are, and why in the end France and the US have always been in this special love/hate relationship (where both see each other with admiration, envy, yet disdain), this book is one of the best attempts at it I've ever read.

It is true for individuals as well as for nations.I am a French living in the states married to an american and finally understood some of the cultural differences my husband and I have been arguing about for the last few years thanks to 60 million Frenchmen can't be wrong!If you plan on living in France, are living with a French or just interested in knowing why French can be so annoying read on!

If you want to understand a people, forget the big cities. and go for the small ones and the country. If you visit France, spend ONE day along the Seine, and get the h*** out of there, and head south-to the Loire valley, to the southern half of France. where every little town has its own history, its own wine and its own flavor - and people will love you for visiting.

To name a few let's start with \\"For Sentimental Reasons\\", \\"L-O-V-E\\", \\"Route 66\\", et al.The stings gave a good performance on this cd. Their arrangements, I thought, were up to par.

It's true the latter two have much more on specific exercises to help get you better and I liked the medical information in Damany. However they don't have a lot of practical information on how to cope with your life during the healing process when you can't do a lot of the things you normally do in your daily life. This book fills that gap. It's got lots of practical suggestions of how to do things when you're injured. It's more of broader focus than the other books on the overall changes you need to make beyond the specific exercise program.

It is not very helpful if you are looking to visit and need more practical information such as where to stay, where to eat, and things to do. While it does list some lodging and restaurants, it is by no means comprehensive and you're left to do most of the leg work yourself.

I would recommend this book to anyone desiring information on this Hapsburg leader."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Philip Whitewash","review":"All that work, and out comes an apologia. No word, really, how the Habsburgs got to take over Spain. About the incredible inbreeding, including Philip's marriage to his niece, Anna of Ausrria, that needed papal dispensation. No indication that Don Carlos was a true schizophrenic, an inheritance from the daughter of Fedinand and Isabella and passed on in the Habsburg family for a few more centuries. The inquisition was a necessity, and the destruction of the armada an act of God? No matter how hard the author tries, Philip still comes across as a hesitant, pencilpushing pedant who was none too bright. Mr. Kamen should have studied Ludwig Pfandl's 1938 book; it descibes Philip correctly and encompassing from all sides.

The sound reproduction is pre-stereo and the playing is just so-so in the first one. In fact, the Concerto #20 played by Yvonne Lefebure is downright sub-standard. She rushes all of the technical spots and covers up a lot of mistakes. Serkin's sounds better! Also, the orchestra sounds subpar. They play these with such crudeness and roughness! Entrances are so abrupt. Definitely not up to today's standards. When I think of great Mozart Piano Concerto CD's, the one that comes to mind is Geza Anda with the Salzburg Mozarteum orchestra. He plays all 27 beautifully and exact with phenomenal technic! Generally, I think Casals was overrated along with many of the performers of that time. I'm sure the War was a major contributor to this. I bought many of the Casals CD's from Perpignan and none leave a favorable lasting memory.

Still, I was mostly happy with it until the mask burst, spilling tiny plastic beads ALL over the room! I still occasionally find pieces from it months later.

I first saw this film in 1996 when I was 11 when I missed it on TV and I rented it from the video store. I liked the part where the Champ (Jon Voight) gave T.J. (Ricky Schroder) the horse and it touched my heart. The part in scene 17 where Annie (Faye Dunaway) reveals to T.J. that she is his mother is a little disturbing. There is a little foul language in it, but other than that it is a great film for the family.When you watch this film, don't forget the Kleenex box and this is one of the films that really made me cry. I recommend this film to everyone!10/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO WHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL!","review":"Well, I know a lot of people like this film, but I have to tell it like it is!......it's not a very good remake at all! Schroder may be adorable, but he is way out of his league going up against Jackie Cooper and although the rest of the cast are top notch, this film feels like a bad TV movie! The first problem is Schroder is too young for the role to be taken for more than sympathy and it's no more than a manipulative trick. I'm not saying Schroder didn't do a fine job, but it's easy to feel sorry for such a little tike crying over his fallen hero who is also his father! If you like the story, watch the original, it's infinitely better than this Hollywood mediocre melodrama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too schmaltzy!","review":"A fun drinking game with this movie is to take a shot everytime that little ragamuffin says the word \\"Champ\\"!Seriously, every sentence uttered by Silver Spoons ends in the word \\"Champ\\".

Deliverance was perfect, and he was rockin' it in Heat. Midnight Cowboy was lovely. I even dug the Champ. Now I learn that he's a complete fool who hates Obama and thinks the country is headed to hell (or at least socialism). No wonder Angelina won't speak to him anymore. Doesn't it just suck when actors you admired do that? Damn. Jon, you're an idiot mate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I wish I had read closer and seen it was a VHS.

We tried to put it into another DVD player on another tv and unfortunately, the same thing. I guess the DVD is defective.

Molavi is a rising star.","review":"I had not heard of this author prior, but after reading this book I was thoroughly impressed with him. Persian Pilgrimages is very objectively written and does a fantastic job capturing the complexities of Iranian politics. Molavi's prose is very poetic, much more enjoyable to read than an academic text. As an Israeli I feel that I have a much deeper understanding of Iran after reading this book. I recommend Persian Pilgrimages to anyone who loves great writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Field Guide Misleading","review":"The title, \\"A Field Guide to Birds of the Big Bend\\" is extremely misleading. I purchased this book as a guide for my first bird watching trip to Big Bend National Park. With 'field guide' in the title, I expected the book to assist me with identifying birds found in the Big Bend area. There are few pictures in the book and all of them are black and white sketches. This book is not useful for identifying birds and therefore does not fit the common definition of 'field guide' used by resources common to every birder such as the Peterson and Audubon field guides. I was extremely disappointed and returned the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, but not really a field guide","review":"This \\"field guide\\" is only a field guide in the sense of the size of the book and the overall brevity of the species accounts. It lacks the detailed art/photos that most bird guides contain to aid in the ID of species. This book is very useful as a secondary reference to a better field guide since it gives information specific to the Big Bend area. There are black and white drawings that are helpful to some extent, but this publication is most useful for its area specific details of each species described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should come in handy","review":"This guild would be excellent if it had better and more illustrations.

Not recommended for anyone who wants to know about Bushido."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buddhism and Shintoism aren't religions?????","review":"This is a great book, on Christian militancy and millenial paranoia. I wish that the author had tried to indicate his close relationship with Christ in the title, as I would have filed it in 'Western Theology', rather than 'Eastern Mysticism and Martial Arts'. Quite a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty Indeed","review":"Trumpeter Leroy Jones does an excellent job of playing traditional songs without ever sounding trite, and an equally fine job of composing music that sounds in the tradition but never merely imitative. This is an excellent recording that testify to the remarkable musical heritage of New Orleans music in general and Louis Armstrong's music in particular."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did he say? Rewind that!","review":"Wasted potential. This movie tries so hard to be creepy that it ruins itself. Everyone whispers throughout every dialog scene, and their voices are further obscured by the constant cacophony of eerie music and sound effects. If you turn it up to hear the words, the shrieks of the mothman sightings will shoot your speaker voice coils across the room. I, English speaking from birth, had to turn on the subtitles to know what they were mumbling about. Very frustrating. Also, the ONLY relationship between the movie and reality is reports of something creepy seen in the woods and the collapse of the bridge. Weak. The only good thing about this movie was the depiction of the bridge collapse. Convincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Old-Fashioned Scary Movie","review":"I liked this movie from beginning to end. The way the Moth Man gets Gere's character to West Virginia is creepy. The sequence of events from where the bridge starts to fall in to where it does is knitted together perfectly. I don't want to give too much away.There were times in the movie I was wondering if it was the Moth Man or reality being presented. I have to wonder if the Moth Man and the Bell Witch know each other. They seem to share the same powers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh So Boring","review":"The Mothman Prophecies begins with so much potential, but never really develops into a story worthwhile telling.

The actors do as well as they can with a really flat script.Definately missable."},{"rating":"2","title":"chilling: better realized than the book","review":"I was scared of the dark after watching this last night! The acting, scenery and special effects were all wonderful. From the very beginning, you are drawn into the darkness and paranoia (sp) of Klein's unravelling life. Is the Mothman real or not? Klein's investigation forces him to confront metaphysics, angels, premonitions and other things that crouch in the shadows. OTOH I didnt care for the ending ... too staged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"This movie was awful. It drags on and on and there's little explanation at the end.

This is the first horror movie i've watched in a long time that had that affect on me. I remember the part where Richard Gere is standing in the hotel beside the wall mirror and talking on the phone when i noticed that as he moved his arm...his shadow didn't. When he walked away, his shadow wasn't in sync with him. And then he shoved the mirror or whatever and you see something in the mirror. God that creeped me out. I stopped the movie after watching a bit more than half of it and then the next day(with all the lights on during the day time)i finally had the guts to watch the rest. Mothman Prophecies is definitely scary and i guess that means the movie works."},{"rating":"2","title":"It creeped me out","review":"This is a very creepy movie. Nothing is shown directly to you. You'll struggle to see what it is that is scaring you but at the same time you really don't want to know. Like when one of the Mothmen becomes a human form and you can only see a silhouette of this figure. Very creepy. One down side to this movie was the characters are about as clueless as the audience as to what a mothman actually is. I found this movie to be much scarier than \\"The Ring.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Thriller","review":"This is a great movie. Probably the only good movie with Richard Geere. Very freaky with the lights off. The story is ok. Don't expect everything to be explained to you. It's supposed to be mysterious, like the X-files. If you like that show, you'll like the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effectively Creepy and Something New","review":"Mothman is one of those rare movies that comes out with a 50/50 chance because of it's different plot and a \\"not so sure\\" reaction. But comes to be a great thriller that gets under your skin and twists and turns at every dark corner. Accompanied by eerie music and a dismal atmosphere, Mothman is a great psychological thriller that delivers chills, thrills, and a clever twist of an ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This movie is truly one of the most boring I have ever seen. It's a good idea, and the beginning is chilling, but it falls flat after the first 10 minutes. Almost the entire film is spent talking, and talking, and talking... you actually only see the Mothman about three times in the whole thing. The final bridge scene is certainly terrifying, but it doesn't make up for sitting through 2 hours of boredom. All in all, this film had a great premise... but bad presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will give you chills every time without fail ...","review":"Some of the reviewers have stated: It's nothing like the book. Thank God. Having read the book, which is fine in and of itself, I'm glad that the movie was so much better and not a straight adaptation. If you wish to order and readthe bookafter seeing the movie, go right ahead, but expect a few very dry, and yawning bedtime reads that might bore you.The Special Edition of this film is the one to get. I already owned the Original Theatrical Release, but re-purchased it because I had to see the two documentaries that were included on disk two. I usually frown at studios double-dipping to rake in more cash from an unsuspecting audience, but in this case it was well worth it. This is a much over-looked movie that was superb in every way.The next time the phone rings and no one responds back ... you'll immediatly think that it's the Mothman, whether you admit it, ... or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrifying Mystery-Thriller","review":"The Mothman Prophecies is one of the scariest films I have ever seen. It blends fact wih fiction (creating a haunting and earily \\"real\\" atmosphere that one does not easily forget.) Richard Ghere is great as the lead, and the story moves along at an almost perfect pace. There is not much action in this movie, but trust me, once you've started there's no stopping, and once it's over you'll have to watch a seriously funny movie to counter it's effects. That being said, Mothman is an excellent film in almost every way, and I highly reccomend it to the thriller fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"I watched this movie not knowing all that much about about the whole Mothman phenomenon, so fortunately wasn't in a position to have my expectations dashed. I guess that's the thing about movies based on real or alleged events, and there's not much that can be done about it if you've already read up on the whole incident. The movie should be taken for what it is, a good, spine chilling paranormal thriller. The Special edition includes a 50 minute documentary on the 1960s Mothman sightings on which the movie is based. Very interesting in its own right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Mothman Real if You Can't Touch Him?","review":"Usually not a fan of Sci-Fi, I was very pleased with this film in it's entirety. An age-old story set in today's world. Well made visuals and the music was a great compliment to the storyline. I enjoyed Richard Gere, but I hoped there would be more of Debra Messing and some more girth to Laura Linney's character.I never jumped out of my seat screaming in horror, but I never left the room either. Maybe a scream or two would have gotten another star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak movie","review":"I've been reviewing many films today and I've been very critical of each one and, sorry to say, I must slate this piece of work as well. The Mothman Prophecies, based on a true story, is a film mystery which deals with the conception of the rare African moth. If seen, it foretells a death. When Richard Gere's wife, Debra Messing, sees the moth, mysterious circumstances ensue which subsequently lead to her death. Pining for her, Gere eventually loses his mind and meets up with a new love interest, Laura Linney in an attempt to uncover the truth. While the plot may sound plausible it proves disappointing.The female characters are seriously underdeveloped with only a brief cameo with Debra Messing. Gere seems to get all the action.The ending is also disappointing and is left open ended but we are meant to accept this considering it is based on a true story.Still though, the film is worth watching if you're into mystery films. However, don't expect to be too impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Boredom Prophecy","review":"This film is extremely slow paced.

Richard Gere tells Laura Linney (a cop) about the near-hallucinatory visions of another character. \\"I had a dream like that,\\" she portentously replies; then proceeds to tell the dream, and they show it (All Blue and All Black), and it has no likeness whatever to the other guy's visions--they hit you over the head with the idea that it's a prediction."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could rate it lower I would","review":"I hated this movie.

However, from the get-go I saw nothing but tired old predictable cliches in music, cinematography, and effects. I was not scared by anything, because I could always sense (or prophecise) what was about to happen; except for the ending, which actually, through its tension and timing and effects, makes up for the rest of the bland, pointless journey through this film. In general, the performances are top-notch, and the fact that this film is based on some reportedly true events will create some intrigue; but basically this film is really nothing more than a bad episode of The X-Files.What would have improved this DVD experience for me is if a documentary about the supposedly \\"true story\\", of which this film was based on, was included.

If it's supposed to be a 'psychological thriller' the psycology part requires at least some logical completion and this movie full of huge holes in the plot.

It moves at an extremely slow pace, and I was okay with it. More and more of the story and character development comes in and finally, some of the scares come in. It doesn't really do much until you hear the mothman, who's name is Indrid Cold. I thought it sounded scary and later on you find out it didn't come from human vocal cords, and after that they don't explain anything. What was it then?

First of all, the version I got didnt have the games attached to the book. This was sad, since the author spends some precious pages describing the rules of the games I did not get. There are only 64 pages in this book. I actually found the text very interesting, but the illustrations kill this book. Its simly a collection of bad quality black and white engravings and sketches from the period, plus some heraldic designs IN BLACK AND WHITE.

If we listen to England it is OK to destroy all of the earth and learn nothing from the wisdom of its original people becuase it will be done in the name of the Church.

A lot of them complained about cheap connectors, degraded signals, etc. I'm not exactly a videophile but I'm really happy with the picture I'm getting with this.My only (slightly) negative comment is that the cable is very thick and bulky.

At first, the cable worked as it should, turn on projector, plug into receiver and voila! But the slightest bit of movement caused the connector to completely come apart.

The alien posseses a police inspector and priest to kill. The film ends with the alien (as the priest) dying whilst trying to stop the train from falling over a cliff.

Some scenes inexplicably shimmer, as if you were looking at some gently sloooooshing water.

The production reminds one of the worst of Spandau Ballet, Tears For Fears, etc., an era of pap best forgotten even if you had to grow up with it. Indeed, it must have been quite a task in itself to concoct something this boring, monochrome, adolescent, and lacking in drama - hence the one star.

Almost half the songs had been previously released. Why would you spend money on a CD when only have the songs are new, and really only one is worth listening to over and over (thug nation)? Tracks 2, 3, 9, 17 and 19 are all previously released (originally, track 4 had also been do your thang with Kray and Felecia, but later copies were switched to a new song).Second, if you're looking for layzie, this cd is not a good place. 15 of the songs are featuring some rapper or another, while the intro and outro and skit are not real songs, leaving two songs with just layzie.Sorry layzie, but when a rapper is struggling to keep fans or get back into the mainstream, this [...] is not the right way.

Coincidentally the best songs on bone brothers were the tracks with krayzie on them.

All of Alice's running around town and insomniac nights were exhausting to read knowing that she was 6 moths pregnant with twins. A bit odd that Alice would mind someone smoking a cigarette in front of her when she is so passive about her own health and welfare of the children she is carrying. The book isn't really a who dunnit, but a who cares by time you get through the last page.Also The endless details of people's houses and furnishings became a little annoying as the book went on. The descriptions of the children playing with their toys every other page was just as annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screeching halt","review":"After such a great buildup,I began feeling totally lost due to way too many characters in the final chapters.

Unfortunately, fruit dust always resides at the bottom and easily creates a mess if one is not careful.All in all, I recommend this product and hope that the organic version of this will be chosen over the non-organic.

She teaches an open rejection of the Gospel, Necromancy, Universalism, Pantheism, Reincarnation, etc.... Her final book The Inner Man is possibly a bit hard to find, but is the fullest accounting of her nonChristian heresy. Christians should not read or support New Age theology nomatter how good it may sound! Sometimes the more wormy the theology the more \\"godly\\" we think it is. It's sad because Scripture is all about the victory we have in Jesus. As a student of Philosophy, World Religions and Theology, I have been studying the Buddhistic influence within Christian mysticism today, and Hannah appears to be one of the front people in its promotion.

I finished it recently with my 10-year-old son. We both loved it and are starting Mountains of Spices. I have read that Hurnard's theology became a little skewed later in life, so I am carefully watching to make sure it is appropriate.Hinds Feet is an allegory, a story where the fictional characters are symbolic. The Shepherd is Jesus and the other characters' names describe their personalities and shortcomings. The main character is Much-Afraid. She falls in love with the Shepherd and begins her journey to the High Places. There are many times on her journey she feels forsaken, but He never leaves her. The book shows in such a beautiful, artful way how we learn much from our difficulties, and how God can use anyone to show His glory.It is a book I will need to reread (and again, and again...) to gather all the goodness in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item and transaction","review":"Thank you again Amazon...I have yet to be disappointed in the various items purchased on your site...and this is one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, but a word of caution...","review":"This book was a huge blessing to me. God used it to really encourage my walk at the season I am in right now. It was a powerful and timely read for me, and confirmed things in my individual life that I sense God doing.Being so encouraged by it and encouraging other Christians to read it, I was very sad and disappointed to learn that after the writing of HFOHP,the author, Hannah Hurnard fell into new age, occultism, reincarnation, etc. Her \\"doctrine\\" became a very flawed and inaccurate one and very different from the True doctrine of God's Word, the Bible. So, I wanted to give a warning to all Christians to enjoy HFOHP (perhaps even \\"Mountain of Spices\\" is okay. I've not read it yet.), but to stay away from her other writings, as they are tainted with new age false doctrine. I feel her views were still pure at the point in which she wrote HFOHP, but not long after, she hit a downward spiral. So, just be careful and be forewarned."},{"rating":"2","title":"God's gace...","review":"This book is beautifully written and Hurnard does a great job at painting a vivid picture of how God's grace sustains Christians...often a very hard thing to articulate, Hurnard puts pictures where words fail. Hinds' Feet also shows how a grace filled Christian walk is also accompanied with suffering and sorrow. Hurnard shows how God can wrap his loving purpose around our brokenness and bring meaning, purpose and even joy and peace into the most difficult places, ultimately transforming us when we get to the \\"High Places\\" (heaven). Definitly worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with this book's message","review":"I really am questioning the focus on physical beauty in this book.

I find it hard to believe so many have found it worthwhile reading. The theology is more than a little questionable; it is not surprising to find out that the author drifted away from Christianity into spiritualism and New-Agey philosophy.I read this book thirty years ago and disliked it then; my opinion has not been changed.

With the Frankenstein-music, Doyle may have written his best soundtrack--and one of the best soundtracks I have ever listened to! Although the whole album is of a gloomy character (supported by great orchestral moments such as 'Elizabeth'), he does not fail to create a truly romantic atmosphere by using a memorable love melody (as heard in 'Wedding Night'). The wide range of orchestration (only 5 instruments in 'she's beautiful' and an orchestral blast in 'creation'), will make this CD a true listening-experience each time you take the time to concentrate on this hauting score!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The wonderful music to the movie directed by Kenneth Braugh!","review":"Buy this CD if you like the movie and the beautiful time period it takes p[ace in!I love the whole and I am working on buying the movie on DVD!!It'a beautiful score for a haunting movie based on the novel of the same name!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love this product.

I am a few years past 50 and can see why younger readers would be confused. Unless you lived during WWII you cannot begin to appreciate this story.I did not know much about the Mitford sisters altho was aware of Jessica, Nancy and Diana. I did not realize until I read this book that Unity lived so long after her suicide attempt.It is a book that gives an excellent view of a time and way of living that is now gone. The Mitfords were cash poor, but managed trips, coming out seasons, servants for their various homes, etc. It is difficult for us to understand that way of life.

The author treats Diana and Unity's commitment to fascism as an understandable flaw (rather like a tendency to split infinitives or something), even going so far as to try to play down Mosley's politics.As someone who has read Mosley's book, I was simply astonished at Lovell's treatment of him and Diana.

And she chooses such subjects! there is never a dull moment in these pages. I thought I'd read all I needed to about the Mitfords but there is so much more to learn from this book.

It relies heavily on Jessica Mitford's HONS AND REBELS; THE HOUSE OF MITFORD, by Jonathan & Catherine Guinness, and, Nancy Mitford's novels. The author merely borrows fact (or fictionalized fact) and conclusions from other authors, and sets them forth yet again, in this waste-of-time effort.I wanted NEW insights into this family, and all I found was repetition. I appreciate when a biographer allows me to draw my own conclusions, but there should be times when an author's feelings come forward about the subject(s). In other words, the reader should have some sense of where the author stands. In this case, I think the author was too concerned about not causing offense to the Duchess of Devonshire and Lady Mosley, who gave her assistance.

I for some reason tend to beleive that the word of the craft and it's techniques should be spread by \\"Witch To Witch\\" as opposed to \\"Publication to witch\\" (For lack of better terms). But when this book was put in my hands by the person I consider my mentor, I found the information very aspired and true to it's word. This book goes more in-depth on some very hard to find topics then most anything you'd see online. This book, I saw, was also reccomended in several Pagan and Wiccan magazines. It is highly reccomended from myself and my piers, and I garuntee that this is more then just \\"Spells and Faerie Dust.\\" This book is more than worth it's turn on the bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"a useful book for the solitary practioner of the magical arts","review":"I own a metaphysical shop, and am a teacher in earth based religions.

It has space to record different lifts, weight, sets, reps, etc, but this crowds out room for recording any other type of \\"workout\\".

I'm trying to implement churn analysis at my company, and this isn't helping as much as I expected it to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Coherent Business Strategy","review":"This book by Rob Mattison articulates a coherent business strategy for telecomm in an era of competition. The basic principles of customer retention hold true for any service business. You should know your customer.

Besides, it is a very readable text that communicates the core ideas effectively. Highly recommended for telecomm execs and for those suppliers who would understand the telecom provider as a customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT all for me","review":"One song, \\"Pressing My Way\\" was the only one for me on this CD. Kind of disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guess you had to be there","review":"First things first, the recording is very good albeit somewhat reduced in volume level, 2 discs/Disc 1 is about 67m in length while Disc 2 is about 46m in length. Performance-wise, there are songs I wish they had performed but didn't. A lot of older material is done here, the esoteric stuff. The new drummer is fine but doesn't have the polish of past drummers (Merv was the best in my opinion) but he does make a good showing even if he tends to overuse that 'crash' cymbal a bit too much, that bothered me after awhile. All the other band members perform well. There is some commentary by John which is at times, hard to understand. Personally, I prefer older live recordings to this one: Spice Doubt, Live Underslunky are better in my opinion but as a collector I had to have this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth finishing","review":"I hate to be negative about books, but over the last few years I have started a bunch of books and not finished about 10% of them.Its sort of like...\\"who cares, why go on?\\"I read half of the book. The craftsmanship is not bad. But it became a chore to continue as I was not interested in the characters, plot and essentially nothing happens in the book. It may be me, but at 12AM last night I closed the book and put in on my book shelves and started another book...if anyone would like to discuss why this book is better than I say..please email me...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sum is greater than the parts","review":"This is a very different novel from any I have read before. It rewarded reading all the way to the end, and had the power to surprise. If I had not finished reading it, I'd have thought \\"that is not a very interesting novel, since nothing seems to really happen.\\" Having finished it, something really did happen.Aside from that, the author's way with dialog -- sometimes long passages of dialog -- and (as I saw it, anyway) his relentless ability to stay in point of view were a learning experience. However, it is a period piece firmly fixed in the early 1990s, with references to CompuServe and other now-antique Internet technology (not to mention then-recent headline stories) being part of the essence.Probably not helpful, alas. I suspect that readers who like this book will like it a lot, or at least will find that it grows on them. Many others will not much like it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensation junkies","review":"This book concerns media and traveling and cyber-culture. It is about connections where there seems to be a lack of connection because people commit outrageous acts.

For the price it is great due to how it can keep me bouncing around with the amount of songs in it. At the time I purchased from Amazon for $6.99 for this CD.

I like it overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing \\"Queen of the Broken Hearts\\"","review":"My goal is own only one (1) Loverboy CD. It needs to have all the group's chart hits.

I am holding out for an entry in the Sony/BMG \\"Essential\\" series (as I am for Art Garfunkel, Dan Hartman, an expanded Eddie Money, and a few others) in hopes it will include everything I want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it aloud to the kids!","review":"I found this book by sheer chance when my children were small and it quickly became one of our favorites for bedtime reading sessions. It lends itself naturally to using a variety of voices as it is read, and my children often wanted to help read their favorite parts. Now my grandchildren love it as well. It's one of their favorites and is always included in the pile of \\"read-these-to-me-Grandma books\\" when they come over for a visit.One of the reasons they love the story is that it is written in a lovely sing-songy cadence and uses easily understandable words. The storyline is something that children can identify with as well: we all occasionally wake up feeling grouchy or out-of-sorts, and this is a clever way to let children know it is fine to feel this way as long as they take other people's feelings into consideration. The end is charmingly witty. This is one book that should adorn every library shelf for the sheer fun of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and perfect for anyone who has ever been growled at.","review":"Some people just have to growl. This is the perfectly funny story of a bear who needs to growl and scare someone. The only problem is finding someone who will take him seriously. The lyrical responses of the birds, bunnies, etc. are irresistable. You meet large and growly bears frequently in life, so it's best to prepare your kids to laugh and watch the large and growly bears pass by. Fit to be read a thousand times without tiring. Hope they re-publish this one soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rememberances of a 21-year-old","review":"This is a book that was read to me as a child.

This is a book that I will read to my children."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will be one of your new \\"favorites\\"","review":"This book is a fun story about a lovable \\"growly bear\\" that simply can't find anyone to scare - except himself!

If you have, do not buy this book expecting new stories.Frankly, I'm appalled that the publisher would repackage two previous works without making it obvious to the bookshelf-browsing fan. I am disappointed that Anne McCaffrey would countenance such a deceptive practice.Having said that, both novels are entertaining (if dated) sci-fi stories in McCaffery's Brain Ship universe. If you enjoy that series but somehow missed these installments, you won't be disappointed.New readers of the Brain Ship saga should start withThe Ship Who Sang."},{"rating":"2","title":"Response to various reviews","review":"I have to laugh at how many people are apparently buying books because they have the nice and shiny 'new' label on them without taking the time to find out what the book is about.

The Guitar Chord Wheel Book is a most comprehensive chord book. Remember that chord you needed the other day? This book has it... several different choices of it! It also solves those difficult key changes with its 'chord wheel'. Beside each and every chord there is a 'chord wheel' that tells you the fret for the key you desire. This is especially handy for those who aren't studied in music theory. Also, it is in large print, is easy to understand, and easy to read! Enjoy it-- you will!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Chord Book","review":"The best chord book that I could see. It also serves as a nice intro to Music Theory for guitar in the few opening pages, when it talks about the music alphabet and how it relates to the fretboard, and also about different keys. My gripes about it (and minus one star) are that some of the categories are not properly organized (in regards to Major Minor), and why is it neccessary to show every chord in an inversion (a different order to finger the same strings) I guesss to beef up their chord count. A good Chord book is good for refernce but I wouldnt bother with trying to memorize it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-loathing intellectual","review":"Every page of her account of her trip, undertaken a few months after the North Vietnamese massacres in Hue, gives voice to her self-flagellating sense of guilt for being a wealthy citizen of USA. She loathes herself for being poisoned by capitalist society and its pleasures. A schizophrenic outlook emerges, because Sontag believes that she has found paradise in Hanoi. She forgives herself for the grievous sin of reaping benefits of her own society, which she hates. She is just a radical leftist weirdo, who would not survive 48 hours in the society which she idolizes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Intact","review":"I liked the movie since watching it on cable, This version had some very hot scenes removed from it for VHS, dont buy it if you have seen the unedited version on cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"You mean there's another version out there?","review":"This movie was erotically charged almost from the start.

The combination of the two heavy guitars, the punchy bass, the excellent drumming, and the incredible vocals all give birth to a premier effort that blows me away each time I hear it. Listening to this album is akin to grabbing hold of a roller coaster and hanging on for dear life. From the classic \\"Blind\\" to the powerful \\"Faget\\" and the massive \\"Lies,\\" this album creates a mood that wasn't there before. The lyrics complement the grinding music perfectly.

Also, this cd is very relatable for some people(like myself), because we know what it's like being called stuff at school, making this a very listenable album. Anyways, if you're a true KoRn fan, pick this one up, it's second only to its follow-up, Life is Peachy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I THINK THAT IT IS GREAT","review":"KORN IS THE GREATEST THAT THERE HAS EVER BEEN.

The others don't come close to matching this raw, electric, and unique CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"True inspiration? No.","review":"You have to wonder at a band like this. I figure it just has to be all an act. A misguided act. Get some guys together; think up an alterno-sounding name; write a bunch of agressive, hate-filled songs; and oh yeah, make sure we get that \\"explicit lyrics\\" label on the cover. Can't be without that.What does the band stand for? Who knows. It's all \\"attitude\\" and no real substance. What exactly is it contributing to the world? No idea. Can't call it entertainment. And it is too calculated and mock-anger-filled to call it artistry.Of course, the kids think it \\"kicks a$$!\\". We no longer have good bands anymore that make good music. Instead we have bands that either \\"suck\\" or \\"kick a$$!\\". Too sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"Yeh, I admit Korn is an awesome group, but look at what they sing about. The cover of one of their CDs has a little girl on a swing and a man is watching her like he wants to mollest her. I think it is all sick and wrong. They are a negitive influence on anybody. If you want a band that is a positive influence on you, go to a local christian bookstore and buy a CD called blindside. Or vistit toothandnail.com to find out more about them.

Are you people insane?","review":"Horrible vocals, weak-sauce riffs, inaudible bass, simple drumming, NO SOLOS MELODIES or ANYTHING that classifies this as good music.

From the roar of ARE YOU READY?!! to the emotional epic that is Daddy, Jonathan Davis takes you on a rollercoaster ride and lets out the demons of his childhood. You really really need this album there is not one bad song on it. I bought this album a few years back and it continues to dominate my CD player. It is still my favourite CD from my collection of well over 100 CD's and probably will be unless they bring out something even better.The lyrics on this album have propbably helped so many angst-driven teenagers feel that they are not alone in there pain.The guitars and also the drums on this album really give the album the dark effect that they need.There is no need in me going through the tracks and giving them a score out of 10 because they will all be 10. This is how good this album really is.This is KoRn's heaviest, darkest and best album to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"korn","review":"when jon davis said \\"are you ready\\" on blind, he really want us to be ready. i was a big fan of korn and its an absolute great album. korn was a really big music change after nirvana. ross robinson know what he does, and now, hes a world famous producer, thanks to korn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost 10 years later, and still the best Korn CD.","review":"This is 1 of those few times where i can sit and listen to the whole album, without disliking any songs (except for mabey shoots and ladders, where they just say a bunch of neursery rymes on a rock instrument).

To end all this, yeah buy the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Korn at their best!","review":"This is Korn's best! Life Is Peachy was the worst. Freak On A Leash is the second best.

Another thing people hate about this cd is Daddy. my god people get to know a band before you can hate them. Now for the good points. the songs are great. I dont have a one favorite. but i can tell you my favoriteS. Blind is a really cool opener with the famous line ARE YOU READY??!!. Shoots and Ladders is funny. Lies is a really cool song. its probably my favorite. Daddy is a really emotional song. I dont like emotional songs like that. it makes me curl up in a ball and cry all day.

Now I've heard a little band called Machine Head, and I'd like to say: KORN IS FOR PUSSIES!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to Listen to","review":"This is not painful to listen to because I'm a boy band fan, but rather because I enjoy listening to quality metal. The only redeeming quality of this album is it's innovative style. If only that creative energy had been put into making a more compelling album. I've no problem with downtuned guitars, Jazz guitarists have made good use of them for quite a while now, but when downtuning is used to cover up the musicians' inabilities, it's no longer ok. The lyrics are overly fixated on teenage angst which is probably why the nu metal genre has gained such amazing popularity with the mallgoing teen demographic, garnering the genre the not-so-flattering title mallcore. In any case, this is a good album for angry teenagers, and little else."},{"rating":"2","title":"THER BEST ONE","review":"I thnink that korn is a good band and ther first cd is ther best one.i mean this cd has graet songs like blind, clown,ball tongue,heck all the song are good.yher ther other cdS are good but this the best go get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"This is considered to be KoRns best album to many. To me, its a good CD, but certainly not the best. Most people say after their debut they went soft, when thats certainly not true(look at Issues or Untouchables)but this album is definitley one of their hardest. Almost every track is good(xcept 12 cos its too depressing) and filled with emotion and hard hitting riffs. KoRn is definitley the cream of the nu metal crop, and they are the originals, who brought rap-metal to the mainstream. If you like nu metal you have to get this CD its the source of all the nu metal. Highly Reccomended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning of KORN","review":"Oh yeah, this CD was made from the first segment of their ingenius powers and it rules. The good songs are plentiful, infact, the only bad one...it would be \\"Fake\\", but it also has a part I absolutely love in it and it's so well put together...so the worst song would then be \\"ball tongue\\", and that's a sweet song too. Here are the three worst in my opinion:2 ball tongue 7.5/109 Fake 7.6/108 Predictable 8/10The reason I'm focusing on the bad is because it's too good, I mean every song is genius, period. (I don't even have to tell you that you should go buy it right now with that money right there that you have)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great CD","review":"This is there first CD they made and it is great! Blind is the first song its a little slow. Ball tongue is a good song talking about how they were all laughed at and the pain he has.

The mood on this album is fascinating and I'm not sure I've ever heard a cd with this much raw emotion. This isn't something you sit and listen to and feel good about, the lyrics are different and probably the best korn ever did. The songs are mostly all structured differently and each song stands out on its own.The best song has to be \\"Blind\\" I never seem to get sick of listening to it. \\"Helmet in the Bush\\" \\"Ball Tongue\\" and \\"faget\\" are also high quality. \\"Daddy\\" is probably the most miserable, depressing, raw song I've ever heard, songs like that made Korn what they were, too bad they got away from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without a doubt Korn's best cd","review":"Korn's latest album \\"Follow the Leader\\" is slightly techno, which puts it at the bottom of the Korn album list.

Korn is what I would define as \\"Garbage\\" metal. That being obnoxious lyrics combined with loud instruments played very poorly. They are loud and aggressive like older metal bands, but they have absolutley no sense of melody or harmony. That's what will forever seperate them from the true great bands like Black Sabbath and 1980s Metallica. Even Slayer has more melody than these guys!

If you call yourself a Korn fan then you must already own this CD, but if you're just getting to know them, then know that \\"issues\\" is NOTHING compared to this! . WARNING! This Cd is not for everyone as it features Jonathan's most disturbed and dark lyrics to date specially on the last song \\"Daddy\\" wich concludes with Jon crying and screaming in a really emotional way...a song he refuses to sing ever again to this very date.

You wouldn't have Staind, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, hell just about any of them except Deftones and Rage Against the Machine (came out at the same time Korn did if not sooner).Musically this album is definatly Korns heaviest LP. Head and Munky's downtuned guitars meld perfectly with Fieldy's jazzy basslines and Dave's great drumming. And Jon lets out all of his rage, anger, dispair, and depression out.

The emotions explored on this CD perfectly explain my life. I guess that's why KoRn has gained such a massive teenage following. Beside Davis' best lyrics ever, the music is raw. The cheap recording quality bothers the hell out of me. I hope they digitally remaster this album, when they have the time.

The instrumentals, due to lack of a better word, [smell]. No guitar solos, no melody, just noise.As for the mood of this album, it is just depressing....

I think Korn should stick with what they are good at HARDCORE music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Korn's best work","review":"...Korn is a more Metal/Punk/Hardcore band, with a touch of funk....This album is Korn's best. It is too bad Korn have decreased over the years. Songs like Blind, Ball Toungue, Divine, Clown, Fagot, Shoots and Ladders, and others are such amazing songs. Catchy yet powerful guitar riffs, decent basslines(Fieldy never was the best bassist.), spectacular drumming by David, and of course Jon doing what he always does. This album beats songs like \\"Make Me Bad\\" any day. You want great music, get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witness this great cd!","review":"The only jewel to done it all in my opinion, is the self-titled of Korn. 12 tracks that contains extreme violence & full of pure agony from Jon Davis himself that describes his tragedy from the past here is quite the unique the way he describes it in words.But now they've got this still in stores, this cd quickly became known as an instant classic.

The \\"pointless\\" screaming in unbelievably expressed and Brian and munky can seriously rip those riffs in blind and faget, david has some quick hands in divine and fieldy has a slick intro in blind aswell. The bagpipes are just so sad. They are almost magical. Most people don't respect these songs because they have no idea what he is trying to say, \\"faget? what a gay song.

Korn put out a bunch of good hard rock albums since then, but this is where they are the most real, the most angry, the most disturbing. Every song is great and furious except maybe track 10 and even that has a cool intro. The speech in the middle of \\"Faget\\" is a classic rock moment, as is \\"Daddy\\". They're all good! Korn didn't have to put on masks to get their point across. I also like their stance in the songs; they're not the violent agressors, they're the opressed and hated and picked on.Now I like some underground metal, but these morons who get on and write about the \\"Real Metal\\" don't kow what they're talking about. They think that grunting and screeching and trying to sound monstorous is cooler and more disturbing than anything else. But folks, that grindcore/standard death is just as cliched and stupid as is modern nu-metal.

This album is a travesty of the worst kind to the world of hard rock and heavy metal. No, it is not metal, but keeps getting lumped in with metal time and time again, as those with no knowledge of metal grope for a label. I bought this album in 1994, but then sold it shortly afterward. I seriously gave it many a listen to try to see what all the fuss was about. So what did I find? Contrived teen \\"angst\\" lyrics, a whiny vocalist who could not hold a tune with both hands and a bucket, stolen riffs, a poor sound quality with over-simplified bass lines swamping everything else, bad drumming, and an overall interest in trying (and failing) to seem cool by being hard done by. The worst thing about the album is that it enabled this excuse for a band to record several more since, as well as influencing thousands of copy cats, and generally reducing the collective IQ of the youth of this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is one that most people can relate to","review":"I thought this CD was great, and maybe the best I\`ve ever heard! It\`s discusses things that most people,young and old, can relate to. Sure it may be dark and disturbing in such tracks as daddy and faget, but it is also realistic. Jon\`s not sick for writing lyrics the way he does, other people are sick(and mean)for doing what they did to him. Every song is awesome both verbally, and musically."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Original Classic","review":"This is the only album I like from Korn because it is filled with so much raw/true emotion. Ross Robinson also did an awesome job producing it. All of the guys expressed so much rage in such a creative/original way on this album, it really does deserve 5 stars. Something really new came out on this album - kind of like a heavy, melodic, semi-hip hop groove band with tortured vocals. Nu Metal or not- who cares, I never liked pigeon holing bands and this album is definitely too good for a specific category. Take it for what it is: a truly great piece of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"people who call Korn sellouts need to recognize!","review":"Why is it that everytime a band gets popular, they are automatically called \\"sellouts\\"?

Oddly enough, this cd shows how The Get Up Kids have gotten significantly worse over time. Since when do unpassionate singing and pianos have a place in rock. (Nobody can call this emo either because it is not) The only reason I would recommend this cd is for the last six songs. Everything else on this cd is a pathetic attempt at giving high school kids some kind of motivation. They will think to themselves, wow, girls don't like me, and one day I will could be able to write terrible sappy songs about it and make loads of money. This cd has absolutely no passion, not to mention intelligence, until the last five songs.

Next to go up were pictures of all our relatives. The book turned out to be a geography lesson for my child as well as fine reading and entertainment. It was especially fun pulling out some of our family pictures to put on the map. My son felt closer to our family just having them up on his wall. Being a family that is stretched across the U.S.A. and even beyond, we sometimes feel quite seperated from the rest of our family. This book certainly helps my son feel a little closer to the rest of his family, and is a treat to read. The illustrations are very cute, and are a surce of entertainment in their own right."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound","review":"Musically and vocally this band truly does rock. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5, is that though they - a Japanese band - make a great effort to write and thus perform in English, their work is just not 100% fluent English. I would like to sing along with them, but my mind is constantly arguing about the grammer. I do give them lots of respect for choosing to work in a foreign language, and pulling it off as well as they do. Honestly, this band is great and I do plan on getting more of their albums in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous topic and a fantastic author","review":"I had the luck of not only reading this novel but having a class taught by the author.I have an interest in WWII so this book was an easy read for me as well. Though the characters are fictional, you will want them to be real for the heroism they display on the pages. From saving Jewish children, rescuing women from concentration camps, and blowing up factories the people will entice you to read more.There are sex scenes here between lesbian and gay couples and they are pretty graphic. For me, the worst part was reading the pasage then going ot class to be lectured by the author. Kinda weird.Overall, I loved this novel and am looking forward to Part 2.

Box was in good condition upon delivery and the packing done at the factory was well thought out to minimize damage in transit. Setup was easy and alignment was perfect right out of the box.I used the local distributor for my cabinet saw last year because the price was competitive and I had read all kinds of horror stories about shipping damage/issues for heavy items on Amazon customer reviews. Because of the price difference I took the chance this time and am very satisfied...absolutely no issues with the motor freight. The saw was deliverd to my house on a liftgate truck and the driver had a pnuematic lift and moved it with no problem right into the garage. I haven't been able to give the saw a good workout yet but I cut 40 ft of red oak for some bookshleves and performance is as expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"DELTA! Not what it used to be.","review":"Due to hurricane damage, I was forced to replace my 18 year old Delta radial arm saw with a new Delta 33-895X saw. The new saw came with a defective motor that had to be sent in for warranty replacement. I am now told that the new motor is back-ordered and I will not receive it for at least 4 to 6 weeks. We have been without it for three weeks so far. We are a manufacturer and need our tools to be reliable, plus quick and easy to repair.To add to this, the quality of the finished product is not good. I suspect that this tool is not American made anymore. I always try to buy the best I can afford. If I wanted cheap I could have saved more than a few hundred dollars by buying an import.So much for good old american made."},{"rating":"2","title":"My twins love this book!","review":"I started reading this book to my girls when they were about 13 months old. It soon became their favorite - they sit still (unusually so!) and listen, and smile at the parts they like best. It is so much fun to see them respond to the simple phrases, because they can understand them. One daughter likes \\"Two little babies play outside\\" best, the other likes the swinging \\"up, down, up.\\" They are now 15 months old, and this is by far the book they choose the most.I almost didn't buy this book because of some bad & unfair reviews - so I had to share our experience, and let other twin moms know that it's definitely a hit. My 5 year old also likes it, so all three pile in my lap and have me read it over & over. A really cute book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for twins!","review":"I really like this book!

In fact, I only listened to this because I heard she was part of this band before she started her solo career. And quite frankly, I was disappointed. Her solo stuff is so much better. This is annoying, repetitive, blaring garage rock, not nearly as catchy as Vitamin C's stuff. Yeah, she may have succumbed to generic but addictive radio pop, but I think that's a good thing. This stuff is just crap. Go check out Colleen's solo albums instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS BOOK FOR YEARS","review":"I am the grt. grt. grt. grt. niece of the \\"daring and notoriuous\\" Col. George W. Kirk. Over the years I have done a great deal of research on Kirk, and, as the author did, often came across mention of the Blalocks, and I, too, was fascinated by the couple. From what I knew of the Rebels in Blue, I was certain that if someone could do the research and connect all of the fragmented material the result would be a fantastic thriller, full of real-life colorful characters. It is a story of loyalty and rebelion, devotion and betrayal, love and hate,freinds and foes,survival and death, heroes and villains - the story of my family's heritage as well as our nation's. The end result of Steven's writing the book that I had longed for far exceeded my expectations, and I am certain that any who read Rebels in Blue will agree that this story is well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Disappointed","review":"Noticed a few errors on dates and some misidentification of people.

Prior to this book, I have read a number of accounts dealing with the Blalocks in many sources. However, this book pulls it all together and paints a clear picture of what this couple did during the War years. While I don't agree with what they did, I admire their passion for the Union cause. Such a shame so many local citizens and kin people had to suffer at their hands. I now live one mile from where Keith and Malinda Blalock are buried and visit that resting place often.Bo Cash, Avery County, NC"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak, many omisions...","review":"Sure, this book covers the Fenders and Gibsons adequately, but its coverage of some lesser know brands like Godin and Ibanez is a joke.

You will not be able to sleep until you read the whole thing from beginning to end, but that's just my opinion, so if it doesn't appeal to you, don't pay any attention to me.

Using the trends established by existing, successful organizations like Nike and Disney, Jensen paints a picture of marketing through consumer allegiance by imagination.For would-be futurists, this book is compelling. For ordinary business folk, this book gels all the trends and ideas you've been seeing lately, and makes sense of it all. For the rest of us -- the Dream Society articulates the need we humans have for stories, culture, and acceptance.This is an extraordinarily intriguing book. Even if you don't agree (or are afraid to imagine) the future scenarios Jensen presents, you'll be compelled to admit -- the Dream Society may really be here after all. A must-read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting thoughts, but a little bit too casual","review":"The title promises firework for your brain, but really doesn't deliver. After 100 pages or so I noticed I was getting bored with it. A lot of examples, but no more thought provoking ideas. If you're interested in exploring new ways for doing business in the future, I can recommend \\"The Visionary's Handbook\\" by Watts Wacker and Jim Taylor. More thought provoking. The Dream Society is only recommended for casual reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"limited new insights","review":"Based on some of the other reviews, I was looking for a bit more insight on the concept of storytelling. Much of what is covered in this book is information covered in other books on Storytelling. Nevertheless, if you want an introduction to the storytelling as a better way to communicated this book is fine as a first read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice vision on a future that might already be here today.","review":"This is a good, visionary book on what could lie just around the corner of the information age. One should remember that future visions are no magic bullits, future visions are broad avenues rather that narrow paths, meant to make one think in different and new ways. People like Rolf Jensen have the ability to build a future vision without getting squishy or vague. This book is not about vague ideas but centers on the notion that we are more and more buying the 'story' behind products or services rather than the product or service itself. On the basis of this notion, implications for businesses, markets and people are laid down in an easy-going style.I have had the honour and opportunity to spend several hours with Rolf Jensen in June, 1999, we had plenty of time to talk undisturbed on a large variety of issues. Thanks, Rolf, for indulging me. He's a smart, witty and driven individual."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Past does not Equal The Future. Know Why!","review":"Definitely coming from the New Sciences breakthrough achievements this book pleasantly takes us to our present 'inner world' and our future world in which this inner world will be expressed. This book builds a strong case for looking at ourselves, our 'now' and our future with the full spectrum of human components in view. And it provides us with interesting views on the translation of 'total human perspective' into society. Yes, this book may stimulate your ability to even capitalize on the 'Dream Society' in business terms. Jensen invites you to jump into his helicopter and take a ride with him to past, present and some possible futures.

To his credit, the author does keep to a fairly straight storyline, not drifting so much that the reader can't keep up. However, the characters lacked individual depth, the character relationships were even less developed, and the science appeared to have no preparatory research. Most bothersome were the elements similar to another notable vampire-genre author (who was slightly denigrated by context, by the way). I found The Vampire Virus to be a very flat, dull ride. The amusing parts were in more of an \\"Oh come on!\\" sort of way, amused at the writing instead of by the writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"romkey's usual","review":"no doubt, this was an excellent book, but I was lead to believe that it was going to be different than the others he's written in the \\"series\\" but it wasn't.

Only 2 exceptions: \\"Another Day\\" & \\"Mull of Kintyre\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"What a vocalist!","review":"There is a lot of soul in this music...Russian and American. The song, Blues Lullaby, is an amazing amalgam of the two cultures, featuring the sexy voice of a Newport News singer of fame in that coastal region, and the guitar of the Russian physicist known as Costy L. Annie Johnson knows how to deliver the lyrics and Costy, the song writer, did a whale of a job. Great song!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the iron mask--a very involving album","review":"this is the second cd of costy l.'s which i've gotten (the first was \\"dirty sky\\"), and his music has become even richer & intricate. on this album he has added a drummer on several tracks and a female lead vocalist on \\"blues lullaby,\\" which are indeed great additions, but he again impresses me with (& makes me extremely jealous of) his multi-instrumentalism, and his creation of sounds which don't seem to me to come from any of those many instruments. i can't get over the variety of the sounds, techniques and influences on this album. i guess one of the most striking aspects of it is how vivid and demanding his (six) instrumentals are, especially the *highly-narrative* suite \\"hanging, drawing & quartering,\\" the deceptively simple \\"immense light,\\" and \\"bride of the blue fire.\\" it is very often some of the most involving and original music i have heard in some time...listen for yourself, there are four samples from the \\"iron mask\\" on here (amazon)..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillary a person to be noted","review":"Using Clinton's past interviews and comments from her friends and colleagues, Warner details the evolution of the first lady from teenager to college student to lawyer, mother, activist, and politician's wife. Clinton's strong personality and intellect seem to have made her a success in her own right, and appear to be crucial elements in Bill Clinton's rise to the top. From this book it seems Bill would never had been able to become the President; but she would have made at least senator on her own. This book places a positive light on an intelligent Hillary Clinton. And actually shows Bill as a liability. This is worth reading to see how she was when she first entered the limelight of political life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor manufacture","review":"I returned this item and never actually used it on the grill. It is porceline coated, and two ends of the grilling surface had porceling missing with bare metal exposed. It would have rusted almost immediately. I doubt it would have held up to a barbque spatula. The concept with one solid half is excellent, as well as the three lips and one open end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stimulating book covers many areas","review":"Mammon and Manon in Early New Orleans is an incredibly interesting and informative book for numerous reasons. This book describes New Orleans' birth and slow evolution into one of the most important cities in the United States. This city was controlled economically and socially by slavery and Mammon and Manon reveals this in with both factual and individual accounts. The book is also excellent in explaining New Orleans' uniqueness in regards to other southern cities and Ingersoll includes many comparisons to other southern states and urban areas. Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone interested in New Orleans and/or the early African-American experience in America."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS SUCKS!","review":"I WAS HYPED ABOUT THE TITLE, BUT WHEN I WATCHED IT, I WAS SO BORED.

WHATEVER YOU DO DONT BUY THIS!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nice looking but has problems","review":"This is an attractive and affordable chrome toilet brush with two problems: 1) the canister lid, which is attached to the brush handle, hits against the toilet bowl rim as you are cleaning because the handle is too short; 2) it's nice that the brush is detachable so you can replace it later, but it detaches from the handle while you are cleaning, which is not so nice. You have to fish it out of the toilet and screw it back on.This is a small-ish brush that looks nice sitting next to the toilet, but if you are going to be cleaning your toilet with it, get a better one. The Oxo brush is not as pretty but it works a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great initially - but beware!","review":"My guess is that most of the \\"great\\" reviews were customers who had just taken it out of the box. I myself would agree that out of the box it is a nice looking piece and exactly what I wanted.Poor design though - the lid does get in the way as the brush is too short and the brush does unscrew from the lid while cleaning. Those things I could overlook.But, beware - this thing rusts like crazy. Not long after I had it the moist environment in the canister had the inside of the handle coated with rust which sprinkled all over my new white toilet as I cleaned it.Today I moved the item to clean the bathroom floor only to find a thick rust ring staining my brand new tile floor - after a few tries I almost have most of the stain gone. Fortunately, my tiles are sort of a red-clay color so the damage may be concealable. I am going to throw this item away! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Quality Finish","review":"Item purchased in Dec. 2009. Finish looked fine initially. The finish began showing spots soon after I received it and after about 15 months it is now pitted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Brass, and has pitted and rusted.","review":"I purchased this item in December of 2010. It looked fine new out of the box, but now it is very apparent that the metal is NOT Brass, but some base metal that is brass colored.The finish began showing spots within two months after I received it, and after nine months is is showing rust spots and pitting. The \\"brass coating\\" at the top of the brush handle is showing the worse amount of rust and spots even though the brush and its handle was cleaned once a week with polish.The bottom of the brush container, once you remove the plastic liner, has a solid coat of rust. I'd clean it, but the bottom might fall off.Very false item description concerning the material, and the entire item is worth less that $7 to $9. I'd give it NO STARS if I could. I replaced it with a white plastic toilet brush and container."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Product","review":"The brush will not screw into the handle. I originally ordered two and obtained two replacements and all four were defective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Handsome. Well designed. Well manufactured. Replaceable brush. Non-slip bottom. Easy to clean..A well thought out product. Much better than the more expensive item it replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Looking but a Little Less Functional","review":"Purchased two of these to use in guest bathrooms, primarily because they look better than the usual plastic models. They do indeed look very nice and like most Gatco products I have purchased are well made and a fair value. However, the handle is pretty short and the brush a little flimsy. The brush does, in the end, work well enough and if a good look is important, it would be a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive Help for Novice and Experienced Writers","review":"\\"...a carefully worked gem of a reference book, packed with facts, advice and common sense on the ins and outs of the writing business that you'll find nowhere else.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"messy and difficult","review":"It is hard to find ice pop molds these days and I was looking for something that would be easy and reusable (no wooden sticks). I got a few different kinds, including these tupperware molds over a month ago.For starters, they are small. They don't stand up strait or secure in the tray. The parts are hard to fit together (sticks are difficult to put in cap/bottoms, and you have to do it when it's full of juice so it is hard not to spill). Worse, even though it's a tight fit and they are crooked, they leek out at the stick when you eat them so you get gooey juice on you.I recommend the \\"groovy freezer pop mold\\" by Tovolo if you can find them.I wonder if the first reviewer is the person selling tupperware, I can image a baby would make a mess using these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get lids on...","review":"Okay, these are cute and I love Tupperware, but I could have bought several other products for A LOT less money and probably been more satisfied. I am feeling like I paid for the \\"NAME BRAND\\" of these popsicle molds. They are really cute and the perfect size for a toddler, but I have to work WAY too hard to get the lids on and as a mom of a toddler, I don't have the patience to mess with a popsicle lid for 15 minutes. They have to snap on and I need to get on with things! I wouldn't buy this product again and am seriously considering returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for babies!","review":"My 8 month old loves to eat these on a hot summer day.

It is extremely difficult to get them to fit since they are a bit smaller. You really need to work to stretch it to fit. The other disappointment is the button holes in the bag do not align with the buttons on the compactor, so forget about buttoning it in and concentrate all your efforts on getting it to fit. Oh and they're thinner too.As another reviewer noted, the Whirlpool W10165296RP IS NOT a substitute for the Kitchenaid 18\\" 4318938 bag.Someone told me the Viking bags may fit and they're supposedly thicker. I'll try those after I go through the 45 W10165296RP's that I am now stuck with, if I have any fingers left."},{"rating":"1","title":"good price, poor quality","review":"While these are a great value (more than 50% less than other bags - Viking in particular), the plastic is thin, they rip easily and more than half the time, you have to rebag in large green garbage bag.Overall, not worth the savings in time cleaning up and you have to factor in cost of rebagging messy trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"I found these bags to be very satisfactory for my use. They are strong and fit my compactor well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kitchenaid 4318938 NOT SAME as Whirlpool W10165296RP","review":"If you are looking for a large compactor bag to fit an 18\\" compactor such as the Electrolux IKON, the Whirlpool W10165296RP IS NOT a substitute for the Kitchenaid 18\\" 4318938 bag. Evidently the Kitchenaid product is no longer available and the Whirlpool bag is substituted (by all vendors I believe). The Whirlpool 18\\" bag is smaller than the Kitchenaid and is NOT an adequate substitute as it does not fit compactors such as the Electrolux (whereas the Kitchenaid bag did).

Its true the graphics are amazing, but the rest of the game far less so. After two hours of endless button mashing and tedious game play I had had enough. The only solutiom was to put it back in the box and take it back to the video store. Which brings me to the real point of this review - to recommend renting this game rather than purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! 10/10","review":"This game is really awesome.

Jeff Santo (Ron's son)did a wonderful job with this documentary on his Dad! I had the pleasure of meeting RON a few times in recent years and he deserves a film like this and should be in the Hall of Fame. THIS OLD CUB is NOT just for CHICAGO CUBS fans...it's a film for everyone BUT if you like Baseball or know people suffering from Diabetes or suffer from it yourself, you will like the film that much more. GREAT extras on the DVD too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sad dvd","review":"They focus more on his having diabetes and not his career. I would have liked it more if they showed him playing or discussed his career with the cubs.They touch on his time with the cubs as a player, but I feel spent too much time showing him sitting in a wheelchair waiting to be seen or when his legs were removed.I did not even finish watching it, because it made me sad and uncomfortable. I wanted to see a baseball great who could deal with an ongoing illness and see how his time as a ball player was the strength of his life. Instead I felt I was staring at a guy who while strong, was nearing death and missing his better days. I think it could have been done much much better.You may see it differently. I just was unhappy I spent the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hall of Fame in the hearts of Cub fans","review":"Incredible determination by an athlete who honors the sport of baseball.

Great movie, very enlightening for the non-professional. The added bonus dvd is something every Thoroughbred trainer should view again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent documentary","review":"The movie gives an excellent insider look at the jockey profession and surrounding information about racing horses. Nicely balanced to provide a glimps at many different aspects of the life of a jockey - many questions people would have are answered in a story telling presentation that kept us interested the entire time. Several knowledgeable people are interviewed to illustrate different views of people in the horse racing industry. The title is a little misleading: it is not the story of one jockey but a movie about many jockeys who all get to speak. The audience gets information about the stories of several jockeys. I like it better that way actually. Entertaining and informative. Very nicely done. If you are curious about a jockey's life, what they go through and why they do it, this is a good movie for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait!","review":"Finally an album of original songs! It may have taken 15 years but it was worth it! Here at the Mayflower is classic Manilow but with a more mature feel to it. The concept of a theme album is done the way only Barry can, the lyric and changing tempos support the idea of all the different people you'd expect to find living in a large apartment complex. I expect Barry to have several hits come from this album namely Border train,( classic soulful Manilow) Talk to me, Turn the radio up, and I miss you. I would recommend this album to anyone who likes good music , you don't have to be a Barry Manilow fan to appreciate this album, although you just might become one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"barry is back!! just in time","review":"this is the best cd from him in a long time of musicof what i grew up on, his own not jazz, not show tunes, or singing Frank! not that they all were not good!they were very good.

This cd is like having all hisbest cds from the past put into one! hes got the oldwriters together again and you can hear it and I for oneam very happy and love this cd.Ive been waiting for along time for this kind of cd just like 'trying to getthe feeling' or any of the next 4 cds after that one.this is a great cd and its filled with fast songs,andas many slow ones and some surpises also.this is a sure barry cd to have you will not besorry and if you are than you were never a fan from thestart.I could buy many more cds just like this one , just likei did in the 70s,go get it and enjoy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in 12 Years!","review":"I so terribly glad HATM isn't all totally 'jazz' or 'big band' or 'broadway'.

He played some songs I did not recognize. People all over the Rosemont Theater went out to buy this CD in the lobby after the show.After the intermission he told the audience that many of the songs that night were from the Mayflower CD. Ran right out and bought it in the lobby. He tells a great story in the cd about three couples.The song about the elderly couple is very true and very caring. My favorite is \\"They Dance.\\"At the concert, they sold a three song bonus cd with an extended version of \\"They Dance\\" Awesome.One of Barry Manilows best projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I bought this CD on recommendation of other reviewers here, and I have to say that I'm VERY disappointed. It's not as if I'm not a Manilow fan, so I knew what style of music to expect. On the other hand, the title track is the only one I really liked, and only one of three on the whole CD that I found even listenable.

He uses the melodic figure of the opening chords of Ms. Nyro's \\"Wedding Bell Blues\\" as the melody for his chorus, and he directly quotes not only the melody, but the words \\"Come on people\\" from yet another Nyro composition, \\"Save the Country.\\" If you want honest-to-goodness quality material, don't look here; go to the source! I recommend Laura Nyro's album Eli & The Thirteenth Confession. It is truly a masterwork, and it can never be imitated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Got It","review":"I have been a Barry Manilow fan for some 20 years! This is yet another exciting album in a long list for him. It is totally Barry Manilow! It just keeps getting better. I just saw him in Atlanta, GA doing Here at the Mayflower. It was Great! That was without a doubt the best concert I have ever been to. I would go see this every night and it would still be just as great as the first night! This is going to be one of his best yet.

The best part of them: My son loves these videos so madly and therefoer learned words from them so quickly!!! There are about 20 words in each vedio.The \\"Motorized Madness\\" is also good, it has 10 machines such as \\"airplane, bulldozer, dump truck, backhoe loader, helicopter, bucket truck, boat, motlecycle, fire truck, and bus.\\" It also explains each part of the machine, like the wings, propellers, engine, cab...The baby bumble bee surely produce the best of the best infant and kids reading program vedios in the market--as good as Dr. Titzer's \\"Your baby can read 1-5\\" DVDs and Dr. Glenn Dorman's \\"How to teach your baby to read\\" book.I love baby bumble bee's \\"Opposites\\", \\"Motorize\\", \\"Actions words 1-3\\" and \\"vocabulary builders 1-5\\" the most.

It was exciting and gripping all the way up until the main characters marry, in a way that I felt was totally unbelievable. Then suddenly with very little interaction between them, she's in love with him? Again, not plausible. And finally, the book eneded abruptly, as if Ms. Dailey suddenly lost interest. There was so much more that could have been done with this story, I was definitely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Interest","review":"Sorry...but after Maggie's character died in the last Calder installment...I lost interest.

Also, I am so over Ben Franklin. So, he invented the kite and the can opener. I think that we as a society would have figured those things out for ourselves after a while anyway. I was looking for some good witty sayings to use when I picked up this book. Until I turn 75 next year, I will not consider myself old and will not be using any of the outdated sayings or information in this book.

It \\"explains\\" things in a very simple and undetailed way, at least for someone whose professional area is not linguistics. It introduces some new vocabulary while it tries to show you the grammatical rules of the language. That didn't help me, however, it just confused me more, as I had double work trying to figure out the new vocabulary and then trying to understand the Chinese Grammar (which, by the way, is not logical at all, at least to me).

This one really didn't help me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done","review":"If you are studying Chinese then you really need a grammar book as a companion to your other course materials. This will serve as a good reference which can be referred to when needed. The fact that the second half of the book focuses on functional (i.e. situational) grammar makes it easy to find the relevant grammar pattern. I won't go into too many details - you can read that in the review(s) below. I still have some grammar questions that the book doesn't answer but it is the best I have found so far.

I was touched very much by Ralphs Fultz life as well. The way he turned his life around after all he had been through is astonishing and nothing less than miraculous. Fultz' work to stand up against the corruption of the prison system and spread the word to help others from following the same road were admirable.

The story unfolds like a novel, revealing the motivation of two petty thieves, Fults and Barrow and their unfortunate escalation into the life of crime, owed in no small part to the brutal Texas prison system. Phillips' approach is fresh and unapologetic, breaking new ground by exposing all the elements and key players in a very balanced and coherent way. I found the major figures in Phillips' book to be tragic, but in a decidedly pathetic way, in no way romantic.

It is very easy to understand and learn from.My only complaint is that immediately under each question is the answer, so you've seen the answer before you can even think about it! Why not put the answers at the back of the book like every other textbook? (This is why I deducted a star). [There are some 'self-tests' which don't have the answers immediately after the question, but I would have preferred no answers until the end, all the way through the book].This aside, I have, and continue to learn a lot with it.If you are looking for an easy to understand chemistry textbook as a refresher or to compliment your current chemistry course - go ahead - it's worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I am going back to school in the fall to start Pre-med.

Because learning by actually doing is so effective, this book has taught me more than I would have thought possible.

Intonation is introduced before everything else, this unique approach truly makes this book stand out.

My background: Previously I have been studying British pronunciation for 2 years and know the subject. In the United States I have been studying American pronunciation with a private tutor for almost one year.About the book: The book mixes the sounds together which are infact completely different sounds. Therefore it is not consistent. For example page 75: the words \\"talk\\", \\"chalk\\", \\"pawn\\" are in the same pronunciation column as words \\"bond\\", \\"hot\\", \\"con\\". But the pronunciation of those two groups is different!!!!I will not go through all other things, but there are quite few of them.And the biggest disadvantage of the book is: the IPA is not used here. The author invented her own phonetic transcription (with umlauts, and other fancy symbols), which are used.Conclusion: If you want to study American Pronunciation professionally - never buy this book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"If you like drills after drills, Ann Cook's book is for you.I highly recommended the following book if you want to learn something meaningful and contextual.Mastering the American Accent with Audio CDs by Lisa M."},{"rating":"1","title":"No improvement for bearers of ligh accent","review":"I have read the book, listened to the CDs and did the exercises, no improvement what so ever.which ever changes in my accent I have acquired are e defined by a professional(after this feutal attempt I have turned to professional help ) as incorrect pronunciation (low level english, \\"non western\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great program!","review":"Ann Cook has put together the clearest, most insightful program for acquiring an American accent that I have found. You get 5 very useful CD's all cued to the manual, a small mirror, markers, and an excellent manual. Quite a value! She understands the American accent perfectly and masterfully explains the ingredients that make up that accent. I am a native speaker/speech therapist and I learned a good deal from this package. I do have one small reservation: a few of her examples of American speech which she considers standard (spoken by educated speakers) sound, to my ears, like mumbling and non-standard speech (ex: \\"didee\\" for \\"did he\\", \\"wooden knee\\" for \\"wouldn't he\\"). I prefer a bit more clarity where consonants are concerned. Dropping consonants has always been a sign of low socio-economic American speech, not standard American speech. This is a minor complaint about an otherwise excellent package. If you use this program, you will sound like \\"one of us\\".

However, the first half of the record present the heavy rock band that Queen originally was and we love so much, for instance you can hear the excellent brighton rock and the proto speed metal \\"stone cold crazy\\", just marvellous. The second half is a bit softer, but it remains its quelity, in a different way though, you can hear the catchy misfire, leroy brown,...there is practically no filler in here. All in all, not for a beginner, but if you like the art rock, heavy riffs band, that early queen was, you cant go wrong with this.

Several different feelings, from \\"stone cold crazy\\", an almost heavy metal song, to the beautiful simplicity of \\"in the lap of the gods\\", to \\"bring back that leroy brown\\", which I 'm not sure if it's Dixieland, traditional jazz, or what.

I'm a great Queen fan and I like this very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"complexity that grows on you","review":"OK, so maybe I'm a simpleton when it comes to music, but it took me a few listens to get into this album. As a traditional jazz listener (not that Kenny G ..., but older stuff like Herbie Hancock Headhunters or something newer like Nicola Conte) who also likes some d&b stuff, the broken beats and complexity of everything mixed up on this took a while for me to get into - it didn't seem to be cohesive. However, having listened to it a few times the complexity began to make more sense to me, and I came to appreciate most of the tracks, track 5 especially, which had been one of my least favorite on the first listen. Having said that, I could do without the spoken word stuff, but thats just me. Now I'm at the point where I feel like this has been one of my best purchases of the last year. Give it a few tries and I think you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazza-Luva","review":"I really like this cd, although I will agree with some of the reviews about the Ursula Rucker psuedo-rap that really didn't need to be included. It starts out with quiet sampling and turns into an explosive of lush and exotic riffs. One of the outstanding pieces of jazz on here is #5 Hanazono, followed by Mwela,Mwela (Here I Am) featuring one of the strongest vocalists around Valerie Etienne. I love the 'off key' vocal stylings of #12 Dance the Dance, and unlike another reviewer, I really got into 'Takes You Back'. I believe it was made not to be 'perfect', just a little off kilter. Well, that's it for me. I love this cd and I have made it a gift to several friends. If you love Jazzanova, this is a buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"enter stage left","review":"I must first thank Amazon for its insightful recommendations. Sometimes it is a little creepy. That is how I got turned on to Jazzanova and the mind blowing tracks on this great cd. I have been following the \\"nu\\" path of jazz and have to admit this cd has opened my horizons to what jazz can really be. Each track has been thought through and nothing is left out. It is hard to put into words what you hear. So, with comparisons maybe I can clue you in. Are you into the likes of Nuspirit, early Groove Collective, or Cinematic Orchestra? If not, what about Micatone, Fauna, or Beanfield? Hum, well don't let these comparisons help make a decision for you. Just go ahead and buy it, give it several plays, and then make the decision for yourself. Money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get This CD or you'll be sorry!

I then took a chance after a friend of mine played it for me and bought this one, and I have nothing but good things to say. It may be the best cd I've perchased in a while, and that says alot when you been listening to lootpack, Talib Kweli, Mos Def, and others. Usually I'm not a big vocal person but all the vocal tracks on this cd are solid,and the spoken word\\\\rap by Ursula Rucker and Hawkeye Fanatic are inspirational(to me anyway).

The first two tracks, \\"Love and You and I\\" and \\"No Use\\" are superb, and \\"Mwela, Mwela (Here I Am\\" is a near-masterpiece. Jazzanova occasionally fails in its attempts to integrate hip-hop, but that is easily forgiven.

Knowing Klaus Kinsky and Gian Maria Volonté were starring in the movie made want to buy it. But alas, the Volonte' character of Indio we came to admire for his acting skills and on stage persona, was NOT the same here. Primarily due to the dubbing. In For a Few Dollars more and Fist Full of Dollars, we heard the dubbed voice reflected a resonance and depth that is not represented in this film - a different dubbing voice was given... it almost made me laugh.Buy this if you want, but I was sadly let down.Bottom line, not in the best Leone spirit and poor dubbing.save your money and put it towards \\"The Great Silence\\"... it's not Leone but has Morricone for the soundtrack, which is wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed stand","review":"The slots to insert the swords are only 2\\" wide.

Ellen Troy, works for the Board of Space Control and is sent to yet another planet/satellite to solve yet another crime that, while on the surface may seem unrelated, are actually connected by a secret group of people who are also connected to her biological enhancements. She's been to Venus and the Moon and now she visits Mars. I'm beginning to think Preuss is simply attempting a tour of the solar system.Preuss' writing still seems to hold up throughout the book and I was still eager to find out how this one wrapped up. However, the overall mystery of the series is being drawn out a little too much. I think this could have been wrapped up nicely in three rather than six books."},{"rating":"1","title":"**NOT** written by Clarke","review":"OK - I am going to vent again... Those books are (badly) written by Paul Preuss - they are not in any way one of Clarke's work. Preuss' idea has been to basically licence 5 **UNRELATED** short stories (one per book in the Venus Prime series) that were among the great short stories written by A.C. Clarke.Then, Preuss procedes in dissolving the short story in an otherwise tasteless story which main purpose seems to be to link Clarke's 5 pieces of work.Quite honestly, Preuss' series is not, by all means, the worse one I've read. However, his skill is certainly not even close to Clarke's. I can hardly believe that Clarke would authorize anything like that - both Clarke and Preuss are guilty of prostituting their talent and (for Clarke) fame.In business, that kind of heavy licensing is typical of badly managed luxury brands (e.g., Pierre Cardin.)

During his tenure, Lockhart was a dipomatic representative, but was arrested and detained by the Bolsheviks for a period of time. He was also associated with some of Britain's intelligence professionals, as well.What makes this interesting reading is Lockhart's experiences in Russia; the views of a westerner. Lockhart was an insider working with minimal direction from London, serving in an extremely dangerous place given what was going on in Moscow and Petrograd.

It has the played out hits \\"Fantasy\\" (which I still enjoy) and \\"One Sweet Day\\" (nice song but sick of hearing it), but I found more pleasure in the understated \\"Underneath the Stars\\" and the ballad remake \\"Open Arms\\". She doesn't overdo the vocal gymnastics here and this is before she drenched all of her songs with that falsetto (or whatever it's called) like what she did on \\"Through the Rain\\".

Other highlights on the album: \\"Underneath the Stars\\", \\"Long Ago\\", which she worked with Jermaine Dupri on, and \\"Melt Away\\", which she worked with Babyface on.

Consequently, at least in my opinion, the tremendous quality and power of her voice is overshadowed by all her \\"stylin'.\\" Whitney's style was much more contained and did not detract either from the music or her voice, but for some reason, everyone since has been trying to outdo her and, in their attempts, failing miserably.

I think people who liked this album are the same kind of people who likes MADONNA, MICHAEL JACKSON, SHANA TWAIN, WHITNEY HOUSTON and other media phenomenons around the world. Carey is not a Paul mcCartney, who is a real solo-artist, composer, singer, instrumentist, with an indenpendent mind. Carey has only her stupendous voice, which she is wasting screaming like a banshee intead of singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dream within a dream. What's this a labrynth of dreams?","review":"This album Dream was made back before Mariah Carrey decided to divulge to the world that she's actually a natural blond. A year or so later when I first laid eyes on that lustrous, soft, blond hair I had to a pinch myself to see if I was dreaming. I think this album foreshadows the phenomenon that a lot of fans like myself were going to be experiencing in the future. I took off four stars because she has black hair on this album so she's not keeping it real and everyone knows what a bad mix phoniness and R&B is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Mariah","review":"Mariah keeps getting better and better.

Well first I'd like to tell you that I like all kinds of music from pop ( all kind ) to R&B to rock, to punk rock to rap to country. Ok, I think Mariah Carey is ok, not great like other people may rate her as. But this album [is bad].... My sister just gave it to me and after listening to it, I know why. Too many high pitched-cant understand a word she's saying dance songs and sappy.... whispering ballads. Yes, I like Fantasy and it's great to dance to... but.... if you really evaluate her voice, its not that loud, it's all squeaky, and it sounds like she's trying to hard.... not traits for singing divas. And the ballads.... [they're bad]. too many..... slow.... useless, boring songs..... and her dull voice makes it worse....and what is up with the Daydream Interlude? That song is [bad]... sorry its true, if you hear it, you will think that too. Horrible vocals... and the high pitch thing she does--annoying!!

Anyhow, I'd suggest do NOT buy this CD, and don't waste your money on it...

The opening track, \\"Fantasy\\", is a party itself, and by far the grooviest song in Mariah Carey's repertoire. Things start to get a little bit mellow with the adolescent feel of \\"Underneath the stars\\" but the album really strikes high in the amazing renditions of the truly inspirational \\"I'm free\\" and the 50's cadences of \\"Forever\\". R&B flavors are also present in this album (all of which were surely enhanced in her \\"Butterfly\\" album) in songs such as \\"Long ago\\", \\"Always be my baby\\" and the sexy and steamy \\"Melt away\\". And for those sick of romantic songs, take a listen to \\"Looking in\\", a fellow cousin of Stevie Wonder's \\"They won't go when I go\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"mariah's the best","review":"This is mariah's best album by far! if you don't own this already, then make it your next buy! everyone should have this CD in their collection! You can't deny this talented singer with such an amazing voice. Songs like \\"When I Saw You,\\" \\"Fantasy,\\" and \\"Forever\\" truly show she can't be denied. Anyone who says she's not good is only overwhelmed and blown away by the fact that she's beyond good. Her strong voice can sing so high and hold it for a long period of time. How many singers can do that? Very few. This is a must have for any music lover of R&B or fan of Mariah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing.","review":"Mariah Carey's forth studio album, \\"Daydream,\\" is simply stunning. As always, her voice shines on the fabulous ballads, such as a cover of Journey's \\"Open Arms,\\" \\"When I Saw You\\" and \\"Melt Away.\\" \\"Fantasy\\" and \\"Always Be My Baby,\\" the CD's upbeat tunes, are fantastic. The album's most interesting, yet beautiful song is \\"Looking In.\\" The lyrics (\\"She smiles through a thousand tears/And harbors adolescent fears/She dreams of all that she can never be/She wades in insecurity/And hides herself inside of me\\") are so meaningful and deep. \\"Forever,\\" as others on here have mentioned, has a 50s feel to it and \\"One Sweet Day,\\" the hit duet with Boyz II Men, is an amazing song about somebody who you thought would always be around and then they pass away, but you know you'll finally see them again, one sweet day.\\"Daydream\\" is most definitely one of Mariah's best albums.

She'd cry and refuse constantly until she was hungry and we introduced this bottle. The secret is in the slanted nipple with the stategically placed holes.

I switched to Dr. Brown's standard nipple which worked great, but I hated washing all those parts. I decided to try this one since the previous reviews rave about decrease in the dribbling of milk, however, this did not work for me.

Their 3 studio albums with Fairport brought more of an American country-rock feel to the band, between Trevor's Australian voice and Jerry's lead guitar. I'm more a fan of the British sound, but I have to say - Trevor has a fantastic Baritone voice, and Jerry plays some fine lead guitar. This album actually has more of a traditional folk feel than the other mid 70's Fairport - and Jerry's instrumental blowout on the guitar should please the fans of Richard Thompson's Irish reels from previous albums. For those who aren't familiar with the band's overall career - Fairport Convention's claim to fame was combining British traditional music with rock (best exemplified by albums like \\"Liege & Lief\\" and \\"The Bonny Bunch of Roses\\"), so this album isn't a fully representative starting point, but it's not a bad one for fans of folk or country rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"One great song and not much else","review":"This album contains a fantastic arrangement of the traditional song \\"Polly on the Shore\\", about a man pressed into service aboard a pirate ship.

The rest are uninspired and sound like outtakes from \\"Angel Delight\\". I would give this album one star, except that I've heard \\"Gottle o' Geer\\". \\"Nine\\" isn't aggressively bad like \\"Gottle\\", it's just bland.(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It dosn't work.","review":"I got this toy for my 14 month old goldendoodle thinking she would love it and play with it all the time.

Before I could take the ball away, he had cracked it in several places. This toy is not at ALL durable if your dog likes to chew. I'm really disappointed. Will stick with theEverlasting Fun Ball LargeandStarMark Bob-A-Lot Interactive Pet Toy, as they seem to be much more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"was disappointed","review":"due to the nature of the opening where you drop in the snacks, there is a well created within the ball (i had to feel around the inside of the ball because my dog was getting frustrated from not being able to get the treats out and he is a smart dog). the treats sit in the well and wouldn't fall out of the ball when you move it around as the toy description says. i shook it all over the place and still couldn't get all of the treats out. won't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Neither dog even gave it the time of day, even when filled with treats.

It does keep your dog very busy, but then it gets ripped apart tooquickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best treat ball","review":"This is the best treat ball ever! It takes a long time to empty, but dispenses treats frequently enough to keep my dogs interested. However, it won't hold up to aggressive chewing if you leave it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"destroyed immediately","review":"This ball is terrible. My dog had it ripped into pieces in minutes. The starmark treat dispensing ball is MUCH better -- she's never destroyed those (although after a few months, they invariably get lost). We bought this ball after the last starmark was lost -- big mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea - Not Very Durable","review":"This is a great concept. The ball looks fun, the dents in it make it easy for a dog to pick up and toss around. However, it is not made to withstand even moderate chewing. The second my dog got a hold of it she decided that rolling it around to get the treats out was for chumps. Within 2 minutes she had chewed through the sides and got them out her way. So the ball goes into the trash along with all the little pieces that she chewed off of it. She normally isn't a terrible chewer, but this ball really didn't stand up too well against her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omega Paw Treat Ball","review":"These are absolutely wonderful. I can not say enough about them. I own a dog boarding facility and these keep the dogs busy for quite some time. Some of the over active dogs, or EXTREMELY fast eaters, I put their food in the treat balls and it takes them a while to get the food out and they are busy. I have only had one be destroyed in the year that I have used these treat balls, which says a lot, considering I can have up to 14 or more dogs a day. Not everyone gets one, just the bored dogs that need something constructive to do. They are soft, so they dont clang around so loudly like the other treat cubes I have seen. A perfect, wonderful item I hope Amazon will always carry. They have them at the best price, and they are not easy to find. Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for heavy chewers","review":"Our medium-sized (45 pound) terrier tore this into bits in about 15-20 minutes.

I have an Australian Shepherd Mix. I gave the ball to her for Christmas and by 10 am it was already chewed through to make her own treat hole.

If you fill it with treats a little larger than their food size, then they don't come out at all. How do you clean the thing? It has an internal rim that prevents you from being able to clean it or get the remaining food out.I am so disappointed. My dog hates it worse than I do. She loves toys and challenges, but this does not constitute either.Don't waste your money on the ball or the shipping!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Toy For My Terrier","review":"This is by far my dog's favorite toy; he's 20#. He pushes it, throws it up in the air and bounces it against the walls. He's a hard chewer but has not destroyed this toy in almost 10 years, even though the rest of his toys are rags or pieces. The craters provide the dog with the means to grasp it. Sometimes I put his breakfast kibble or treats in it. A high prey drive dog can't resist this ball that dispenses at a random time and amount. The only negative is that the 5 inch ball is just small enough for a dog to push under buffets, so you'll have to block them. And, it's so much fun to watch the dog go ga-ga over this ball."},{"rating":"2","title":"your dog will love it!","review":"I have a Maltese, she is a little pick for food, sometimes she doesn't eat nothing in the morning but i always leave the ball full with dry food wen i go to work and i don't have to worry about her, she will play latter on and eat all the food, and i have so much fun watching her playing with the ball, rolling, trowing at the air and so happy that the food came out. worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smells wonderful!","review":"The concept and idea is fantastic but it really doesnt last long for chewers.

When I know I have things I have to get done without four-leeged help, I pour my dog's food into the hole, then put the ball down.

We feed her supper in this every night and it never gets old. It takes her about 1/2 hour now to eat and she has a blast and gets exersize while doing it. It is hilarious watching her as she gets to the last few morsals of food left trying to get them out. It is fairly durable. It may not be for young puppies that are very heavy chewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic treat ball","review":"This little ball is great. I put my dogs kibble in and he is entertained for at least 20-30 minutes. My favorite thing about it is how quiet it it. I've given my dog a buster cube in the past and it is so noisy when my dog throws it around trying to get the treats out. Now I stick to this and the tug-a-jug and save my hearing.

I don't use a bowl to feed him, instead I divide his meals between a few treat toys so he can \\"hunt\\", use up some of his excess energy, & help to slow him down while eating so he doesn't eat too fast. He LOVES his treat toys!I thought this would be a great treat toy BUT once the kibble was in it was near impossible to get out, especially if it was only partially filled. I even had trouble getting it out & my dog found it near impossible although he tried & tried. This is because there is a rim around the inside of the treat hole that traps kibble rather than letting it bounce around & fall out as my dog rolled it around. He could have, & did, roll it around for an hour trying to get food out w/o much success.Save your money on this & purchase something better for your pup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chocolate Lab Destroyed in under 5 minutes","review":"I really had high hopes for this one.My dog had a hole chewed in this in literally 5 minutes...disappointing..If your dog doesn't destroy things quickly, it'll probably be a great toyfor them..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for chewers","review":"In less than a day our Labradoodle and Pit mix were able to chew through the ball to get the treats.

The dog however is a strong chewer and it only took 15 minutes before he decided to chew a hole to get the treats out instead of rolling it around on the floor. It was a pricy toy for one day use so I would suggest they put a rating on it for chewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"As long as there are treats inside","review":"My older puppy figured this one out right away. Roll the ball, get a treat so he was rolling it all over the place. The younger one kept picking it up and shaking it and then she tried to stick her tongue inside to get the treats. We got a good laugh out of it. But from watching the other one she finally got it. But once the treats are gone they don't want it anymore. It is a good toy though. Can't chew it up. Worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea for keeping your dog busy","review":"I wanted to get my basset hound a \\"buster cube\\", but i kept hearing about how loud they are since they're made of hard plastic. This toy is essentially the same thing, but it's made of a soft material so it's very quiet. My dog really only plays with this if it has LOTS of treats or kibble in it, but that's probably because he's a glutton.When there are only a few treats or kibble inside it is difficult for a dog to get them out, which is the point I actually feed my dog his meals in this thing and it takes him about 20 min to eat it. Very cool concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog Treat Ball","review":"These were very expensive (we got 2 of them).

So all the dog has to do is roll this across the floor, and he's left with a trail of kibble... that he may or may not eat. The food comes out way too easily. I Thought there would be a challenge, but about 75% of the time, the food will fall out of this ball with one push. THe ball is stinky, smells strongly of plastic and chemicals... its loud, and a waste of money. I will try again, with some different treats, but I am disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"No match for our Pitbull","review":"The toy was great at first for our pitbull. She couldn't figure it out for a while. Once I showed it to her, it seemed to be almost too easy. She had it down and emptied it of treats in a minute or two. Once empty, she was convinced there had to be more treats inside and proceeded to rip it open at the hole by giving it a few good chews and tugs. We were really happy with it at first since she seemed to like the toy and it kept her busy but it isn't durable enough for heavy chewers. I also think it dispenses treat a tad too easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Durable","review":"I have one busy dog who absolutely loves this toy! He rolls it around and around, or drops it from a height to (hopefully) get a treat to fall out. My other dog never gets a chance to play with it, as the high energy dog stays occupied rolling it all over, scurrying after it, carrying it in his mouth (for refills, please) or cuddling with it on the couch. It provides a great deal of fun play time and gives mom a break! They destroy most everything but this remains unblemished after several months of fun.

He didn't play with it for a week but once he figured out he gets treats, he figured it out and loves it!

Dogs having 40x the smell sense of humans, I cannot imagine the assault on their noses. It may likely even cause the treats placed inside to have an altered taste as well.The design of the ball is one solid peice of soft plastic. You cannot take it apart for cleaning; if simply rinsing out with water and soap, good luck getting all of the water out. You have to wait for it to dry completely before using. And since it can't be cleaned, you're stuck using hard, crunchy treats as anything else is certain to spoil or contaminate the inside.Good in theory, but design poorly executed and seemingly low quality materials used to produce(made in China!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for strong chewers","review":"My 20 lb miniature pincher ate through this toy in 10 minutes.

I placed dry food inside, which came out relatively easily as it rolled - however my 3 labs are very adept at these kinds of toys. After it was empty, they each easily tore through the plastic to look inside. Not fun... On a plus side, the orange plastic is easy to spot to clean up. Unfortunately, this ball proved too big for my mother's small dog - which leaves me to wonder - what's the perfect dog for this thing? However, we really like the soft feature, which is nice for inside non-carpeted play. A medium sized dog that is not an aggressive chewer would be the perfect candidate for this toy.

This item looks almost identical to the one we had for 5 years, but this one is made of soft, easily-removed-by-dog plastic and only lasted about 3 weeks before we had to take it away from him because we were concerned that he would swallow the plastic that was easily coming off as he chewed it. We ordered another one and after only a few weeks, we will be tossing this one as well. Our dog is less than 20 pounds and is 13 years old and had no problem chewing this ball apart very quickly.

He did love it while it lasted though, so if your dog doesn't chew, it *might* work. I ordered this ball because a friend of ours has one just like it that my dog loves, but that one was a harder plastic (same shape and color though, so I assumed it was the same). Guess we'll try another tricky toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't clean it out","review":"How do you clean this if the dog takes it outside, gets water in it and the treats gets moldy? Impossible!We love the ball, but we are on our fourth one because we can't clean the inside out.If you purchase this, DO NOT let your dog take it outside!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Outgasses a horrible plastic smell","review":"This works fine for dispensing treats, but it has a very bad, sort of sweet plastic smell that you can smell several feet away.

I've had it for about three weeks now and the smell is diminished but still not completely gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omega Paw","review":"Wonderful toy. My dog weighs 28# so I purchased the small toy. I wish I had ordered the large ball because the small will roll underneath furniture. Overall, it is a great toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but Not for Heavy Chewers!","review":"My dog really loved this toy but I found that I couldn't trust him to be alone with it because he would begin to chew it. The rubber it is made out of is not hard enough and a heavy chewer can chew through in a few minutes. Watching him and telling him to roll it and not chew it helped, but I didn't ever leave him alone with it. After playing with it a few times he did manage to chew open the ball. Its a great entertaining toy if your dog is not a strong chewer, but if he is I would recommend finding something else, especially if the goal is to entertain your dog while you are away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT for heavy chewers...","review":"After reading the reviews, I decided to give this product a shot with my 1yr old Am Staff mix. Filled it with kibble, all was well for about 15 seconds. When he realized there was food inside and it wasn't coming out fast enough, he chewed a hole in this item in about 5 minutes flat. Several reviewers have said this was better than the Kong Stuff-A-Ball, but to be honest, he did the exact same thing to that item too. Chewed off the flaps that are supposed to hold the treats inside. I would highly recommend against purchasing this item for any of the \\"bully breed\\" dogs, as if they're anything like mine, it won't even last a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth It!","review":"Our yellow lab pup was inhaling her 1/4 cup of food three times a day - literally. Sometimes it would all come back up, whole! So, we needed to devise a way to slow her down. The square-shaped food dispenser toy would have been deafening on our hardwood floors so we opted for this \\"Mars\\" ball, as we call it. It's great! The pup learned to use the ball within seconds and it's much nicer on our floors. I would like to caution, however, as with the advice of other reviewers, that because the Mars ball is a softer material our pup WILL bite and chew it. Therefore she must ALWAYS be supervised (I don't mean you have to stare her down, but just keep an ear out). When she isn't getting food, it's up and away from her tough little jaws. All in all, worth every penny and we haven't had a regurgitation episode since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!","review":"Our dogs love this toy. We just drop some small training treats, or even just a little of their dog food into it and they gently push it around the room looking for the trail of treats. The \\"game\\" really keeps their attention and you can just see their brains going. Extremely durable plastic as well. Similar concept to a kong, but we've had much better experiences with this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for a big dog","review":"This toy only last about three hours with my boxer mix. She quickly figured that it would be easier to rip the thing open than to roll it around to get at the treats. As stated, she only had it for about three hours before it was destroyed. It might work well for a smaller dog, but I wouldn't advise getting it for a big dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!","review":"We all love this toy! Tilly can squish it so it fits in her mouth, she can roll it around to get food, and she just loves it!

Emma is admittedly qualified to be the ultimate tester for the durability of dog toys. She was able to rip the top off a Kong within minutes The one toy that Emma has loved more than any other, and it doesn't have even the tiniest bit of damage after 6 months of her ardent attention: the Everlasting Beanie Ball or BentoBall: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X2RUX0/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01 She loves it with or without the treats and plays fetch with and gnaws on it when there's no treat in it. I'm going to order another one of those--after I get the red, plastic Omega carnage cleaned up."},{"rating":"1","title":"My dog shredded it in 10 minutes!","review":"The concept of this ball is great. My dog loved it and quickly figured out she could roll it around to get treats. However as soon as she started to chew on it (even though we got the larger size so she couldn't chomp down too hard) she managed to destroy it within 10 minutes. I had to throw it out so she didn't choke on the plastic pieces she was ripping off. I was really hoping this would be more like the green \\"everlasting\\" treat ball that we have had for years and is still in one piece. My dog has gotten so good at that one that I was looking for a new challenge, but that didn't work out."},{"rating":"1","title":"lasted 5 minutes","review":"My dog is 30 pounds, she tore this up like it was paper.

This bra is supportive. Although, it does give you somewhat of a grandma-type shape. This is not really too much of an issue for me as I mainly just wear this bra at home (I work from home). It is comfortable enough to wear all day without too much of an issue. I do find that the band rolls and then becomes a bit itchy. This is a minor annoyance and one expected from a soft cup bra. It gives surprising lift given the fact that it is wire-free. It was stiff and itchy initially, but after \\"breaking in\\" and giving it a few washes the fabric softened and was more comfortable. I'm not going to say it is my favorite, but it is definitely a nicely constructed and supportive bra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sports Bra","review":"This bra was too small, but that may be my fault as I didn't realize I had to order a size larger for a sports bra.

This second set of bras seem generally well made and fit pretty well, but unlike my first set of bras, the seam over the breast is puckery and shows through some clothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The seams on the cups are UGLY","review":"This would be a great bra, but the seam that runs through the cup is UGLY under a t-shirt. I supposed I could put on a camisole to disguise the seams, but in South Miss, it's too hot to wear all that extra material in the summer. Hate it, but am going to have to return this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why lift and separate?","review":"While I love this bra as far as comfort and support, I'm giving it only two stars for the \\"separate\\" feature. Why do most bra manufactures think we plus-size women want to be lifted and separated? I finally found a bra (from Amazon) that I hope will work. I wear a 42H bra, and most bras that lift and separate make my breasts look like they're growing out of my arm pits. The new bra not only lifts but provides support at the sides, so I'm upfront and center and my breasts are where they're supposed to be, i.e. growing from my chest, not my armpits! If this new bra, which should arrive on Friday, fits as I hope, that will be the only bra I'll ever buy again. In addition the price on the new one is reasonable. If others of you have the \\"growing out of your armpit\\" problem, just search for a side support bra.This is the bra I ordered and hope works:Goddess Women's Keira Soft Cup"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable","review":"I bought this bra after reading the many positive reviews.

He paints vivid and evocative word pictures as he leads the reader through the battlefields of France, Russia and Vietnam examining the dangerous and tragic remnants of war. Things slow down when he turns his attention to the legacies of America's nuclear and chemical weapons programs.I blew through this book in a couple of sittings - partially because it's an easy read and also because it's fascinating stuff for a military buff. Fortunately, he keeps the \\"man's inhumanity to man\\" hand-wringing to a minimum and gives us mostly straight reportage.I read this on the recommendation of history podcaster Dan Carlin and, like Carlin's other recommendations, it didn't disappoint.I guarantee you'll find interesting stuff you didn't know if you read this book.The information is more than a decade old, but it's still worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like McPhee on Mines","review":"If you've followed Webster's career at all (Outside, The NewYorker, National Geographic), you already know his abilityto unearth all the right local characters, draw them out anddistill their musings into a coherent sense of place. Inthis, he applies the same brand of cozy reportage to a timely(needless to say, overlooked) issue of global (though notnecessarily domestic) significance. This is also good, funstuff to read. And despite Browne's concern about the author'sfacts in his NYT review (from a reviewer who badly misspellsthe author's name in the very same review, no less!), thebook is deeply researched and lucidly told. If you at allstudy the tragedy of war and the follies of humankind (andwho can avoid that, anymore), this is a good stand-alone primer."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful and facinating","review":"Webster explores an interesting topic -- he revisits sites central to twentieth century warfare, and writes about the continuing physical effects of warfare on those battlefields. This book is part history and part travelogue. His opening chapter on the World War I battlefields of France and the men who work there to this day removing unexploded artillery shells is particularly beautiful and haunting. The subject matter is intriguing, and Webster's writing and approach are elegantly simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Collection","review":"This is a splendid anthology of music.

But upon further reading, I was very impressed by the thought provoking manner in which she encourages each individual considering or going through the adoption process to seek the Lord's guidance for each step taken. She does not \\"sugar coat\\" adoption like it's the TV sitcom \\"THE BRADY BUNCH,\\" but weaves in accounts of actual families as they made their way through adoption. Though not a technical reference book like THE ADOPTION RESOURCE BOOK by Lois Gilman (by the way, is an invaluable adoption tool), Kay Strom makes you stop and evaluate your motivations before you jump into adoption.

Past Imperfect discusses the failings of Ambrose, Bellisles, Ellis, and Goodwin, and the relatively nonchalant reaction of the public.

I do think that, for children just learning language, the alliteration may be a bit of a negative - while they are working hard to understand and say individual words for different objects, the rhymes in this book make everything sound the same. I know this will be a hit for the kids when they are a bit older and have a more solid command of the vocabulary, but I find it not to be the MOST appropriate for my very young toddlers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fox? socks? Knox? It rocks!!!","review":"A great book. It was my child hood favorite and I'll never forget the first time I I was able to read the book all the way through. To bad I lost it, I'd pay good money to have my book back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong book","review":"Dr. Seuss is great - our kids and grandkids alike have loved his books. Fox in Socks may not be as popular as the Cat in the Hat, but they are in the same genre and excellent for beginning readers.We ordered the book using a link supplied by our daughter to the Amazon website, and that link showed the book in English. However, when the book was received, it was a dual language book (English plus Chinese or some other Asian language that we neither read nor speak). i hope Amazon doesn't make mistakes like this very often!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the book, very upset with what I received","review":"We have this at home for our son, so I bought it for a friend as a baby gift. When I received the book, I was very upset to find out that the entire book was written in both English and either Japanese/Chinese/Korean characters. It was too late for me to attempt to return the book and get a new copy, but very upset to have to try to explain this to the friend for whom I bought this. The picture shows the characters, but the description did not describe that."},{"rating":"2","title":"fox in socks","review":"I tought hat Fox In Sox was an good book.I didn't give the book five stars because it would be hard for a little kid to say all the tongue twisters. All though the tongue twisters of kind of messed up they are fun to read. Also I thought that the pictures were funny. Also I thought that the made up words were fun to read also. I think the advice on the cover is nice because it is hard to read the book fast the first time because of the choice of words. All in all this was a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not full book","review":"I bought this book to read to my little sister...I did not see that this book was a cardboard highly ABRIDGED version.

It is not worth anything and since I'd not bought them before I didn\\"t know what to buy. Not very pleased with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for elementary students","review":"I bought this for my 2nd grader who is a proficient reader, because the rhymes and tangled sentences are great for reading accuracy, and because I always thought it was fun when I was a kid. Used is a great option for young kids.

Like Seuss' other title, \\"Hop On Pop\\", the controlled vocabulary and clues provided by the illustrations, allow children who are beginning readers to proudly read the book by themselves. Again and again and again, much to their delight! Recommended for children ages 4-8."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"The book had a lot of writing and coloring in it. It also took along time to get here. I ordered other books from other sellers and they arrived a whole week before this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"it grew on me","review":"When we first bought this book for my then two-year old daughter, I could barely get through it the first time. I didn't much like it. That's probably because I was so busy trying to say the words it, I couldn't pay attention to what was actually happening. Since then, the book has grown on me, and my now three-year old daughter loves it, as well. After reading the book aloud a gazillion times, I can now say it almost without getting my tongue twisted, and my favorite part is the ending, where Knox finally gets his \\"revenge\\" for what Fox has put him through.One minor complaint: Seuss uses the word \\"dumb,\\" a word I would prefer to keep out of my daughter's vocabulary, and it could easily have been replaced with \\"glum,\\" a change I try to institute when I read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Used book which I knew, however, all pages were nit attached to the spine of the book. I received a cover with loose pages.Horrible, never again!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of Seuss","review":"My wife bought this for our daughter for christmas several years back and frankly it is a terrible book. This coming from a huge fan of Dr. Seuss. It basically has no story or interesting plot at all. The purpose of the book is just to have a bunch of tongue twisters just to have them there. I really was surprised how bad this book was since I love so many other Dr. Seuss books (our child has at least 15 other seuss books we love). Honestly, my child picks this book periodically for bed time stories, and my wife and i will cringe when reading this. Also, our child doesn't really seem to care for it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so bad once you get used to it!","review":"When I first bought this book, I thought it was just another Seuss book, but it is not! At first I hated it and would try to persuade my son into making Daddy read it instead of Mommy, but many nights we would both end up reading it. After having done it so much, it's a breeze now, but it does take some getting used to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tongue Twister","review":"This tongue twister of words is great fun. This was my favorite Dr. Seuss book as a child. My sister and I read it over and over to see if we could read it all the way through with out messing up. What a great way to encourage your child to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Fun Easy Reader","review":"This is a clever book full of tongue twisters, which can be enjoyed as an easy reader or as a read-aloud. The fox plies his friend Mr. Knox with tongue twisters (each accompanied by a funny illustrated scene) and Knox refuses to try them, but in the end Mr. Knox bests the fox at his own game. Children will enjoy playing with these silly words and silly scenes, all of which are defined by the easy reader's limited vocabulary. It's lots of fun, and this kind of wordplay may help open the mind to an appreciation of true poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect but Small","review":"Received this great book, that is a classic. I obviously did not read the description very well, as I thought this was a standard size book. Instead it is a smaller, cardboard book. It was a baby gift but instead my 18 month old is getting it for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Seuss","review":"A wonderful, silly Seuss, filled with tongue twisters. Great illustrations. And for adults---I teach ESL, and have a relatively advanced class, but the students' pronunciation isn't great. I tried this out to drill vowel sounds and it was a winner! The students are enchanted with the silliness of it, it makes a boring activity--drilling--fun, and several bought the book for their kids. A great find! Published 40 years ago, Seuss never gets old."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great selection of Latin American writings","review":"Since I believed it unfair for sole reviewer to rate this book one star when the problem they had was with the seller, I felt compelled to share my thoughts about the book. \\"Tradición y cambio\\" has a very diverse selection of readings, from non-fiction to poetry to fiction, that I found very informative and enlightening, not to mention inspirational at times. With readings from a wide range of people, times, countries, and circumstances, the book is an excellent overview of Latin American writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of writing","review":"There were many writings on different pages with a pen. Underlining words so dark you can barely understandwhat the word is. Alot of the answers are already done(questionaires). I'm unable to erase the markings.

He is back at school now, but he seemed to like the book OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book on the subject.","review":"I'm not going to waste too many words on this textbook. First, this textbook utilizes lower secondary Spanish which would not even pass in a real Latin American university. Second, this textbooks uses examples which are taken out of their historical context in order to fit into the social commentary which the authors are attempting to make. Each chapter is a generalized portrait of Latin America which attempts to paint it with the same brush and hue, when in fact its history and its peoples are as diverse as its geography and Eco-systems. This isn't the first course I have taken on Latin American society, but this is by far the worst textbook that has been written on it. Of course, for most students, purchasing this textbook isn't quite an option, but be forewarned that it should be read with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one!","review":"This probably was a promising video record of an event that has been marred by bad audio.

Story wise there's nothing new or interesting to get (as if you'd expect that), and the same goes for the acting and the action really. The fights are choreographed in the same way that all other kung fu movies of the time were: not very good. And that's basically it. Fighting's not good, so the movie fails to deliver, in a sense. Only interesting bit is, that Jackie is spelled Jacky in the credits.Get it if you collect or are a hardcore JC fan. Otherwise leave it be."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you saw Fearless Hyena there is no need to watch this.","review":"This movie is a rip off. Chan did not finish making this film. He only shot a few scenes and then he left production! However the director took scenes from the first \\"Hyena\\" and hired a double to make this film.

Its main nozzle is practically useless, and cannot even reach the range of 35 feet even if I pump 50 times. The Flood nozzle, however, more than makes up for that. This riot blast makes this gun unmatched in close quarter combat. However,this watergun cannot compete with anything more potent than a CPS 1000, although it supersedes all present day blasters, save the Water Warriors Orca, and Tiger Shark. It is best used in close quarter combat, although pumping can get difficult. To give you a good idea of how this supersoaker performs, here is something simply put: A person with a Sneak Attack can keep out of range and drench you while you're still pumping. However, all in all, its not a bad watergun, although by no means is it a phenomenal one.

This band's power lies in its newness and experimentation of sound, which, after their dull Rose Clouds... album, I was glad to see them back to a destructuring of music.Not to say that there aren't single masterpieces on this disc, but the album taken as a whole is much more satisfying than picking out the best songs, then comparing them to others on the same album.All in all, Take Care... let's me believe that there is light at the end of the tunnel at what could have been a less than climatic end to one of the most unique bands in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their weakest effort","review":"I'm pretty sure my problem with this release is solidly in the realm of Albin Julius. I've never been a fan of The Moon Lay Hidden Beneath a Cloud, and since all things DiJ up to this point have been wondrous, it's gotta be Albin, right?Not to say there's nothing good about this. Cirro Massimo has a nice, hypnotic feel to it, composed of nothing but what sounds like a loop of the soundtrack to Triumph des Willens, and most of the instrumental work on here has that patented Death in June \\"yes, I really AM more mournful than you\\" feel to it, but it just doesn't click the same way that earlier releases do."},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised","review":"This is a really nice product, but I don't find it to be super outstanding considering the price I paid for it.

We have read it but isn't the same without the cd. The first time we did the story with the cd my son was sitting across the room and didn't want to do it but his younger brother did. Funny though my oldest would peek at the book and finally was on my lap helping turning the pages when needed. Also this is a good book for children who aren't used to listening to a story being read from a cd or tape, just another interesting way to enjoy a book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We teach our kids NOT to go inside a stranger's house ....","review":"I was unsettled reading this book -- regarding the reference in which the young boy enters a (very) stange man's house, and is pulled down the basement stairs into his \\"evil lair\\", if you will.Loved the quality of the illustrations -- but, being a mother of young children, and visually seeing a boy being pulled down into a basement by this strange man, was much too unsettling for me! We all teach our children to avoid stangers at all cost .. this book just encourages it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope, it's bad news.","review":"I hate saying this over and over again, but Queen are bad.

Miss You Freddy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Have you heard the News?","review":"This is a solid effort from Queen. Great opening, with the one two punch of \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We Are the Champions\\". Some people don't like \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" because of the weird effects in it, but I like it. \\"All Dead, All Dead\\" is a beautiful ballad. \\"Spread Your Wings\\" is a terrific song that deserved to be a bigger hit than it was. The Roger Taylor sung \\"Fight From the Inside\\" is simply not very good. \\"Get Down, Make Love\\" is a great hard rock song. \\"Sleeping on the Sidewalk\\" is a good song that is probably the closest Queen ever came to recording a blues song. \\"Who Needs You\\" is just okay. The epic \\"It's Late\\" is really good. The album closes with \\"My Melancholy Blues\\", a pretty ballad that spotlights Freddie's piano playing. As for the remix of \\"We Will Rock You\\", it is interesting, but it doesn't really belong here."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the \\"Big Three.\\"","review":"Queen's mega-albums were, in order of release, A Night At The Opera, A Day At The Races, and News Of The World. Personally, I've always ranked this a shade behind Opera and a shade ahead of Races. It has the gigantic \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We Are The Champions,\\" but there are a lot of great songs here you don't hear too often. My favorites are \\"Sheer Heart Attack,\\" \\"It's Late,\\" and \\"Sleeping On The Sidewalk.\\" All in all, a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Rocks Me","review":"This album was suffering the fate of many of the things I have on vinyl, which means it's been sitting unplayed on the shelf. I don't listen to the radio any longer (does anyone?) so I've not had the occasion to listen to much queen.Amazon had this release on special, so I purchased and downloaded it. It was refreshing to listen to again, almost as if for the first time, though it did bring back a lot of good memories.This is a very strong album with a sold mix of music showcasing just how talented and versatile the band was.I guess I'm going to have to download the rest of the queen catalog now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen Rocks","review":"This was my first Queen album. As soon as the radio started playing We Will Rock You, I needed this album. I am still (30 yrs later) amazed at the sound on this recording. Brian, Freddie and the guys really showed the world that rock was NOT DEAD! If you look at the time (1977) we needed to be rocked, and that's what we got."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful...","review":"This CD shows plainly and clearly Queen's different style for music. It goes from slow blues (yes, really!) to heavy metal, and theatrical to plain rock. I really enjoyed this CD and can't get enough of it! Even their more unknown music, like Who Needs You, is brilliant. One can compare the greatest hits of Britney Spears the worst of Queen, except Queen's are even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't receive the item so i can't say anything about it","review":"I didn't receive my stuff so I can't write any good review. please someone help me because I don't get to contact the dealer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, it's truly weak, NOT a good Queen album","review":"Queen has put out some true classics. THIS one, however, ain't one of those. Repeated listenings will certainly prove that, as I really wanted to like this album.It's a fair well-thought out opinion--seems you can tell which reviews here are honest and unbiased...and question the merits of those that TYPE LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME. ugh.

Play it all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not Queen's best","review":"OK.There is some good stuff on this album : We Will Rock you and We Are The Champions are all-time rock classics.I think Spread Your Wings is a fantastic inspirational song - unforgettable. There is the punk rock Get Down Make Love, the haunting All Dead, All Dead , the angst-filled It's Late and the bluesy Melancholy Blues , which are also good.But the album is not as good as Queen's first five masterpieces (which are among my favourite albums of all time: Queen , Queen II, Sheer Hear Attack,A Night At The Opera and A Day At The Races .Its still worth having in your collection and it's still a hallmark of the roaring 70's , which is always a pleasure to listen to (Its also far better than 80's Queen) but it also marks a departure from Queen's classic rock-opera roots for which I most love the band. Of course musical fashions where changing by 1977 but for me Queen 1973-1976 are where it is at for the best rock music you can ever get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We Will Rock You isn't the only song on this CD","review":"This is one of the first albums that I had when it came out in the 70s. Everybody knows the classic \\"We Will Rock You/ We Are the Champions\\" The rest of the songs on this CD are equal if not superior to these(with the exception of the horrible remix of We Will Rock You) Check out Roger Taylor's \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" and Freddie's \\"Get Down Make Love\\" not to mention Brian May's brilliance on \\"Sleeping on the Sidewalk\\"- classic Queen-every song on News of the World is great. \\"It's Late\\" is probably the best \\"unheard of\\" song that Queen ever recorded. Not too many groups can come close to the extreme talent that Queen was- News of the World proves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware vinyl lovers...","review":"Great music ruined by awful sound...another sad victim of the \\"loudness wars\\".

In Lord of the Silent, however, I wasn't sure if the action ever really started, despite a series of false apprehensions.

A bit too cute, too precious, and too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"lord of the silent","review":"I have no complaint about the book itself, but the binding just fell apart. Please be prepared for other complaints of this type. Thank you, Wilma Davenport"},{"rating":"1","title":"Retread, retread, retread","review":"At one time, I was a devoted fan of this series, but no longer. It has become so entirely predictable, you are not sure which book you are reading--there is no great difference from the last one. Amelia and Emerson are in danger of becoming cliches; Nefret and Rasmes, who were fascinating children, have become dullsville adults; I wish to God somebody would bury Sethos. The only bright spot is Sennia. If you want more of the same, then this is your meat; but consider. Amelia and Emerson go to Egypt; they dig for antiquities; there is a younger couple to provide the romantic subplot; they are in danger from thiefs/murderers/terrorists; someone is kidnapped; someone escapes; all ends happily. The end. The humour helps, but not enough. I'm getting so that when someone attacks Amelia, I hope they'll do a lot of damage. A bad sign."},{"rating":"1","title":"No suspense","review":"I should have known this book would be bad when the Amazon.com reviewer remarked that \\"Innovation can be overrated.\\" The author has completely run out of ideas. There is not much plot to speak of. Much of the book consists of characters ruminating about things that happened in prior books. More than half the book concerns Ramses and Nefret - absolutely perfect, gorgeous, intelligent, plucky, devoted, and totally boring. They belong in a romance novel. The only suspense here was wondering if I would bother finishing the book. The only mystery was why I bought it. The first couple of books in this series were good - stick to them and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and long-winded","review":"This was the first of Ms. Peters' books that I read. Maybe if I had had the background of the other books, I would have found it more interesting. As it was, I kept thinking \\"Get on with it already\\". There were too many exceprts about Nefret and her hubby and then it would switch back to Peabody and Emerson, and it rarely went back to the murder. When it did, there were so many characters and so many nicknames for characters that I was totally confused and often had to go back in the book to see who was who. The setting in this book and Peabody's wit kept me reading, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was \\"Bored of the Silent\\"","review":"I feel I must protect other unwitting prospective readers from this directionless, suspenseless, bore. Being a fan of all things Egypt and an Agatha Christie fan as well I thought this book would be sure to please---not so! Short of Grisham I've never read about heroic characters so impossibly beautiful, charming, intelligent, desirable, and perfect in any way and SO boring. Was this a mystery? I don't remember much of a plot at all. Just characters going from one place to another and getting engaged in conflictless conflicts. Finally, why set it in Egypt if you intend to use next to nothing of the country, its people (other than a few trite stereotypes), and its antiquities?Reading it on a long plane flight, I actually pondered whether finishing the book or crashing would be preferable. For my guilty pleasure I'll go back to Stephen King---Tolstoy by comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"amateurish blather","review":"Elizabeth Peters (aka Barbara Michaels) used to know how to write a great, scary mystery. Now she needs to hang it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Dry","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed while reading Lord of Silent, as the overall action and suspense was kept almost at a minimum.It seems almost as if Peters went on a long tangent about the Emerson's family life, writing a lot of filler to go along with the main plot. Until the last forty pages or so, I struggled to get through the book because there was no suspense at all. No cliff-hangers or anything of the sort.Ramses and Nefret, though darling, only thickened the struggle. I don't think that all the interaction between them was really necessary; perhaps Peters wanted to throw in some romance, but is wasn't working.Lord of the Silent is a sheer failure of Peters's story-telling skills, as in many of her other books her talent proves to be quite brilliant. Save your money and buy a different Peters's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least 25% text has characters declaring their greatness","review":"Being on the lookout for new authors this series seemed very promising. The reviews were great mentioning mystery, Egyptologists, and a turn-of-the-century setting. Being enthusiastic I ordered \\"The Falcon at the Portal\\" and \\"Lord of the Silent\\". In both books, Amelia tells us over and over she is bright, clever, beautiful, etc. She tells us how her husband is the greatest Egyptologist of all time, he's brillant, he's strong and women cannot resist him. Rames is brillant, brave, master of disguise, and women cannot resist him. Nefret is brillant and beautiful. Now there is 6 year old Sennia who is well on her way to learning hieroglyphic's and become an Egyptologist. I do not mind having characters that are bigger than life what I object to is having the characters continuing patting themselves on the back telling you about it constantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this one at all costs","review":"Usually I am a fan of A. Peabody and the whole Emerson clan, but this book made me want to eat lead. It is not that I dislike it when the characters are happy, but such self-congratulatory behavior quickly wears thin. I found myself waiting (and wishing) some tragedy befall them.Missing from this publication was any confidence that the characters we had grown to love held the slightest bit of intelligence or reason. They all seemed too busy \\"in love\\" or \\"blissfully happy\\" which affected their ability to operate rationally.If this is what happens when they are happy, for the love of god, bring back the pain and suffering of unrequited love, betrayal, and subterfuge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfunctory and boring","review":"There's no wit or charm here - just a plodding tale, the resolution of which comes out of nowhere, without suspense. Nothing for a reader new to this series, and precious little for the fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another strong entry in this wonderful series.","review":"This book is another page-turner. I so enjoy the Emersons when they are right in the thick of things. This book is a little different though because there appears to be two parallel stories at first, and the older Emersons are in Cairo following one thread, and the two younger Emersons are in Luxor following another thread. But of course they end up investigating together, and that iw when the fun begins. It's nice to see Ramses and Nefret in their newly-wed bliss. Let me tell you, Indiana Jones has nothing on our Ramses. But Emerson and his Amelia are no slouches either. We also see a new and more emotional Amelia and that is a good thing. She does her utmost to keep her son away from harm in this book and neither of them have gotten over his harrowing escape from death in the last book. But there's still lots of danger, tomb-robbing and deaths in this one and it's such a great deal of fun getting to the bottom of it with these four amazing people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooray! She's done it again!","review":"Another wonderful book! Amelia and Emerson, Ramses and Nefret, Cyrus and Katherine, and all the wonderful Egyptian cast is also there. And surprises!

They just keep getting better and better.I do make one wish-that Emerson & his beloved Peabody make that big Egyptological discovery (Of course to do with a pyramid) soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much froth, not enough story","review":"This is a great series. However, this may be the weakest book in the group. The histroy and detail are truly great, you get a real feel for the time and place, and every other book in this series has been spectacular. THere wasn't enough adventure or mystery, which has never been a problem before. That being siad, I'm waiting for the next one in this series, and I can't wait until the series catches up with Howards Carter's find of King Tut's tomb. I can't wait to hear what Emerson has to say about that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the Silent","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I love Elizabeth Peters. In fact I read her books over and over again. I have read Lord of the Silent twice now thinking that maybe I didn't understand it the first time. It was very slow and uninteresting. I felt it wasn't up to her usual style. I am hoping The Golden One will be much better. I loved He Shall Thunder in the Sky. I couldn't put it down. Maybe that is why Lord of the Silent was so uninteresting to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out.","review":"Gilson, while a very good historian, was a self-taught philosopher and, as such, made a few interpretations of St. Thomas that are questionable. His metaphysics have some serious errors in relation to the Dominican tradition of Thomism (which Gilson utterly rejected). An excellent refutation of Gilson's errors are found in Tonquedec's \\"La Critique de la Connaisance.\\" Gilson has some valuable insights, but parts of his philosophy are deeply flawed, especially his perception of philosophy as an art instead of as a science (which St. Thomas held [see hisThomas Aquinas: The Division and Methods of the Sciences (Mediaeval Sources in Translation)]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book but I have my disagreements","review":"This fine book profiles colleges and universities in 10 categories including schools that promote honesty, spiritual development, leadership, voluteerism etc. Also profiled are 50 college presidents who make a difference. The book also includes an honor role featuring the top 100 schools that foster character development. As expected, many of the schools are smaller, religiously affiliated schools, however, many of the top known, larger universities are also liberally profiled. I have a major quibble, however. Schools that have arguably run counter to good character development are included. An example is Yale University which refused to allow religious Jewish students to opt out of the mandatory requirement to reside in a dorm when these students were offended by other students who were running around in various states of undress in co-ed dorms and who were openly entertaining their sesual partners. Still, all in all a very helpful resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE the Chrome honda grill","review":"It looked great once installed and so cheaply priced at the same time.

Australian soldiers were in Somalia at the time too as part of the UN peacekeeping force. I enjoyed the fact that it didn't deal with the political framework, as mentioned before it is first and foremost a soldiers story. As stated by Hoot (Eric Bana) near the end of the film; \\"it's about the man next to you\\". But I think the film could have done without the chest-beating by Josh Hartnett at the end. I was a little disappointed that the film did not depict the Somali riflemen, RPG men hiding behind, underneath, in a crowd of women and children as in the book; that's what these young soldiers had to deal with.

They didn't ask to go out, but when called, they selflessly do a job.B) They have ABSOLUTELY no idea what they are getting in to when they saddle up and head out.Anyway, this is an excellent movie. Not for the faint of heart. Not for the John Wayne-type of war movie crowd. ESPECIALLY not for younger veiwers.I like this movie. I just hope that I can sit through the whole thing in one viewing this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Being one of the only modern day war films, this movie excels in its portrayal of present day conflict. Technically correct in more aspects than any other military film, it does a great service to those who sacrifice for our country. A must own for anyone who appreciates what our nations young soldiers give for our freedom and for the freedom of the people of other nations. Unflinching in its combat scenes; there are no \\"breaks\\", but rather only few moments where the honest feelings of these soldiers are revealed. A true masterpiece of a war film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some people don't understand","review":"I am getting tired of people bashing this movie by saying that it's too violent and doesn't develop the characters enough. Here's a wake up call to those people: WAR IS VIOLENT and this movie shows how violent and inhumane it can be. Most of the people who downplay this movie either don't know what happened in Somalia or don't understand the utter brutality of war. This film tells the story of what the Rangers and Delta Force in Somalia went through. It doesn't try to develop the characters because that's not what the director was trying to do. Black Hawk Down is a living tribute to the American soldiers who died in Somalia. In this case, their actions were the key focus and not the men themselves. Critics need to appreciate what these soldiers did for their country and for each other before the full potential of the movie can be seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ausome stuff","review":"Josh Hartnett has been critisized by his girl loving fans all over the world. They need to shut up. If there his real fans they should think he should do whats best for him. Black Hawk Down is clearly is in the top 5 all time war movies. It is also the best movie Josh Hartnett has been in. Most of his fans havn't even seen the movie to say it was a dumb decsision or not.Let's get down to it. Black Hawk Down is a masterpiece. Although it has been critisized. These people dont know what the frik there talking about. This movie was nominted for only three oscars (won film editing and best sound). Honestly I think the movie should of been nominated for best picture over Gosford Park or Moulin Rouge. And it probably would of won. All i'm saying us buy this DVD.

It will be a quick reading since its intensity keeps you reading until you are finished.Enjoy !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure war movie","review":"This film avoids all speech making and sentimentality that has become a common occurrance in many modern war movies. Black hawk Down does one thing and that is capture accurately the feel of the atmosphere and intensity in that awful day in Somalia where 18 American soldiers lost their livesThis is probably the most definitive film on modern warfare and features slick equipment such as night vision and the latest weaponry, all adding to the realism. This DVD is somewhat flawed because of its lack of special features. I suggest, if you really love the film, to wait a few months when Revolution studios will probably re-release the film on a separate DVD. This film is intense, featuring about 2 hours of non stop action and gore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been made better","review":"I feel sad everytime I watch a war movie - blood splattered across pavements, body parts blown everywhere, too much profanity. War & death basically leave me a heavy heart to reckon with. That partially explains my 2-star rating --- I basically don't feel comfortable with war movies.However, there's one particular war movie that I like & that is \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". There is a core group of soldiers, whose lives, beliefs & fates I managed to follow through. I guess that is what was lacking in Black Hawk Down. There were just too many characters, a lot of action but inadequate room for character development. I relied heavily on their faces to tie in with the characters they portrayed, but when they were all bloodied & grimed, & not enough stuff to make them stand out, I just got them all mixed up.I feel like it was just a collection of big names with hit movies to back them up, but nothing essential to mark their contribution in this particular film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This DVD!!!","review":"Don't Get me wrong, I think Black Hawk Down Is A Great movie, but this dvd [is not good]!!! it has basicly NO extra features.

Everybody can recall the images of dead Americans being desecrated by the Somalis, but what the book covered was the story behind the conflict, and it's participants. What I didn't like about the movie was the combining of some characters, and the omission or downplaying of others. I didn't get a feel for any of the characters in the movie. They all seemed very thin, whereas the book fleshes them out quite a bit more. Also, the tension between the different units stationed in Somalia, not there at all. In all fairness, had the movie mirrored the book, it would have been about as long as the battle itself, with hundreds of characters, and a cast of thousands. Bravo for making an almost honest movie about an unpopular conflict, but as for me, I'd like it a little more like the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome movie","review":"This exiting epic is an exilent reinactment of the tragic war in somalia.

I admire the movie for being truthful about war, how the soldiers show fear, (as in life) there aren't any cheap attempts at patriotism here either. no one liners. In a sense I felt I was watching a documentary of the events that took place in 1993.the movie showed our soldiers unbelievable bravery without sugarcoating the facts. I felt a lump in my throat when the two soldiers dropped down out of the helicopter to try and save their fallen brothers, against hundreds of enemy militia. I have never seen bravery displayed on cinema in any manner like the bravery shown in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Modern War Movies of This Decade","review":"Definitely a great action movie, acurately re-creating the gritty, desert combat in the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia. Amazing sound: this movie is best seen with a huge woofer to capture all the amazing low frequency RPG explosions. Not only is the action amazing, but it is a sad, thought-provoking look at the horrors of war. Slightly gory, but not anywhere near a Private Ryan or a Windtalkers. My only gripe is a small one: there is an almost constant whine of sad African music playing in the background. But some people are into that stuff, and it is appropriate when depicting sorrow. In any case, this is a movie that any action lover or war buff SHOULD NOT MISS OUT ON. And if you like the movie, read the book, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The (mostly) good and bad...","review":"To start this off, I'd like to say that in general this was an excellent movie. The only people that have given this movie 1 star was because they were anti-war fanatics and just want to downgrade war in general. This movie is very realistic for the most part, absolutely action-packed, and will have you sitting on the edge of your seat from the second that the fighting begins.On the other hand, like a lot of American war films...this movie is extremely biased towards the American side of the story, not to mention the fact that it also only focuses on the American troops fighting...and not the Pakistani and other troops helping the UN side. It also portrays the Somalis as heartless people, when they were no more heartless then the Americans fighting.All in all, it is still a great movie, I'd recommend it to anyone that isn't weak of the heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Hawk Down","review":"Excellent movie, made you feel like you were in the middle of the action.

The problem is, most of the movie is just a collection of big, long, loud and tedious fight sequences that last more than 2 hours. The photography is good and creates a realistic and gritty feel, that almost seems like a documentary. The explosions are also well done and directed, but apart from that there\`s nothing to recommend here. The characters are one-dimensional, comic book-like, and end up being flat and generic. There\`s not much of a plot, either, as the movie drags with countless fight situations, chases and deaths. It\`s not too patriotic, especially when compared with melodramatic stuff like \\"Pearl Harbour\\", but that doesn\`t help much when the movie is so weak and uninteresting. Most of it seems like a mix between a documentary and a video clip, and the result disappoints and doesn\`t convince. This is one to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"the rewriting of history","review":"Of course we are all used to the fact that hollywood takes it liberties with the truth. However, this film is so much a rewriting of history it made me sick. I would have left the theatre had I not been stuck in the middle of a row. The film portrays the american troops as doing all they can to try and save the day, when in reality it was the american decision to hunt Aideed that signalled the end of earlier effective humanitarian intervention. The americans did not save the day, they created the mess. added to this the ill judget attempt at humour during the film (the lost soldiers, har har har) the story is [poor]. Sound, editing and special effects are brilliant though, and if that is what you go for, plus a lot of violence and blood (way over the top) this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!! - DVD needs more content","review":"Great movie, but the DVD doesn't have many extras to it.

This picture deserved alot more recognition at the Oscars than it got.

I guess in a way you could say that. Then again, if you want to see another war love story i'd recommend Pearl Harbor or something along those lines, but if you want a realistic war movie? Hawk emphasizes more on the important realism of the events in Mogadishu than anything else. This was a war movie for war movies. And the characters were brilliant, acting as real soldiers would in this scenario.

Of course, with reviews like that, who could have not seen it?Well anyways, my friend and I went to go see it on opening day. We piled ourselves into the theater along with a bunch of other action craving guys and sat down. Throughout the movie, I felt destracted by the allour of my popcorn more than what was up on the screen. I thought it was overly violent, mediocore acting, but, I must say, good action.

Otherwise, the depiction of the events that occurred on that mission are not only obscure in the movie, but entirely inaccurate. The movie aims at making some quick bucks by riding on the patriotic environment of the US right now, but its xenophobic portrayal of the Somali people and generally, all non-Americans is both disgusting and ignorant.

If you've got a weak stomach, skip this one. This movie gives you close-ups of severed limbs, gaping wounds, and exposed internal organs.

However, they opted to generalize the entire battle into one confusing and objective story, rather than tell the stories of the soldiers. I can easily have my emotions stirred up by the brutal killing of a character, but not if I have no clue who he is or what he is doing. The film throws so many characters at you in such brief periods that you can't remember any of their names, let alone what kind of a people they are. Aside from the uniforms we can't tell the difference between the rebel Somolians and the U.S. military. We're not even sure if we're fighting for the right side.

To be frank BHD reminded me of a video game.The only pluses I am going to give it is due the direction and cinematography. Ridley Scott is like painter, and film is his canvas which makes the visuals sheer delight.

If you want to learn about what really happened, read \\"In the Company of Heroes\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"..........","review":"for all of you people that are complaining that theyre arent enough minorities in this book you need to understand something. if u read the book black hawk down by mark Bowden u would see that in truth theyre were really only 2 minorities in Somalia for the US. so its the truth dont complain about it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary war flick","review":"As close to real as I've seen it. No storyline except the real stroy--a firefight. no holds barred."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty Realism","review":"I would have liked to have given this movie five stars but that has to be reserved for truely exceptional movies and this wasn't quite there. Having said that I think that Ridley Scott is an exceptional director and this is a fine movie. The characters are a little underdeveloped but this is not a movie that is essentially about characters. It is a movie about an event. It is not a romantic swashbuckler like The Three Musketeers. It is a piece of gritty realism about a real event and like real life in moments of high stress events can seem to flash by at a pace that defies our ability to think about them. I saw the History Channel presentation of this incident shortly after seeing the movie and if anything the movie probably understated the confusion and chaos of that 24 hours. It also did not overstate the violence. Estimates of Sommali casualities are frightening. This was the news like tha papers never tell it. Worth seeing for that alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Book Instead (or at least read it first)","review":"This movie is just another typical, Hollywood, special effects blockbuster with no substance to back it up. You see a bunch of soldiers running around shooting, but the movie gives almost no story about who they're shooting at, where they're running to or why things went so terribly wrong on this ill fated mission.Mark Bowden's book is a gripping tale of American heroism in the face of overwhelming odds and an honest documentary of a battle most of us barely noticed on the six o'clock news. It's a shame so much of this was lost in its translation to the big screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda Posing As Something Glorious","review":"This film is the longest recruitment ad for the Marines I have ever seen. In this modern world of media and warfare, interventions like this are more complex, but they have been oversimplified to side with U.S. objectives. There have been thousands of innocent people killed in other countries (South Africa, Bosnia, China), why do you think America singled out Somalia for assistance?...If you really want to see a good movie about the complexities of modern warfare where tragedies ensue when people try to give assistance, see \\"No Man's Land\\" directed by Danis Tanovic. This film shows how affecting military intervention can be from several different perspectives. It does so without the usual big-budget Hollywood treatment, so those of you raised on Go U.S.A. Rambo-style action sequences maybe bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all this hooplah about?","review":"Personally, Black Hawk Down did nothing for me. I'm a fan of war movies, don't get me wrong. From a war film perspective, this movie is an accurate portrayal of combat in modern times. You can't deny that. From that standpoint, the movie is good. It's the other aspects of a good film that are missing. This movie is a 2 and a half hour gun fight. That's it. No character development, no real ending, it just kind of ended. Personally I think we're all so caught up in post-September 11 patriotism that we want to see a bunch of people we don't care about get the living crap shot out of them just so we can feel good about our American superiority. Gimme a break. You want to put out a war movie, at least give it more substance than two hours of Saving Private Ryan-ish combat. At least Private Ryan was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"More american patriotism","review":"Another sadly american film, this film attempts to tell the truth but ends up glamorising american soldiers and failed american foriegn policy.Briliant cinema, but again the message is blurred to suit the american box officeIt is a real shame that none of the film makers these days have the guts to tell it how it really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"The acting was great,,,but.....","review":"A little blood and guts goes a long way. I tried to look at this film with an open mind and tried to see what the director was trying to get across to his audience. If he was going for \\"shock value\\", than he did his job. If he was going for entertaining,,,,he failed.When i go to the movies or buy a DVD i like to be entertained. I'm a proud American and would do ANYTHING for my country. I don't need to see a film that has so much pain. Granted war is hell and i know what it is like to lose a friend(s) to war. But why do we have to be constantly reminded of this type of sadness throughout a movie.The acting is really well done and i don't say that lightly because if you read my reviews i'm pretty harsh on non-broadway trained actors. But the acting in this film was quite wonderful but the director could have gotten his point across without the terrible gore and pain. For acting i give this 5 stars, for directing i give it only 2. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Hawk Down","review":"This was an amazingly realistic and awesome documentation of what happened in Mogadishu. It is a little gorey, but it is a fantastic DVD that should not be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not HD.","review":"It's just a DVD on a Blu-Ray carrier. National Geography in HD is much better than this movie. And that's even in 720. Not 1080.The movie itself is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"greatest war movie ever","review":"...I thought this movie was excellent.It captured the realism of war with alot of brutal andd realistic violence,everyone in this film did a great job.Ridley Scott should of wn best director,and the film should of won best picture.The action sequences are great,the best i have ever seen.I like the fact that the film is non-stop war with so much violence.I felt this is atribute to all the american soldier's who lost their lives that day...i felt that this film is patriotic because just like the people who lost their lives on 9/11 the soldier's in real life are 100% heroes."},{"rating":"2","title":"just buy it","review":"what a great movie. tons of action, tons of movie stars. lots of explosions and action!it has a decent storyline abt a debacle in africa. must of had a billion extras in this movie. but anyways, storyline abt a mission goof up that cost the US rangers and delta force quite a bit of time to evacuate their forces that were stranded in hostile territory. realistic fight scenes and a glimpse into how the terrain and fighting might have looked like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Am I missing something here?","review":"I wanted to give the DVD movie three stars, but maybe I don't understand the technology that well. I have a 56 inch Samsung DLP HDTV with 1080P; I hooked up my PS3 with an HDMI cable and just bought this Blue Ray DVD movie. The bright colors are absolutely amazing but the dark colors have more \\"grain\\" than my average DVD's when I play them. With the money I've spent the performance should be spotless, but that's completely not the case. Am I all alone or maybe something is hooked up incorrectly? I cannot get the movie to fill the whole TV as well, so top and bottom are cut off, which I believe is normal - not sure.Sorry, don't mean to ruin the five star performances, but very frustrated with the dark grain colors. It's very noticeable and was shaking my head the whole time."},{"rating":"2","title":"huskerfreak@theforce.net","review":"First off this is a true story that actually occured, was researched intensively be the producers, and the director. Not to mention they had people on set that were actually there,... Lastly I like to say that ColumbiaTristar did a fine job in making this film. The cinematography was superb, the sound was like being there, excellent casting, as well as great acting, The CG was added nicely, and it all looked so real. Not to mention the fact that is was a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best war movies...","review":"Intersting that certain folks who give bad reviews for this movie does not apparently realize that it was the Army involved during this battle (and obviously the movie) rather than the Marines. Anyway, this movie is one of the sharpest, most compelling war movies to have been made. Ridley Scott's hyper-direction makes it appear as if you were on the ground with the Rangers, Seals and Delta Force. Many complaints were voiced over the apparent lack of characterization of the many troops who were fictionalized during this movie. I disagree and am actually glad that we didn't have to sit through another \\"Joe\\" showing us a picture of his girlfriend back home only to see him blown up minutes later. Personally I am looking forward to the Special Edition version of this movie rumoured to be released early next year. Bottom line: good movie, ultra violent, views like a documentary, tough to watch because of the realism, nice reference quality sound for your home theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"engaging, rarely jingoistic tale of camaraderie","review":"a beautifully shot, produced and directed film. fully deserved it's two academy awards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for my husband","review":"I bought this movie as a gift for my husband as he had not seen it in a long time. He really enjoyed the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is a great movie for anybody interested in the special forces or is curious about an operation in Somalia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie of Real Events","review":"Okay, most of us like the glitz and glam of traditional Hollywood action flicks. Well, this isn't one of them. This story portays the real life events in Somolia. The story takes some time to get into, but it helps civilians to see the real life dangers facing our Armed Forces. It is one of the best adaptations of a true story that I have ever seen. It makes you think twice about what America's service men and women go through. Buy it today--- it is a definant keeper for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ridley Scott should have gone for two in a row..","review":"This film was absolutely excellent! I felt somewhat at an advantage watching it because I read the book in advance, but nothing was lost here. The book was incredibly well done, and only Ridley Scott could do this movie justice. The music combined with the filming aided this movie in giving the same feel the book had, which was that this was not a brilliant screenplay written for hollywood, this was REAL. Great acting throughout, editing, music. There is absolutely no reason that this film shouldn't have been the picture of the year.Bravo Ridley Scott for more ground-breaking work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie, great looking & sounding blu-ray.","review":"If you like war movies, you will most likely have seen or own this movie already. If you like it on DVD you will really like it on blu-ray. Excellent picture and sound. If you think the price is right this is definitely worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Hawk Down","review":"Great movie, the Blu-Ray version in terms of visual and audio are superb. Buy this movie, get the player Blu-Ray is worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing visual detail","review":"First off, this is not a sci-fi film where it is all clean with cgi. This is a real life film with real dirt on the ground. There is a lot of grain but only if you look for it. Looking at the ground the battle resides on is where you discover the true abilities of HD. The level of detail in the surroundings is overwhelming and brings more realism to the viewing experience. Colors are saturated, but it might have been intended that way. The sound is all over the place with bullets wheezing and ricocheting everywhere. And not to mention this is one of the best war movie to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good.","review":"Black Hawk Down was a good movie. It was about Army Rangers were suposed to go on a 30 minute mission to get some Prisners in Somalia Africa but the mission goes wrong and it ends up they have to fight the whole citys militia and the mission takes over 13 hours. We only lost 19 guys but in the movie it looked like we lost 50 guys. If you watched Saving Privet Ryan and liked it you should watch this. The begining is boring because you dont even find out what they have to do until its 30 minutes into the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ridley Scott rocks again!","review":"Ridley Scott is -to me- the best film director still working in America. He made another masterpiece, this time on an episode of warfare, after having filmed other genres like science-fiction: Blade Runner, Alien, historical: Gladiator, The Duelists or the road movie: Thelma and Louis. This action movie can stand at the same level as any of his previous.The pacing, the photography, the script, everything shows that Mr Scott masters the technique and has a talent for storytelling and images like only an artist has.Ridley Scott rocks again.Bravo maestro!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Shipping was prompt.

One thing is for sure, this movie has motives behind that are obvious to most people. People are too smart, today, to accept anything, but this movie is a very sophisticated propaganda piece that is mostly true but tweaked in such a way to accomplish their goal. The average American can't help but be [mad] at the end of the movie, but with reflection and time to digest and disect this movie leads one to the true motives of this movie. It still a good movie.Thank the soldiers that went through that HELL. Bless the soldiers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blackhawk Down","review":"Im very happy with this product.

Under the guise of saving Somalis from famine (though the worst of it was already over), U.S. troops got into trouble. In the process, they killed thousands of Somalis... In the movie, each American life is precious and each Somali life is worthless. The movie is nearly plotless; American soldiers shooting like crazy at Africans who don't want them there. Fans of the book will be disappointed that Ridley Scott has stripped the movie of any complexity, doubt, or sophistication. For 2 hours, it's just 'kill the Black people.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unaccurate account of the event.","review":"This movie is in no way a accurate accounts of the US conflict in somalia, it over simplifies the the reason for the conflict and protrays the somalians as \\"terrorists\\" and the UN peace keeping troops as scum. When looking at this movie from a action movie standpoint it's okay, but looking at it from any other angle and it's mere propaganda.If you want action without accuracy or realism, then this movie is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyable by testosterone filled teenagers","review":"If you want to see lots of action and violence, this is the movie for you. A good 90 minutes of the flick could have been interchanged without affecting the movies' plot. This film is all violence and it's quite graphic at times.The movie has few redeeming qualities and I found it to be very boring. Then again, I've seen things blow up and people kill each other in movies for decades now. Show me something new or at least have some character development and interesting dialogue while it's happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I just have to say that this movie was an absolute disappointment. I love war movies; in fact, they are my favorite genre. And I've seen them all. But this one lacks substance. It is a war movie for the sake of gore. If there is a plot to it, it is lost behind the overkill of the blood, gore, dismantled bodyparts, etc. I strongly recommend seeking viewing pleasures outside this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Hawk Failure","review":"I am going to be to the point. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. WHY?1) No features2) Full Metal Jacket beats this movie3) Acting so-so4) Story okay but not good enough for you to spend full price.5) It is too long and never gets to the point.6) No minorities at least not enough and they were in a Africa(HELLO)7) Leave no man behind? They left and made them run- patriotic enough for you.If you are into war then buy it- but at least buy it for less. Go somewhere else and buy it full 50% off or something.

I am into some war movies and this was not a good one. It drugged on and on and on and I had to make myself watch it after turning it off so many times. This is a real downer- you are better of watching Full Metal Jacket.Second, this movie act as if no other minorities fought. I was disappointed to see only a few minorities.

Protraying patriotlism and showing how Americans soldiers being passionate even at war! Ridley Scott tried to show the humane side of the soldiers while they killed 1000 somerlies in one night?! This is so contradicting. Why didn't he at least film one part showing what the somerlies suffered? I feel so disturbed after watching the movie, partly due to the selfish directing of Scott, and also because I feel sorry for the thousands of somerlies kids and women who lost their father and husbands in this incident."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Had our regrettable experience in Somalia never occurred, this movie would never have received the undeserved accolades it's gotten.

Ridley Scott directed this like it was an episode of Miami Vice. Quick cuts, so-so soundtrack and some action scenes do not make a movie good... DON'T BUY INTO THIS MYTHY. Plus take into account this is a story about the worst military exercise in our nations history. The Mogadishu ATTACKS were the worst planned attacks ever. If you want to feel patriotic go buy Full Metal Jacket or Apocalypse Now. These war movies have been made by two of the best directors of our time. Don't waste your money buying Black Hawk Down..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now, there's a bad movie","review":"What's the deal with this film? It is so biased and unrealistic. They show one side as suffering heroes and the other as barbarians. It's quite an anoying film. The worst: the only credible character falls into stereotype at the end.One other thing. The movie plays as a drama, but then you have a soldier preparing gourmet coffee on the middle of the battle and then the 3 soldirs/stooges come in to play with a donkey. At that point is when it becomes a mockery of the actual events, making ridicule of what happened. Quite a difficult movie to stand."},{"rating":"1","title":"only movie this film student ever HATED","review":"This was the worst film I have ever seen. Not only did the absence of plot and character depth fail to involve me in the action, I became so bored that I actually started daydreaming about other things to entertain myself while I was sitting in the theater. I almost fell asleep becasue the sound of bullets was so rhythmic as to become soothing. The film shows no concern for non-Americans, and the whole thing plays like a shooting gallery game at the state fair: set 'em up and knock 'em down. It was the most shallow, degrading thing I have ever put myself through, and I caution anyone but the most carnage-loving fan to stay as far away from this film as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting US propaganda - an insult to history...","review":"I only watched this film because a friend told me it was a good portrayal of the horrors of war. It is not. It is an attempt to legitimise a US mission in a sovereign state that caused the deaths of 10,000 Somali civilians. From the outset, the natives are portrayed as animals and terrorists, when the real terrorists were the foreigners (US) who invaded their country and took sides in a civil war that was none of their business. Of course, Ridley Scott doesn't tell it like this. He portrays the US terrorists as \\"heroes\\" and spends more time weeping over the deaths of 18 US soldiers than he does over the deaths of 10,000 Somali civilians. He portrays the US mission as \\"humanitarian\\", when its real purpose was to install America's preferred puppet and gain control over lawlesss Somalia. If you care about the truth, I'd advise you to avoid this film..."},{"rating":"1","title":"One BIG Lie","review":"Financed by Pentagon, this film turns out to be a propaganda movie for the US Army.

Yes it is all action, shooting, shoooting shooting, but there is absolutely nothing interesting. The scenes are not really well thought out, and the characters are so superficial. I can't recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Movie - Too bad it isn't true to life.","review":"Nice action and acting all around, but this is not what happened in real life people.

Wait for the special edition whenever it comes out. Ridley Scott has done special editions for his last two movies, Gladiator and Hannibal, and there is no reason why he will not for this movie. This movie will sound dynamic in DTS, if you have the patience and means, I highly recommend you wait for the better version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Hawk Up","review":"Josh Harnett's other war movie recently released was Ridley Scott directed motion picture \\"Black Hawk Down\\". The movie is about the US Delta Forces and US Rangers mission to capture some lieutenants from the band of Muhammad Farrah Aidid. During the movie, different things happen and turn a perfect mission into a perfect disaster. The movie is packed with lots of characters and lots of sad and funny moments, great sound and awesome visual effects. All this together makes the EXCELLENT movie called \\"Black Hawk Down\\". Two thumbs up for the movie!!! Excellent work Ridley Scott!!ALSO!!! if you loved \\"Black Hawk Down\\", don't forget to check out the Musical Score, written, composed and directed by Hans Zimmer, the genious behind the \\"Pearl Harbor\\" and \\"Gladiator\\" soundtracks and musical scores!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a huge fan of war movies and from the previews of the movie I thought this would be good. However, I was not very impressed at all. \\"Black Hawk Down\\" had good production and good depictions of war in general but it was lacking in scripting and acting.The script just was not all that good and the movie failed to have much of a plot. It just seems that this movie focused to much on just one fragment of the plot and never seemed to move on to something different. In general not much really went on in this movie it was just revolving around the same thing over and over. The acting was not all that great either. I was not impressed with Josh Hartnett in \\"Pearl Harbor\\" and I definitely was not impressed with him in \\"Black Hawk Down\\". This movie failed to give me the enjoyment and excitement other great war movies has like \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"Platoon\\", and \\"The Patriot.\\" This could have been a great movie but the plot and script was generally just to boring to accomplish that."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a movie, sure...","review":"I watched this a few days after watching the 2 hour documentary on the History channel, and it didn't compare at all to the real story. Want to really have your eyes opened? Watch the documetary. I loved it, and I hate documentaries!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic battle","review":"I read an article relating the events in the movie to the events in real life, and that they were extremely accurate. The movie itself is a great battle, great as in large. Though many might watch this in confusion, asking such questions like why were we there? Who are these people we are fighting? If you want the background do your homework. You will find that this battle is the result of Communism failing in East Africa, and a country in confusion, plague, and warlords ready to pick up where the Communists left off. I loved the characters, each individuals, but also a team of brothers with a mission and motto \\" No man shall be left behind\\". Think about that while watching and imagine if that were you in there place. The soldiers held back overwhelming odds. I did not see this as a glorified hail to the American power, but a fight to save hundreds of thousands of starved people. Difficult to watch at times, graphic, bloody and emotional. Great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent","review":"Apocalypse now - helicopter attack (minus Wagner music) plus Saving private Ryan - first half hour equals Black Hawk Down.This movie, based on a true story, is war roller-coaster and one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for DVD but . . .","review":"I thought that this was a great movie when I saw it in the theatre and I could not wait for it to be released on DVD for all the extra features that usually come with a DVD. After I purchased the DVD I found myself dissapointed with the lack of extra features that I guess I expected. The back or the DVD case says that the movie trailers are included. The only trailers I have on my copy are for Spiderman and The One. I was also hoping for some deleted scenes. I hope this is not a trend to release a DVD with limited special features and then in six months re-release it as a \\"Special Edition\\" with all the extras!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gut Wrenching Movie","review":"This was an incredible movie. However, Black Hawk Down is a very difficult film to watch primarily because you can relate to the guys so well. My wife actually stopped watching halfway through because it was so tough to watch. It is not sensationalistic in its portrayal of guys getting shot and/or killed, but it is very realistic.My only complaint with the DVD is there is no director's narrative to go with the movie. I don't need it to appreciate the film, but I love the insights those commentaries provide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of an upgrade to Blu-Ray","review":"Given that this is one of my all-time favorite movies, it's one of the few dvds in my collection worthy of an upgrade to Blu-Ray.I read the book, which is excellent, when it was first published and thought there was no way a movie could do justice to what happened there. I was wrong.Technically, both the video and audio quality are excellent. In terms of value, the extra features, most especially the commentary by some of the military personnel who were present, are alone worth the price of admission. As far as the movie itself, this is a great one. The story is compelling, especially since it's based on an actual event. The directing is top-notch. The acting is excellent and wholly believable. Black Hawk Down is the sort of movie that stays with you long after it's over.Black Hawk Down is a worthy tribute to our men and women in uniform in general and to the soldiers who took part in this battle in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible True Story","review":"This movie is based on actual events that took place in Somalia in 1993. During a mission in Mogadishu a Black Hawk helicopter was shot down inside the city. The soldiers find themselves surrounded in a hostile city surrounded by angry and crazy terrorists.This is one of the best war movies of the past 20 years. It has a super stacked all star cast, great special effects, and tons of intense action/drama. This movie puts you right in the middle of one of the biggest military debacles in modern history. No movie collector should be without this incredible film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sea of violence and swearing","review":"That's right, tons of war violence(which is expected), and LOADS of f words.

If you get weak at the sight of blood this is not your film. With that said, it is important American history to remember. This movie is a fairly accurate film as it shows the strengths and flaws of both sides... and the integrity of the United States military to leave no one behind. For those into war films, as I am, this is one you want to add to your collection. To those into history, as I am, this is worth viewing so we don't forget what took place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow. Felt like we were there.","review":"We watched this movie on a summer afternoon, but it seemed like we were transported into the middle of the battle. Very realistic tension (e.g. trying to save the soldier with the femoral artery leg wound). From a technical perspective, great realism with helicopters, RPGs, machine gun fire, etc.Some comic relief, especially early on (of course). Not a movie for the squeamish.Overall, very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really worth watching","review":"Black Hawk Down is one of my favourite war movies. Right next to Saving Private Ryan. The story is about a group of American Rangers who supposed to kill a Somalian gangster in a short mission. But something goes wrong and that results in a long fight with lots of victims. I also have to mention, that I noticed quite solid performance by Josh Hartnett in this movie, by the way. So, if you enjoy watching war movies, this movie is almost necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"After a boring intro, the rest of the film is one long battle scene. While the film had the potential to make a strong comment on the futility of war, it turned out to be a showcase for special effects and noisy set pieces.This is a classic example of a film that favors style over substance. For die hard war movie fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really not for weaklings","review":"Before watching this movie, please read a review One of the best war movies ever made! dated 5, 2002, by a viewer from Sacramento, California. Unfortunately for me I read it too late. I fainted exactly during the episode when a medic was trying to save his severely wounded buddy. Thus I never saw the rest of the movie and know the end of this story of outstanding heroism of the soldiers and exceptional stupidity of the high commanders because I have read Mark Bowden's book. Still I give the movie 5 stars: 1) what I saw was very convincing and impressive; 2) all my friends gave it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blackhawk Down","review":"This vdeo gives two views of the story from Somalia, Africa. The theatrical story, and the true story with interviews from the actual soldiers involved in the historic battle that claimed the lives of 19 US Soldiers. The book was written by Mark Bowen, of which the story is based on. The us Soldiers fought with honor and courage in a no win situation, in the middle of the city of Mogandishu, Somalia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Hawk Down","review":"Riveting, horrifying, nonstop action. Painted a too real picture that made sleeping the next evening difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whole lot of shootin' going' on","review":"This is an action-filled recreation of an American mission into Somalia gone bad. The Americans were to capture a local dictator and his lieutenants, but instead one of their helicopters is shot down and things go from bad to worse as they are attacked by local soldiers. Help is slow in coming and the Americans hold off their enemy as best they can while waiting for reinforcements. The action is fast and furious and the acts of courage are everywhere. This is a well-made film and is recommended for those who enjoy this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best War Crime Movie of the Year!","review":"I first saw this movie in a little town with my buddies. We had no idea what it was about and what was going to happen in it.We had a big suprise. We all came out of that movie theatre stunned and completely water eyed. My friend turned to me and asked did that really happen. I said yes. Everyone of us could not sleep that night at all. I could not believe how horrible that was for our own men to survive such a horrid place with horrible people. But I have to say that it was done very well and it was a real good war crime movie that everyone has to see to know whathappened that day our men were alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Black Hawk\\" soars","review":"Where were you October 3, 1993? If you're like me, you definitely weren't paying attention to our military involvement in Somalia. After seeing \\"Black Hawk Down\\" I wonder how I could have been so oblivious to the whole situation. The most violent and intense war movie I've ever seen, it's also one of the best. Benefiting from a strong ensemble cast (Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, William Fichtner, Sam Shepard) and taut direction by Ridley Scott (\\"Gladiator\\", \\"Thelma & Louise\\"), this film tells a powerful story in a powerful way. The action and effects are amazing; you'll feel you're actually in the middle of a Mogadishu street with bullets whizzing by your head. Hans Zimmer's score is effective and contributes to the heightened emotion. This is one Hollywood film that Hollywood got right. Not for the weak-stomached, \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is, nonetheless, a film you should see."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wonder","review":"if my memory does not betray me, there were foreign forces involved in helping the US soldiers. Yet somehow ridley scott did not potray this aspect in this film. of course hollywood will always potray the half truth to the American audience, so that in the end any US military involvement in foreign land will not be questioned by the tax payers."},{"rating":"1","title":"No fun","review":"This is probably the most realistic depiction of war I've seen. The explaination of the battle plan was clear enough, but after things start to go wrong, it was easy to lose track of the action. Blood and gore is abundant. There is little character development, hence it is difficult to truly care about any of them. It was not my idea of a fun evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a piece of the picture...","review":"\\"Black Hawk Down\\" is a good snapshot of what it's like to be in light infantry in what the Army euphemistically refers to as \\"Operations Other Than War.\\" Very graphic in depicting what can happen when little things go wrong in these sorts of operations. However as a holistic story of what happened to the men of Task Force Ranger that Sunday night in Mogadishu, it's sadly incomplete. Little effort is made in setting up the stage as to why the Rangers were in Somalia, and it completely ignores the aftermath of the fight... even to the point of leaving you hanging and wondering if CW3 Durant ever got away from the Somalians :-(As a shoot 'em up war movie, \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is hard to beat. If you're looking for the story of what happened in Somalia and the lessons that can be learned from that sad experience, skip the movie and get Bowden's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Real, and too long","review":"I am a fan of war movies and this I wouldnt call a war. A mere skurmish. You cant help but fell patriotic as you watch this movie and want to squash the villans and enemies, but his movie just doesnt end.

It good too much hype, and it was a total let down for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"History about what we didn't see","review":"Black Hawk Down reveils the American stand off in Somalia during the Gulf War. This movie has a great cast of characters that will keep your eyes glued to the screen... Along with the action.

This movie is very accurate in showing the realities of combat and I think that this is a movie that will really convey to people what it's like to fight and die not only for their country, but for each other.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to know about what it's like in the heat of combat and the courage and fortitude of our soliders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing","review":"Now I haven't seen Mel's Passion yet but as far as i see this is the best movie yet. I read the book and watched the movie and this movie was icredibly accurate. It shows how hard it was for the U.S. soliders in Somalia how violent this war really was. And if you haven't seen the movie yet you better go see it, it will astound you from start to finish with its captivating story."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a non-stop Action packed film","review":"Black Hawk Down, after I saw the movie became my favorite war movie right in front of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". The movie is about a group of rangers and delta force souldiers who were sent to Mogadishu, Somalia in October, 1993. For a mission that was supposed to take only 45 minutes, turned into a chaotic 16-hour war of survival, Sgt. Eversman will do whatever it takes to get his men out of this war zone."},{"rating":"2","title":"great action","review":"This movie was great. I loved the role of Josh Hartnett. Alot of action it did not drag like other war movies it was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"War","review":"this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The effects and the scenes are perfect. It gives you the feeling that you are actually in the war or watching it from outside live. the things that you see while watching the movie are not the things we see in our world but the movie gives us the idea that there is a totaly different world out there that we have to understand how lucky we are."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Eager to Please the American People","review":"This was a movie that was created to be the most PC and pleasing movie of the year. THe characters were unbeleivible, with stupid antics to make shots at jokes during the movies. THe main character was the perfect boyscout who loved all races and was there to save lives, i dont doubt that the men and women in service do this but he was just too much the perfect human being without any faults. The movie was also too repetitive, i would of loved to pay 1/4 the price and have seen 30 mins, but instead it seemed they took thirty minutes of footage and put it on a loop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Made","review":"This Movie is terrible...I paid good money to see it in the theater..and I'm telling you people who read this dont waste your money buying this crap...it not even worth your time.

The action is unmatched in every catagory. When you leave the theater, you will be in awe of what you just witnessed. It makes you want to go and sign up for the military because of the strong brotherhood. \\"Leave no man behind\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"We are not War junkies\\"","review":"With the great story telling of that fateful day in 1993, what I got out of it is definitely the \\"No Man gets Left Behind\\" message, and conveying home to those that don't believe in the war but follow-up harassing the soldiers in the front line. So much appreciation and admiration to those that not only fought, but keep going back to help until everyone is home.I'm not in military, nor have any family member affiliated with the military. So I can only judge as someone feel being protected by these brave folks. So this movie was an eye opener - same or more so than Saving Private Ryan.The blu-ray pictures are pretty good quality for blu-ray standards.

Whether it is Saving Private Ryan or one of the many war film starring John Wayne, there has always been something special about going to the limit and making sacrifices for what you believe in. But this movie was just too much of that.People say that the first ten minutes or so of Saving Private Ryan is intensive and ultra-graphic. And they would be right. About 85% of Black Hawk Down is at the same level of intensity and graphic depiction. It is almost like a rollercoaster ride from hell. It left me somewhat dazed at the end.Having said that, I thought the cast was wonderful. The characters were colorful and managed to each stand out in the midst of hellish wave of war imagery bombarding your eyes and mind.All and all, not a bad film but not an exceptional one. Less beating about the head and shoulders with the imagery stick and I think it would have been an exceptional one."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great film","review":"this movie was of ot the best moves i have ever seen. the war shots were awesome and the acting was supurb. josh hartnett did a wonderful job, along with ewan mcgregor. there were many actors from the movie pearl harbor, and i personally think the actors gave a great depiction of the movie. the best movie of the year"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of dark scenes","review":"I think that the prevalent dark scenes caused this movie to be less likeable.

Maybe someone will one day be able to tell this story properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good fighting that undermines the \\"plot\\"","review":"This is ultimately another Hollywood film whether or not the director intended it to be. It has little character development (if any) and doesn't really tell the story (beyond fighting which we already essentially knew). If you're looking for blood and guts alone, you're in for a ride. If you're looking for another Saving Private Ryan with character development and more than just fighting (with violence as a byproduct) then look elsewhere.This is a very one-sided film. Corrupted politics (also existent in the 'good sided' US) somehow translates into purely evil somalians that do nothing but kill (innocents and american soldiers alike).So, you will get to see the omnipotent americans kill those black hawk suckers alright (no pun intended...), but not much else. That's Hollywood for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"great movie - BUT GO BUY THE 3 DVD SPECIAL EDITION","review":"Black Hawk Down is brilliant filmmaking by one of the industry's greatest directors.

When a bunch of marines is stranded in Mogadishu, Somalia all hell breaks loose as militants start attacking them. From there it is just angry men running and shooting. Although this is what you would expect from a war movie, Black Hawk Down remains way below average. I think this movie could have done better with some obvious main characters. Now you barely get a chance to start caring about what happens to the soldiers. Now you have so many qualified actors doing nothing but firing guns. As this movie was based on events that truly took place, probably Americans will appreciate Black Hawk Down a little more.

But I definitely do not want to watch this movie the second time. It taxed my patience even during the first viewing. For it is very poorly conceived as a movie: no characterization, no plot, no structure. As such, it is terribly boring. All one gets to see, for more than two hours, is brutality, blood, violence. Josh Hartnett is a talented actor, but he does not even have a chance to show his talent, for, like war itself, this movie does not allow people to emerge as individuals, and this hurts the point of the movie, which is \\"fighting for the man next to you.\\" Great war movies do not just exhibit shooting, bombing, running and shouting. They show the audience who the soldiers are--not as machines, but as individuals, as human beings.

I was able to put it together in about an hour. I would however recommend a crescent wrench for a few of the bolts. Other than that assembly was quite easy and the diagrams were a little confusing at times, but common sense helped me out alot.Admittedly I'm pretty out of shape and this is a very nice workout. I wouldn't recommend for someone who is looking for hard core training. I can move the bike from room to room as it has wheels on one end, so if company comes I can hide it in a spare room. There is little to no noise from the bike and it easy to use while watching TV or a movie. I'm about 5'7\\" and fit nicely on the bike. The seat is a little hard, but I'm planning on fitting it with a cushion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Economical basic machine","review":"If you're looking for a basic model without all the bells and whistles, this is an excellent choice. It's also very quiet and it's compact size was definitely on of the selling points for me. Only problem is that I wish the seat adjustment were easier to work. It gets a little stuck sometimes. Again, if you are looking for a basic model this is a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well until the pedal mechanism wore out","review":"I bought this back in 2008, but the pedal mechanism wasn't designed well (or I had a defective one). Within a year of casual use, the right pedal would fall off. After falling off, I would put the pedal back on, only to have it fall off again. After having not used this bike much for the last couple of years, I finally studied the pedal in detail. The threaded hole in the pedal was completely striped, so I have junked my unit and plan to buy a different product. Other than the pedal issue, I was happy with the product because this bike did its job, especially for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well built machine","review":"A nice heavy bike that will take lots of use I think. Easy to put together with no problems. The tension you can set on this is amazing. Lots of differance between the easy tension setting and the harder setting.

Very quiet, not even a whisper while in use."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for!","review":"I didn't want to invest a lot of money in an exercise bike as I plan to use it while recovering from surgery. This one seemed to be pretty well rated and the price was very reasonable. It does the job, but only just. I've had it for about 2 months and the monitoring device has stopped working reliably. Sometimes it tracks speed/distance/calories/time and sometimes it just won't come on. At first it worked great. Also, the seat is not very stable and is a bit wobbly. Not in danger of falling off or anything, but just not a secure connection to the base. Overall, the bike works about as well as you would expect one for this price to work, but I did hope for better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bike except few problems with the fixtures","review":"I got this bike and I instantly liked it.

I only received one, the allen wrench. I called the company and stated the tools were missing and they said they would send them priority mail. Never came. Called back, then I'm told there's a mistake with the packaging and those tools are not included. So apparently I need to go find the appropriate tools to put the dang thing together. The bike itself is probably fine but it p*sses me off to no end that this company...1. gives different answers at different times and 2. cant provide the 10 cent tools that would allow me to put the bike together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mainframe of bike was bent - too thick to bend back to shape to fit the screw in.","review":"We were so excited to get this bike, after purchasing it here on amazon.com. The box it came in was completely banged up and some of the parts were sticking out. We were concerned, but thought we'd check out the situation. We opened up the box and made sure we had all the parts; they were all there. So we go to start putting it together, and then we see that the mainframe is bent along the bottom. It's bent so far back that we can't put the first screw in. It's a thick frame, and we can't just bend it back to shape (at least without using a hefty mallet). We're so disappointed... we wanted to use the bike but it's not even possible to get past the first step, because of how much it was bent. It was either packed damaged, or damaged by the shipping company. Either way, whoever did it, I hope to get this replaced otherwise we're expecting our money back, obviously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal","review":"A good price for a well made product.

Easy to put together (about 20 minutes tops) A lot of the brakets didn't line up perfect... The first thing that was dissapointing was that one of the bolts holding the seat on stripped out with hardly any force. The second was the seat itself. I can hear the wood cracking on one side and I weigh 220lbs... the biggest disapointment is the thing they call a \\"computer\\" this thing is a joke. It's supposed to start up when you begin but doesnt come on till you are off the bike thinking its busted. As far as the readouts, God knows what your looking at cause as soon as you can read the number being displayed it automaticly changes to something else.

As a KitchenAid fan already (I have a few small appliances and of course the stand mixer), I expected this set to be wonderful and it is! Very easy to clean, the handles do not get hot, and they're not too heavy. I do stack them for storage and I haven't noticed scratches and I DO NOT put them into the dishwasher - I ruined my Revere set that way, hence why I bought these.

I recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy pot rack for a reasonable price","review":"We have an \\"upscale\\" home but, like many people, have become extremely cost conscious. We had been wanting a pot rack for our kitchen. The pot racks in a kitchen store in the Medford area were in the $400 - $500 range and out of our current desired price range. The on-line store from which we got the pot rack from Amazon looked good, but, of course, pictures can be deceiving. However, the pot rack we received looks and feels like a quality item and looks great in our kitchen. A friend of ours has a pot rack that looks very much the same--and she paid much more for it. We are very happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Dishwasher Safe","review":"You would think based on KitchenAid reputation and the cost of this set it would be hands down an excellent set for most any kitchen. Unfortunately, and not until you have read all the fine print, would you discover the set is NOT dishwasher safe and as such unacceptable to be returned after having made the assumption and had already ran them through a couple of cycles to learn they now cannot be returned. It is ashame to later learn that lesser known makers of a similar sets of cookware, costing half as much, IS dishwasher safe.

The clean up is so easy, the clear lids are great and the handles don't get hot.

My mother-in-law cooked with them one night and ordered a set the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the Price","review":"I've owned more expensive cookware sets, but this moderately priced set from KitchenAid ranks with the best of them. All of my previous cookware was stainless steel or low-end aluminum, so I was not sure what to expect in terms of durability. However, this set has exceeded my expectations. The pans are wonderful to cook with, the non-stick coating beats anything I've tried before, the lids fit tightly, and the insulated handles make oven mitts unnecessary. I love how light the pans are -- even full they are easy to lift and pour from. One note of caution: The domed lids and upright lid handles mean these pans require a bit more storage space than other sets I've used."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the positive reviews must not cook with gas","review":"We purchased this cookware less than a year ago. In a short time, our gas stove had licked the finish right off the exterior of every pot and pan. Totally discolored, and a decent percentage of the surface is down to the bare metal. Totally unacceptable.I sent one of the pots and a picture of all pots and pans to the warranty address... have not heard back and it's been 2 months.Based on the other reviews, we might have received a defective set, but we're totally baffled, and not nearly as confident about the KitchenAid brand as we were previously... especially with the totally unacceptable customer service.Strangely enough, it's the inside of the cookware that has disappointed us in past purchases (Pampered Chef and even ScanPan), and the insides of these pots still look new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this set!","review":"This Kitchen Aid set is exactly what a cook would hope to have in a kitchen. I've had this set for 5 years now, and it still looks brand new. I can lift the pots by the handles without burning my hand, and the lids fit securely when cooking. I always hand wash them and have never ever seen rust or peeling. It's a high-quality product for a great price. Well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchen aid cookware collection","review":"The product is wonderful.

It was a fantastic deal and the reviews were good, so although I've been a Calphalon owner for years I decided to buy this deal. I made a great decision! First of all, these pans are hard-anodized just like the Calphalon pans I was planning on supplementing, but they are much easier to clean and more non-stick than my previous pans; truly non-stick. The silicon handle is great and I never need a mitt to handle. Another huge thing for me was the size. All of the pans are very deep and much more so than my previous set. Aside from my trusty cast-irons, these are my go-to pans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not buy from warehouse again.","review":"I was a little hesitant to buy from the warehouse, but after reading the description for an excellent/like new condition referring to a dented box, I decided to buy these pans after all. I was very excited to be getting such a great deal. However, when they arrived, one of the lids was smashed into a million pieces, and the pans appeared used, having food splashed over the inside of the pans. Next time I will go with my instincts and will not buy from the warehouse again. Returning these pans was easy, although an inconvenience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two years of careful use and they are now junk","review":"I have had these since May of 2007. We never use metal utensils, no dishwasher, etc. The pans are now all sticking. They worked good for about a year and a half but are now going into the trash because everything sticks even with lots of hot oil! There is a 'lifetime guarantee\\" but from what I was able to gather that is only good for the first year. That makes sense because that is how long they will probably last. This seemed to be a good set as long as you don't mind buying them every other year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasn't held up well...","review":"I purchased this set at a department store almost 2 years ago, and have not been impressed with its durability. The nonstick coating on the larger frying pan has peeled off in the middle, and I'm afraid to use that piece, for fear that the nonstick material will come off into my food. The large skillet became warped very quickly, so it no longer sits flat on my glass-top stove, and it's almost impossible to heat food evenly. And the \\"rivets\\" that hold the handles onto the pots/pans are exposed on the inside of each piece, and are a pain to clean. I bought this set to replace an even cheaper t-fal set, but I think I'm going to have to invest in some quality cookware, rather than waste money on more cheaply-made sets like this. (Note: I'm not much of a cook. These don't get heavy use, but still haven't held up.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchen Aid Gourmet Essentials Hard anodized 12 piece cookware","review":"I have to say I really researched buying the right cookware but I came across all the reviews for this product and I have to say they were all positive. I have had this product for a month and they really do work well for day to day use ( the skillets, the small pots) they larger pots I have not used as of yet but I'm sure they are fine. I have washed these pots only by hand but the lids can be put in the dishwasher. The reason I gave it four stars is that the skillets don't have lids, and the skillet I use on this electric range blackened the bottom slightly so I cannot wait to use this product in my new house on a gas stove as I think they will not heat up too fast and the heat will be distributed appropriately.Other than that I appreciate amazons customer service promptly adjusting my purchase price as I noticed the price fluctuates for this product so wait for the sale! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love all things Kitch Aid!","review":"This set is wonderful! I had an expensive T-Fal set and hated them.

One of the best kitchen decisions I ever made!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A HAPPY WIFE MAKES FOR A HAPPY MAN","review":"I bought this set of cookware as a surprise for my wife (after many hours of research & weeks of decision), but the real surprise was in how much she loved it. Heat seems to radiate much more efficiently, which means lower gas or electric bills. She loves the style and only wishes she had a kitchen where she could hang them out for everyone to see. I myself have but one complaint... the handles on the lids get HOT! You need to be a little bit careful when you grab a lid, make sure you grab only the rubbery part and not the metal at either end. OK, so ladies have smaller hands and probably won't have a problem, but for any male chefs out there... beware. Bottom line... I love this cookware and would recommend this set to my mother or my sister and to both of my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome basic set!","review":"I loved this set! I bought it about 3 - 4 years ago and still use it. Like another reviewer mentioned - I love the lids, they sit well (no gaps, etc) and they're durable. Also, the handles are great. They don't get hot at all. And I love how you can put the saucepans in the oven! The pots are heavy, which means they are thick, and therefore take some time in heating up. I prefer it that way though, so that when I remove it from heat, the pot stays hot a good long time after.The bottom finish of the pots are still in great shape after a couple of years of use, but the two frying pans show some wear and the finish at the bottom is wearing away; it looks scrathed up and I have to oil them well to keep things from sticking. But they show the most wear because I use them the most. I contacted KitchenAid and they said they would replace them if I sent them in. All in all, a good set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Pots","review":"These pots are great! Food falls out of the nonstick like it was never in there. Cooks evenly and doesnt even burn. I love them and would definitely recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"handles too heavy for small pots","review":"The pans, being non stick work very well. Clean up is a breeze and heat is distributed very evenly. However, I find that the handles of the smaller pots are way too heavy for the pots and it does have a tendency to tilt over while on top of the stove. It was unfortunate that because of this, I had quite an accident wherein the small pot tilted and the contents, which was hot oil, spilled on my hand. I got a pretty bad burn and since then stopped using the small pot to avoid such an accident. So be very careful of just buy the bigger pots and not the set."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and Last","review":"Heat distribution on this product is non existent. How a cook can burn a meal on a low setting is beyond my thinking. When I bought this item I thought the problem might be the inconsistancy of the electric range. The apartment complex saw that I had an old range and replaced it. Since food still burns I believe it is the product, not the range that is the problem. It is interesting that the T-Fal set I had used on the same range didn't burn food like this set does. As soon as I have a few bucks Kitchen Aid is gone in favor of T-Fal."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRODUCT wont last!","review":"This cookware I purchased for the brand name alone.

We were in another room watching TV and heard what was almost as loud as a gunshot...in fact, I grabbed my gun to investigate. Kitchenaid said this can happen if the rivets were over-tightened and they'd send us a replacement as soon as they were back in stock, which was supposed to be about a month. 6 weeks later we called again to check and they told us they still didn't have any. 2 months later we got the same story. 2 months after that, same story. We gave up trying...luckily it was for the pot we use a lid for the least (the giant boiling pot). Great pots and pans, Kitchenaid just has crappy customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever for price","review":"These pots and pans are of the highest quality and are well worth the price.

Treading in the footsteps of Charles Dickens seems to have compelled him to raise the level of brutality in the orphange to a dismaying level. Perhaps some ambitious writers feel that if their work isn't outraging some middle-class sensibilities, it isn't great literature.

The rest of us would be better off re-reading Oliver Twist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only person who didn't like this book?","review":"Not only wasn't it laugh-out-loud funny, I didn't even once crack a smile. The characters are not particularly interesting or sympathetic, just collections of random idiosyncrasies. The arc of Edgar's life isn't interesting either, but simply an excuse to move from one dull vignette to the next. And I didn't see Edgar's optimism in the face of his crushingly depressing circumstances as inspirational.In the final analysis, this book disappointed me because I had been led to expect so much more.

I was actually late for work this morning because I decided to peak in and see what was going to happen with Edgar, Sunny, and the Brain and his trip to see his old friend in Nevada.

The human condition is examined with great pathos, humor, and acuity. This book also documents the general state of excess in our world today and how little we appreciate the blessings in our lives. This is a great read for young and old alike, but caution should be taken when exposing younger readers to the graphic nature of the narrative found throughout the book. This graphic material does not seem to be rooted in sensationsalism, but rather is used very effectively to portray the true condition of the protagonist.

It's full of lively, memorable characters and you can feel the love that the author has for his main character. It's hard to put down and well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK I'VE READ IN 20 YEARS","review":"I am not a young man and have read many books, but this book might be the best of them all. Reviewers have compared this book to The World According to Garp, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and Great Expectations. These comparisons are all justified. Can you imagine such a thing: a novel writtern by a 30 year-old man being justifiably compared to three great novels written in English? I don't think I can say anything else: this is a defining book, this is a beautiful book, an indespensible one. It will win awards and be included on college syllabi. Most importantly, it will take up an important place on your bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"most memorable","review":"This is one of those truly special novels that leave an indelible mark on the reader, one that you want to recommend to others, and when all is said and done, one of the few you will want to read again. And it's as good the second time around too. In parts funny, sad, uplifting, maddening, and joyful, this novel does what all good fiction does; it moves the reader and transports you into another world --- but one without rocket ships or asteroids. This is just good, soul-fulfilling, down-to-earth storytelling. You'll love the main character, young Edgar, and you'll love the story, and love this book. There have been a lot of comparisons to John Irving, especially \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany,\\" but I think this novel is even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edgar Mint","review":"This book was awesome!

Will definetly put on my bookshelf sorry folks no resell here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hijinks in jeans","review":"The Miracle Life of Edgar Mint is a frustratingly page turner where little Edgar attracts different kinds of trouble(s). For me, it was very real, as the setting is where I was born and raised. The story is fictional but some of the events are real. I am glad that Brady Udall was able to write in a humorous way, about these marginalized people(s). The novel was recommended by a friend and now I am recommending this story to other friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a short note","review":"I'm not going into what this book is about. What I do want to say is that just running into a work of fictional literature of this calibre is very rare. I would compare this with Joseph Heller, with Iris Murdoch, with all of those great writers who wrote about nothing more than the lives of people. Yet, we are always drawn to these stories, looking for ourselves and those we know and knew, looking for some answers.This is not a pop novel, but a work of literature. Sorry, but there it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching, rewarding AND funny!","review":"If there was ever a time to use the word \\"tragicomedy,\\" this is it! Udall has created a tragic character in Edgar Mint who, nevertheless, manages to make us laugh out loud. From his \\"accident\\" with the head-crushing mail truck, to his placement in an Indian reservation school where the children take every opportunity to beat him up, to his conversion to the Latter Day Saints, Edgar remains an affable and perplexing orphan in search of a family and a home. I look forward to more work by this young author."},{"rating":"1","title":"The disappointing life of Edgar Mint","review":"I was drawn by the rave reviews, the comparisons to Dickens and \\"One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest\\". What I was left with was a bad taste in my mouth. The story was dark, with humorous moments interjected...the style is confusing, jumping between first and third person narrative...the characters were more caricature than developed. After an early life of pain, loss and heartbreak, Edgar is rescued by an ill-timed meeting with a previously unknown character from his forgotten past. There is a movie deal for the book...I would suggest cartoon artist Jamie Hewlett."},{"rating":"1","title":"a native american Owen Meany","review":"Let's see.A story about a boy from a dysfunctional family, who is somehow physically different than the rest of the kids; he is a great believer in God and has a very strong belief in his vocation and the reason for his being alive.Haven't we read this book? Yes! It's the Native American version of Owen Meany!! Very smoothly told, don't get me wrong. But, why settle for less than the original.If you've read John Irving's \\"A prayer for Owen Meany\\",you might want to give this book a miss.Mr. Udall can certainly tell a tale. Too bad, this one has already been told."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Adventures of Robin Hood. B&W","review":"These are 1/2 hour episodes of the Robin Hood series filmed in England and shown in the US in the late 50s. They are B&W, and the writing and acting is very good. Did not see this when it aired in the '50s, but really enjoy them now. Very entertaining, and well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Remember ...","review":"I remember watching Robin & His Merrymen back in the 50's on my parents small black & white console television.It was really exciting back then and I shortly after got my own hat that Robin wore.Remembering it now,it was made of leather,brown & green with a feather that was 14\\" long.It would be worth a fortune by todays standards.Watching it now you can see how non-realistic the inside of the castles were made but as a kid you could not find a more realistic place.The one thing I like is that Robins' camp and ALL outside activities were all shot in the Forest,maybe that is why I have always liked the woods.The complete series is here and I have watched it over and over and it holds a Special place in my DVD Library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard Greene is the BEST Robin Hood ever!","review":"As a kid, I loved Robin Hood; but watching them as reruns on Saturday mornings meant that you never got to see the entire series. When I saw the First season in the $5 bin at Walmart, I bought it hoping it would live up to my childhood memories. Not only did it do that, but our grandson starting watching the episodes with me and also fell in love with Robin Hood---even in black & white! We loved it so much, we had to find the rest of the seasons. We were thrilled when we found them here on Amazon al together in one boxed set.We've watched all 4 seasons, and they were great! It just amazes me how the writers came up with all the clever, new plot twists each week.This series is thoroughly entertaining and satisfying, containing a good moral message with each episode without coming across preach-y, contrived, or superficial as some 50's shows did. Although Errol Flynn made a dashing Robin Hood in the movies, Richard Greene will always be Robin Hood to me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Much of a Good Thing","review":"I watched a few episodes, on an oldies television station, and thought that I would be interested in more episodes. Unfortunately, I grew bored after watching several more of the episodes on DVD. The continuing fight between Robin Hood the evil Sheriff and Prince finally wore me out. I know the series ran for years, and had its' followers, but I grew tired of Robin Hood saving this nobleman and that princess and then being 'the bad guy' again, in the next episode.For someone who is interested in Robin Hood or in any of the original stars, I recommend this product. Otherwise, it may be too much of a good thing because there are at least 100 episodes.The Adventures of Robin Hood: The Complete Series"},{"rating":"1","title":"very very old","review":"This is a black and white. Very hard to watch. The outside package is in color giving the belief that it is in color. This is not the new Robin Hood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic Robin Hood from a TV age that believed in heroes","review":"This show was magic to me when I watched it as a youngster on morning TV circa 1962. The spark is still there in 143 episodes in DVD format at a very reasonable price. Picture quality is very good and clean. It's a pleasure to see the quality British actors from that era esp. Richard Green who was so good in classic films like Kentucky and Forever Amber, and Alan Wheatley as the Sheriff who received raves from actors who subsequently played that role. Donald Pleasance went on to play Blofeld in the early Bond films, Edward Mulhare of the Ghost and Mrs. Muir, John Schlesinger, brother and sister child actors Peter Asher of Peter and Gordon pop fame and Jane Asher who grew up to become Paul McCartney's girlfriend, all make appearances. You will enjoy the heroic nature of these eps and they hold up in entertainment value and interest even after 55 years. This is the first collection I've found in one full set, good quality, reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing EVER on television","review":"I found the dvd for the first season in a discount store five-dollar bin. Came home, watched one episode, and suddenly remembered all the best feelings I experienced as a kid, fifty something years ago. I'm pretty sure this show had a lot to do with pushing me toward the Church, but I'm funny like that. Sure enough, AMAZON carries all four seasons. I've ordering sets for all my Godchildren and Grandchildren.\\"They handled all the trouble on the English country scene [seriously? \\"scene\\"?] and still found plenty of time to sing!\\" They didn't just sing in their extra time, mark you---they FOUND the time!\\"Yo, Robin!

Every episode is very well done the stories really pull you in and leave you wanting more. Richard Greene is the best Robin Hood I've seen so far.

However, in looking at my old 45s from Junior High, I noticed that a couple of my favorite Gamble & Huff songs for the Intruders - \\"I Bet He Don't Love You (Like I Love You)\\" and \\"This Is My Love Song\\" - are not on this CD (or anywhere else that I can find). This is a great CD, but my joy with having it receded a bit - such a shame!

For example, while rough- and-ready Teddy Roosevelt was not much of a fan, Franklin Roosevelt was instrumental in keeping baseball going during the dark years of World War II.Dwight D. Eisenhower was a pretty fair ballhand, a minor leaguer who found greener pastures in military and political pursuits. And Richard Nixon was considered by some to be an astute student of the game.The President's Game is well-illustrated with seldom-seen photos and would be a welcome addition to both the baseball and the political science fan's libary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Guide To Tribbles","review":"If you like reminiscing about how great the tribble episodes are this may be for you. I was hoping for some made up anatomy, biology history stuff and this is none of that. Its really just quotes from the episodes and some unfinished jokes (no really!) And its only about 10 pages. Save your money and write your own book would be my suggestion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Mix, but not for serious classical music listeners","review":"Bach, Vivaldi, and Mozart are all too well known, but less known musics are blended well into this CD. That's why I bought this CD. I think this is a good CD to familiarlize myself to flute pieces, but as a serious classical music listener it may come in short as more than half of pieces in this CD are something too famous and were listened so many times. This CD can be used to know what I like and then move forward from there. I am the type of listener who listen to the entire Carmen of Bizet instead of listening to only one part or two of it. If a listener is unfamiliar with clessical music, I think this is a good one to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"An insightful look at a long neglected topics","review":"Department stores have been too long neglected in the field of U.S. cultural history and when they are examined, tend to be treated in terms of nostalgia or as studies of their wealthy founders. Benson finally gives us a more complete look at the web of relationships -- highly gendered relationships -- that made these emporiums so work. She not only reveals that it took an ever-changing balance of gendered roles to make the stores thrive, but that the department store played a much larger role in shaping American identities than historians typically consider. Thoroughly researched and wonderfully insightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The works indeed!","review":"When originally released by Capitol in the U.S. and Canada, and Toshiba-EMI in Japan, that marked the first time Queen were with EMI for the entire planet. In the singles department, \\"Radio Ga Ga\\" was the last Top 40 entry for several years, as Queen were slipping away in America, while getting bigger everywhere else. \\"I Go Crazy\\" is only on this edition. I have the original UK LP."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Start From the Ashes of Hot Space!","review":"After the disaster of \\"Hot Space\\", \\"The Works\\" is a decent attempt at recapturing the heights attained before and up to \\"The Game\\" but still falls way short. The whole \\"A\\" side i.e. the first 4 tracks are quite forgettable except for \\"It's a Hard Life\\" which has an incredible guitar solo that's almost as good as the one on \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" years before when they were really, really great and the album only seems to come alive from the \\"B\\" side i.e. track #5 onwards. I guess coming from such a low base like \\"Hot Space\\", this is actually quite a decent effort. This version with its great mini-lp replica packaging and remastered sound earns it at least 4 stars although the sound quality isn't great when compared to the other Queen remastered albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing album","review":"I've been a Queen fan since '84 and this was the first album I bought way back when. I'm still listening to it today as I do with alot of their other albums. Creativity breeds longevity. And Freddie/Brian/Roger/John were among the most creative ever. This album is amazing...my favorite being Machines - it still sounds like it could've just come out today. What an amazing song. Other notables are Radio Ga Ga, Its a Hard Life, and Is this the world we created... Heck, they're all good. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Works works!","review":"This id definitely worth time and money to get. It flows well and gives enough vintage Queen for everyone to love. The two remixes at the end are classic Queen as if in concert. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to good old hard rock!","review":"You can definitely tell that Brian May had a large influence on the content of this album - it is filled with his trademark hard-rock style guitar. This album is great! Radio Ga Ga is a brilliant pop song to star the album which then explodes into the heavy metal of Tear It Up. Hard Life is a lovely gently song by Freddie, followed by the rock 'n' roll fun of Man On The Prowl. Then comes the album's best song, Machines. This is an incredible hard-edged rock number with fun lyrics. Following that is Queen's hit I Want To Break Free with their famous hilarious video. Keep Passing The Open Windows is a good pop song with leanings towards full-on rock. Hammer To Fall is their excellent famous stadium song with Brian May's unforgettable riff. Finishing the album is the gentle Is This The World We Created, a beautiful solo acoustic guitar song. Overall, there isn't one bad song on this album. This was the first Queen album I ever heard and it made them my favourite band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice comeback album","review":"After the Hot Space mess in 1982, Queen came back with a much better album in 1984, The Works. While not as strong as earlier Queen albums, The Works still offers some great songs. The best songs on this album are I Want to Break Free, Hammer to Fall, Radio Ga Ga and It's a Hard Life. Keep Passing the Open Windows is a good song as well. The other songs on this album are pretty much filler. The remixes are no good as usual. I Go Crazy is an excellent song; very catchy lyrics and great guitar work by Brian May."},{"rating":"2","title":"After","review":"After the hidious Hot Space Queen made a strong effort with The Works. Although this album did feature Dance related fare the fare did well do to strong lyrics and melody (Radio Gaga was a Club Hall smash during the early months of 1984). This album also features some great Hard Rock, Pop ballads and the 40s style Man On The Prowl."},{"rating":"2","title":"My all time Favourite CD","review":"I would have to say this is my favourite CD, the funny thing is it has been my favourite since I was 6 years old, now thats a long time. I don't think Queens music will ever be out of date as it is in such a league of it's own.My favourite track would have to be the heart rendering \\"Is this the world we created\\" about what we have done to the earth it still makes me cry!I love EVERY song on this CD and that's a pretty hard thing to say bout any CD, especially when it's not a best of album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goes back to the heavier days","review":"The works goes back to the heavier days of queen. Although it was good in it's own way, Hot Space was not the classic heavy Queen sound.

It's got something for anyone - lots of action, snappy dialogue, a few chills, a little romance, and the best part is this is unlike any other vampire tale I've ever read. Merz has created a world populated by realistic heroes and villains - he makes the reader experience it all. A great novel - buy this book!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fixer: Personality and Plot","review":"Wonderful book? You bet. If you're interested in anything with voice, captivating action, and unending plot twists, Jon F. Merz's book, The Fixer, is for you!

Edge of the seat thrills, Vibrant images, You'd think I'm selling a DVD player with these types of phrases. But I'm not. The Fixer does not dissapoint. Wonderful writing written well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes you just have to doubt the 5 stars","review":"Well everyone. I am convinced that whoever gave this book 5 stars really didn't read it... The book had decent writing in most aspects, plot, character development, but the verisimilitude of the character and consistency within the story were very poor. I kept getting knocked out of the story when I would come across an inconsistent fact or opinion; the main character kept talking a good game but acting like a chump. I would give it 1 star and leave it at that if there was nothing good about the story. The author does have a decent original world and with more development and better editing it could have been a good book. I have read better free works online. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coulda been a contender but...","review":"...it's all been done before. Merz's \\"Fixer\\" is just an awkward hybrid of James Bond and Vampire the Masquerade. Predictable plotline with a lot of one-dimentional characters and some campy silliness thrown in. A fluffy airplane read, but that's about it. If you're looking for serious vampire gumshoes, gangsters and secret agents, then I recommend Keeper of the King by P.N.

The heroine Alexandria gets kidnapped from her French foreign escort in the desert by a band of nomands, coming to find out the prince who kidnaps her she knew as a child. But the story just drags and doesn't keep intrest where it should. It had potential but didn't use it. The villians weren't convincing to me. I just didn't believe in the end that she loved him at all, and he her. All in all I wouldn't recommend this book,unless you're very bored, lol. But can I make a suggestion if you're wanting to read something exciting and touching? Try Virginia Henley's Falcon and the Flower, or Raven and the Rose.

Instead, this album is filled with generic songs that contain none of Bree's potential as a singer and songwriter.

If you hated Guttermouth, then this may be the album for you. My only other complaint is a minor similarity between Lazy Afternoon and Soak up the Sun (Sheryl Crow), but it doesn't break the album.So, as I said, I do adore this album, but if for some twisted reason I had to choose between More B.S. and Cheap and Evil Girl, I'd take the latter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Managing Pain Before It Manages You","review":"This is THE chronic pain management book according to my doctor, and I'm a believer.

How about, I can't walk around the block? There is no help offered for people with pain that is more than moderate in nature.

No matter when or where I hear this song it invokes memories of happy times when I was about 11-12, 15-16, 20-38. This song unlike so many others has stood the test of time. The break when the song goes from a mellow jazz composition to a \\"this is my part!!\\" get up and dance beat that is unforgettable. While I agree that TSOP may have gotten more air play because of soul train, I truly believe more people recognize MFSB for their Love is the Message theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pina Colada Cocktail Sugar Drink Rimmer","review":"This was pretty good but wished it was not blue, it is kind of weird since my pina coladas are creamy colored or if strawberry coladas, they are pinkish with red strawberry garnish or yellow pineapple with umbrellas that match the drinks and garnishes but BLUE??? rimmer didn't make much sense.

So for them, I bet it is great. But right now I am a stay at home Mom, so coming up with a Mission Statement is not high on my priority list. But I really enjoyed the stories about Winston Churchill and Mother Theresa, so I gave the book one star per person. This book would be a great starting point to help you figure out what is most important to you if you haven't done anything like that before with your life. On a skiing scale, it would be for novices. I've been doing a lot of work on myself lately, so I'm an intermediate and I didn't get much out of it. One book that I did enjoy was Dr. Phil McGraw's Life Strategies. It's a quick read because he writes in terms everyone can understand, and it gave me a lot to think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"There are a few reasons why I will not buy this book:1. It is merely Hyrum's old thoughts recycled. It contains material mostly from the second half of his time management book.2. I already have Stephen Covey's 7 Habits book. What is Franklin Covey trying to sell here? They seem to be selling two separate philosophies: Covey's 7 Habits approach and Hyrum's Discover/Plan/Act approach. Cognitive dissonance anyone?The subject matter of this book is best covered in Covey's 7 habits book. While I criticize Covey for milking the 7 Habits paradigm for all its worth with mediocre follow on books after his first magnum opus, atleast he has a lot of material in that book.What I would have loved to see from Hyrum Smith is his original book reworked for the Palm world.

Box of Fire includes all of the band's Columbia albums with the exception of, of course, Nine Lives, and even adds a 5 cd bonus disc. The discs come remastered and with extensive linear notes. The only drawback to this excellent box set is the price. At around $100, it is too much for most listeners, but for those who are loaded you should definately get this collection, especially if you don't already own these albums. If you do though, you will almost certainly want to pass as there is nothing new here outside the five songs (of which you have probably already heard, and maybe even own, three) and the box itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of Aerosmith Best songs!!","review":"What an awesome collection...it has Aerosmith's early beginings...to their knock you out of your seat hits!!

Aerosmith has never made anything bad in my openion, and this shows of what I mean, all the albums here are first rate excapt for Rock In A Hard Place which isnt that bad, concedering the worlds greatest guitar player Joe Perry and his buddy Brad Whitford were not there. This is a good way for new fans to get all Aerosmith in one place. Pick up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Queen - The Miracle (Review)","review":"This is a really poor album. Innuendo is a better choice if you want to hear Queen in decline. While the musicianship and production are competent, the songs are just not what you expect from these four men. I Want it All could pass for a real Queen song if you mixed it in with some other tracks, but that's about all you'll like on Miracle. Skip this one unless you've already heard everything else the band ever did. Note- if you're new to Queen's later sound, try Hotspace."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"As a big queen fan (up until 'A kind of magic', anyway) I was highly disappointed with this rather lame effort. Tuneless and unoriginal, I hope this one fades into the background that the real brialliance of earlier works is remembered."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: Bland","review":"Queen return to the U.S. charts with this album though, as a whole, stands as a weak effort.Of course, you can always count on a few tracks to make buying it worthwhile.The band look back and question themselves with the rock anthem \\"Was It All Worth It\\" to which they answer \\"It was a worthwhile experience!\\"\\"I Want It All\\" stands out as the best of the lot with it's heavy metal leanings and cries for equality (at least, that's what I got out of it.)Then it's \\"Breakthru\\" which has a quality that I've always enjoyed in songs, it makes you happy. When Freddie sings \\"If I could only reach you, if I could make you smile...\\" it has a profound effect on me.Unfortunately there's the watered down disco-like \\"The Invisible Man\\" and the pseudo R & B track \\"My Baby Does Me\\"....ick.With it's Euro-centric sound, I was surprised to see the album break the top 30 here (this was after all, the hair metal 80's) but charting is charting. Save this one for the last batch of Queen albums you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you 're new to Queen - avoid this album.","review":"I'm a fan of Queen and they'e one of my favorite bands even after twenty plus years but this album is definitely the worst Queen album. Even Hot Space was better overall. For my money there are two good songs on this album, (Kashoggis Ship and I Want It All), and one great track (Was It All Worth It). The rest ranges from \\"alright\\" to downright embarssing. And Freddie Mercury's voice by this time had declined quite markedly.He also makes the mistake of tending to shout too much.Things would get better with the next album Innuendo but The Miracle is clearly Queen in transition and somewhat surprisingly losing their way."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLY FOR DIE HARD FANS","review":"I am a die hard fan and I had trouble listening to this. Freddie said he wrote disposable pop. Critics say \\"Hot Space\\" was their worst album. Well, THIS IS THEIR WORST ALBUM.The cover art was bad enough. I was ashamed to be seen with it when I bought it. Well, I am ashamed I actually listened to this. If you have not heard any of these songs but intend to buy this, listen to \\"Khashoggi's Ship\\" and \\"The Invisible Man\\" and be prepared to laugh or cry.\\"Scandal\\" and its remix, \\"The Miracle,\\" and \\"Breakthrough\\" were the only decent songs.If you have not listened to hot space, the album is good. It got a bad reputation because some of the songs have references to homosexuality.Back to this album, this proves that if you write a song about stupidity and have good music to go with it, people will like it. Just ask P. Diddy. If I hear about P. Diddy's expressions one more time . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Queen is Alive!","review":"This is a great album, especially considering it's not a greatest hits comp. There's genuinely an impressive amount of good music on just this one album. It doesn't have \\"We Will Rock YOu,\\" but you can hear that plenty just by randomly tuning into classic rock radio stations, don't need to own it. This disc is packed with less-famous gems: Khashoggi's Ship, Miracle, I WAnt it All [very stirring part in the middle], Invisible Man, Breakthru, Was It All Worth It. Freddy's vocals were awesome, it sucks he died early of AIDS. Note: a number of the foregoing songs might not grab you on the first listen, but they definitely grow on you. So give this album a chance with some active listening when you're not busy fussing with other stuff. It's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"We had a good night jamming away.","review":"This album by Queen was released in 1989. It was their first album to dispense with individual songwriting credits. All four group members are credited on all the songs, whether they actually had a hand in the writing or not. Queen's popularity in the US was way down at this point. The only single from the album to make the American pop charts was \\"I Want It All\\", which peaked at a meager #50 on the Hot 100. However, Queen remained tremendously popular in the rest of the world. Five songs from this album were hits in the UK. \\"I Want It All\\" reached #3, \\"Breakthru\\" reached #7, \\"The Invisible Man\\" peaked at #12, \\"Scandal\\" reached #25 and \\"The Miracle\\" topped out at #21. Overall, this is a very good album, although the lack of recognizable US hits may make it less popular with American listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it.

My mom had this album and I'd look at it and wonder what the heck she was listening to. Well, she popped it in one day and I was HOOKED! This was the first Queen album that I had ever heard before and I think this the best album of them all, since I grew up on it.1989...what a year! Freddie shaved, Brian's hair curled some more, and The Miracle was out. I fell in love with the picture of Freddie inside the cover. I think that's his best picture of him. Great songs too and hard rock! I Want It All and Breakthru. This album includes my all-time fave Queen song, Was It All Worth It. I love Freddie's laughter. No one would feel complete with out this one! Oh, and Khashoggi's Ship is one-in-a-million!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen was still great in the 80's","review":"1989 -nineteen eighty-nine was a great year with regards to Queen.

I'll stick with a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Miracle is wonderful!","review":"The Miracle ! What can I say! A Very diversified album/cd. One of my favourite Queen albums. After each listen it grows on you more and more. I am a huge Queen fan so for me they can do no wrong! Some well know songs: The Miracle, I want it all, The Invisible Man, Breakthrough and Scandal! After listening to Scandal a few times it has become one of my favourite songs from this album. Amazing vocals from Freddie Mercury when you consider this was recorded around 1989 and he was already quite ill at the time. If you can get to see the videos of these songs they are fun especially The Miracle which uses four mini Queen lookalikes and is a really interesting video to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was It All Worth It?","review":"Although I have said before, several times, in my other Queen reviews that I prefer 70's Queen, this is their best album sinceHot Space.This album reintroduces a certain musical sophistication, lost withThe WorksandA Kind of Magic.On this album,, there is the pleasing The Miracle, the superconfident I Want It All, the funky The Invisible Man, the hopeful Breakthru, the resigned Rain Must Fall, the coulourful Scandal, the laidback My Baby Does Me ,and what seems like an ode to the years the band performed and recorded, and a premonition that the end was near- Was It All Worth It?This is noA Night at the Opera, but ultimately this is good music, and worth adding to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuing the trend set with \\"A Kind Of Magic\\"","review":"Queen's previous album, \\"A Kind of Magic\\", was a return to form, and \\"The Miracle\\" continues that trend. This is a very good album, better (IMHO) than the albums they released in the early '80s. It is an extension and continuation of the styles they implemented in \\"A Kind Of Magic\\", which they would refine in their next album, the excellent \\"Innuendo\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Underrated Queen Album","review":"I am a newly converted Queen and this was the second album I bought. \\"Breakthru\\" is an awesome song, especially the beginning because it sounds like a gospel choir. It's comforting to hear Freddie say a few words in most of the songs. He seems closer to the rest of us. All in all, it's an excellent addition for all music lovers, not just Queen fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A key work of black history, compulsory reading for everyone","review":"A classic work of history, a compelling study of the only succesful slave revolt in history and its extraordinary leader Toussaint L'Ouverture, and a key work by a man who himself features in the history books as one of the most remarkable of modern day West Indians. James's sardonic and elegant yet impassioned prose is worth the price of the book in itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but too much marxism","review":"This is an older account of how San Domingo became Haiti and the rode to freedom from slavery. Be warned it carries a Marxist slant throughout the whole book but once you ignore that then the story is very compelling. It is one of the best accounts of what happened on San Domingo and you get a sense for how the French Revolution influenced what was happening the Caribbean. If you are just starting out on Caribbean history this is the perfect book to start with. It shows how the cultural identity began to take shape and what happened to the French Caribbean possessions."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting but","review":"Hated this book, it was like pulling teeth.

The latter cursorily in comparison to James's work. His analysis of race and class are concurrent as the Haitian dymanics necessitate such. One of the most salient things was the bizarreness of the social arrangements in Haiti: Great Whites, Small Whites, Mulattoes (even more stratification in this class) and Africans. Maybe the events that transpired were ineluctable. Here are these variant races and classes in the midst of an African revolution with a French Revolution correlate and interface. This political climate produced some of the most intelligent, heroic and proficient men in History: Toussaint, Dessalines, Moise, Petion and Christophe.

Shiny silver fold-out. (...) Granted, it's a lot of fun to listen to. Electronic ambient noise stuff. Very soothing without being boring or new-agey.

Clearly, as Thomas Fleming demonstrates conclusively - the evidence clearly shows Wilson out to be a demagogue, a myopic idealist and a fool.I learned a great deal about the story of WWI from America's perspective, about how British propoganda fooled millions into supporting the war in Britain's favor and I gained a new perspective about Germany in WWI vs. Germany in WWII - the 2 are vastly disimilar.At times I thought Fleming to be very biased, but I couldn't find any flaws in his reasoning or his use of sources. He backs it all up and makes a convincing revisionist case against Wilson.Entertaining, well written and elucidating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WW I - Why?","review":"I read this book about a year ago, and since then have often thought of the impact WW I had on the course of history through the 20th century. It always seems to me that most Americans have little understanding of why America entered WW I. This book explores the why's, and it isn't what most people think. As a result of reading this book, I found that many leaders I previously considered heroes were in fact little more than dupes; while others I thought to be ogres, were in fact much more altruistic than it would seem at first glance.A well written, well researched book. If you love history, you will love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A diatribe","review":"Rather too soon after taking up this book, I have put it down.

Though he is generally correct on the facts in this book his personal animosity shows through so plainly that it detracts from the flow of events. I am not concerned with what the author thinks. I would have much preferred a book that lays out the facts and timeline with minimal commentary. Fleming has confused editorializing with interpretation. He provides no opportunity for the reader to form their own opinion because he is so busy forcing his own down the reader's throat.

That describes this disappointing work rather well: for those who wish to hear only the positive, and the classic story of repentance and redemption, the basic story is competently told, and it will, perhaps, serve its purpose. But it offers little or nothing to the thinking Christian (or non-) reader: there is little or no critical evaluation of Colson and his story and (disappointing to this reader) little too on the remarkable movement that he has been so involved in creating and leading, Prison Fellowship. Colson's is an inspiring story, but little or no purpose is served by setting him up as a plaster saint. There is a fascinating tale to be told, and real Christians still struggle today with the moral ambiguities and compromises of life in the world's centres of power.

Unfortunately it doesn't always seal completely.It just feels like cheap plastic compared to the old stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic, not rubber","review":"The tubing is plastic, not rubber, so it is stiff and less flexible then the other tubing I have used.

The songs are all at least decent, and some of them are great. The remix of \\"Dragon Attack\\" is even interesting, although I'm sure some of Queen's old fans will hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it was not for Dragon ATtack ...","review":"..

The rest is medium, almost below average for Queen's standards...!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Musta been soundalikes cause this was not Queen music.","review":"This is such a poofy album I dont know where to start. Crazy Little Thing Called Love sounds like it was recorded in a bomb shelter somewhere with such a hollow sound souless tune I thought me speakers were out of synch. Another One Bites The Dust, yea me when I heard this for the first time. Yea its got a cool bass opening but so do many songs,My Sharona comes to mind. Disco was supposed to be dead or dying and they came out with this snorrer.This whole album sounds like a bunch of throwaways they had laying around and put together just to fulfill contractual obligations.They didnt sound hungry anymore and each subsequent album after this were basically just the swan songs of a once bold and uncompromising group of talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"Another unspeakable album from the most unspeakably overwrought, over-produced and over-rated rock band of all time.

Ghastly stuff.K."},{"rating":"1","title":"the end","review":"Some high points, some low points, but overall pointed the clear path towards Queens demise as an artistic force. Embracing pop. And what's more, the shameless and uninspired way in which the talentless bassist, Deacon, blatantly ripped off Chic, for that baseline from Good Times, undescores the limitations of this album. It's one thing to borrow a theme, elaborate on a theme, but what Deacon did was dishonest. This kind of dishonesty is a symptom of his musical incompetence really, since he didn't know better.At the time, when the album came out, it was a bit of a shock to the kids of that era, since Queen was turning its back on its inventiveness. They had embraced the pop single as their only format. After this it would be Flash Gordon and David Bowie, in other words: nadir.It wouldn't be until Queen's final album that they would again take up the mantle of artists. In the meantime, they were following the trend of euro synth pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen at its best","review":"Queen's album \\"The Game\\", is a must buy for any music lover. From John Deacon's \\"another one bites the dust\\" to Freddie Mercury's \\"crazy little thing called love\\", this was one of Queen's definitive albums. They give the rock n' roll fans what they want with powerful tracks such as: \\"Rock it(prime jive)\\", while Freddy Mercury's beautiful voice sings throughout \\"play the game\\" and \\"save me\\". This album belong in any rock n' roll fans' collection. It very well could be Queen's best Pure Rock album. If you're a huge fan of Queen's rock this album and News of the World would be the ideal purchases for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen Enter The 80s With A Bang!","review":"One of the best albums of their career, the Game is a little bit of a departure for Queen (their first album to feature synths).

Queen's first attempt at using synthesizers was a major success not only in the USA, but across the globe. Four big hits highlight this album (Play the Game, Another One Bites the Dust, Crazy Little Thing Called Love, and Save Me). Other songs like Need Your Loving Tonight and Sail Away Sweet Sister are strong songs in their own right. Dragon Attack, Don't Try Suicide and Rock It (Prime Jive) weren't that great, but not terrible either. The bonus song, a remix of Dragon Attack, is worthless.All in all, a great album.

There isn't a real hit song anywhere on it. But if you love Queen (and who doesn't) you must add this one to your collection. Like many great albums this one has to be played in its entirety to truly appreciate its nuances. It's both mystical and amazing, transporting the listener to some far away place polutated by fairies and ogres. Quite possibly the greatest Queen song lives within this album. March of the Black Queen will give you chills. It goes from a ballad to to serious hardrock within its seven minutes. Freddy, Roger and Brian all take turns at lead vocals something I don't think they did anywhere else. Amazing! Leave the top 40 hits to the amateurs- this album is for the true fan and for the ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply fantastic","review":"This album is BRILLIANT. It's a wonderful musical journey. I still get goosebumps listening to this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps their best","review":"I found that on first hearing, Queen 2 was a little dissapointing. It's not exactly pleasing to the ears at first, as (I think) a lot of the chords don't seem to match up. It's only when you take notice of the lyrics and the way things flow that you can really appriciate the shear brilliance of each of these tracks.I really like the way the songs flow into one another, making this album almost a collection of 3 tracks. There's the rather easy-going yet interestting Brian May tracks followed by a much heavier, characteristic of Taylor (I'm in love with my car) track, and then you arrive at the very highlight of the album, Freddie Mercury's amazing string of songs. At first I hated this music, but I find it so clever and easy to listen to it has to be one of my favourites. I don't think that this is a CD for the general listener, they'd have to be in to Queen's rather 'variable' style and be prepared for sounds that aren't quite what they'd be expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"My least favorite","review":"I have all the Queen CD's, and this is my least favorite. But it is still better than most other bands i have heard. My favorite Tracks are, \\"Ogre Battle\\" and \\"The Fairy Feller's Master Stroke\\", they have a lot of Queen that is yet to comeAll in all, in my oppinion, Their worst, but still the best compared to other bands.P.S. i am writing reviews for all of queen's albums"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Material, Bad Remastering Job","review":"This disk showcases the many moods of Queen as they began to develope their songwriting chops. The original release had a side White and a side Black, each of which described the moods of the songs. There is the beginning of Mercury's experimentation with different themes and seques within a single song as exhibited in \\"Black Queen\\". \\"Ogre Battle\\" showcases some of the speed playing the band was capable of as well as the stunning falsettos of drummer Taylor and Mercury. Seeing this performed live in a small venue was unbelievable. There is an obscure yet powerful song written and delivered by Taylor, called \\"Loser in the End\\" that is great. I just wish the engineering was a bit clearer on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen Rocks","review":"Personally, I don't think the album Queen Rocks needed to be released. This one rocks the heaviest, but all Queen albums had at least some heavy-ness to them didn't they? That guitar. The voice. The rhythm section. Harmonies. Whew. It was mind blowing back in the seventies/eighties, and it still sounds great. My daughter is getting into this music as if it was new. Well I guess to her it is new...Right now I can't type as fast as I want to.... oh maybe that's because March of the Black Queen is playing.........."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mixture of sounds for a rewarding listen","review":"One of the greatest things about Queen is their ability to make albums with a wide range of sounds and emotions. If you like hard rock, soft rock, or just love to sing along, you really can't go wrong here.I'd describe this album as Queen's most theatrical. It's like a fantasy rock opera. As usual, the vocals are just phenomenal here. You get the amazing Freddie Mercury's versatile voice, the band's excellent harmonizing segments and you have \\"Loser in the End\\" which sounds like a Pink Floyd song.Overall, if you're a Queen fan, a classic rock fan, or just have an open mind with music, this album shouldn't disappoint. Just rememeber, Queen are often a better ALBUM band than they are a SINGLES band. And their singles alone are great to begin with. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have never seen so much creativity.","review":"Really.

Queen at their best. hyper-complex arrangements, multi-part songs, one half of this album is one long composition by Freddie. Especially note \\"Black Queen\\" - perfection, never comes back to the same musical idea twice... the minute I heared this album and particularly this song I knew my life would never be the same.

The compositional expertise of May and Mercury shine forth. This in my estimation is the best full album for progressive rock fans. Side black is my favorite from Ogre Battle thru Seven Seas of Rhye, Freddie shows his dynamic vocal range and uncanny compositional ability. This album is dark and forboding yet fun and intriguing. Everything about this one is awesome a must have for all the late comers to the Queen scene. This one makes Fat Bottom Girls stand out as the silly pop song it was. Buy this one and you will be hooked for life. Long live Queen before A Night at the Opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless effort","review":"There's no question Queen is one of the greatest bands of all time. However, \\"Queen 2\\" is absolutely their worst album until at least their lousy 80s stuff. There isn't a single decent song on this record - amazing in light of the fact that their first release showed so much promise and the subsequent \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" is arguably their best. I can't understand the people who rate this album highly. They must be \\"fans\\", e.g. those unwilling to objectively listen to the music. Sorry fans, but this one stinks.It's amazing that some people felt the need to reply to this review with the usual \\"awesome album\\", \\"beyond your comprehension\\", etc., etc., etc. But as I said, Queen was a phenomenal band that simply missed the target on this one.

First of all, some of the tracks end abruptly in the middle of applause or even while Melba's still singing, no fading out, but just stopping (imagine!). Secondly, there is no booklet, no liner and production notes; you can call it a really cheap thing. It wouldn't be that horrible if the songs were to look over, but on the contrary: Ms. Moore sounds great, with an absolute mastery of the material and more warmth and flexibility in her voice than in some of her other records. Plus passion and listenable joy of singing. I deeply appreciate the artistry of Melba Moore, but am almost disgusted what the music industry does to her - with every of her later records, but especially with this one.

Picking up and hugging bear cubs has a good chance of leading to your demise.

The next four tracks feature the Michel De Villers Octet, with De Villers on baritone sax and Fol on tenor. Again, fine, though my life would not be diminished if I had not heard them. What follows, seven tracks of Sonny Criss, is sublime. Criss' potent mix of brilliant, blistering alto technique and deep, yearning blues sensibility was rarely heard to better effect. If you are a Criss fan, you DEFINITELY want this disc. If you aren't a Criss fan, then you haven't heard enough Criss. Treat yourself and pick this up.By the way, I'd rate the Criss tracks 5 stars in a heartbeat, but the other tracks just aren't that remarkable. As a compromise, 4 Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Material not real worth it.","review":"Ive purchased multiple dvds from the international academy of middle eastern dance. IAMED.

Thomas Harris takes what has become the most anticipated day in all of sports and turns it into a platform for sheer terror.What is so scary about this book, as with so many plots involving terrorism, is that this could happen. Whether at Tulane Stadium (the setting for the Super Bowl in the book), at the Orange Bowl (the setting in the movie), or any other of America's crowded sports venues, all it would take is a well-placed bomb or something worse (?!) to turn carefree fun into chaotic frenzy.Black Sunday is a must for the bookshelf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical...","review":"I loved reading all of Harris's other books so I decided to give this one a try.

The pace of the novel is unceasing and unrelenting. In Black Sunday there are no rest stops....Make sure your seat belt is fastened before you begin this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absorbing first effort","review":"Harris' first novel is an excellent freshman outing. It's a bit different than the more famous ones that have followed, but that's to be expected.

Harris weaves the plot between the two scenarios, which gives added meaning to the two-minute-warning, with no more timeouts.Harris aptly shows what happens when the raw emotions of hatred and jealousy grips the mind and how it ultimately eats away at the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody has to take care of security","review":"This is an interesting book, nobody will believe it until it happens, here I have some questions: what's the minimum time to empty a Super bowl stadium?

Because Ms. Longbotham is able, with a brief evocative description prefacing each of her recipes, to elevate what is, after all, commonplace into something that's so much more -- a memory of a friend or an occasion, a curious bit of culinary culture or a tie-in with some exotic locale that she's visited. This is what I want in a cookbook, and she's given it to me by the cupful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipes completely unreliable","review":"I'm a huge lemon dessert fan so when I saw this book, I didn't hesistate to buy it, even at retail price. Then I hurried home and got to work on the recipes. I do quite a bit of baking and I love to meticulously follow directions, but almost everything I made from this, with the exception of the lemon curd, turned out almost inedible. This book offered the worst recipe for madeleines I have ever had the misfortune to encounter, the cheescake with dense and disgusting, etc. I was very disapointed in this purchase, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

I was startled to see the madeleine recipe panned in another review, because I think it's the best I've ever encountered. Normally I'm not happy with the texture of my madeleines, but these were very tender (the secret is probably the 10 minutes of creaming).

With the number of batteries we go through in our house, I would have been money ahead to have had this battery tester years ago. So many items need batteries and, usually, multiple batteries in one item (remotes, game controllers, radios, etc.). With this battery tester, I can now tell if the batteries are actually low on power and really need to be replaced or if they are still okay. I have a radio that takes 6 AAA batteries and seems to blow through batteries frequently. Before I had this tester, I would have to replace all 6 batteries when the radio wouldn't play. Now, I find that sometimes its just one or two batteries that are actually dead and I can just replace those batteries. This tester will test any size battery too! Not just AAA's but AA's, D's, C's and 9 volt batteries (there are probably other sizes too, but those are the sizes that I have tested myself with this tester).

It covers all the pertinent general chemistry topics for organic and is designed to be read BEFORE you start organic. But don't worry, its the perfect companion for use throughout the year of Orgo1/2 as well because it teaches you how to make complicated problems very easy WITHOUT MEMORIZING any reactions or formulas. I had an A+ in general chemistry and I thought I had all those topics down to a tee--- this book showed me new ways to look at concepts and easier ways to solve. It really is a must have.

When I first read this book, I thought it was clearer than my larger textbook. When asked to predict products of reactions I thought I'd never seen, I recalled a lot of the fundamental principles emphasized over and over in Karty and let out a sigh of relief. I recommend this product to anyone wanting to overcome their fear of Ochem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare or Review","review":"Great for any chemistry student to review gen chem and prepare for Organic.

I felt overwhelmed by a great deal of information that didn't seem to tie back to the Org class I'm currently taking. Perhaps my learning style is just different from others who posted. Or maybe this is a book that should be read over the summer ahead of the school year, when there's plenty of time to reread sections that the student doesn't understand on the first pass.With a full-blown headache, I'm packing this book up and returning it.The only reason that I didn't go with one star is that Dr. Karty writes well, which is always appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tite","review":"This is a nice overall album, for being underground and for being Latin Artist, this album was put together very nice.

With a keen understanding of human nature, much akin to that of Reinhold Niebuhr, he begins to untangle a series of crimes that began two years before.

Maybe I should just grin and walk away. But the classics, by authors like Leo Rosten (The Joys of Yiddish) and Joseph Telushkin (Jewish Humor : What the Best Jewish Jokes Say About the Jews) -- and even Bader's first book -- all prove that when Jews read humour, we do it to learn more about ourselves.Humour offers a painless lesson in Jewish reality, which is sometimes troubling and unpleasant in real life.

Beginning accelerated learners should consider this book and Peak Learning by Ronald Gross. I have used these techniques as a student, counselor, and a teacher to facilitate better learning experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Done, Just not Sure about the concept","review":"I'm of two minds about this title-- on the one hand, it's a quality product, well written and organized.On the other hand, I didn't find the concept to be all that compelling and I didn't really gain anything from the book, other then some familiarity with the subject matter.Overall, this is a well written book but I just didn't buy into the theories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss \\"Burma Road\\" on \\"Hidden Agenda\\"!","review":"I have heard and been fascinated by the cut \\"Burma Road\\" many times over the years, but never learned the title and artist until recently. I found the item on Amazon.com, read the customer reviews, and ordered it. Many of the reviews singled out \\"Burma Road\\" for special praise, a judgement I heartily agree with. It is 4 minutes and forty-nine seconds of musical genius that will touch your soul. Plaintive notes from a Shakuhatchie flute are answered in kind by the distant trumpet of Greg Adams, while a propulsive Bass line sets a background beat for this moving cross cultural musical conversation. This one extraordinary piece is worth many times the cost of the CD, in my opinion.This is not to say there is nothing else worthwhile on this collection. There are other moods, all expertly arranged and superbly performed on this prime example of the jazz/funk genre.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great CD","review":"I heard one of the songs on my XM radio - had never had heard of Greg Adams before.I did not realize he had been around since the 1990's! I had to do some searching to find the song and the album, and then found that it was available though Amazon.If you like smooth jazz - this is an excellent addition to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin volume disappoints, doesn't match description","review":"Disappointing. In reality this \\"book\\" is little more than a catalog for the large Klemantaski collection of photos. Not only is it a very thin volume, but it's small too - only about 5\\"x7\\". The selection of pictures is very good and the reproduction is better than average. Text is minimal, with only a 1- or 2-sentence caption per picture. It's really too bad, because Klem's body of work is generally outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection for 80's Music Fans!","review":"I found this at Family Dollar in Lisbon Falls, Maine for $6. It is $6 well-spent. The sound quality is excellent and the selection of hits makes it perfect for driving or for background music for your next 80's themed party or for just any party or gettogether. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensible volume","review":"You must get this book, whether you are a Chesterton fan or simply a lover of poetry. Even if you don't like poetry, this gold mine may convert you. The power and beauty of some of Chesterton's poetry is unsurpassed, and even his lesser stuff is generally very good.This book would be worth it for the Ballad of the White Horse alone; Charles Williams (whose opinions are not to be sniffed at) has said that the Ballad may possibly be the best war poetry since Homer, and that many passages are in fact better than portions of the Iliad. The characters are also very well-developed and memorable (I plan on naming one of my children Colan, if/when I have children).This is, of course, a dificult volume to find; Amazon is definitely the best route, in my opinion. I spent [my money] to get a rather beat-up copy, and it has been my most satisfying online purchase ever.

It contains 3 sections ranging from his Cubist period to his Ready-Made objects. The video provides a lot of information about \\"why\\" Duchamp chose to create the artworks he did. Particular attention is paid to Nude Descending a Staircase, # 2, and The Large Glass, or The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even.

I got home, checked out the band on-line and realized that this was a totally different person. I honestly do not see how people get away w/ completely stealing someone's vocal styling, approach to harmonies, vocal mannerisms/enunciations, lyrical styling, and overall CONCEPT of a band!! Second hand bands are always robbing original acts of such things (just look at bands like Creed, Puddle of Mud, etc), but I don't know the last time I heard an act that was doing it this blatantly and with such \\"emotional\\" intent. I feel sorry for people that hear something like this and feel that the emotion is original and touching. This is musical piracy, and John Vesely should be ashamed of himself.

Her cockney isnt the best , but i'll lay off of that because it is hard to do a good cockney if your are american.I love Rex Harrison on both albums, he is so funny!

No.","review":"I'm really just appalled that Audrey Hepburn is credited on this soundtrack, as she never sang for the movie and Julie Andrews was the original Eliza, so there's no way in hell that Audrey Hepburn qualifies for the \\"original cast\\" of any music recording of this show.

Also liked the stainless finish and overall design. Pros: Toasts fairly fast, toasts evenly, toast lifter (no more poking into toaster with a knife!), wide mouth that will handle bagels, crumb tray, good controls, absolutely silent operation. Cons: Cheesy, stiff power cord. It is so quiet you really have to pay attention to see when your toast is ready. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best little toaster on the planet","review":"My husband hated our \\"new\\" Cuisanart toaster. He longed for the day I'd bring down the Rowenta, made in West Germany, from the attic. Upon a visit to a friend's condo, we were marveling at his new upscale kitchen, and the Braun toaster caught his eye. He was totally enamored on looks alone. When he heard how easy it was to use, how perfect the toast was every time, and that it was cool to the touch (a feature of the Rowenta as well), I knew a match had been made in kitchen heaven. And, the best part was I found it on Amazon! This toaster has lived up to all its hype. It truly is the best little toaster on the planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Toaster - Nice looking and easy to clean","review":"I like the great style of this toaster and it works perfectly. It is a bit larger (longer) than I expected but I have enough counter space for it. Before you buy this model you need to be sure that it will fit in your space because it is the largest toaster I have ever seen. The shipping was very substandard as it took 10 days to get to me and I feel that is much too long and unacceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic toaster","review":"What can you say about a toaster?

Only complaint is that it is bigger than I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"discontinued - so no repair service","review":"We received this toaster as a wedding gift and were very pleased to have a nice toaster, especially one that accommodates thicker bread. Unfortunately, only two years later, one entire side of the toaster doesn't work. I've called Braun and they tell me that the toaster has been discontinued, there are no parts and no repair service, and there is nothing they can do for me! (To add insult to injury, when I asked to speak to a manager, they blew me off by putting me on endless hold.) I thought this was a company with a solid reputation, and I've certainly been pleased with Braun products in the past. For this kind of service and better durability, we would be better off buying a cheap toaster. So would you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for those who like light toast","review":"On the lightest setting (1), this toaster still makes toast darker than what I like (ok, maybe I just like warmed bread), but with 5 settings, it seems that it shouldn't make the edges of the bread black in spots. I can't imagine what the highest setting does.I looked into returning this toaster, but Amazon would have deducted the cost of my \\"free\\" shipping from my refund, PLUS I had to pay the postage to return it. I basically now put in frozen bread on the 1 setting, (not the frozen bread setting) and make do, since it would have cost me too much to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"burn it down","review":"Toaster is sleek looking, but it burnt my waffles.

Decided this was the toaster for me after reading all the glowing reviews. Rest assured that this toaster not only looks great but performs well, too.

If you are searching for perfect toast this is the toaster for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even toasting, for lots of toasting at one time look at others","review":"This toaster does toast evenly as promised, but I find that if I want to toast lots of bread I have to wait for it to cool down to put my next 2 slices in. The bread will not stay down if the toaster is still hot. Has anyone else seen this? I wouldn't buy this model again unless I was single. For a family, buy a 4 slot toaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Toaster I Have Owned","review":"I ordered this toaster last week from Amazon and it is, hands down, the best toaster I have owned in my 45 years of keeping a kitchen. Besides the basic geometry of the toasting slot (it accommodates long slices and relatively thick slices too) it toasts evenly and quickly. I replaced a Cuisinart toaster that was less than a year old with this Braun. It seemed an indulgence but I am so happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It looks nice. It does not toast very evenly, typically get one edge burned another not toasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warranty Cliche","review":"Bought this toaster in March 2007 and loved it - at first. Stylish, toasted well, the crumb tray is a nice feature. But, the cradle that holds the bread in the toaster broke two weeks after the one year warranty expired! How's that for timing? The cradle dropped down into a position that jammed the crumb tray and prevented the on-off switch from moving down far enough to turn the toaster on, so it's now completely useless and headed for the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks Great - Works Great","review":"Fits in great with the other stainless appliances.

I thouroughly enjoy every song on this CD. If you're looking for positive up-beat music with great guitar riffs and intelligent lyrics look no further. Seven's voice is amazing (a combo between Bono & Marc Anthony). Eddy Zak and Wally Brandt are superb on guitars and the rhythm section of Mike Elizando & Matt Chamberlain are bar none. Get ''Back to the Innocence''. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This CD is wonderful...I saw the guys live at Zootopia at Giants Stadium in June and just could not wait for the Cd to come out. I bought it the day it was released and have not stopped listening to it since. The music is great. Seven has a beautiful voice. And the lyrics are so down to earth and real you can really relate to the music. These guys are gonna make it big....."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Surprise","review":"I bought this CD with caution, figuring that this was just another band whose CD couldn't stand up to the quality of the first single (\\"Walk With Me\\"). But I've really enjoyed it. None of the tracks really has the same feel as WWM, but that's a good thing. The lyrics address a variety of topics that each demand their own style of accompaniment. I especially like the slow \\"I Pray\\" and the ridiculously catchy \\"Say It's So,\\" as well as the title track.The sticker on the front of the album says it carries a promise from the band that \\"every song counts.\\" They mean it, y'all."},{"rating":"2","title":"depth of voice and talent!","review":"The first group in a long time to come-along and WOW me! Not only does the music move well into my soul . . . the lyrics actually seem as though they were written with thought and consideration. Seven and the Sun seems to balance it all together . . . offering style and substance like a reincarnated Sting or Bruce (not that they're gone)! Jersey Rocks Again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the Innocence Rocks!","review":"I think the music on \\"Back to the Innocence\\" really rocks!!! It's great, positive music! The songs are all very catchy and the lyrics have real honest meaning. It may not be the \\"new\\" sound, but what is nowadays? Isn't just being good, good enough? In a time when music seems to be so angry and self-gratifing, its good to hear something with a positive vibe that can make you feel good for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had promise.....!","review":"Have to say some of the songs are catchy but come on?...\\"Bono\\" let's be real, Seven is more like \\"nsync\\" Some of the songs have promise but the production is lame, it is the same basic formula. When will American Lables grow a set and try something new rather then play it safe. The songs could have been a lot more. But the mindless masses will probably buy it because its all the Record companies give us and they are going to shove it down our ears. And they wonder why we download and don't buy. Please don't make the comparison with the likes of Bono or others. This is most certainly not orginal or groundbreaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CD EVER","review":"I first heard Seven and the Sun on an episode of Smallville, but when I began listening more and more to them, I fell inlove with their music. This CD is just the best CD EVER, and I can't help but listen to it over and over again. Not only do they have up tempo great AlternRock songs, but they have beautiful rock ballads like, \\"I Pray\\". It's probably the most beautiful rock ballad I've ever heard! Go get this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor and pass on this one...","review":"Has to be the most forced contribed [junk]I have heard in a long time. Lets take some early 90's pop and add some distorted guitar mixed with acoustic and call it new. I could go into detail on exactly why this [stinks] but it would take you a day and half to read it. If your really want it just download it, but don't waste the money unfortunatly I did because my girlfriend heard one of the songs on Passions and thought she liked it till she really listened to it. Basically a lame version of Matchbox Twenty or any other band like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, easy listening background jazz","review":"Very nice collection - could do without \\"It's Only A Paper Moon\\"... does not match the overall tone of the other selections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Piano","review":"If you like great piano and good jazz, this is the album for you.

I bought this for my daughter after she played with her friend's Calico Critters for a long time!I loved these when I was growing up-so, I was suprized in today's world of toys to find a personal favorite holding it's own. I have been repeatedly excited when she chooses these over her dolls. Plus, they are the perfect size to tag along in the car. When we travel, she pulls them out and plays with them in the airport.People mention the price. It can seem spendy especially when you look at other play sets like Polly Pockets. These are so much better-they are engaging and timeless. As for the money, the time playing with it far outweighs the price. I am happy with my purchase...but, more importantly, my daughter is happy with this set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So cute!","review":"My kids love calico critters! This is a great addition. The only problem is one of the bikes broke within the first day. I can slide the handlebars back onto the bike but it won't stay on.

She played w/ it once and the handle bars on both trikes broke off. She is not rough w/ her toys.

So, disappointed in the quality of these items."},{"rating":"1","title":"From the factory to the world... not France","review":"This would be a reminder to Amazon that they should state the country of origin for everything. I will not buy from the off-the-original-shore factories unless there is zero choice. No, I don't mean that I won't buy foreign... it means that I will not buy products from countries which do not care what it is they are producing... countries which have bargain priced workers... ready to do their best to make whatever they are asked to make. I want products that have heart. If it is a Chinese or Indian product that is part of the culture of that nation... then I am interested... but I do not want French stoneware made in Thailand or American furniture made in the People's Republic of China. As of today, here is what it says on the Amazon page featuring this product: \\"About Le Creuset...Since 1925, artisans have been crafting Le Creuset cookware in the French village of Fresnoy Le Grand.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Le Creuset made in Thailand!","review":"Ordered this item back in April as a Mothers Day gift for my wife as an addition to her Le Creuset set. The box was not opened until today (Mothers Day). My wife brought to my attention that the bar code label indicated it was made in Thailand and that it was \\"stoneware\\", not cast iron. At first we thought it might be a \\"knock off\\" since neither my wife or myself realized Le Creuset was made of anything but cast iron (I ordered it and am not a Le Creuset expert since the add on Amazon did say \\"stoneware\\"). So, after figuring out that the item was most likely a genuine Le Creuset product we felt better but will be wary of low prices for otherwise expensive products...to be honest I figured it was a clearance item was price to \\"move\\" and didn't take the cast iron vs. stoneware into account. The product is fine and my wife is happy since...it's the thought that counts but as I said, I'll pay closer attention to low prices in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"We got ours broken","review":"We had this in our wedding registry and we got it broken. It was very poorly packaged, just some thin cardboard between the dish itself and the lid.We got a certificate for the amount, and I would really like to order another one, but I am afraid it is going to come broken again. More, we have to pay again $30 for shipping and, who knows how it will come again.I cannot really rate the item, since I was not able to use it. If I get it next time I order it (and it seems like a great dish for a big party), I will rate it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BIG Casserole dish for potluck","review":"This is a good quality baking piece that will fill the oven. 5 1/3 quarts! It is a bit heavy but that just means that the item stays warm for a good long time, big lid holds in the heat. Easy to wash because of the ceramic, just sudsy soak. I plan to use it for cold dishes, like potato salad and such. Again, that lid will keep cool, covered and presentable. Great party dish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous look at real family life","review":"As a parent of four grown sons, I found this a very entertaining and accurate view of the 26 child rearing years I spent at home with my sons.

Now he is obsessed with them and has learned all about them and talks all the time about things like which dinosaurs were sauropods and which ones were therapods and where the Western Interior Sea was ... Yet, he LOVES this little book. He is an early reader, so I think he likes the fact that he can read the whole thing by himself. In addition, it is nice how Byron Barton drew the dinos with accurate details, for example the T-Rex id shown with only 2 fingers. It is VERY simple, but it is likely going to keep your kids entertained over the course of many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son's favorite!","review":"This has been my son's favorite book since he was about 8 months old. I was suprised how well he took to it as such an early age. He is now almost 14 months and still can't get enough of it. It is the one book he will look around for and really insist on having at his high chair during meal times. Agree completely with the other reviewers who mentioned how fun it was to make the dinosaur noises and that the \\"long sharp claws, long sharp teeth\\" part is especially fascinating for the child. Even when i don't have the book handy, just by saying the opening lines...a long time ago...there were DINOSAURS -- brings a delighted smile to his face every time.He also enjoys \\"My Car\\" by the same author although that book is not as simple (i.e., talks about car needing oil change, obeying traffic laws, etc.)."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic introductory book about dinosaurs","review":"I had a smaller hard cover version of this book and lost it. Just as well because this larger paper back version will be better to read to my preschool class. This is a good introductory book to present to young children and particularly those with special needs as the text and illustrations are extremely clear and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"All I can say about this book is \\"Bo-o-oring! After wonderful and lavishly illustrated dinosaur books of Yollen, this one (we took it in a library) is very disappointing. My daughter didn't like it, and neither did I. Maybe it's appealing to very young toddlers that still learn their colors, but it's sort of blah for my 22-month old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as stated","review":"This product works as stated. It is on the small side, had to full compress it to make it fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORKS AS ADVERTISED","review":"This is a good product, it fits well and is easy to install. Also it keeps odor from backing up thru the trap so you don't have to worry about dry trap issues anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant","review":"Sorry but this book was difficult to finish reading. My son would laugh and say...\\"is it almost over...let me guess, Houdini escapes..\\". We felt that the plot was redundant. On a positive note, the book is good for expanding your vocabulary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely!","review":"I had read the description and thought it sounded interesting; upon reading it I am transported into a wonderful place of serene adoration of this book. I love to dabble in naturalism and I love the depiction of the mysteries which modern science has now cleared up, but were once romantic, magical questions (such as where meteors come from). I love the characters and I mourn when the stories end. It's a quick, delightful read that will lead me to more Angela Barrett books for certain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rating: Very Good/ Excellent","review":"The book I ordered arrived on schedule, was well packaged, and exactly what I wanted. Thank you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful and unforgettable story!","review":"I read this one years ago and am very glad it has been reissued to be enjoyed by those of us into gay or M/M romance. The writer has created a very credible and applealing character in Allen. His childhood is unique. His growth as a family man is touchingly written as he builds a warm family with the handsome Jeremy and his sons. Underlying the story is the poignant lingering sadness as the story takes place during the Aids epidemic and Allen has Aids and his time with his family is limited. The writer does not dwell on the inevitable tragic ending but gives us comfort and hope in his quality writing. Yet like one of the reviewers commented we all die. This means how one lives is all that really matters, which is all beautifully conveyed in this luminous and moving story. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"bestest!","review":"This is the best micro popcorn ever.

I definitely recommend Thirty-Nine Steps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw the play, NEED TO READ!","review":"I saw the play with my school, that wanted to make me read the book SOOOOO MUCH!! Glad its free! Great Book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining","review":"I got this free ebook on my Kindle because the reviews sounded good and I had seen Hitchcock's \\"The 39 Steps\\" movie. I've just checked the movie out again from the library as I haven't seen it in awhile & I'd like to watch it again after having read this book, which it was adapted from. The book is quite a bit different from the movie, although the main character has the same name, Richard Hannay. The movie has a romance as well (which I like) while the book is simply pure adventure. The basic basic plot is the same pretty much with the hero on the run from both the bad guys and the police and trying to figure out what the spies are up to, with dire national consequences looming. But they changed things around quite a bit when the book was adapted into the movie. They're both good (not usually true; I normally find the book much better than the movie). A good entertaining read; good clean adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"39 steps","review":"The book arrived on time and in good shape.

Bring on the next ones! Woo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously implausible and contrived","review":"The problem with this tome is that it stretched credulity to such an extent that it becamea laughing matter. Contrivances like this are most often encountered in TV crimeshows and episodes of Perry Mason, where the solution of the murder must be foundwithin severe time constraints. Ironically enough, this book employs preposterousand implausible events as the motive for the hero's actions. I simply couldn't take thestory seriously. Heaven forbid that any naive reader might actually think that the storywere based on fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my kind of book","review":"The hero of this novel expresses anti-Semitic views. Since this was offensive to me, I stopped listening to the CD after the first 20 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"An easy read, especially good for children and (maybe) young adults","review":"This is a classical thriller that has influenced a great many authors. It makes for an easy read. The story follows a well-to-do fellow who's involved in a matter of international importance & secrecy. Most of the novel deals with the adventures of how he escapes from the \\"bad\\" guys and the police. Each chapter describes one such event, each being a bit more difficult to swallow than the preceding tale. As I read the story I remembered all those books I used to read as a teenager. I think this would be a reasonable book for this group, but I felt the novel did not have anything in it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big subterranean movement","review":"This adventure novel is not really what I was expecting. I've seen the Hitchcock version of \\"The 39 Steps\\" and have really never understood what all the fuss was about, since I found it both implausible and uninteresting. The book is probably just as implausible but is much more absorbing. My favorite thing about the book is the main character, Richard Hannay, and how ready for adventure he is after the boredom of civilized life. Hannay is resourceful and clever, but always has a sense of humor about himself and his mistakes. Unlike the movie, there is no beautiful blonde accompanying Richard on his adventures, and unlike the movie, the thirty-nine steps are just what they sound like. The book is a portrait of England at a time when Europe was teetering on the brink of World War I and German spies were thought to be everywhere. That backdrop gives the mystery depth and makes for an involving, entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first \\"wrong man\\" thriller.","review":"I've loved this romp since childhood. Richard Hannay back in London from the Colonies and bored to death. Then Mr. Skudder gets skewered to the floor of his Portland Place flat with a bread knife and the chase is on. Through the Scottish highlands, trains, country inns, the moors - and an appearance of the first spy plane. This is pre- James Bond when a fellow could work miracles with just a pen knife.It's interesting to note how Hitchcock varied from this orginal (mostly to sex up this 'Boys Own' yarn). This a pre World War One hero, when men were men who camped out, fought with their fists and did their best for God and Country. There's nothing the matter with that or this fast paced production. Don Wardell KWXY Radio, Palm Springs, California."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't stop here","review":"Buchan's famous proto-thriller, a suspenseful foot-to-the-metal flight through pre-WW1 Scotland, is handled deftly and masterfully throughout. It is neither well-thought-out nor intricately plotted, but a good part of the fun comes from seeing Buchan inventing as he goes along with incredible ease and skill. Unlike his more serious works, it's concise and tautly-constructed, but it also lacks the character development and philosophical insights of his other books. An excellent place to start reading Buchan, but a bad place to stop! If you read this book, make sure you read the sequels: they keep getting better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book that became an even greater film!","review":"A great espionage thriller, involving danger, murder, and the future of England, set just before World War I.

Atwell's reading and writing workshops are a wonderful way to get students enthusiastic about learning to read and write because it enables them to set up their own expectations and allows them to take ownership of what they're doing day-to-day.A good resource to have if you're having trouble getting students engaged in their own learning but it does not stand on its own.

The legendary Brian May sound and muli-layered harmonies are ued to brilliant effect throughout an equally brilliant album. My favourite tracks are 'Too Much Love Will Kill You' and 'Driven By You', although I prefer the Freddy Mercury version of 'TMLWKY'. What made me want to listen to this album was the sound of Brian May's guitar. While he may not be the greatest rock guitarist this world has ever seen, I think the sound of his guitar and the way he uses it is the best. If you are also a fan of Brian May's guitar's playing, then I would definitely recommend that you buy this album. I would give this album five stars, but I just feel that on some of the tracks BM's voice isn't powerful enough and he needs Freddy's voice to strengthen them. However, this is still a brilliant, underrated album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst record ever made ?!?!","review":"I'm a Queen fan, but I can't find words to describe how poor this record is.

I also couldn't help but notice that all the positive reviews so far are from New York, coincidentally where the publisher is located. Hmmm, could it be we have another mystery?This book has so much purple prose you would almost mistake it for an Anne Rice novel instead of a \\"scholarly\\" historical tome.

It does, indeed, appear that those who gave it 5 stars must have been reading an entirely different book! I have read extensively about English history, especially this particular time period, and am very familiar with most of the \\"characters\\". Nevertheless, while attempting to read this book, it was hard to remember WHO it was supposed to be about. The book seemed a total mish-mash to me, and extremely hard to follow. The author seemed to go off on way too many convoluted tangents. As much as I wanted to like this book - due to the supposed subject matter - I found that I just didn't have the stamina to finish it!

I have no problem with difficult (good) writing, or with keeping track of all the Richards, Henrys, Edwards and the like, which is a necessary part of any study of English political history, but an author who makes her readers work as hard as Ms. Wroe would have us toil -- with negligible reward -- is doing those readers no favors. I'm not really sure what editors do, but this one needed one, badly, and didn't get it. To be fair, I did like one thing about the book: the appendix contains a very good Family Tree of the Houses of York and Lancaster. Royal family trees are cool, but not for $35 (plus tax).

It is mostly little details about various events in the lives of the two sisters, with no actual point or meaning. There is in fact very little about weight loss, weight loss surgery, or the changes that took place in the girl's life after she had the surgery. Most of the book is dedicated to endless details about parties that the sisters held and shopping trips they took. There is also a one-and-a-half page quote from Alice in Wonderland. There are far too many trivial details and far too little actual interesting content regarding what Allison went through.What's more, this book isn't even in the first person. It's by the SISTER of someone who had weight loss surgery, so really has no idea what the experience is like. When I saw the book I bought it, curious as to how a story of human tragedy and triumph can be interesting when told from the point of view of someone who wasn't even there. Now I know: it can't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going for the masterpiece jugular","review":"This is the greatest Suede album, if only for ambition alone. It is obvious that Brett Anderson and Bernard Butler, as disparate as they reportedly were around the time of writing and recording, were going for the jugular on this album, striving for a masterpiece. The opening 4 songs, capped by the amazing \\"Wild Ones\\", start Suede on the road to greatness, but the rest of the album is largely uneven. For every song as good as \\"The New Generation\\", there is a near-miss like \\"The Two of Us\\". Still, this album is Suede's finest, a compelling testament to the fruitfulness of the now-defunct Anderson/Butler songwriting partnership."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dog Man's Star","review":"A Follow up to their sucesful and critical aclaim self titled debut is a fantastic album. A Dog Man's Star take a bit new direction but still has the unique vocal styles of Brett Anderson and the fantastic guitar playing of Bernard Butler. The songwriting is a lot better and now they are more focused on what they're doing. On this album there are quite a few gems on it and I Have to recomend any music fan to get this album. it is raw,beautiful,soulful yet dark and mysterious. Suede managed to create another masterpiece with A Dog Man Star which becomes their most mature and ambitios work to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest albums to grace the planet","review":"ill keep it short-the best album i own,and have everheard,beautiful music-when they were at there absolute peak in my opinion,and completely untouchable,and although bernard butler left before the completed album-its plain to see that when working together brett and bernard fed off each other just beautifully,not forgetting simon and"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it going to turn into a lost classic?","review":"When this album came out, everyone seemed to rave about it, however, now no one talks about it, why?

The music is very melodic with a collection of some of the most beautiful tunes I have ever encountered: Heroine, The Wild Ones, Black or Blue, The Power, Still Life and literally every song in this album is a melodic masterpiece. This is music for lovers. It is somewhat \\"Bowiesque\\" and very romantic but there is nothing corny or iffy about it as the word \\"romantic\\" often connotes. This is a must listen for every music lover. A true masterpiece. My all time favorite that I hold very close to my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely A Masterpiece - the PATHOS of a decade","review":"It's not a matter of complete originality, and its not a matter of self critic, it is a MASTERPIECE for its absolute and infinite pretense, grandiosity and uncompromising pathos, which reflects through the music, lyrics & production. Butler(lead guitar & co writer) is the mind behind the whole creation (It was proved by Suede later albums). However, without Anderson (front man and co-writer) this album would not have become what he is.

There are 50 lessons with over 40 exercises, and in the next edition there could be more added.There was also an lab manual included with 19 more labs consisting of over 55 exercises, most of which seemed right on the objective target. I also like the cd included with 120 day evaluation of Windows 2000 Server.The other cd has the e-book, several flash demos about the only thing missing is some sort of practice exams software, which can also be added to the next edition.

If I had a choice of listening to Mozart or Jeff the Drunk it would be no contest...Jeff the Drunk wins hands down. I recommend this album, especially if you are trying to impress a lady. If the person you are with wants to listen to more or turn it up, then you know this person is a keeper for life.Buy this masterpiece, it will be the best album you've ever bought and one you can impress your' friends with.

My husband, after searching every local jewelry retailer he could think of and not being successful, found this ring online. This is the ring he picked out for me and it's perfect. He was really relieved when it arrived, it looked exactly like it does in the picture. I get compliments on it all the time. It's held up really well, including the finish, and I'm not gentle with jewelry. The only one compliant I have is that I had to get the prongs tightened shortly after I got it, but apparently that is a very common with rings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bits burn out far too quickly","review":"I've done maybe four or five light sessions with this iron, maybe 8 to 10 hours total.I've already changed the bit once, and looks like I'll need another one soon.I used to work in the trade, I had my iron on all day, and I expected a 25 or 30 watt iron to need its bit changed maybe every few months.I know it is called a Home Project Iron, but that's exactly what I'm using it for. I bought Weller expecting better quality than this.Oh yes, I've just searched Amazon, and the Internet, and the bits (where available) plus shipping are nearly as dear as the iron.

Starting in chapter 3 there are 2 key terms Dose equivalent and Equivalent dose you look up the definition for dose equivalent and after reading and defining the term it says, dose equivalent is now called equivalent dose.

After I finish reading a book about eating recommendations I try to find one similar to it so that I can figure out which points I agree with and which ones I can live with.

If it were not for Dover Publications, I would not have this text in my library, nor would I be able to afford it. Please visit Dover Publications website to view all the other fine mathematics texts which they offer at bargain prices.

WASTE OF MONEY !"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Slag-Fest of Words","review":"After reading Rowling's Harry Potter and Chabon's Cavalier and Clay, I eagerly awaited Summerland. Boy, was I disappointed. This overlong, show-offy and tension-free barge of a book was just, plain dull. Wanting to write a children's book and actually doing it well are two vastly different things.This is the literary equivalent of Bill Buckner's play at first base in the sixth game of the '86 World Series. I hope Chabon learns from his error and goes back to writing for adults, which he does fabulously well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summerland--Not Recommended","review":"First of all, I've never read any other books of Chabon's, but I am an avid reader so I thought I'd try my hand at a little critiquing. This book was recommended to me by many people, so I began to read it. The plot completely lacked to ensnare me, and I had to force myself to read the book. The characters are poorly developed, and the whole fantasy world comes on way too fast. New fairy type characters are quickly introduced, and similar to the main character, they are poorly developed. The plot idea is overall a good one, but Chabon fails to bring together the plot and the characters in an interesting and detailed way. I normally like to give books up to 100 pages to warm up and get me into the plot. I read about 150-200 pages in Summerland, and let me tell you, it really doesn't get any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The magic of baseball","review":"Ethan Felds is the worst player on his baseball team, and everyone knows it. In spite of this, he finds himself drawn into a struggle to save the universe, travelling in an alternate universe where all stories are true, and baseball is a metaphor for life. Together with a rag-tag team of misfits, he must find his way along the branches of this other world to the well that feeds the tree of the universe, to save his father and prevent the poisoning of the tree that supports the universe.This is a wonderfully quirky tale about an awkward boy who discovers that he is stronger than he would have believed, and about the importance of stories in giving meaning to life. The true magic is the power of stories to fuel our imaginations, and fill us with wonder. Just remember, keep your eyes open!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantasy but not FANTASY","review":"To me, this book was a clever mix of fantasy with reality. Even though it is clearly a work of fantasy, there is an underlying current of reality that separates from a bit from the usual fantasy genre. This is coming from a lover of pure fantasy books. I definitely enjoyed this book and believe it would be appreciated by lovers of fantasy and adventurous, imaginative fiction alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Book","review":"Summerland by Michael Chabon was a very good book. It had great elements of fantasy and reality coming together. Also there is a moving part in the book with Ethan feelings about his mother who had dies before the book begins. Chabon has an amazing feel for all the fantasy that goes on in the book. If these types of characters were real (like giants, ferishers and everyone else) Chabon would be describing them perfectly. The great thing about Summerland is that the elements of reality are perfect. With baseball season and Ethan's friends tie in with the fantasy part. Having the tough, but smart Jennifer T. and brainniac Thor it helps the flow of the book. It is a great story and a shocking outcome that I won't reveal. Hope you enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Pulitzer to Pathetic","review":"Yes, I loved Kavalier and Clay, and yes, I looked forward to Summerland with an almost unbearable enthusiasm. Had I known that this alleged \\"children's book\\" would turn out to be a freely cannibalized mishmash of heterogenous folklore cobbled together in a thinly-veiled attempt to cash in on America's sudden thirst for feel-good tripe, I would have saved myself the 23 bucks and re-read The Hobbit.I suppose I can understand an author needing to take a break from his craft in order to cash in on an easy opportunity, but shouldn't there be a warning label somewhere to alert serious readers about impending literary vaccuums?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read","review":"This is nothing groundbreaking, but it is a good, fun read. Chabon weaves together Norse mythology, Native American myth, and elements from the fiction of C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien to make an interesting story centered around summer and baseball. Definitely recommended for those who like the aforementioned authors. I feel like if C.S. Lewis were American and loved baseball he would have written this exact story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chabon is a must read!","review":"This is my second novel by Michael Chabon. The first was \\"The Amazing Adventures of Cavalier and Clay\\" and I enjoyed that one so much I decided to pick up this one. It is marked as a \\"childrens\\" book but I think it will appeal to the child in all of us. This amazing tale includes creatures of all shapes and sizes and a harrowing tale of love that never ends. You MUST MUST MUST read this book. You will be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable Book","review":"Quite simply this is a very enjoyable book. Its structure is a well woven blend of ancient and modern myths and legends, primarily fairies and baseball; that is, the summer country and the good ole summertime. The book also features everyone's favorite trickster: Coyote.The adventure is well written and believable regardless of its unbelievable content. The story line is fast paced and kept me reading. I cared about the characters good and bad. The conclusion is satisfying. All in all the book has genuine literary content and intriguing ideas. It is worth reading more than once.Christine and Ethan Rose are the authors of the new fantasy seriesRowan of the Wood"},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio","review":"I \\"read\\" the audio version of \\"Summerland\\" narrated by the author, and found it fascinating. The characters come alive as the author creates voices and personalities. The storyline unfolds with surprising twists in the plot. A truly enjoyable tale told by an excellent storyteller."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK to stop in the middle of this one!","review":"I turned to these customer reviews in the middle (well, the first quarter, to be honest) just to make sure I wasn't totally missing something. This is such a disappointment! I really enjoyed Chabon's Kavalier & Klay, but even that took forever to plod through because of his unfortunate need to populate his worlds with almost excruciating detail. But in Summerland, I just find this over-detailing just makes the whole thing grind to a halt. I read, and enjoy, books for younger readers, too, so I wasn't turned off by that. I'm a baseball nut, too, especially the philosophy of the game and its history, but even all these tantalizing details don't bring this story to life. There are many moments when the writing itself is wonderful, but if this book hadn't been written by Chabon, I don't think it would have raised a buzz at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Being juvenile doesn't mean its good for kids","review":"I don't understand what makes Mr. Chabon think that he is qualified to write for kids. Is it the fantasy element? All kids should read fantasy now? The sentence structure in this book is not at all appropriate for the supposed age range, and a lot of the themes, while light, are not really aimed at kids per se. Still, its content is not really objectionable. As a teacher, I do not like to see writers jumping on the Harry Potter bandwagon just because they can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summer-dud by Michael Chabon","review":"I usually don't write reviews, but after reading Summerland by Michael Chabon, I have to let one go. This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read. And I've read alot of 'em. This Harry Potter wanna' be reads more like a cross between a poorly written Steven King and a Douglas Adams novel that doesn't make any sense at all. Although, the plot is quite simple, Chabon complicates our journey through Summerland by confusing us with character, objects and places that are given names so complicated, or the reverse, so simplistic, that they become ridiculous and confusing. As Chabon got caught up more and more into the creation of this ridiculously confusing world the reader becomes less and less interested in finishing the novel. I forced myself to finish it, just to see if it got any better; it didn't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"eh...","review":"I just might not be a Chabon-type reader, but I thought the book was pretty boring. And I usually finish what I start. I stopped reading this around the middle. Maybe I just didn't like reading about an 11 year old boy trying to stop armaggedon. It just wasn't my type of fantasy, that's all. You can read it (or start reading it) for yourself and see how you like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO BAD!!!","review":"Summerland was probably the worst book that I have read in a LONG time. It's confusing, the story is TERRIBLE, and the characters change all the time. Don't waste your time reading this awful book. You'll regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Author Gone Bad","review":"As the other reviewers mention, this book is over written. Perhaps there is a marvelous story that Chabon is trying to tell us in Summerland, but I was hard pressed to find it. Telling the tale of a mystical island in the Northwest, this book fails to integrate a sports story, fantasy/tall tale of the Holes variety, with that of a family drama. There is superior work in each genre and the interested young reader should turn their attention to the superior and more accessible books found with-in those genres. The ambitious young adult reader should read Chabon's adult literature, much of which is truly excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotyped, out of context, and simplified...","review":"Chabon's portrayal of Native American \\"little people\\" truly defies belief. First, he took legends from at least ten sources and mixed them up. Then he simplifies them and gives them downright stereotyped roles.This is one of the most disturbing pieces of European colonialism of Native American ideas that I have read in years. If you liked this book, but wanted portrayals of Native American \\"fairies\\" that resemble realistic, I highly suggest you read the books of Canadian author Charles de Lint. While most of his stories are meant for adults, many of his short stories are understandable to children if you wish to spend a little time explaining these things to them, and several of his published books are collections of short stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't have to love baseball.","review":"other reviewers have said that if you don't love baseball, then you won't enjoy Sumerland. that is just not true. At least, it's not true in my case. No offense meant to baseball lovers, but I happen to think that baseball is a complete waste of time: in other words, it's BORING! but i still absolutely LOVED Sumerland. it was AWESOME!note: i really don't appreciate it that i have to use a special form to review this book jsut because of my age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy adventure AND baseball? Now you're talking!","review":"I thought the book was wonderful. It was certainly a change of pace for Michael Chabon, and while I wouldn't say it rates up there with Tolkein or C.S. Lewis, it was a fantasy adventure that certainly rates higher than the Potter novels (which I really enjoyed!) There is one potential problem with the book. My 10 year old son read the book and liked it, but after hearing me read chapters aloud to my 7 year old son before bed, he said that he thought he missed a lot of detail. \\"Too many characters for a kid to keep track of\\", he was his comment. But, he had the same comment reading Tolkein, so it's no indictment of the book, obviously. Maybe the best bet is to read it to your kids, or discuss the book with your kid as he reads it. The beauty of the book is in the richness of the folklore and the development of the characters, so it is worth discussion. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"a long road to nowhere","review":"I feel dumb. I didn't know it was a book for kids. I read Summerland and kept waiting for it to get better. It never really did. Contrived, laborious, a time waster that I should have quit -- as my friend did after 30 pages -- but read to the bitter end. I read the Mysteries of Pittsburgh a few years back and enjoyed it, and picked up this book after hearing glowing reviews of The Wonderboys. And I enjoyed that \\"little\\" movie they made of Wonderboys. And while the actual language of Summerland was at times beautiful, for 500 pages it was too long and an average story. I'm a lover of baseball, and even that seemed contrived. I feel dumb because I don't get that much reading time, and I feel I wasted valuable hours on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUMMERLAND","review":"I'm almost through reading this wonderful novel to my 9 year old. He cannot get enough and neither can I of this wonderful mix of fantasy, adventure and folklore. Narnia, Middle Earth, Hogworts and Wind In the willows all mixed together.Michael Chabon has written a classic. Looking forward to discovering his other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"trite","review":"trite, reminds me of highschool art class full of earnest drawings attempting to tackle the great subjects- religion, peace, love by using a crucifix, a peace sign, and a heart all in the same picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summer-Bore","review":"I began this book with such high hopes since I had so thoroughly enjoy Kavalier & Clay. In the end, I was just bored with the book. There were too many characters to keep track of and I felt that what was told in 500 pages could have been told even better in half that space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really for kids","review":"I don't see that any kids have weighed in with positive reviews, and I'm not surprised. Long-winded doesn't begin to describe this book. While there's some strong prose, there are also so many elements thrown in and then abandoned, you just have to wonder if Chabon had an editor. He introduces new creatures, languages, and places--then never gets back to them. The depiction of minorities is disturbing. A black \\"bigfoot\\" woman with a good singing voice who's in a cage, until 3 white kids rescue her. A Latino ballplayer just lying around until the same kids get him moving. Hmmm... And a lot of Native American folklore taken out of context. But, overall, the main problem is that the writing is too sluggish for kids, who don't keep reading a book just because the author's famous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, but a little too male oriented","review":"Summerland was a pretty good book, but its baseball themes made it a little too male-oriented for me. If your a male baseball fan, this is the book for you. If you are looking for strong female and male characters in a fantasy that everyone can relate to, you might want to check out books like King Fortis the Brave or the Chronicles of Narnia instead of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing coming from Mr. Chabon","review":"Michael Chabon is my favorite author, and The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay is my favorite novel, so I tackled Summerland with much anticipation. Unfortunately, it does not live up to Chabon's previous works. The novel is horribly paced and the American mythologies, the use of which which others have lauded, were integrated poorly. Save on rare occassions, Summerland fails to grasp the magic of such children's novels as The Wizard of Oz and Harry Potter. As an adult novel, it is a near-complete failure. I can't help but think that this novel was written before any of Chabon's previously published work and could be published only now that its author is famous. Still this book was somewhat enjoyable, although I would only reccomend it to a Chabon completist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major league disappointment","review":"My eight year old daughter and I approached this book with such eagerness, as we both love baseball and magic. On page 115 we made the mutual decision to give up. Michael Chabon is a talented writer for adults but he has no clue how to structure a story for young minds. Characters are fuzzy, the plot is hard to follow, and there's a lot of overwriting. (We kept saying, \\"Who is he again? Who are the bad guys again? What do they want?\\" and paging back to find out. By page 115 we still weren't clear, and ceased to care.) The more I read other writers of fiction for young people, the more I appreciate J.K Rowling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chabon for the ages","review":"Michael Chabon brings his marvellous gifts to the age 10 and up market. The results enchanted both my 10 year old son and his 40-something dad. He mixes appealing well-known ingredients -- baseball, Indian lore, and otherworldly fantasy -- and comes up with a truly original and riveting story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do yourself a favor - listen to the audiobook","review":"If ever there was a book made for the audiobook format it is this one.It is read by the author, so you get a real sense of how it sounded in his head as he was writing it.There is such a large cast of characters and he does a wonderful job of giving each their own distinctive 'voice'.With most audiobooks (and I am completely addicted to audiobooks) I am pretty neutral about the reader and some readers kind of irk me and do take away from the story a tiny bit.I feel that Summerland is exponentially enhanced by listening to Michael Chabon read it. There is no way on earth I'd have ever been able to give the characters the depth he does with his reading. This is one of the few books I recommend with the disclaimer (even to those who aren't huge fans of audiobooks) that to truely appreciate it you MUST listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for a Senior Citizen","review":"What do you get for a father-in-law who is 90 years old.

It had been a long while since I read the play and I had forgotten just how dryly funny it was. The story of a family of warm loving murderers and their nephews. One perfectly normal, the other looking much like Boris Karlof and with the personality that would fit many of his movies. In fact, when the play was produced on stage in New York it was Boris Karlof who played the part.The product itself is a typical acting script, but if you sit down to read it there are a lot more laughs that even the movie had. But better than reading it, will be seeing it come to life once again on stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arsenic and Old Lace","review":"This is an enduring classic comedy that has been staged with actors of all ages including those in high schools, community theaters and professional productions. The script contains jokes based on the status of \\"the theater\\" at the time (common discussions among critics at that time parallel the line in a Simon and Garfunkle song, \\"is the theater really dead?\\") The story line is built on a wonderful array of eccentric characters. A great deal of the comedy is based on dramatic irony, where the audience knows something that some or all of the actors on stage do not. Great to stage and fun to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"unpredictable, refreshing,and hilarious","review":"Arsenic and Old Lace is a very original comedy. Very light hearted and funny. The characters each have their own quirks and idosyncrasies which makes each one of them enjoyable to follow through the unpredictable storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Publisher should be ashamed!","review":"The play itself is brilliant--but beware!This is advertised as an acting edition; any actor who actually gets through a week of rehearsal with it intact is a magician.It is cheaply zeroxed, on flimsy paper; in many places the type is only partly legible.Apparently at one time it was cheaply typed too, because several lines are omitted from the original, creating confusion in some spots. In one case, an actor's lines are jammed up against the previous speaker's dialogue.The \\"perfect\\" binding fell apart in several of these with only minor handling.I bought these for a reading group at a public library and the participant's average age is 70, so it's not a case of teenagers throwing them around & jamming them in their back packs.DPS should be ashamed of this shoddy product!If Dover can create acting editions of Shakespeare & Shaw--which really do hold up--for less than $5, DPS should either do the same or charge a lot less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality binding and print","review":"While the play is very good and this edition list all the blocking, set design, and props, the quality of the page copy is poor and the binding is flimsy and falls apart after a month of rehearsals.

I am returning this Bible today because the type-size is actually 11.5 - too small to read even in the best of light if you have vision/reading issues. The type size is clearly indicated on the back of the cardboard cover. Too bad it is not included in the product description. I have since visited a book store and learned that GIANT print can be anything from 11 pt to 18 pt type, not the 14 pt I already own. Very disappointed in this purchase.

I felt like the main character, Cooper, was an irritating teenager at best, while our hero, Alec, was brash and uninteresting, not to mention, a terrible cop. The story was utterly ridiculous with Cooper walking around with a magnet on her head, using her ESP, and Alec trying to get away from the crazy woman. I imagine at some point, after Cooper gets crazy drunk from alcohol and pain pills and annoys everyone, that she and Alec get together to solve some crime.

I've read many books based on the story, some good, and some bad. This author just doesn't pull it off. I didn't care about the characters. I wanted to like them, but couldn't. When I found out almost half way through that I was reading a novel within the novel, it was a blow to the way I viewed the characters. It was a twist I didn't need. Character and story development would have been a far better tactic in writing this novel. I mention story development, because none of the nuance one finds in Jane Austen was present in this book. The author did invert the genders of the characters, and that could have been interesting if she could have pulled it off. Vanity and Vexation is light, fluffy, and not good enough to recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" Instead","review":"While Kate Fenton has written a little after dinner mint of a book, she is no Jane Austen. She is not even Austen Powers, for that matter. Drawing her plot from the gentle, delightful comedy \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" Fenton tries, in vain, to reset the book in modern-day Yorkshire. She has taken on a task beyond her skills, and should not be congratulated for trying.

In my opinion he made the people in the book sound to over acted. He read the book like he was talking to someone...and the singing, well let's just say I'm glad he a writer.

The book started out okay, but the further I got into the story the more unreal it became. I was not convinced that John \\"Loverboy\\" Williams was as talented as the book let on. The book had a lot of potential, but the song lyrics and music beats ruined the book by making it more of a comedy than a serious work of fiction. The \\"telling\\" of the story rather than the use of description made the story totally ineffective. The ending, rather than leaving me in tears, left me laughing for the past week.

The book Just Say No, and the accompanying CD which features Tyree \\"singing\\" are just plain embarassing. I agree with the other reviewer that said the characters were predictable, including John \\"Loverboy\\" Williams. It's like Tyree has a formula that he must use for all of his books. I don't recommend this book, and I sometimes wonder if the positive reviews for his books are written by Tyree under different names, or by blind people without access to Braille. Pick up a serious piece of African American fiction instead of this tripe. Oh, and if you don't believe me, read this sentence. It begins the book and almost made me stop reading right there. Notice the abundance of prepositions.\\"I stopped daydreaming about the past and looked out of my cab window at a mental hospital of red brick and gray cement that was out in the middle of nowhere within the state of Maryland.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What In The World!!!","review":"What in the world was Omar thinking? This was the worst book I read in a long time. It took me weeks to read, when it usually only take a me a couple days. I had no desire to pick it up and finish it. I was an Omar fan (key word was) until I read this. Did he have a deadline to meet or what? This story is hard to follow especally with the song lyrcs. Pleeeese Omar, I know you can do better than this. I think you have lost your touch. You might have a shot in the music buisness. Leave the novel writing to the pro's."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Love","review":"See when I started to truly read about a year and a half ago this is the first book I read, now I'm up to 140 books so far and I wont stop until I'm blind. So \\"Just Say No\\" has a major influence of me in my reading for that I read all of Omar Tyree books. Just say no isn't your ordinary book, it's real it deal with a **Star** by the name of John who lets the \\"FAME\\" take complete control of his life and leads him into a more and power addiction the \\"Selfish-Ego\\". An addiction, which becomes a great defeat in his life. I love every part of it and strongly suggest it to anyone who loves to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasted my time on this one","review":"After having read A Do Right Man and For the Love of Money, I was not impressed with Tyree's writing style (though I've managed to keep A Do Right Man on my bookshelf). The only reason I dared to read Just Say No was because it came highly recommended by a friend. While I did finish the book, I was thoroughly disappointed. The story moved incredibly slow and at times seemed to be going nowhere. The author doesn't trust his readers to 'connect the dots' of what he's trying to say, so he tends to explain every little thing. It gets annoying to say the least. The song lyrics and \\"shoo-bee-doo-ooh-aahs\\" were too much. I wondered if the story should've been a musical instead of a novel. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they were interested in music and wanted to read a flat novel about two guys in the business."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to sum up trash with three words","review":"Why is this man so popular? Why do people convince themselves that Omar Tyree can actually write? It's a little harsh to say he can't write at all when this is the only attempt I ever made at reading his work, but come on! I may not be a writer myself but I am a reader and I know trash when I see it. This book went absolutely nowhere. I only made it past the halfway point because my friend assured me it would be worth it to see how the story ended. The joke was on her because I got rid of the book and still found out the ending from a reliable source. Allow me to say I'm glad I didn't waste anymore of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Omar Tyree's best","review":"I think that Omar Tyree hit it out of the ballpark again with this book. He's other books such as Flyy girl and Single mom were great and so was this one. I was a little skeptic to read another Omar Tyree book after he dissapointed me with For the Love of Money, but Just say no! was great. Tyree really got into the world of the music business. This book really makes you think that maybe the world of music is just like this book. I do think that Flyy Girl was better than this book, so if you have to choose one, get Flyy Girl. I do think this book had some of it's downs, but not too many. I think this was a good story because this was original, you don't see many stories about a drug/sex addict R&b singer. All in All this was a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivating","review":"I love this book.... read it a few years ago but didn't get 2 finish it, so i bought it & glad that i did. i am an inspiring music artist and just loved this book & found it very useful and true when it comes to the music business. love the context of the story and is one of my fav. books from Omar Tyree. i give this book 5/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Seller","review":"The book was in the exact condition described and arrived in just a few days. Great service."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"I was able to read this book within a week, which I was able to pull through with a busy schedule. I loved some of the spiritual themes of the book, but the ending was so tragic. Also, the in depth view of the music industry was also interesting as well. I agreed with the fact R&B music today was not like it was today; now singers these days just bring good hooks to rap songs. Music has been desensitized to materalize. Great job, Omar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Experiencing","review":"Just Say No, was a very interesting read. I knew the content I was dealing, because of the title. The read gave an insight on what goes on in the music industry. Omar done a lot of research to get the facts of the music industry, by him being a writer not a musician. It have facts on what entertainers have to go through along with their success. It also have sight on how real friendship should be along the the ups and downs. This read really touched me especially at the end and it was not predictable, I even shedded a few tears. I would suggest all readers to read this book. Keep up the good work Omar. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Say No to Reading This!","review":"What I thought started out to be a pretty good read, turned into pure torture after the first chapter as I struggled for more than three weeks to finish this book. For a person that usually finishes a book in a 24 hr. time frame, that's an eternity!! I suggest that next time you leave out writing lyrics and beats. Especially over and over. Most readers are more interested in the story. Thank God I read a copy from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok","review":"Darin and John are two best friends who have dreams of making it big one day.

I throught the storyline was interesting gives you a look into a singer's lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It took me three weeks to read this book, for it was just not interesting. The parts in the book where they wrote the lyrics to the songs with that riffs and everything was just too distracting. The ending was good though, I almost cried. But I almost cried while reading the book because it took too long to get to the point. In the space of reading this book, I sat and read three other books, and this one was read as a last resort when I had nothing else to read. It may be interesting to people that are into that stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"When I got this book I didn't expect it to be as long as it was, but I still finished it in one weekend. The characters were well-developed and the author did a great job of making things seem real. The story flowed well, and I really felt for the characters. I haven't read this author's other work, but I want to now. If you enjoy music, this book will give you a lot of insight on how things might be for your favorite artist. This book is culturally sound, not dumbed down for the mainstream, and even more respectable for that reason!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes i too wasted 25 dollars","review":"Omar tyree what happen to you. i'm not just referring to \\" just say no\\" and lord help me \\" for the love of money\\" but to every book after \\" A do right man\\" apparentyly some were along the line you have lost your creativity. Your books have become unrealistic. which would be fine if you were writing science fiction. not black contemporary. and almost unbearable to read. not saying that in all black books you have to struggle but your characters lack so much substance. books are not name brand clothing and it just seems that your pushing out ruff drafts and slapping you name on the cover expecting people to buy them. you know that you don't measure up to other authors but your books sold because of the sincerity and the matching of the times as battle zone and capital city did of cource flyygirl. i think maybe you need a break and go live a little before you write another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"same old thing","review":"The story is slick. You know what the characters will do before you turn the next page. Tyree never delves too deeply into why Loverboy Williams does the things that he does. The friendship between the two men is nicely done. For Tyree fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful...","review":"That's it Omar! I can't do it anymore! I bought Fly Girl way back and liked it. But it has been downhill ever since. Your ego has grown so large that you can't stop referring to yourself in your books (what other author does that???) and the quality has become horrendous. For The Love of Money was just plain bad, and while Just Say No isn't as bad as that, it was just as predictable as the rest of your novels. I've got to ask: What the hell was the NAACP thinking when they gave you their award? Readers, if you want to read quality literature, check out Michael Datcher's Raising Fences. In fact, Omar, you should read it also, so that you can see how the craft of writing should be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just say No","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The beginning was interesting but then it became way to predictable. Also Tyree is not a very savvy writer...his books are about 200 pages to long. He should try adn get the details in wiht out all the meaningless dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"When you see this book on the shelf, Just Say No","review":"The book held my attention for the first few chapters, then it became so predictable. I was hoping that somewhere in that dribble there was some sort of plot twist or turn. But there wasn't even decent character development, the women's roles were a joke. The writing was repetitive, one sexual exploit after another, one recording session after another, one concert after another, and drug usage galore. You can see this same scenario anynight of the week on VH1's \\"Behind the Music\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just say... I cried.","review":"I think I cried through the whole last chapter of this novel. I have read of number of Omar Tyree's novels and consider myself a fan of his work. But of all of those I have read so far none have affected me like this one. It really look like OT did his research for this book. He took you through the highs and lows of the music industry while taking your emotions throught the same. This story had a coming of age feel but it showed what happened when you took the wrong turn.....

Shakespeare thought it was great, enough said.On Mandelbaum: I've read about 4 different translations of this work and Mr. Mandelbaum's is my favorite. He remains precise without being choppy. He keeps it poetic, which I like. There is a fine line translators must walk, being true to the original text while making the english understandable and keeping the imagery, flow, music and intent intact. This version does all of those."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully translated, poetic, absorbing","review":"A marvelous translation of the Metamorphoses, difficult to put down, very poetic and evocative, leading one into one's own personal associations to the myths while being true to Ovid.

There are far better books for fresh insight to management - see Farson's Management of the Absurd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Al Pacino goes to B-school...","review":"The success of the Mafia Manager lies much in its brash, unflinching analysis of organizational behavior: what makes people tick, what ticks people off, and the means by which to secure advancement in a world where the most important rules are unwritten.The advice offered is nothing new, of course. However, it is the delivery, with all the refreshing and tongue-in-cheek Mob references, that drive the author's point home in ways that ordinary \\"management\\" books fail. Some might appreciate the humor (I did), and others might not. If you can see big business as a cartel of thugs trying to carve up the profits of an autopilot enterprise (as I do), you will likely find the humor in the Mafia Manager to jibe with your dark cynical and manipulative perspective. On the other hand, Stephen Covey fans seeking to \\"empower\\" employees, might understand or appreciate the ruthless tactics suggested by V.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mafia Manager","review":"The book is entertaining.Although it was not exactly what i expected.I'm not so sure of Mr. V.'s mafia connections.But i liked his managers advise.Would like to see another book written by Mr.V if he really is a capo.About the inner workings of the crime families.The day to day working.And how they do the loan sharking,numbers,illegal gambling dens ect.the quotes he puts in his book should have also have said who said them.If it was known."},{"rating":"2","title":"Necessary for the Advancing Bridge Player","review":"This classic bridge book is a must for every serious bridge player who wants to advance to the next level. It is not for beginners, and even intermediate players could find its concepts a bit too advanced. But for the bridge player who is seeking to reach the expert or near expert level, it is required reading. It focuses on the hardest aspect of bridge play, defense. The theme throughout is that counting the number of cards that declarer and partner hold in the four suits is a requirement for good defense. The hands are excellent examples of how to do this. The book is well written and interesting. It is one of the top bridge books of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugh Kelsey","review":"Hugh Kelsey has written 10 excellent books mainly on playing techniques for the advanced bridge player.

I'm surprised to see how high other people rate this book. I guess there are still people who enjoy this kind of mixing of spiritual traditions, popular psychology, philosofical thinking and quasi-sciense. I was searching for a book about haitian vodou. About who the Lwa are, and how they are served. This book does not tell you this. The writer seems to have surprisingly little knowledge about the vodou religion. He has a little to say about a whole lot of diffrent spiritual thinking, and seems to find it amusing to make pagan/esoteric stuff as \\"mystical\\" as possible. If you want to learn about shamanism a good book would be \\"way of the shaman\\" by Michael Harner.

A faster tempo \\"Fly Away\\" is very uplifting and the best one on the CD is \\"How Great Thou Art,\\" a song played at my wife's grandmother Millie's funeral.

I guarantee it. :) Wow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice doesn't always make a good album","review":"Before I begin, let me say that I enjoy Alan's music. Unfortunately, this album truly let me down. I have come to expect from Alan some of the best heart wrenching ballads and the fast get-up-and-dance songs as all the albums before this. This collection lacks both. If you enjoy the old time country sound with alot of religious overtones, then this is the album for you.

I've loved this album so much that I obtained copies for friends at church who have all said that I had no idea of how much they loved this album.One thing that I will definately recommend to readers of this review- you MUST buy the companion DVD in which Alan Jackson performs these songs live at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. The DVD includes 2 songs that weren't shown on the CMT presentation.

Again, my sister -in-law loves 98% of them. So she gets this cd and is raving about it. I borrow it and listen to it. I LOVE IT! How many times have I sat in church and listened to somebody over-sing (read BUTCHER) these songs or listened to a bombastic recording with arrangements that take away from the purity of the lyrics. Alan Jackson sounds completely at ease singing these songs. Without great big notes and huge production, he gets the message across brilliantly. It's obvious to me that these songs are very close to his heart as he sings them tenderly and soulfully. I believe he believes every word he is singing is the truth.

I am afraid I might wear it out since I play it so often. It is simply beautiful. There are many of my old favorite hymns and a couple I hadn't heard before and I love every one of them. They are all moving and done in such a beautiful way that they seem to lift you right up to heaven.I recently watched a special on GAC called \\"Alan Jackson Precious Memories\\" and it is scheduled to air again a few times in June 2009.

Each song is taken out of the Southern Baptist Hymnal but you will find the songs in other denominations hymnals. Originally, as a gift to his mother and his mother-in-law Jackson and his wife went thru the Baptist Hymnal and chose songs that had special meaning to both of them and their families.Each song is wonderful sung by Jackson with 3 or 4 of his band and on one song his daughters sing a verse, this is indeed spiritual and uplifting. It does bring back memories of Sunday morning services when you got to know the songs without looking at the hymnal. Each song praises the Lord and I am glad that this CD is in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Best rendition of gospel hymns that I've heard.

This CD isn't going to win him a Grammy, but I like it. The hymns on this are all ones which I have sung from childhood, and therefore are all very familiar to me. It's nice to hear them sung by a voice as strong as Alan Jackson's. No, Alan doesn't 'modernize' or 'embellish' these hymns to make them like popular hits, but that is just why I like them. Some things don't need a new sound.

Today's church song leaders and choir directors prefer to have their congregations sing praise and worship choruses instead of traditional hymns from the hymn book. I'm not even sure that most young people have even heard many, if any, hymns. Worse, many people who do sing hymns don't sing them the way they're traditionally supposed to be sung. I was very pleased, therefore, when Alan Jackson recorded this CD. I saw his concert on TV, and immediately thereafter ordered the CD. Alan Jackson sings the hymns the way they were sung in church when I was growing up... the way they're supposed to be sung.

It is very badly mixed. I own the columbia records compilation \\"Johnny Cash's Greatest Hits Volume 1\\" and the mix is very different even though it is obviously from the same recording session. The bass beat is significantly slower but the voice is only a bit slower. They make up for this by cutting out base notes every now and then. It make for a confused feel and does Cash a real disservice. The \\"Super Hits\\" people must have some weird idea of what sound they want.If you want to enjoy the music stay with a distributer with some musical morals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent selection of Johnny Cash favorites","review":"I have always been a fan of \\"I Walk the Line\\" and \\"Ring of Fire\\" and loved hearing them on the radio. I bought this CD only for those 2 songs, but found that I love the whole CD. I had never before heard the hilarious songs \\"A Boy Named Sue\\" and \\"One Piece at a Time\\" before and they are now my all-time favorite Johnny Cash songs. \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\" is also an excellent, classic song. He's a little bit country, a little bit rock-n-roll and lots of beat. No one can replace the awesome deep voice of Johnny Cash.

Turned my back on it for not more than two seconds, and it was gone. Sad? Yes. Would I buy the same one to replace it. OF COURSE!I bought this CD player as a replacement for one that I had worn out. At the time, it was only because I loved it's fire-engine red color and was attracted by the price ($35 on sale at Record Town). After I cut open the packaging, inserted the batteries and slipped in a CD, I knew that this was the player for me. The sound quality was much better than any of the other players I'd had and it never skipped. Not once. I was amazed.After a few months, I replaced the headphones. The ones it came with worked just fine, but I wanted ones that fit in your ears. No biggie. This is a fantastic portable machine that sounds like a full stereo. Amazing sound quality.

Not many people, if any, have released music of this nature in the new mellenium. If there are, I have yet to hear. The only reason I give this album 4 stars, is due to the lyrics. I find the lyrics didn't have much thought put into them. Almost rushed. Finally, I'd reccommend this album to anyone who likes chilled, relaxing music with superb instrumental and melodic qualities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great CD from Josh Rouse","review":"A great album of 70s influenced music for people who weren't alive in the 70s, and for people who were. While nearly every track on this one is amazing, \\"Sunshine\\" \\"Under Your Charms\\" and \\"Rise\\" are the highlights. I do have some faults with this album, \\"Slaveship\\" is goofy and non-sensical, and his lyrics are not as strong as on Under Cold Blue Stars.

No worries just good times, genuinely without overproduction or loss of sincerity. A well worked album that delivers with each listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful pop record.","review":"a lot of care seems to have gone into the production of this recording, and it pays off. the sound achieved is rich with a depth of clarity that really is stunning coming out of my stereo speakers. wonderful songs, too. \\"sparrows over birmingham,\\" is the real stunner here, a beautiful slow number that had me hitting the repeat button a few times. the title track \\"1972,\\" \\"rise,\\" and \\"under your charms,\\" are also slow numbers that really stand out. the mid-to-up tempo numbers are all excellent with fine infectious melodies. all in all, a wonderful pop music recording. i highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING / COMPLAINT: \\"Bonus DVD\\" not received !","review":"I received this music CD today from Amazon, but it did NOT include the \\"Bonus DVD\\" that's supposed to accompany it.If the DVD is no longer available, Amazon should remove mention to it, to avoid disappointing and angering its loyal customers (like me)!I have sent a complaint to Amazon Customer Service and am awaiting a response.----------------------------I heard back promptly from Amazon Customer Service who issued me a credit for half my cost.

I have listened to the disk over and over and over again and it just keeps getting better. I highly recommend it. Try to enjoy it without feeling the need to decipher the lyrics and deconstruct the sentence structure - taking this route will just allow you to loosen up and relax the music (and life)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album since Aimee Mann","review":"I was introduced to Josh Rouse, 1972 last October, 2003 while visiting a friend in Stockholm, Sweden.

If you like this one you'll also love Nashville."},{"rating":"2","title":"70s Rock for Now People","review":"Let's focus on what Josh Rouse is: a brilliantly eccentric and refreshingly original songwriter, and not what he'll likely never be: a mainstream success. What Rouse has done on the excellent, but not quite a classic \\"1972,\\" is make a Josh Rouse record that sounds like it was recorded the year of his birth. The album has plenty of decent tunes to recommend it, particularly the soulful title track (in which he cites Carole King in the second line), \\"Sunshine,\\" \\"Slaveship,\\" the ace lovesong \\"Under Your Charms,\\" and the amazingly spiritual \\"Sparrows Over Birmingham.\\"Through four albums, Josh Rouse has been a uniformly excellent songwriter. Those who bemoan his lack of mainstream success are missing the point. If he ever did shoot for a larger audience, he'd lose what it is that make his music so special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Disagreed With Amazon's Typically Subpar Analysis","review":"This album is by far one of 2003's best. Don Mcleese [see above Amazon editorial review] either did not listen to the album or is too busy jamming to Clay Aiken to understand fresh talent when he hears it. Unlike Amazon, Rolling Stone and the Onion are heralding Rouse as one of the best \\"up and coming\\" talents. The lyrics on the album are profound. The tone is subtly intense. The sound mixes great acoustic guitar with cool effects--e.g., flute, vibes, hammond b3--to give a \\"retro\\" feel that still sounds cool \\"3 decades later.\\" Now, logoff Amazon.com and go buy the album from a local independent business person in your community so that we can put the likes of uninformed, out-of-touch big business music editors back out on the street and into small music scenes where real music is made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Gimmicky","review":"This album has been a huge disappointment for me. I have been a Josh Rouse fan for a long time. This 'concept' album is far away from \\"Dressed Up Like Nebraska\\" - in writing and especially music. Why go to lounge disco Josh? Why? What's up with that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twists and Turns","review":"Every 1000 years, one of the Devil's subordinates is given the right to challenge Lucifer for the throne of Hell. This time it is Babbas, whose clever scheme to deliver a fallen angel to Lucifer puts the Devil in the awkward position of defending and protecting one of God's creatures.Barney, a gentle, aging railroad conductor, becomes the pawn in this contest of evil vs. evil. He tells an innocent white lie and, before he can correct it, dies in a train wreck caused by Babbas. From beyond the grave, Barney must try to right the wrong he has caused so that he can earn his place in Heaven.Ms. Hartman has filled her first novel with interesting characters, an unusual plot, and enough twists and turns to keep the reader breathless. The Devil May Care (an interesting title, too) offers evil, fantasy, romance - and some delicious humor. I'm hoping for more from this talented new author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comprehensive and Creative","review":"I just received this book and was pleased to see the variety of resumes.

I commend the author for trying to cover a highly technical area in a manner that tries to be accessible to a lay audience, but it doesn't work for me. I also found the frequent biblical references and quotes to be excessive and unnecessary.A much better coverage of the \\"gene-centered way of life\\" can be found in Vertosick's \\"The Genius Within.\\" While this requires slow and careful reading, it should be accessible (and quite fascinating)to the non-scientists among us."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most tender part of our life","review":"deserves the best name in the world!This book has THE VERY BEST !Just take a look...As cute and beautiful as the baby in the cover..."},{"rating":"2","title":"We are extatic with this names","review":"Thrilled at so much beauty and variety...

I'm not crazy","review":"I thought this book was not only very well written and well researched, but it made me sigh a huge sigh of relief to know that I was not alone in my frustrations during my earlier years as a young mother. It not only justified my feelings but at the end of each chapter gave me helpful hints on ways to deal with the challanges of new parenthood. Now that my children are 12, 10 and 3, I still found the book relevant, because alot of the same challenges apply, you just have found ways to work around them or work them out. Although starting a family is a magical and exciting time, too many people go at it with no preparation or idea as to what to expect. We go through all sorts of classes and excercises to get us through the delivery, but little or no preparation is done for the changes, physical, emotional, hormonal that take place in your body in addition to the changes that your relationship goes thru. This book helps you to prepare for and handle the changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of true facts","review":"This is a pretty accurate picture of what happens after the birth of a baby, a major event in a couple's life which not only puts a lot of strain on marriages, but also gives overwhelming joy to its parents. It's not easy for anyone I should guess. A lot of homework was done and great efforts were put into the writing of this book, but at times it seems a wee bit repetitive. However it is very useful, and offers great advice in saving marriages and remedies for everyday obstacles, it also reminds you that you are not alone. Another point to add is that the author demonstrates a great sense of principles which are the basis for a good marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Couple Must Read This!","review":"After reading this book, I felt so much better and better prepared about the impact of a child on marriage. I have several friends that ended up divorced due to issues that were complicated after having children. Even though I am fairly young, it amazes me the myth that continues to thrive with marriages is \\"if we have kids, it will fix everything\\". The author deals with all aspects of the impact of starting a family on marriage from conception through birth. This is a book to keep as a reference guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it less than a star if I could...","review":"I am expecting my first baby in October and purchased this book as a way to be proactive in maintaining the strong bond my husband and I now enjoy; what I received was a tome of negativity and pessimism, a horribly fear-mongering piece of work which paints a dismal picture of marriage post-baby. I strongly urge you to think twice before spending your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotypes aren't useful","review":"This book was a disappointment. The author is so deeply entrenched in gender stereotyping that she offers advice like this: \\"Praise your partner's strengths. If your husband does a good job quieting the baby, tell him so. If your wife demonstrates selflessness and patience as she cares for the baby, let her know you admire or appreciate those qualities\\" (33). Thus, the father gets praise for quieting the baby, but the mother must be \\"selfless\\" and \\"patient\\" in order to earn praise. Even my husband laughed heartily at this one! I was, frankly, shocked that a book written in 2000 could offer advice based on such simplistic male/female gender divisions. Sure, it acknowledges that new parents are exhausted and that marriage is a challenge, but it offered no advice I found useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moth Trap gets moths","review":"The moth traps generally work well, although not all of the moths have been caught (as was hoped).

As for the product, it works great, it trapped the moths and eliminated them from my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"The disappointing finale","review":"The tenth, and final, Martin Beck novel. A disappointing finish to an otherwise excellent series. International terrorists strike fear into the heart of Sweden, their motives obscure, their methods deadly.The authors abandon all pretense of reality in this one, focusing on excessively heavy-handed Marxist criticism of all aspects of society. Beck's motivations and actions seem very out-of-character, the plot is ridiculous, and the writing is unusually poor. It reads like a freakish crossbreed of Tom Clancy, Kurt Vonnegut, and Frederich Engels.If you've read the other nine books, you should probably read this one, too, but it's for die-hard fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Terrorists","review":"The overall story was good, but the characters were one dimensional. I was disappointed as the authors are deemed by others to be exceptional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand Finale of a great series","review":"Although it has been several years since I read this book, it is the culmination of a great series that is part mystery, part social commentary and part satire. All of the Martin Beck mysteries are good and should be read in order beginning with Roseanne and ending with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning series!","review":"Recently read the all ten books in the series--the first nine for the second time.

My 2 year yells out the letters and my 1 year old sits with a huge smile on his face while watching it. I particularly like the song about \\"F\\" and the little girl who has decided she doesn't want a world with F (sounds like Lily Tomlin narrating), and it's nice to see \\"M\\" is for Martha again. I also really like that they run through the alphabet at the beginning and again at the end, while identifying animals whose names begin with each letter. It's really well done, and focuses on the letters and although Elmo, Zoe and Tali are in it, they aren't as annoying as usual. My 2 year old can recite almost the entire alphabet, and it's a great adjunct to \\"They might be Giants..ABCs\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Valuable Item For The Kids","review":"Like most of Sesame Street releases, \\"The Alphabet Jungle Game\\" is sufficiently entertaining for kids to hold their attention for the duration of the video. This DVD seems to have yielded the right results from my two kids. The video is actually a compilation of various video clips of letter lessons that have been produced over the course of many years. If there was something that could have been improved I would say that the sound of the letters could have been emphasized. Most of the letter lessons were just used in word examples. The lessons work but I have a feeling that an emphasis on phonetics would have shortened the learning process. Hence the one-star deduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I grew up watching Sesame Street and when I saw this video, I thought it would be somewhat like the Sesame Street of old. It wasn't. Some of the characters were present, but not in the same spirit of the Sesame Street I grew up with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I expected much more from a Sesame Street video. Sesame street characters are rarely shown. Much of it is just cartoons - and some not so pleasant. The songs and jungle scenes are not cheerful youthful songs that you would expect. I really wanted it to reinforce the letters I've been working on teaching my 2 year old - but it just is not fun to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Terrible Audio Quality","review":"This DVD has the same audio problem as \\"The Best of Elmo\\" and \\"Kids' Favorite Songs\\". I am very disappointed about the audio transfer. It's completely distorted and way too loud. The sound of Elmo actually frightened my 1.5-year-old son. Try it from a video store first. Don't waste money on the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"It IS a jungle...","review":"Boy, this DVD is just a jumble of old episodes, which are fine. But, it's just not cohesive overall. Feels very disjointed when watching it.The good thing is my 2 year old loves watching it. She only learned \\"m\\" and \\"u\\" from this overpriced DVD, but at least she likes watching it.I must say, I was afraid she wouldn't like \\"Meet The Letters\\" after watching this DVD countless times, but she does (I highly recommend Meet The Letters, if you want your young ones to actually learn). Oh, she could call out all the letters after watching \\"Meet The Letters\\" for about 2 weeks. Is it because she watched the jumbled \\"Jungle\\" for about 3 weeks earlier? Maybe. But, she sure heck didn't call out the letters while watching it (other than \\"M\\" and \\"U\\" as mentioned).This is a good DVD that entertains. I would've actually gave it at least 3 stars if it weren't for the price ($[...] B&N;), considering that they only had to create those few new scenes with Elmo, Zoey and Telly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"The cover and description lead you to believe that this is a Zoe and Elmo video, however they are barely in it and my daughter lost interest very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"My son loves this videos. He is 5yrs old and is already into Jimmy Neutron, Avatar, Spiderman and any other martial arts action packed character; he thinks Sesame street is for \\"little kids\\".

The \\"jungle\\" theme could be MUCH stronger, and it seems like the writers made little effort to give the letters equal time. While some letters get several scenes, others get very little time. (Admittedly, some letters receive more use in the English language, but the letters that received more time in the video were not necessarily those letters. Further, for a kid learning the alphabet, each letter is equally important.) Finally, I often found that the images that accompanied the letters didn't make the most sense and often seemed ill thought-out. My guess is that this video was thrown together quickly and without much thought, and this is a shame, as the idea of a jungle-themed search for letters has a lot of potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed in video","review":"I watched this video with my 18 month old and it was horrible.

Their music never fails to transport you back in time. While the songs on this CD are somewhat more formal, they're basically designed to entertain the Spanish Court of the 15th and (early) 16th Centuries. As such, the evocative use of the guitar, and the excellent vocals and acoustics help transport the listener back to the courts of the Alcazar, overlooking olive trees and lush gardens. It's excellent background music, perfect for easy listening while working, or even during a massage. It's a highly recommended compilation that any medieval enthusiast should have in their CD case, as well as something any fan of \\"World Music\\" would wholeheartedly enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good wire splice","review":"I used this splice to repair cut cord that supplied an underwater lake irrigation pump.

An original story chronicling the disappearance of several young travelers in Eastern Europe, THE SHRINE is eerily atmospheric, as many fellow reviewers noted, very much like a Mario Bava 60s film. The movie also cleverly avoids the use of subtitles, a device that aids in letting viewers share in our heroes sense of isolation, and more importantly, provides the film's surprising twist.Aaron Ashmore, currently seen as Jinks on TV'S WAREHOUSE 13, is proving to be a sturdy performer in today's genre cinema. Cindy Sampson exudes an icy seductress persona and the supporting cast fill their roles nicely. The scenes with the statue in the foggy forest are very chilling.THE SHRINE is an above-average horror movie.

I've read the glowing praises of the majority of the reviewers and can only conclude that it's far too clever for my simple understanding. To read and enjoy a book, I must have some liking for some of the characters, but the way M/s Hazzard rushes on like a freight train, bombarding the reader with unfinished sentences and words which would require even a moderately well educated person to have to dive for the dictionary, is just too much for me.

This book took away two hours of my life-two hours that I can never earn back by reading true literature. The story (is there a story?) is dreadful.

Why should I read entire paragraphs without understanding them when I have read, understood and enjoyed other \\"difficult\\" books from Tolstoy to Bellow to Atwood? Maybe the problem is that this is British from an unfamiliar era. Oh, well. I didn't really like any of the characters. Caro was cold, Grace a whimp, Christian self-involved, Ted a martyr, Paul egocentric. The protraits of minor characters such as Caro's fellow office workers were the best part of the book.

The characters are lifeless, one-dimensional and stereotyped, the plot slow-moving, and the language overly ornate. The most vibrant characterization is of Dora, the professional martyr, who raises her two younger sisters, (the protagonists), after they are orphaned. Hazzard captures the essence of a woman whose joy in life is complaint, and whose ultimate weapon is the suicide threat, but no other character is more than a paper doll, clothed in fancy phrases and incongrous metaphor. Most of all, this novel is about Shirley Hazzard. It screams \\"Look at me! I can write! I am wise! You will have to work if you want to decipher my meaning.\\" But was it worth the time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"the people all nasty or weak","review":"Shirley Hazzard's novel, The Transit of Venus is beautifully written: the language was wonderful, very descriptive. There were some excellent scenes. The characters, however, leave a lot to be desired. They all seemed to be either nasty or weak, or sometimes both. There wasn't anyone there to really love or believe in. For lovers of language, this would be a satisfactory experience, but if you value the story as much as the language, you might be disappointed. I got to the last paragraph and was completely confused, having dismissed an earlier vital clue as an extraneous detail. I had to go online to read some discussion groups before I had figured it out. I'm not sure the reading experience, the quality of the writing, was worth the effort for the final outcome. I found it heavy going.

I was sure I knew what the ending would be and missed it by a mile. The only reason I give it a 4 star is that I love Duncan's early stuff, the Reluctant Swordsman, Man of His Word, and those, even more than I enjoy the Blades series. Duncan writes very well, his worlds are believable, his characters are rich and grow and change. If you don't own everything he has written, you should.

Oh, it's not perfect (hence 4 stars). The Blade isn't actually a Blade for most of the book, Duncan inexplicably and inappropriately changes character viewpoints for short portions of the book, and there are some atrocious errors in the editing (including one unforgivable sentence that switches from third person to first and back).Those errors aside, \\"Jaguar Knights\\" recaptures the excitement and daredevil adventure of \\"The Gilded Chain.\\" Fast paced and highly entertaining, this was a very enjoyable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wolf and Hogwood sitting in a tree, k i s s i n g","review":"This was my first (and last) Kings Blade book. Duncan's writing style pulled me in, but the story mutates. The narrator's tone, a bit sarcastic, nonplussed and world-weary tough, fits the main protagonist and is fun to read. Very vicarious. But I kept waiting for the story to pick up and build on the initial premise of how a small force invaded a fortress and why they kidnapped the commander's main squeeze. It never does, and the answers, in my opinion, were weak and unfullfilling. Two-thirds into it I just didn't care anymore. When the author leads a reader to believe the story is about X, and then makes it about Y, the game is up. I can't describe exactly how this happens without giving away too many details, in case you decide to read it. I'd look elsewhere, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all like the other King's Blades' books","review":"I was a very big fan of all of the other King's Blades books.

I eagerly awaited the release of Jaguar Knights . . . and was sadly disappointed. It is so much worse than the others, it was almost as if Dave Duncan didn't write this one. I bought Jaguar Knights in hardcover, but if he writes another installment in the series, I will definitely not bother with the hardcover.

The razor works fine without the power feature which vibrates the blade. At first, I liked the power feature and used it for about one week, but then I just found it a bit annoying and haven't used it since then. The power feature actually slows you down a bit as you cant rush the blade over your stubble as I have become used to doing after a hot shower in the morning. I can tell that using 5 blades gives me a slightly closer shave than my previous razor with 3 blades (the mach 3) but I honestly don't care about the slight difference. Hence I have come to the conclusion that this is not much of an advance in shaving technology, in a strange way, it is actually a step backwards as the prices of blades have gone up without a real noticeable enhancement in my shave. I am glad that they haven't stopped making my previous blades and will likely switch back to those after I have used up all of my fusion blades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shave if you can afford the cost of the blades","review":"I put aside my buying an electric razor.

Plus it skipped over such important issues as HOW to get rid of rust; HOW to apply bondo; HOW to use fiberglas: and on and on. The HOW TO is not in this book.

I liked the intertwined parrell lives of the characters. I was intrigued by the twists and turns in the story. Daniel was an interesting character and as the story evolved it kept your riveted with the mystery behind the writer Julian Carax. Fermin was an interesting character that proved his loyalty to his benefactors. I got to dislike the villian Inspector Fumero in his role.

It seems like a novel in which symbolism and parallels are plentiful, but the story of which I found eminently boring and tedious. I had a similar problem with The Road by Cormac McCarthy. What was probably a meaningful book was drowned in a boring story. If you are looking for an entertaining and light-hearted read, then this is not a book for you.

I hope none of the other books feel too badly about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Borges?","review":"This is a nice little melodrammatic novel, that has absolutely nothing to do with Borges, Eco, Marquez and other luminaries it is being compared to. While reading it, memories of a Brazilian soap opera I used to watch when still a kid kept bothering me. Maybe this would be a nice start for Zafon's next novel: somebody haunted by a forgotten soap opera. I bought this book partly because the jacket mentioned Eco (not Stephen King), and partly because I love Barcelona. Well, it turned out that King is Eco, when compared to Zafon, because the novel completely lacks the metaphysical dimension. It has all the necessary romance ingredients: trouble in the family, angry parents, suffering teenagers, secret pregnancies, incest, love letters, sick lovers, monomaniac fathers -- you name it. It also is the most kitsch novel I have come upon lately. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I had been looking forward to this book and when I finally read it, was deeply disappointed. Part of this may be due to inappropriate expectations - I think I'd been hoping for a literary mystery in the 'Possession' mould - but the book doesn't even succeed as a Gothic thriller. The characterisation (with the exception of Fermin) was perfunctory, the plot both over-complicated and excessively simple (anyone out there not guess who Leatherface was within minutes of his introduction?). By the end, I'd lost all interest in who'd done what and why, and just wanted the whole sorry saga to be over. The author's attempt to generate suspense over the narrator's eventual fate was a cheap narrative trick that didn't work. The writing was untidy and included such infelicities as the author's voice taking over in a letter from one character to another, to enable her to describe events she had not witnessed. Very sloppy, wouldn't recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like this book!","review":"I tried to like this book, I really did, but after reading a little more than half, I FINALLY gave myself permission to end my suffering!

I am an avid reader who usually reads between 5 and 6 books a week. When I first received this book from a co-worker I was skeptical. I have never really cared for mystery type books or books with rather dark subject matter. Yet, I found myself unable to put the book down. I brought it every where with me. If I found myself with even a minute of spare time, I had to read the book. I found myself quite sad that the book ended.

It tells an improbable story of a boy who by chance comes into possession of a copy of a book by Julian Carax. The boy, Daniel, seeks to find out more about the author and the book tells about that search, and of the romance which led Carax to leave Barcelona to go to Paris. There is much extravaganct melodrama, none of which really caught me up. Yes, I wanted to know what would happen, but there was nothing too admirable about any of the heroic characters--though one had to be \\"for\\" them rather than the excessively evil people seeking their destruacition. I was glad the ending was as it was, but the air of fantasy hanging over the events--none very logical--did not remind me of great novels of the classic genre--which I think the book was designed to do. I found it too long and was glad it was not longer. I understand there is a prequel, but I am not tempted to want to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orignial, well-written, first class book","review":"I read a lot, and am always seeking a well-written imaginative book.

I recently struggled through 130 pages and quit. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it didn't. I found the drama contrived: for example, I would know that a scene was supposed to be suspensful (or sad, etc.) but it didn't feel suspensful (or sad, etc.). The writing didn't transmit any feeling. My match.com dating profile is a more compelling read.I found the characters flat; there wasn't a single character that I cared about. The book just didn't seem to have any soul/meaning/purpose, if that makes any sense. I prefer books with characters and storylines that have depth and meaning, and this book was definitely lacking.Maybe I'm a harsh critic. I'm currently reading Midnight's Children by Rushdie, and it is incredible. To compare, that's an example of 5 out of 5 stars (in my book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope, couldn't finish it.","review":"I usually finish books, and I usually don't review them here, but I've got to take this one down a few notches. Whatever the \\"secret\\" was I'll never know because the story was so uninteresting. The main character bumbled around the town of Barcelona finding one dead end after another over and over again. I tried to keep on thinking there would be a payoff, but at a certain point the weak plot got too boring. If you like well crafted stories with no dead ends and characters who have at least some level of wit, say, by the likes of Wilbur Smith, Ken Follett, or James Clavell, DO NOT bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern classic?","review":"I delayed reading this book for quite awhile for 2 reasons:1) It was translated from spanish - I'm always sceptical of translations, and2) Stephen King had recommended it - not a fan of most of his work,but after the first page I realised that there was nothing to worry about. This is a brillant book and without a doubt Carlos Ruiz Zafon has a fantastic imagination.

In a few pages you will experience, joy , sadness, fear...and almost every single emotion known to man.All characters are very well developed throughout the novel, you can almost touch them and imagine them as your friends or enemies.The setting of the novel is no less than Barcelona, one of the most beautifull and mystical cities in the world, in a time where life was dangerous yet simple.If you have a couple of bucks for one book, do not look any further...this is the one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than his second novel...","review":"...but not by far. TSOEW might have fared well at novella length. Foreshadowing Zafon's second novel, this one, too, is completely bloated -- hundreds of pages longer than it should have been. If endless doors \\"ajar\\", sunrises poured like molten copper/gold/tin/iron across blood-red/coal-black skies, putrid/stinking/rancid flesh, and shadows -- my God, the shadows! -- are your thing, and if you love a pat ending, occasional moralizing and a pretense to intellectualism, then you're in for a treat. The second star in my rating is by comparison with Zafon's truly unbearable followup novel, and because the story at the core of TSOEW -- buried under Zafon's gloppily layered prose -- is at least a clever one.What Borgesian book adventure will Zafon think up next? For my part, I doubt I'll make it past the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You Senor Zafon","review":"For writing a very entertaining book that draws one into a labarynth of twists and turns starting from the first page...and dosnt let you go until you've finished the last page.

I have been to Barcelona and the book does it great justice.This is one of those books that you just don't want to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"College Sanctuary","review":"I've never been so enraptured by a book in my life. The combination of genres, storylines, and the visualization of a dynamic imaginary world placed within the rigid stasis of history struck me senseless. Never have I had a novel grab me so tenderly and pull me through so effortlessly as Shadow of the Wind. There was no point in the novel where I doubted my want to continue to read. I adore and am indebted to this novel for the world it created for me as a freshman in college, an inspiration to embrace creativity and fact alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, but of course it's melodrama!","review":"And therein lies the beauty. Don't pick this up expecting anything but a brooding city, flawed and tragic love affairs, passionate physical encounters inside a hanuted mansion during a thunderstorm, a bookshop, a dark character who hides his burned face, lots of rain . . . it's all there. And Zafon pulls it off beautifully. Fermin is a real treat. Without his witty, energetic and passionate character, perhaps the book would not have been so sharp. But he shines, and carries the book for the most part.My only complaint was the way Zafon failed to carry some of the early threats. The burned man was one. After appearing early in the story with real, gripping and very possible threat, he virtually vanished, not to be seen for many many many pages.But for the most part, a highly enjoyable read. Not quite on a par with O'Neill's 'The Lamplighter,' but has that same brooding tone.Delightful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to get lost in...","review":"It just doesn't get any better than this if you are seeking living, breathing characters who you'll come to care about, high excitement and a complex and intriquing mystery. I loved this book and envy all who may be opening to those first pages right now, as they are in for a real treat. This wonderful novel really stays with you. Extremely well written and nothing appears to have been lost in the translation as even the occasional humor translates very well. I look forward to more from this author. Also recommend The Flanders Panel/ Gospel /The Quincunx /The Eight /The Magic Circle"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets under your skin","review":"Carlos Ruiz Zafon's Barcelona-set SHADOW OF THE WIND has been repeatedly compared--quite inaccurately--to Borges, but it is really more akin to Sebastien Japrisot's A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT and Michael Ondaatje's THE ENGLISH PATIENT: it's basically a multi-threaded story of doomed love, set against historical upheaval and pieced together years after the fact. It has fine Gothic atmospherics that really make it compelling. There are, however, quite a number of narrative lapses throughout that may betray the author's comparative youth. (For example, Ruiz Zafon frequently has his main character read documents by other characters that are all told in the same basic style and that have information within them to which the characters writing the narrative could not possibly be privy.) It was an enjoyable read all told, however--whatever its errors, I could not wait to get back to it while reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"give me a break","review":"Aside from the obvious Marquez rip-offs and the heavy-handed purple prose (lots and lots of shadows, mists and blown-out candles), this novel also suffers from extraordinarily shallow characterizations. Is it a parody of a (bad) gothic novel? But there's no real irony going on that I detected. For all the plot intricacies, I still struggled to finish it. Why oh why is every female such a flimsy (though, of course, exquisite) shell? And why is the villain so very very thoroughly demonically evil so as to be silly? Finally: I thought this was supposed to be about \\"the power of books\\" -- but it was more about a young man's obsession with the mysterious author of a rare book, which is a very important distinction. Very little in this novel made me think about literature, aside from the cutesy flourishes the author brought in to prove he is well-read (a cat named Kurtz, for example, and a boorish boyfriend named Buendia)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly written, wonderful translation!","review":"When I first came across this book on Amazon, I was drawn by the title and also the subject matter. The glowing reviews only added to my desire to read this book, and I must say, of all the books that I've purchased through Amazon [and that's quite a few!], this was my best buy. The book reads like a dream,and reinforces to me the spellbinding nature of books. It is truly a beautiful work, and the language [wonderful translation by Lucia Graves] just makes me want to reread certain passages over and over again. The descriptions of Barcelona, the historical setting...the complex plot,Carlos Ruiz Zafon has indeed created a beguiling masterpiece. The platitudes can go on and on, but I leave it to future readers to judge for themselves. This book will be a tough act to follow, but I hope Zafon persists, and produces another enthralling work of ficton. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Since there is a very long review about this book, I will only say that it is one that I recommend. I read this book in 5 days. I was taken in by it in the first 50-60 pages. It ended up being better than I anticipated. If you like a little mystery with a little bit of a love story, you will like this book. It is very good.Read it! You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did I miss","review":"After reading a few of the other reviews I'm tempted to doubt my impressions of this book. This novel takes 300 pages to get going and while I did ultimately finish the book and found some to enjoy, I found it difficult to connect with most of the characters. How many 10 year olds do you know that ultimately devote their life to pursuing a single book? Sure, this was another time before the days of TV and the like but I found the basic plot to be absurd. I spent much of the book not sharing the passion for the plot that our main character possessed. While much of the mystery was intriguing, I found myself getting bored by the hunt to unravel and only started aggressively turning pages when the mystery started to unfold 300 pages in.It had its moments but fell short for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The past as prologue","review":"Seemingly about a single book, then gradually sweeping further into the past to encompass all the works of a single author, this haunting story links past tragedy to the present as certain events seem destined to repeat themselves. Set in Barcelona, the feel of the city, its neighborhoods, and especially the darkened streets and a certain deserted mansion, envelope the reader. The action begins quickly, then slows (as the reader wonders where the book is leading), then gathers itself for the denouement. Cruelty, selfishness, arrogance are set against compassion, love and the stubborn will to follow a story to its end. Finally, a beautiful love story. The book stays in your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"Enjoyed reading this book very much. Plot moves along well. Engaging and hard to put down.

It grabs you by you heart and soul and mind and doesn't give you time to breath! At every page another layer of mystery is revealed and you fell sinking deeper and deeper into this world of enigmas.

I had the book finished in 36 hours- the story was immediately captivating. Zafon creates the kind of story that appeals to anyone by incorporating humor, intrigue, romance, mystery, history, and literary skills that surpass most American authors. The characters are richly drawn and lovable (or \\"hate-able\\" in some cases!) and the story is woven so tenderly and with such purpose that the reader almost feels like a part of the intricate web. HIGHLY recommended- easily the best book I've read in years!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise pick","review":"I picked this up at Costco on a whim. Found the story totally engrossing. I found my self so wrapped up in the book I didn't want to put it down, but sometimes had to anyway as I found it totally draining. Not predictable at all. Usually I can figure out where the writer is going early on and I did have some things figured out, but there were still surprises. Good read - I recommend it if you're not looking for something light."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shadow of the Wind","review":"This was a lumbering book with several unbelievable plot lines. It was overwritten, and had serious gothic overtones. I would not recommend it and was barely able to finish it. I will not read another book by this author. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shadow of the Wind","review":"This is an excellent book. It was sad and yet had such a good storyline. If you like mystery and murder along with faded love you will find the mix here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not since Tolstoy and Dostoevsky.....","review":"have I been left with such a feeling. I started the book around six in the evening, read until my eyes burned - went to sleep and when I awoke, didn't stop until I had finished the book! Like other reviewers, I felt like many of the characters had become members of my own family. I missed them greatly as the book was finished, so I have started reading it again. I will tell everyone I know to read this book, and if it doesn't win high honors and praises in the world of literary prizes, I will be greatly diappointed.I find it astonishing that the author was able to achieve with his readers the exact passion and experiences with his book as Daniel (the main character) has with Carax's. This work is a masterpiece, the likes of which I have not experienced with other writers. I can't say enough great things about this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Very simply when you read the back cover about the \\"cemetery of lost books\\" and about the mysteries surrounding the book in question you are deliberately led to believe that there will be something at least a bit supernatural involved in the story. It turns out to just be a rather unimaginative and overlong love story with too many plot twists and really nothing more. I felt deceived and disappointed, frankly."},{"rating":"1","title":"This, after all the hype?","review":"I was expecting something really exceptional based on the reviews and what I got was: Pulp fiction sex, violence, and cheesey plot. I tried it, put it down, tried it again, and put it down for good the second time around. How did this get on the New York Times best seller list?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good bridge between trashy bestseller and good writing","review":"I feel like this book did a great job of creating an accesable bridge between literature and trashy bestseller. This guy can write, and has a truly great style. Sadly the plot is cheesy and unbelevable, yet interesting enough to keep any reader on their toes. I think its a good alternative to much of the crap that hits the bestsellers lists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"The writing was extremely clever. There were lines that I wish I remember so I could use them. The storyline was intricately woven and suspenseful. As much as I wanted to savor the book and read slowly, I could not wait for the next page. I usually give my books away for others to read but this is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorites","review":"I have passed this book on to countless people who all thank me. The storyline will keep you reading long into the night. Great characters in post-war Barcelona. Highly recommend. Do yourself a favor and read it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic, mystery, suspense and an intense love of books","review":"Is it magic or just mysterious coincidence? It really doesn't matter. This is simply one of the most haunting, creepy, riveting, fascinating and wonderful books I've ever read. Much of it is about the magic of reading, which puts it in a class of its own. Don't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE SHADOW OF THE WIND","review":"THIS WORK OF FICTION WAS CAPTIVATING. IT WILL KEEP YOUR INTEREST FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AND YOU WILL NOT WANT IT TO END. THE AUDIO VERSION WAS NICELY DONE. I ALWAYS ENJOY WHEN THE CHARACTERS COME ALIVE THROUGH THE NARRATOR. I WOULD RECOMMEND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"2","title":"serendipitous delight","review":"This book grabbed me by the eyes in Wal-Mart--the last place I would have expected to see any such, but I was captured by the time I had gotten to the bottom of the first page--and the Cemetery of Books.Anyone who likes mysteries will enjoy this book. It's a matrioshka doll of a book, plots within plots within more plots, all set during and after the Spanish Civil War. Sorting it all out is wonderful and holds the reader to the last page.Its delights include several romantic threads, at least one horror story, and the city of Barcelona among the memorable and seductive characters we meet. Written with a very Peninsular Spanish sensibility and translated by the late poet Robert Graves' daughter, it is a luscious read.My cousin, who lived in Barcelona for years, says the translator probably doesn't know Catalán, so it is frustrating for her to read. She and other Catalán speakers may need to read the original. However, the rest of us will enjoy this translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hauntingly beautiful book","review":"You know how some books are so wonderful that after finishing the last page, you can't read anything else for quite a while, because it seems that nothing else could be quite this good?Well, \\"Shadow of the Wind\\" is one of those books. Admittedly, it was slightly slow going at first, before I started liking it, a lot. But it was the last third - poignant, beautful, and haunting - that made me fall in love with the book.Many reviews have compared it to various other literary works, rightly enough. But I'd add that it reminded me a whole lot of a movie by Spanish director Pedro Almodovar - bizarre and colorful, filled with quirky characters, at times outrageously crude, but also touched with sudden, breathtaking moments of beauty.And, as noted above, the final moments of \\"Shadow of the Wind\\" just wrapped around my heart and still won't let go, even months later.Can you tell that I really recommend it? :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Modern Gothic","review":"The reviewers who gave this book a poor rating obviously have no romance in their souls. This book is a wonderful piece of escapism that will leave you longing to stay behind and spend some more time with its' characters. Some parts are predictable, but so what? The pleasure of this book is in the way the story is told. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long-Winded and Lurid","review":"Sad to say I thought this book, which I'd very much looked forward to reading, was terrible: murky and shallow. The identity of the dark leather-face 'mystery man', around which much of the presumed suspense revolves (and which takes the writer 350-odd gruelling pages to divulge), was only too obvious from the word 'go'. One of the main reasons I kept reading was that I assumed my initial guess was too simple and that I must therefore be wrong. So I was left feeling cheated and annoyed. The writing is indeed (as one critic described it) 'florid'. Though at times self-consciously clever, it's melodramatic, at times gruesome, contrived, and devoid of joy, enshrouding the reader in an oppressive atmosphere. When I finished the book I felt depleted and only too relieved to emerge at last into the light of day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great intellectual triller","review":"If all contemporary writers were able to write this way - with wit, sense of humor, erudition and elegant style, maybe there wouldn't be a need for TV or movies. Yes, the book is that good for people who like smart literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shadow of Not Much of Anything","review":"This book promises way more than it delivers. You think it's going to be complex and intricate, but it's not. The plot fizzles out and you can easily guess what's going to happen. This could have been written as a high school literary project -- it's so derivative and unoriginal! My suggestion: use a little brain power and read The Name of the Rose and save this for when you are feeling really mindless or just coming out of general anaesthetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing - too long, boring & predictable","review":"I was extremely disappointed after finally finishing this book. I found it predictable and just plain boring. Halfway through it got a little more exciting, but keep in mind that was 250 pages in! I felt that it had to have some redeeming qualities to get such rave reviews, so I pushed on. Should have gone with my instincts and just let it go."},{"rating":"1","title":"time wasted","review":"Predictable, meandering plot that objectifies women. It's poorly translated as well. I only finished this book because it was selected by my book club(without my input). The characters are flat & the melodramatic plot is adolescent at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I have rarely read a book as bad as this: several times I wanted to hurl it across the room. Turgid claptrap! I only carried on because my reading group was reading it. However, out of the six women that attended, only one had lukewarm praise for it; the rest of us thought it drivel. I wish there was a libary for forgotten books: it would be a worthy candidiate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice read","review":"A very decent read difficult to put down once you are into it.but not sure if its worth recommending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic mystery","review":"Ruiz's multi-layered plot made me want to read to uncover the ultimate truth of Daniel's quest. Ruiz's villains can rank with other prototypes who frustrate and thwart their protagonists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth patience","review":"The beginning first 50 pages made me wonder why people liked the book but it is frankly worth being patient as it is an excellent story. I considered it dark but it is beautifully written and the author created great characters. I especialy liked Fermin and Daniel a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite book of all time","review":"This was the second time I read Shadow of the Wind. I had received Zafon's The Prisoner of Heaven for the holidays and wanted to refresh my memory of the earlier book. It is still one of the best books I've ever read.

The book has a tale with a parallel tale going on at the same time and it was wonderful to realize that. Very satisfying novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing...","review":"This is the best book I've read in years. If you liked the DaVinci Code, but wished it had more of a literary flair, then this is your book.This is probably the best book since 'The Name of the Rose' by Umberto Eco. Can't recommend it highly enough. It's a true bibliophiles book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will keep it simple. It's so bad.","review":"I don't understand the near-5 star ranking here. I thought it was awful. Read the other 1-star reviews and consider yourself warned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Did What They Said","review":"Product as advertised...surprised that shipping from GA to GA resident took as long as shipping cross country."},{"rating":"1","title":"The shadow of the hype","review":"With so many rave reviews out there, Zafon doesn't stand a chance. This book was an enjoyable distraction, but I read most of it the way I read articles in People Magazine, with my ears tuned more to the outside world than the inner world of the novel. Full of predictable surprises and the creaking door of a \\"scary\\" plot, Zafon's novel is drizzled lightly with metafictional hocus pocus about forgotten books and labyrinthine libraries. While the nods to Borges, Eco, Marquez, and Dickens made me buy and read the book, they ultimately made me long for the originals. They are unforgettable: this book, alas, will disappear in the recesses of my memory almost as quickly as my second (and every other) novel by Steven King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"A nearly flawless work of fiction. I have not enjoyed a novel this much in a very long time. Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"drek...","review":"Reading this is a bit like biting into a gigantic cream-puff. One that somehow manages to be both undeniably stale and unreliably sweet. There it sits uneasily. You paid for it. Now you've got to eat it. Or do you? 500 plus pages of derivative drek. With all the luminous reviews one can only conclude that people no longer know what they are reading or why they are bothering. And those comparisons...oh my Lord."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shadow of the Wind","review":"I finally gave up on this book halfway through it. I kept reading that long because of all the favorable reviews. But, halfway through, I still didn't care about any of the characters or even the plot. It is a very \\"wordy\\" book with a confusing list of characters. I lost track of who characters were and how they fit into the story. It certainly did not live up to to hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flick-Scribble","review":"This film treatment disguised as a novel will no doubt shortly be at your cinemaplex with all the atmosphere of the haunted mansions to be found in the Scooby Doo movies. Cardboard, two-dimensional characters, predictable plot lines and more. Can you spell \\"schlock\\"? Despite the critics' references to Borges, Dickens and Garcia-Marquez you should run to your library and get the real thing. Really you should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly great storytelling","review":"A second-hand bookseller takes his young son, Daniel, to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a secret library that preserves volumes that would otherwise be lost forever. This event will result in a years-long quest for more information about an elusive author who mysterious life parallels young Daniel's in many ways.Carlos Luis Zafon's novel is big, gorgeous storytelling, full of passion. The many characters have fascinating backstories that intertwine in unexpected ways, resulting in a very rich plot. Fermin, a profane but courageous homeless former spy who become a loyal ally of Daniel, is one of my favorites, both for his great love of life and for the many hilarious comments he makes during the course of the story. This is a masterwork of Gothic melodrama that revolves around the world of books and writing, an irresistible milieu for anyone who cherishes reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, Barcelona...","review":"This book is a homage to Latin American and 20th century European Latin Mediterranean literature. Barcelona is a huge character here. The fact that the Spanish Civil War is in the background could also classify this book as a historical novel. The end result is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible book","review":"I can't even begin to describe what a wonderful book this is. It is definately top 5 for me. The characters in this novel are rich in depth. Emotionally and physically I had a vivid picture in my head about each and every one of them. The pain of a father, a son, an author, a historian (book collector) as well as a lover. Twists and turns pulling you in to every page. Page after page of magnificant words put to paper to tell what I feel is the most gripping story I have read in a long time. This book had no \\"drag\\" times for me. It followed a smooth trail from start to finish. Carlos Ruiz can write. Read him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite what I expected","review":"Zafon's Shadow of the Wind starts out strong and hooked me early...always a good sign. Our Spanish protagonist Daniel is swept into a mystery over the author of a series of obscure books. He's pursued by an even more mysterious figure who is trying to destroy the very books that Daniel has become enamored of. And there's the mystery: what became of the author? Who's pursuing Daniel? Why is someone destroying these books?At first, it seemed as though this was going to be a tale with twists of magical realism. Instead, it turned out to be a fairly straight forward love story (albeit with a complicated, twisting plot). Expecting something slightly supernatural, I was a little disappointed by this. However, it's a well-written tale and entertaining enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"shadow of the wind","review":"great book~ mysterious, intriguing, spiritual. it is well written and hard to put down~"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"spellbinding \\"","review":"\\"Shadow Of The Wind\\" is a masterpiece of literature, personally one of the five best novels I've read ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful peer to \\"The Meaning of Night\\"","review":"My way to pay \\"Shadow of the Wind\\" a compliment is to compare it to what I believe is a very underappreciated book: Michael Cox's \\"The Meaning of Night\\". I was amazed not to find \\"Meaning..\\" among the list of similar books provided here at Amazon, and somewhat disappointed to find other books that in my opinion are less deserving of the association(e.g. \\"The Kite Runner\\"). In \\"Shadow of the Wind\\" you will find wonderfully developed, original characters (with a lovely tinge of spanish personality and sarcastic humor) and a beautifully described historical setting. In \\"Shadow..\\", we get even more and quicker plot twists and turns, though I actually believe \\"Meanings..\\" plot is tighter and its conclusion less predictable.All in all, both are riveting, intelligent and unforgettable books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joy to read","review":"Kindle has really got me back to reading and this is one of the best books I have read in many years. Once you start this book its hard to stop. I think everyone will enjoy this book and it is rare to feel that way about anything this day and age."},{"rating":"2","title":"None required","review":"As with all works of lasting literary merit, The Shadow of the Wind is diffused with language invented by the author to evoke images of such force, passion, and beauty that the words themselves take on a life of their own. Chapter Thirty comes to mind immediately. I study Zafon's scene and characteriztion; his unparelled choice of words that paint a portrait of the Tenebrarium and its occupants so vivid and hilarious that I must return to it time and again for inspiration. Yes, he is in the same class as every master of the art of writing. I eagerly await his next novel and a return to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not understand the appeal of this book","review":"I started this book with high expectations because I had heard many good things about it. I was warned to \\"stick with it\\" because it was fairly slow at the beginning. Jeesh I thought it was unbearably slow for nearly 300 pages. Something about it made me plod through it. There was something compelling about it that made me finish it. Having said that I would not recommend it. It just was not worth the time invested in reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many... Too much...","review":"Too many useless twists and convenient connections between charactors. Too many pregnant teenage girls with enraged fathers. Too much pointless secrecy between people who claim to be seeking the same end when a little information sharing would have cleared things right up. And too much rain. Apparently the rain in Spain falls constantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular.","review":"Bar none the best first sentence of any book I have ever had the pleasure to read. And the rest of the work only gets better every time I read it. I have had to purchase a new copy; I read the old one literally to pieces. Highly, Highly recommend. Story telling at its finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Favorite Book","review":"I got so caught up in this book that I didn't want to read it because then I would finish it and it would be over. It had a little bit of every type of genre and was very well written. It really is my new favorite book . . . I think I'll go reread it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Words Cover the Lack of Great Story","review":"Initially, the words hooked me. The translation is a pleasure to read, and so I imagine credit belongs to Lucia Graves. But the story is lacking for me. The focus is all on forbidden love, TV soap-opera style -- completely forgettable and a waste of time by the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Formulaic, but very well executed.","review":"I do agree that this novel is a bit over-hyped, and probably poorly compared with some higher literature. However, despite all my cynicism, I was very charmed by this book.While this story did not hold many surprises for me, and yes, perhaps there is some validity one can infer to the \\"soap opera\\" references, it is well executed just the same. Zafon is clearly a very talented writer, the translation is absolutely beautiful, and the characters and setting provided a pleasant escape.Do not take this work too seriously, enjoy the long ride and lush scenery. Do not let the hype or comparisons taint your expectations and you will enjoy this novel for what it is. Not timeless literature, but a nice diversion nonetheless.I found this book reminded me of the films Malena, A Very Long Engagement and Cinema Paradiso, and was not surprised to find Zafon has written screenplays. If given to a capable, foreign director, this would be on par with those films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadow of The Wind Review","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was a very solid story that grabbed my interest from the cover alone. I saw it in a couple of book stores and read the blurb, then I finaly bought it. As ussual, the book was different than expected, but the tale was wonderful. I was caught by suprise a couple of times at the plot turns but others most likely will find it a little predictable. What was most engrossing however, was the language. The descriptions of the people, the places and the books involved in this novel are mesmerizing and spellbinding; like a symphony of words. Those who love reading for its own sake rather than just for the plot will most likely enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bibliophiles unite, this is YOUR thriller!","review":"I no longer recall how I was alerted to this marvelous, especially suberb novel for bibliophiles. No matter, it's finest kind of reading, I assure you. It's not perfect but you won't care once you settle down with it. The first chapter is titled \\"The Book Cemetery\\" -- just wait 'til you read about this place. It's where I want to work and die!In many ways this novel is an exceptionally Spanish mystery/thriller; there's philosophy, religion, intense passion, historical roots, mysticism and more. Barcelona comes alive in full color for the reader while the implications of the Spanish Civil War and its Francoist aftermath is presented clearly. Utterly splendid reading book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a really good read","review":"I love this book. I picked it up after a recommendation from a book club just as it was being published. I read it on a train trip and didn't want to get off the train because I wanted to keep reading. Yes, the plot is somewhat contrived, but who cares? The characters and atmosphere are still so memorable and not completely unrealistic given the time and environment of the story. I highly recommend it if you just want a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent!","review":"This novel, I think, is one of the all-time greatest, most engaging books I have ever, ever read! This copy I bought as a gift for a 16 year old grandchild, who loves to read, because its theme is about the treasure and mystery of books themselves. You get drawn into the story from the very first page. It creates an entire world for you that you just want to linger in to see how the plot plays out! Get this one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty, breath taking, brilliant.","review":"This was one of the better written books that I've read in awhile - beautiful descriptions without feeling tedious, a fascinating story that gets more complex with each chapter, but brilliantly. I really enjoyed this book which seemed to offer a little bit of everything - it is really a mammoth of a story, where Zafon takes his time to tell seemingly every story and quaint thought he's ever had, but somehow managed to do it brilliantly, in my opinion. You get a little bit of everything here - gothic, dark descriptions, a massive cast of characters, each with their own secrets and stories - the book is peppered with life lessons and ruminations, ridiculous humor, heart breaking turns of events and moments of hope in the middle of despair. I found it gritty and depressing and yet breath taking and filled with a sense that \\"maybe things can still work out\\" even when it seems unlikely, or even impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't finish it","review":"Angel's game was intriguing... the copy was so superbly edited... it was amazing to read. The story, however was confusing. This book was much worse. The editing and writing was much more cumberous, without even the hint of a story to plague it.

Borges? Dickens? EGAD! All I can say: BURN THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spanish kitsch","review":"It's hard to know what to make of this book -- it's a cross between a modern bodice-ripper, a nineteenth-century Italian opera, and Casablanca. Overblown, overlong, overcomplicated, overdetailed, over-dramatic, over the top in almost every respect. I listened to the audio tape, and the occasional tinkling piano music (composed by the author, we learn at the end) added to the overall effect. If you like misty streets, dark lowering clouds, eternal love, Spanish passion, unwitting incest, endless detail and a totally improbable story-line, then this is the book for you. My favorite line in the entire book, about the disfigured spectre who haunts the streets of Barcelona -- \\"I wanted to kiss him. . . but he had no lips.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The emperor has no clothes","review":"This book was so hailed by reviewers I trust - now I think everyone is afraid to tell the truth.

I kept hoping the book would finally get better, but it never did. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Cherish this","review":"Beautifully written, great plot, entrancing characters.... Reading this book compelled purchase of every other book to which it was compared in published reviews. My first copy was paperback - quickly given away - but had to find hardcopy to re-read and re-read. The voice of the young protagonist and atmosphere of pre-WWII Barcelona were well drawn. I've bought several copies of this to share with others, as it's easily in the top 10 novels I've ever read. A real masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"All plot; no characterizations","review":"Overly long and tedious. Plot is intricate and clever but characters never come to life. Some exceedingly witty dialogue (especially Fermin's). Fumero is the villain, not so pure but quite simple.

The setting is mainly Barcelona, and the reading is beautiful. It is so easy to picture everything that is happening! As you read, you fall in love with each of the characters who seem as real as your neighbors. This book kept me up for several nights because it was so enthralling, I could never guess what was coming up next (which is awesome!) The ending is very satisfying and I will be looking for future books from Zafon, as soon as they come out I will put them at the top of my \\"Must Read\\" stack. Don't miss out on this wonderful book, the time you take to read it will be a delightful experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of richness and amazing depth","review":"Another monumental book, full of colorful richness and amazing depth. I realize a reader loses the artistic nuances of the original language when he or she reads a translation, but if translator Lucia Graves' remarkable accomplishment is this breathtaking, just imagine the grandeur, the silent wash of beauty that must envelope the reader who is fortunate enough to encounter the original Spanish.One really hates to bid farewell to a book like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book lover's novel","review":"My college rommate told me about this book.

After reading the reviews praising this book, I thought I would love it. UGH. It was so long and I kept thinking the story would take off and I would be entranced. DIDNT HAPPEN. Such a bummer. Cant believe I read this entire VERY long book just so I could get to the last couple of chapters for a pretty lame ending. If you are reading this book and do not like it, just read the last section. I could have read it and found out the ending immediately after reading the first section. Waste of money, waste of time. I am surprised to see how many people love this book and author. I guess I am in the minority of opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"3rd rate novel","review":"I couldn't bear to finish it after torturing myself to continue in hope that 700-odd reviewers who gave high rate were right in some sense.

I thought she was being very generous. Now I know why she didn't need it back: it is utterly boring.To be fair, the first 200-300 pages are interesting. The story and the characters are unusual. The quest of a young boy and his uncle for the lone copy of a book by Julian Carax are (or I should say: could have been) extremely appealing. So I kept on reading, hoping that a mid-point in the book, something would happen. Well, it did: Half-way through,I was so completely confused by the labyrinthine plot that I forgot where I was, and why I was there. (Not good, especially when some readers may think you are the next Gabriel Garcia Marquez).In short, if you are curious about it, get it from a library or at used book store. You might find my copy there because I promptly traded it in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadow of the Wind","review":"Great story,written in the traditional lyrical style of Spanish authors.

Can't wait to read the sequel. Loved, loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-Crafted story","review":"I was drawn into this story from the first page... Couldn't put it down. I don't use this description for much, but this book is extremely well-crafted from beginning to end. The words drip like honey -- Beautifully written.I love how the life of the main character, Daniel, becomes intertwined with and reflective of the life of the man he his searching for -- Carax.Excellent development of individual characters whose lives intertwine in ways you don't anticipate as you first get to know them.What I especially loved is that the story was well resolved. There were no loose ends at all, even for the minor characters. The secrets that needed to be revealed were revealed, and the secrets that needed to be kept were kept.After reading the last page I put down this book with a feeling of satisfaction.One of the best books I've read in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have not ever recieved this book. where is it?","review":"My credit card was debited but i have not received this book! Thankyou for your attention in this matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary, rich read.","review":"It is hard to describe the beauty and sensitivity of the writing, along with the astute capture of human emotions. Having read this as a library borrowing, I then bought a copy so that I could re-read inimitable passages. It is complex, interlaced and challenging. It is a tribute to writing wrapped inside mystery and darkness. It creates a reality that rides on the margins of reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to agree...","review":"...with the 2 star/1 star reviews. I don't know why this has so many raves. I'm half way through and will probably finish as I don't have anything great in the wings to read, but I'm beginning to skip bits as they are so repetitively dark, Gothic, overwrought and, yes as others have said lurid. For instance the story of Jacinta (in the institution) was just too over-the-top with the mystical, ghost ridden, devil cursed, awful fortune she'd had to live through. Why should I live through it too? Maybe once, but we've been there with that a few times already in this book. Just don't care about these folks, don't believe in them, the magical realism is neither real nor magical and the mystery is in no way compelling. Yes, I agree--don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a dark and stormy night....","review":"It seems that this novel polarises readers and i'm afraid that i tend to the south pole more than the north. While the story is calculated to entrance and captivate i agree with the reviewers who were disappointed by the flatness of the characters and the boring predictability of the storyline. What more can i say about a novel full of breathless heroines with heaving bosoms, dastardly cigar-smoking villains, mysterious strangers and comic-relief sidekicks. Comparisons with Eco, Marquez etc are fatuous. This novel would win my nomination for the Bulwer-Lytton purple prose award."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have you gushing 5-star reviewers actually read this book?","review":"Dear Lord The Shadow of the Wind is a stinker.I had bad feelings about it even before I started reading it...just looking at those absurdly gushing reviews on the back book cover from various newspapers in Germany, I had a premonition that the readers were blowing smoke.If this yawningly stupid and overwritten book had not been given to me as a birthday present, I wouldn't have even bothered opening it up. But, to be fair to my friend, I decided to give it a try. Okay, I've given it a try and now I say, Phooey. I've read a little over half of this nightmare and have no intention of finishing it. I don't care about any of the characters, what their problems are or what happens to any of them. Good riddance.Amazon, you need a rotten tomato or a stinky-looking fish to click on for those of us who really dislike something and want to warn the public.And now there's going to be prequel? Yikes."},{"rating":"1","title":"terribly overrated.","review":"I could not believe the legion of rave reviews for this book. It was trite and melodramatic. The translation was bad . . .I'd expect more from the daughter of Robert Graves: i.e., just how common was the use of the word \\"ecosystem\\" in the early 1950's?; I assume that the main character was \\"nauseated\\" and not \\"nauseous\\" ....although the whole book was \\"nauseous\\" to me; and a spider is not an insect.I staggered to the 400- plus page finish line. . . . at the end, all I could think of was that there are so many books out there to read, so little time, and I wasted valuable reading time on this. I know I'm going against the grain here . . . perhaps I'm just missing something."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DIFFICULT READ","review":"I was surprised to read other reviews of how great this book was and how unforgettable. When our Book Club decided to read this, I started to read it and realized I had already read it. It was COMPLETELY forgettable. The tracking of characters took skill and charting by the reader with convoluted twists and turns, not always easily understood. For some reason, I found the book dark and not compelling. I would not recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I saw this book at my local book store and was attracted by the cover. I really, really loved the book! The caharcters are great, especially the enigmatic, wise,crack up Fermin! The story gets a little predictable in the end, but it is still very enjoyable! I also liked the description of Barcelona during the spanish war and what people had to endure in those years...Final note, I think that the translator did a terrific job!! He's partly responsible if this book is very good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadow of Magnificent","review":"The prose of this novel is magnificent! (It is a superb translation.) This book, while being both a mystery and a shadowy story, is a mystical journey into intermingled souls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful but. . .","review":"This story is beautifully written and engrossing, and held my attention till the end. I loved all his descriptions and the characters were well drawn. It had elements of tragedy, love, and humor. No novel is perfect, hence the following critique: It would have been better had the dialogue fit the time period of 1945-1966 and not been filled with modern vernacular phrases and slang such as \\"catch my drift\\", etc. At the end of the book, the female character who writes in 1st person and sums up the story of Julian could not have possibly known some of the events and dialogue between characters which she discloses. Some killings take place at the very end which logically couldn't have occurred as described. Certain characters who should logically be dead, live to a ripe old age. But what bothered me the most was, Daniel says he has one week to live so the reader expects him to die tragically -- instead, this is only a ruse used for dramatic effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was VERY good...","review":"I bought this book just by a chance at an airport on my way back to home..just to spend my flight reading something. At the first pages, I knew I had done very good to buy it..It was a book with several layers waits to be discovered..It was a delight that the taste of which will never be forgotten.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the sun ever shine in Barcelona?","review":"I do so love books with wind whistling down dark alleyways, rain pelting down, and shadows lurking, hiding mysterious goings-on. The atmospheric touches in this book enhance the sensuality of the prose, but I have to wonder -- does the sun EVER come out in Barcelona?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old world feel - great read","review":"First book I have read of this author and I was captivated. The book definitely has an old world feel. Having never been to Barcelona, I could almost feel the city live through he ebb and flow of the story. As the story proceeds to through the unlikely hero Daniel's life, you manage to slowly untangle the similarities that create a web that binds him and the author he is curious about - 'Carax'.The book is so well written that you travel through with Daniel into adulthood never realizing the steps you took with him through the twists and turns of his life. You know as much as he does so the mystery unfolds to the reader at the same pace it does to Daniel.This book reminded me of the classics I love to read even though it was a mystery novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.","review":"First read this book a few years ago. Felt it good enough to re read. Excellent story telling. Beautiful language. Highly reccommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky and Unpredictable","review":"I enjoyed this book, although some of the translations were a bit quirky. I particularly liked the parallels between the differing time frames and characters. I thought the story had interesting characters and plot twists that were not so predictable.Faith and religion is a strong undercurrent to the story - something readers may not readily comprehend. Check into the history of the Spanish Civil War referred to throughout the story, and you'll see how the culture has not to this day fully recovered from the most brutal attempt to eliminate religion from Spain. This book opened my eyes to one reason behind the loss of faith taking place in Europe today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, Beautiful Writing That Did Nothing For Me","review":"Slow, pointless, unnecessarily complex vocabulary - seemed the author aimed to impress if not by story then by his amazing vocabulary and turn of phrase. For those that like writing for writings sake, this book is great, sip your wine, and enjoy. For those that want a good yarn that grips, squeezes, and maybe leaves a little juice worth drinking in reflection when its all over, this isn't it. The only driving force in this story for me was will power to finish, and the hope that such great writing skill must come with a worthy point by the end of the novel.People that like writing for the sake of clever pros and witty dialog may love this book. In fact, it was emphatically recommended to me by just such a person."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shadow of the Wind - a TOTAL MUST READ!!!!!","review":"First off WOW!! I was pretty much hooked from the first sentence of this book! For a book lover like myself what could be better than a book starting out by the main character visiting something called The Cemetery of Forgotten Books?Right from the start the story is both enchanting and intriguing and impossible to put down!! This book literally has it all; intrigue, action, love story, history, intense love of books, really too much to try and summarize in a review!Basically anyone and everyone who considers themselves a lover of books should go out and find this book immediately!! This is by far the best book I've read in months and I want everyone I know to read this book and be as enthralled and gripped by this book as I was!TOTALLY AWESOME BOOK, BEST BOOK I'VE READ IN MONTHS!!!! EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK, READ WHAT I READ ABOVE AND JUST GO OUT AND GET IT, THIS BOOK HAS IT ALL!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping","review":"I started the book a few weeks ago not sure how it would turn out. The narrative is exquisite and I savoured every word. Carlos Ruiz Zafon is able to paint vivid pictures with great articulation and imagination. The first few chapters were a little slow, with many characters that left me a bit confused and wanting. But that soon evaporated as the story became more and more intriguing. The language is fulfilling, which is more than I can say for many recent novels. The characters are different but interesting. The book undergoes a metamorphosis as the chapters follow one another and I ended up reading more than half the book in less than 24 hours... that is how gripping it was! I recomend it to all of us who like to get 'lost' in a labirynth of words and who enjoy escaping into the pages of another world!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious","review":"I was hooked on this book from the first page. I read it in 2 days and moved on to Angel's Game, and The Prisoner of Heaven. Zafon's imagery is brilliant, his writing crisp, and his plots are intriguing. However, he can be irritatingly incomplete sometimes. I found the ending of the book disappointing, and almost had a feeling that it was a rush job. There are parts of his other books that border on genius as well, but none of them are flawless. I hope Zafon keeps developing as an author - he has potential to be one of the greats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"What more could I possibly add to 877 reviews that will help illuminate your appreciation of this book?I stumbled onto this book by accident, and what a joy! The author writes incredibly well and the story is amazing. I usually get lost when there is a combination of past/present and a lot of characters. Somehow, I managed to stay with the storyline here.How can you not read a book where one of the first paragraphs reads, \\"One of the pitfalls of childhood is that one doesn't have to understand something to feel it. By the time the mind is able to comprehend what happened, the wounds of the heart are already too deep.\\"Simply amazing.Anyhow, this is a great book. Good character development, nice flow, and an incredible story. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I loved this book. It has an intricate plot and is beautifully written. I wish it didn't have to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Live up to the Hype","review":"I realize I'm in the very small minority of readers who didn't fall in love with this story. I tried - I really did! - but couldn't get into the rhythm or the story and gave up after 150 pages. The writing style was formal and a bit florid for my taste and the story didn't engage me - there just wasn't enough there to tantalize me into wanting to pick it back up, always a bad sign.It was slow going and I threw in the towel so I can only tell you about what I did read: the premise is intriguing...a young boy, raised by his antiquarian bookseller father, comes into possession of a mysterious book and its even more mysterious author. As he becomes more involved into solving the disappearance of the book's author, he becomes enmeshed in a world of sinister secrets.Perhaps there was so much hype about this book that when I finally picked it up, my expectations were too high."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing novel","review":"This is the kind of book that grips you almost immediately. Once you start this book you will not be able to put it down. It has all the elements of a great story: mystery, love, sex, scandal, friendship, revenge - you name it, it's in this book. Don't pass it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Five Stars","review":"As others have stated, this novel could have benefitted with a bit of editing here and there, and I wonder if the translation takes a bit away from the impact of the original Spanish. But, I was entranced by the characters and the plot (I did figure out a big plot twist way before it happened; I thought it too obvious to be true). There are many faults that could be pointed out in this work, but there are many wonderful moments as well. One chapter in particular, which I won't mention for fear of spoiling things, I found to be absolutely hypnotic and breathtaking. I hope more of Zafon's books are translated into English, and soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"English or Spanish, one of the best books I have read!","review":"I read the spanish edition as soon as it was available. From the first pages, Ruiz-Zafon grabs your attention in such a way that you JUST CANNOT PUT IT DOWN!! He is able to transport you to Barcelona, the details of the post war lady of the Mediterranean imprints in your mind the horror of a fraticidal war. The plot, which innocently enough, begins with a father and his child sharing a secret, grows in scope and characters that eventually share a common thread. AND just when you think you know what is going to happen next, Ruiz-Zafon turns you and your new found world (the novel) upside down!READ IT! READ IT! I will read it Again. SOON."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"There are worse prisons than words\\"","review":"Let me be up front about this novel: it's one of the best books I have read in years, and considering the number of books I have read, that's a high compliment indeed! It's a beautifully written story, with mystery, suspense, romance, and wonderful descriptive sentences abounding throughout. It's also a great compliment to the translator, whose competence makes one feel as if this book were actually written in English. The characters seem so real, and the background so factual, that it seems to be non-fiction rather than fiction. I don't want to give away any of the plot, but this is a book tha centers around books, reading and authors, and the worlds that are created and lived in by them. I think that this is the author's first novel, and I really hope that it will not be his last!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shadow of the Wind","review":"This book was recommended to me in Tel Aviv before a long flight back to the States. It couldn't have been a better choice. I was brought into the characters and the twists of the story and loved every nuance. I have recommended it for my book club and I am loving reading it again! This time I am reading more slowly to once again taste the words and feel the passion."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Wonderful Ride","review":"If your looking for a good time, this is the book. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment I spent reading it, which was not long enough. I didn't have any expections when I picked it up other than a decent story. I was in for surprise. It's been a long time since I've laughed out loud while reading, and found characters as fun and interesting as those found between these pages. The story was fast-paced and never lagged. The ending was gratifying and I felt satisfied in the end. I plan on starting it over again because I'm sure there are charms I missed.

The case I received, unfortunately is slightly too small, so the lip doesn't wrap all the way around. I do have a zagg body on it but that shouldn't make that big of a difference. I guess in the manufacturing process the clearance wasn't made accurately. This makes it so the phone can't sit all the way in and the back of the iPhone isn't flush against the case. Slightly awkward, but we'll see if the plastic stretches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bamboo iPhone Case","review":"Great case, fits well, people notice the wood, kind of an \\"organic\\" aspect to the iPhone.

I was surprised with the level of quality on the case. Yes, it's just a sliver of bamboo glued onto the back of a white piece of plastic, but it actually looks good. From the picture, you can see that the front of the case doesn't have a lip over the edge of the screen, I wish that it did. I like a case to offer some front protection. The case is very easy to snap on, although, it takes a little work to get the case off. I don't know if I would use this case everyday, but its a fun case to use and people seem interested in it when they see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap case","review":"After a few days the case gets loose and doesn't grip your phone as well.

In the case at hand, the music ranges from Sor (d. 1839) to Eduardo Sainz de la Maza (d. 1982).

I always have it with me when working on AC electrical circuits. Seems quite robust.The beeper is quite loud, little possibility of missing it. And it's easy to test the battery - there should be a beep when you first press the clasp - no beep, don't rely on it.I needed a second tester, so I recently bought a Hioki 3120 based on good reviews. You may prefer the on/off strategy - this one lights green and stays on when the batteries are good and it's turned on. Then it flashes red when near a hot circuit. It's slightly less sensitive than the GVD-504A - for instance, when touched to the exterior of a switch that is turned off it does not show hot. This could be good, could be bad. Your choice.Yes, it uses watch type batteries, but with occasional use mine has lasted for years, so this is not really an issue. It's only 'on' when you press the clasp, so really it's rarely on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable design","review":"I purchased the GVD-504A and was very disappointed with it. In fact, I was so disappointed, I purchased a different unit.This one is sitting in the junk pile.Here are the reasons:1) There is no positive on/off switch - you have to press on the clip to turn it on. This is the main design flaw with this unit.If you don't make a good contact it can be off while you're testing and not chirp. This is a terrible design and is, in my opinion, dangerous! My new unit has a positive on/off switch. You just twist and it's on. When you're done you twist it back and it's off.2) Requires 2 watch type batteries. These are expensive to replace and harder to find. My new unit takes standard AA or AAA batteries (I can't remember which) that are cheap and easy to come by.Overall I would recommend passing on this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"very handy, totally functional","review":"this tool is awesome, good thing is no direct contact needed, beeps are loud enough to warn you...good price too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sensitive to be any use.","review":"This product is too sensitive to be of any use - it will go off if there is any AC in a 3ft radius.

The moves are really complicated, so they have to slow them down to show them to you. This is irritating when you first start out because it's hard to keep your heart rate up.

All the video consists of is about 40 minutes of people coming to the front of the class trying to showoff whatever dance move they are doing. It is a ridiculous waste of time and money.

After kicking the couch a few times, I'm afraid I just packed this tape away. On the plus side, the music was good and the performers had a high level of enthusiasm (although I would say that appreciating Eric Nies' personality must be an 'acquired taste')"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough to learn, but worth it","review":"The first time I put this video in, I was totally lost.

They obviously recognized that it is a complete set of junk as they told me to throw away the old one entirely as it is not compatible with the new one and its new circuitry.I also found it strange that I didn't have to do anything as far as provide a receipt or proof of purchase. Sounds like they have completely given up on this item and are starting from scratch. So if you have one of these call customer service.

The station gave good air pressure reading for the first year I had it. Then the graph started to constantly show steady bars. Even when the alt was set.

I leave home for work 8 and probably make the last pot at 6:30 and when I get home at lunch the coffee is still hot enough to enjoy.

It is suppose to hold 10 cups of coffee but when I put 10 cups of water in the resevoir, the coffee overflows all over my counter and floor. It is also very difficult to clean the carafe. I've written to Braun to let them know my disappointment and haven't heard anything from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timer","review":"Very disappointed in Braun for not adding a timer to this coffeemaker.

I wasn't sure how much difference there would be in the taste with the water filter. WOW!! The coffee is wonderful & brews very quickly. It stays hotter WAY longer than my Mr.Coffee thermal carafe. Looks great on my counter too. So far I have no complaints & I would highly recommend this coffeemaker!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Everything about this product is great, except we feel the coffee is a bit mild in temperature when served. This morning we tried to warm up the jar by pouring hot tap water prior to brewing, and it worked.

Even partially empty, the carafe maintains a satisfactorally hot temperature (if not piping, but the laws of thermodynamics are what they are)for a couple of hours. I've never tried leaving it completely full to test maximum heat retention, but I suspect it might go 3-4 hours.C) It has an automatic shutoff, a clear window to watch the reservoir fill, and an overall design that is both contemporary and compact.Really, there's no reason to buy a maker with a burner anymore, no reason for burnt coffee. This is all you can ask for, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm coffee IS a problem","review":"I've had this for a year now and have always hated it.

I wanted a simple thermal coffee maker with no frills. I like to grind my beans just prior to making coffee, so I didn't need a timer.I wanted a thermal carafe, this one works much better if you fill pot with hot water to preheat while you are filling the water reservoir. I had read several reviews that complained of leaking during the brewing process - I figured out quickly that it was because the measure on the side of the water reservoir was a little too generous for the 10 cup pot - I was used to a 12 cup pot. So I started filling it to just below the 10 cup mark and it made excellent coffee with no spillage.I am happy with my purchase. I like being able to grab a cup before it is finished with the entire pot.

OKAAAAY, I don't really care of the resevoir takes 25 cups - I want to make 10 cups OF COFFEE. As far as I'm concerned they are totally misleading people.

Very good coffee maker for the price. We have had Braun Coffeee makers before, but the glass carafe frequently broke. The thermal carafe makes cleaning a snap and it keeps the beverage hot for upto 8 hours. Two points of caution:1. If you use RO or bottled water in your coffee maker, you will not notice a difference in taste with the water filter attached. You also may NOT need to change the Brita filter every 2 months as recommended. Save your money!2. We use a paper filter over the gold one that comes with the system. It extends the life of the filter and prevents fine grounds in your coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good purchase!","review":"We were looking for a quality coffee maker with a stainless steel carafe and are very pleased with this one!

The simple, well thought-out yet attractive design has a small footprint on your counter top. All the annoying features of other coffee makers seem to have been eliminated. It is one of the few products that are worth every penny, even at the full retail price.One of my favorite features is the mid-brew stop-and-pour. Unlike most other coffee makers, this one does not release the stopper mechanism till the carafe is replaced in the brewing position, eliminating ANY drip. Additionally, the carafe lid is easy to remove and pours without any spilling...something Krupp has yet to overcome with their carafe designs.Ignore any negative points made by others. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive and works well","review":"We have been using this coffeemaker for a month now and I am pleased with it.

With this pot, there is no heat in the base, just the wonderful thermal carafe, which keeps the coffee hot for hours! The only fault I could find with this pot is that the carafe cannot go into the dishwasher. But this is a minor issue, as I rinse it well each day and refill it with hot water overnight, then when I get up, replace with fresh hot tap water while I fix the coffee for brewing.

It DOES give you good tasting HOT coffee for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, the coffee is NOT hot.Yes, I DID try pre-heating the pot with nearly boiling water for 10 mins.before making the coffee.

Does not have extras like 1-3 cup setting or a clock, but I have rarely used those features in the past.

As other reviews have mentioned, I too find that this coffee maker doesn't get the water hot enough to brew a rich tasting pot of coffee. Additionally, the carafe may be thermal but it doesn't keep the coffee hot because it's not coming out of the machine hot enough. The pad that the carafe sits on doesn't offer any warming properties either. I've been very disappointed with this coffee maker ever since I bought it about 3 years ago. On the upside, it's not failing to disappoint me -- it keeps making my warm cups of coffee every day. I keep hoping one day it will break so I can replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun KF600 is a VERY pleasant surprise! Kudos!","review":"After thoroughly researching user feedback in this and other forums, I was still hesitant to purchase the 600. Why? The ~$50 prices was TOO LOW. I've now used it for over a month. As someone has been disappointed with a number of products (e.g. Krups Aromamaster), I must say that I am blown away by the 600. Coffee tastes great and stays hot for hours. Product is easy to use and easy to clean. Design is simple but elegant. Size is just right (not too tall).Designing a good coffee maker should not be rocket science. Unfortunately, it still is. This is evidenced by all the failed efforts and off-target competitors that make compromises to save a few bucks (or even for no apparent reason). Perhaps if the competition USED their own products they might do a better job.The KF600 is a gem. Kudos to the design team - they got it right! $50 does buy a lot. Will a model with a timer be next? (but don't increase the height)."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than Starbucks","review":"I bought this for my husband for Fathers Day and he loves it. He states his coffee tastes better. Machine filters water and is east to use. Plus the stainless finish looks great in the kitchen.However, be aware that the parts of the coffee maker do have to be washed by hand. They cannot go in the dishwasher."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice coffeemaker - makes great coffee.","review":"I am beginning to be a coffee connoisseur...I enjoy good coffee...the likes of Caffe Ladro and Caffe Umbria in Seattle. This coffeemaker is a very good one for your home for the price...$50 with no tax and free shipping - you can't go wrong. I appreciate the removable filter which is very easy to clean. Also featured is a Brita water filter built into the water chamber. It will not take up all of your kitchen counter space - for us apartment dwellers =). Also, I like my coffee hot and this maker does just that. My only suggestion for you is to buy really good coffee and use cold tap water - none of that bottled water stuff. Overall, I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressed with Impressions","review":"I hadn't purchased a coffeemaker in years, but I knew I wanted one that had a thermal carafe, that did not take up much space on the countertop, was simple to operate, and did not have an idustrial appearance. This looked like the one & after reading all the reviews, I decided to purchase it. Very happy with this coffeemaker---it's everything I wanted. But, you MUST preheat the thermal carafe. With first use, I filled the carafe with hot tap water to preheat--not good enough. So, the second time I filled the carafe with BOILING water, let it sit for about 10 minutes, poured the water out and proceeded to make coffee as directed. The leftover coffee was still hot hours later !! (and not bitter)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun Thermal coffeemaker","review":"It doesn't really hold 10 cups, apparently European cups are smaller and it's capacity is 9 cups, and that would be 6 of our large coffee mugs. You must fill the water holder (which has its own water filter) with the thermal carafe, not the 10 cup fill line on the side, which I did and caused it to spill over. Also, make sure the carafe is firmly in place because if it is not, coffee will spill all over. On the positive side, the carafe keeps the coffee nice and hot even after the coffeemaker automatically turns itself off. I probably could have invested in a metal carafe and saved money, but I do like it and use it and a standard Mr. Coffee if I am making alot of coffee for guests or want one pot of de-caff too. It also comes with a mesh coffee filter so you don't have to buy the paper filters too. I found out that the paper ones are still good to trap stray grounds so I use both."},{"rating":"1","title":"dosen't keep coffee hot","review":"I really wish I bought a different model. I'm very disappointed with this Braun. It brews okay, and has a nice, clean, simple design. But I purchased this Braun specifically because I thought it would be nice to have a second cup of coffee mid-morning, without brewing again or running to Starbucks. Unfortunately, this carafe doesn't do the trick. In fact, the coffee is already cooling by the time I get up about a half-hour after my husband. I like hot coffee because I add milk. This is just warm coffee, even though my husband preheats the carafe with hot water before brewing (and who needs that extra step during the morning rush anyway?!). I suspect the lid design might be partially to blame. In reading a description of other coffeemakers I see that some carafe lids screw on tightly; this isn't so tight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor product","review":"After reading several consumer reviews, we chose this coffee maker to replace our Cuisinart. We were disappointed that the Cuisinart had lasted only three years. At least it lasted more than three days! Unfortunately, the original packaging was inadvertently thrown away or we would have returned this product immediately. The automatic shut-off feature only worked for two days, we absolutely have to use paper filters along with the gold basket filter to get decent coffee (we never needed to with the Cuisinart) and for some reason this coffee maker has decided to drip long after it is finished brewing. This machine is a disaster; the basket popped open this morning while it was brewing, sending coffee all over the counter! We will be buying a Cuisinart this week to replace the Braun, even though we will never get our money back for this poor product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Coffee Maker - Convenient","review":"I purchased this coffeemaker to replace a 12cup. I was a bit concerned when I saw the difference in size and almost returned it but I only make 8 cups every morning. To my surprise, I love it. The two main features of this coffeemaker (and we have had our share of them) are 1) Easy pouring method -- you do not have to unscrew the top -- just tilt and pour; and 2) the gold filter basket is wonderful and you never have to worry about running out of paper filters. The Bruan Thermal Coffeemaker is compact and convenient. The added feature is that it comes with the Brita filter (I opt not to use it but will try it eventually). I would highly recommend this machine. LB"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffeemaker","review":"I just replaced my Krups which I had for many years with the Braun KF600.

Initially the coffe is about 150-160 degrees. Within 60 minutes it is about 120 degrees. The warming burner kicks off 17 minutes after the brew cycle is started. I have found that turning the burner back on does little to keep the coffee warm. You can, literally, place your hand on the burner while it is on and not get a burn. If you are just after that first cup of coffee this may be a good buy. I would assume this is not the case if you are looking for a carafe style maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"Good news is: it has a double insulated thermal pot, the bad news is that unless you run extremely hot water in it over and over (wasting water) before making coffee to heat the stainless steel pot, the pot absorbs a lot of the heat from the freshly made coffee We don't find it keeps it hot very long at all compared to a coffee pot with a burner. It's so bad I make less coffee more frequesntly using up more filters. The automatic shut off stopped working after 2 yrs so you have to wait until the coffee is completely finished to pour any - bad quality. It's very hard not to have lots of drips from the filter area, coffee pot itself - you'll go through a paper towel every morning just for your morning coffee. Also, you cannot see through the stainless steel pot to see how much coffee you have left - not good for having company over where you don't want to run out. There are only 3 adults in my home and none of us would buy this Braun coffee maker again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Coffee Maker","review":"This coffee maker is a very basic model that provides excellent service but you have to want basic.

Whether you are pouring yourself a cup or removing the pot early before it has finished brewing.Easy to clean and even easier to use.Prior to purchasing the Brawn KF600, I always used the the Farberware Coffee Pot. They used be the best for HOT coffee and they would last for years (10 plus). They still make hot coffee, but they will only last about 1 year.

Twice now, I've had two different little plastic parts on the filter basket assembly that have snapped off, rendering the unit unusable. I'm a reasonably careful person, so I think the plastic used is just not appropriate for this part.Other than that, I really like this coffeemaker. It's fast, good-looking, I like the water filter and the lack of a heating unit. It could be improved by adding a timer to set the pot to start automatically in the morning, but that's minor.I bought this because of Braun's general reputation, but I'm beginning to wonder how much a name matters anymore. My final opinion will be determined by how Braun handles my complaint and warranty claim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Coffee","review":"Am very pleased with this product. It is simple to use and makes good coffee. I like the filter, but still use bottled water. I use a paper filter in addition to the gold filter basket since the coffee grounds seems to get through the mesh basket and collects at the bottom of the pot. I only wish that this coffee maker came in 12 cups rather than the 10. Like the automatic turnoff and the carafe keeps the coffee hot plus it has cute little feet which keeps the carafe from sitting directly on any furniture. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a good hot cup of coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fairly good coffeemaker","review":"The only disappointment I have with this coffeemaker is that the coffee is not quite hot enough.

The carafe does not hold 10 cups, even though it is sold as a 10 cup maker. So if you fill the reservior to the \\"10\\" mark, the hot coffee just overflows all over the place. What I also found especially fun was that even if you don't fill it 10 but say to 9, you have to be very careful when picking up the carafe or hot coffee dribbles out of the undersized carafe (leaving me with wonderful burns all over my: hand, wrist and forearm). I am really surprised that this thing has not been pulled off the market due to liability. At the very least they should warn the user that the carafe is really only safe to hold about only 8 cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun KF600 Impressions /Absolutely hate it!","review":"I spent a week going over reviews and searching for the right coffee maker.

The water indicator was on the left, and you pour the coffee in the right side! I used my old crafe to put 10 cups of water into this and it was all the way to 12 cups on this one and I still had water left in my crafe! I then brewed a pot with the amount of water I put in the resivore, and when I went to pour a cup, I had coffee all over the counter and floor, the resivore took more water then the crafe!!!!

It took numerous calls to Braun, then of course I had to pack it up and ship it off. Several weeks later it was returned to me and once again, it worked one time. Again, it took several phone calls and I had to pack it up and send it off again. I received a new unit that does indeed heat up, but has several other problems. The drip shut-off mechanism stopped working after a couple weeks, the permanent filter allows grounds to get into the coffee, and if one uses a paper filter, it tends to overflow the filter basket.

So, if you are looking for a 10 cup coffer maker, make sure you get one that holds at least 60 oz, our you will be disappointed.

Even after one hour, the coffee had already cooled down. The directions state you should rinse the carafe with hot water prior to brewing. Even rinsing several times to heat the carafe did no good.

It is now August and the product is still on back order. I canceled the order and called P&G again to find out if there is another way to get a carafe short of buying an entirely new coffeemaker.

They are not permitted to make up their own definition of what a liter is.This coffeemaker came with a braun water filter which had a hole in it.

Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works fine if you like lukewarm coffee","review":"It just does not heat the coffee above lukewarm. I have tried filling carafe with hot water, etc. to no avail. The problem may be that the machine automatically shuts off (for my convenience and safety) after 17 minutes. Whatever it is, I now need to buy a new coffee machine, because this unfortunately just does not work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Coffeemaker I've ever owned!","review":"I've been using this model for 2 months and couldn't be happier! The carafe doesn't leak (yay!). Compact design doesn't take up much space on the counter. Thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot for quite some time (provided you rinse with hot water before brewing as directed). I ditched the gold filter basket because in my experience those things do nothing but clog, but ymmv. The \\"10 cup\\" capacity is indeed a little skimpy, holding only 1/3 cup more liquid than my previous \\"8 cup\\" machine from another manufacturer. Other than that very minor quibble, I have no complaints about this machine. Love it! Buy it, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you REALLY like coffee","review":"This coffee maker is perfect for the connoisseur! There is no burner, so your coffee stays the perfect temp. If you're going to be drinking it over the course of several hours, I'd recommend filling the carafe with warm water for a few minutes prior to brewing to ensure 4 hours later you still have hot coffee. Slow perk, is just the right amount of time to get the perfect cup - no waiting for 15 minutes, but not so quick it doesn't have time to filter through those luscious fresh ground beans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon reviews didn't disappoint me; this is a good coffee maker","review":"This coffee maker is eveything I expected, after reading the reviews here.Positives:* A full carafe brews fast.* Coffee in thermal carafe stays hot for a very long time.* Permanent filter a nice touch (though not as useful for those with septic systems).* Brushed stainless easier to keep clean than regular stainless.* No leaks (like with ALL my Mr Coffees).* Pause-and-serve function good, but reduntant because of the brewing speed.* Automatic shut-off is a nice feature.Cons:* No clock/automatic start.* Brita filter is more a pain then a benefit.* Coffee dribbles down side of carafe when pouring, if you don't hold the carafe just right.All in all a good coffee maker for the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stops and starts","review":"It worked great for about a month and now it will stop brewing halfway through a cycle. I have to move the pot around or turn it on and off to get it to finish. It is a nice looking unit and keeps the coffee warm without burning. I get about 3 good size cups of coffee out of a full pot, so I don't know how they rate it as a 10 cup unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in home brewed","review":"Love the Braun KF600 coffee maker.

Worst coffee maker I've ever had! My carafe hardly keeps the coffee warm (not hot) for an hour -- and I leave hot water in it for at lease 5 minutes. After the first cup I have to nuke it. The carafe is difficult to clean. I can't get my hand in with a sponge, nor can I get a brush up around the underside of the top. It makes good tasting coffee, but I like mine hot, not reheated. Today I decided to give up and get myself a Mr. Coffee.A fifty year connoisseur coffee drinker who grinds her beans, mixes types, and loves her morning coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite coffeemaker to date","review":"...and I've been drinking coffee for years. The only downside is that it is difficult to clean the inside of the carafe which is not dishwasher safe. Otherwise, it brews a great cup of coffee and keeps it warm for hours. I love the removable filter holder. It doesn't have a lot of frills, but I've never been one to prepare my coffee ahead of time since I like the beans freshly ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice, but one problem","review":"Looks great, makes great coffee, coffee stays warm for hours. This is my second Braun. My first was 8 years old and still fine. I only replaced it because we wanted stainless to match. One minor problem:No matter how much or little coffee I use (with a paper filter), the grounds always end up floating over the top of the paper filter. They don't make it into the prepared coffee or leak out of the machine, but it makes cleaning the filter more difficult. You have to remove it and rinse it every time. My other Braun did not have this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffeemaker meets expectations","review":"We are very pleased with the Braun thermal coffeemaker. Coffee smells and tastes good. It took a bit of practice with amounts and grinds but we have that down now and love the coffee this machine makes.

I've resorted to pan toasting in order to avoid another bad purchase. Finally got tired of so much effort for toast and broke down and got this toaster. It's so easy to use and it even defrosts frozen bread and can warm up an already toasted slice without retoasting. Worked amazingly well to heat a cold slice of pizza but I'm sure Braun is cringing if they read this! I love the little pull out tray, you don't have to pick up the whole darn thing and hold it over the sink and beat it to death! The toast comes out very even and perfectly toasted every time. Slots are wide too so a bagel is no problem. It is fast too, so you won't miss it not being a 4 slice toaster.

Now, with the internet, I am looking for the right tool. Yes, this does the job, it is inexpensive and basically, you get what you pay for. If you crimp the cap too tight, it cracks. If you don't crimp tight enough, you get a fuzzy picture. It doesn't stip or cut the cable and it doesn't give the professional fit you get from the cable companies, which is what I am looking for. My advice is to spend a little more money and get a coax cutter and compression crimper. That's what I'm looking for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful gift of poems","review":"Averno shows Gluck at her best, giving us gifts of radiant poetry that lights a path to the dark mysteries of being human.

In other words- my mother, and I, have always cared for my grandmother.This book fits our needs perfectly!

I love futuristics, they are probably my absolute favorite romances, except for dragon-involved ones. Three hours later I put it down, just managing to resist tossing it against a wall. I know that there are only so many plots to futuristic romances, but please! The characters were interesting, but the rest of the book was so predictable and seen-before. After I was done, I couldn't remember half the characters names, and I didn't care about them anyway! I gave this book two stars because there was an itsy bitsy subplot romance that I thought quite enjoyable. While at one point I would have considered buying the others in this series, I think I'm going to pass. If you like your \\"usual\\" futuristic romances from Lovespell, think about picking it up. If you go more toward Dara Joy, Sharon Lee or even Susan grant, I'd give it a pass.

There's almost always a rough spot or something that is unrepairable unless you recut it. It cuts fine, just tough to get it aligned perfectly in the 90 so you don't end up with odd little edges. Maybe had it been larger so you could really wedge the corner up in there, it would be more accurate.

(review for small punch)","review":"I'm pretty new to paper crafts but wanted to attempt some DIY elements for our wedding invitations. I was skeptical about such a low priced corner punch but it was one of the best tools we bought for our project! It's actually quite difficult to mess up. I even let my fiance take over punching the rest of the invitations. You just turn it upside down so you can see the paper line up to the notch and you're ready to punch. I'll upload some detailed photos so you can get a better look. They have this removable clip so you can attempt other patterns but I felt it was pretty difficult. I would stick to just corner punches with this tool. It's also much smaller than the other corner punches that I've seen so it'll tuck away quite nicely. Plus, it's about half the price of those other punches. I highly recommend this tool for anyone on a budget or even a first timer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent for occasional usage","review":"I concur with other reviewers that it's just \\"ok\\" because it's not anything special, really. It's only as precise as the person using it because if you're not holding it just right and don't push down on it correctly, it won't necessarily cut the way you'd like it to. It is not meant for thick paper and for multiple sheets of thin paper, for that matter. I think it's really only good for random small things that you don't need to cut often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Measurements Needed","review":"I'm giving this product four stars because there's no measurement on the packaging. Otherwise it's a great little punch for the price. It turned out to be 1/4\\", and larger than I was looking for. I didn't find that out until I had opened the package and could no longer return it. I bought it with the intent to use it on tarot cards, which another reviewer finds it great for. I think it's just a bit big once the tarot cards are made so much smaller by the removal of the borders.If you need a 1/4\\" corner rounder, this is the one for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Good You Guys!","review":"Perfect size to create custom playing cards and rounded business card corners.

Bette plays a mother who can't give the best to her daughter and slowly pushes her away which causes her daughter to go to her father to live. Bette doesn't seem to really fit this role as a more dramatic actress such as Susan Sarandon or Meryl Streep would have effectively fit this role. John Goodman and Trini Alvarado as well as Martha Mason and Stephen Collins all give good performances that very well keep the movie going.

Who really was the girl who posed in Vermeer's famous Painting The Girl with a Pearl Earring? I think all of us have wondered this before when studying great works of art. Was the model someone important to the artist or someone who just captured their eye for a fleeting second?Chevalier does a remarkable job of introducing us to 17th Century Dutch life and in bringing us into Vermeer's household. Griet, the model for the painting, begins life as a maid to Vermeer. Over time her relationship to the painter becomes increasingly complex and brings to head a number of problems in the household.Chevalier's writing is simple yet effective.

This one does not, or at least not much of one.I'm not interested in reading character studies, and if I was, this wouldn't be one I had liked. An untrained, uneducated serving girl has the know how to fix the arrangement of a master artist's paintings so they become great. Uh huh. I don't think so.

Find something with a plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is INCREDIBLY DULL and a TOTAL waste of money","review":"I am currently reading this book because I work part time while going full time at college. This book is INCREDIBLY boring. The main character, Griet or however you spell her name, is one-sided, flat, and pricelessly dull beyond belief. She talks so little she could almost be a mute. I like her descriptions about the children and the food. other then that this book leads you nowhere. Its a narrative with no point, and it doesn't give any insight into any characters or to the history that surrounds the characters. Like, the author does not give any perspective into the mysterious disease that surrounds them. The character's boss' wife, Catharina, has babies, they eat food, and Griet (the maid in this book, for she works for the famous painter Vermeer)says nothing and does even less. This book is horrible. At first I was going to give it a C- (paltry mediocrity) but now I'd rather give it a D. NOT WORTH BUYING.

I suspect GIRL may be one of those overrated books that people are afraid to admit they don't like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulp fiction","review":"I can not understand all the hallaballoo about this work.

The characters were well fleshed out. However, I felt they were passionless, lacking in wit, kindness, and character. No one in the book has a sense of humor, most of the characters are surly, and they all tip toe around each others' emotions. Also, I did not care for the sexist treatment of the main character, and her acceptance of this as what she deserved. In all, the book left me as warm as a Dutch sky in January."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read this year","review":"This is the best book I've read all year. The author's description of Holland in the 1600s is so vivid, it feels like you are walking the cobbled streets alongside the main character. At the same time, she has not cluttered her book with mundane descriptions or details. Her language is simple and crisp, easy on the reader. The story itself is graceful, but riveting. It's like listening to fine music. You want to see what happens next, but at the same time, you don't want it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but no masterpiece","review":"I read this book in two days. While it was appealing to me as a person interested in art and gave me a renewed appreciation of Vermeer, it has little more to offer than that. The writing is cut and dry and the characters are just generic, paper-doll types (the humble maid, her witch of a mistress, the more understanding elderly lady). Chevalier seems afraid to develop too much the character of Jan Vermeer lest her description strays too far from historical accuracy. This is a bland novel with an anticlimatic, yet realistic, ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"It started off good","review":"The book started off a good read, tenison and sorrow. However I was left with the feeling the author lost interest about half way through. I am not a student of this time period so was left confused over several plot twists such as why would being painted in a picture lead to ruin?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing -- so overrated","review":"Never have I been so bored by the style of writing, nor so angry at the flimsy content of a book capitalizing on my favorite artist's life. As stated elsewhere, the cover art was the lure here, and I also had to force myself to finish it, waiting for a momentum which never materialized. This book left me feeling ripped off, since $12+ for a paperback is not peanuts. The book's cover hyperbole bears no relation to the book that I plodded through. These accolades, and others read elsewhere, were too freely bestowed on a very minor talent. Who are these book reviewers setting standards for the rest of us? Tracy Chevalier should give up writing -- no-one else can drag out nothingness for page after page as she can. I would not even pass this book along to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":":((","review":"I was highly disappointed with this book!

The plot is interesting enough, but everything is lopsided and flat. There is not any real back stories to the characters themselves. A lot of things are based on local market gossip with almost no explination. What really bothered me is that Griet sounds more educated than she really is. She is barely semi-literate. It says in the book that all she knows is only to write her name and read her prayer book. She cannot read somebody else's hand writing or printed words in anything else. That really bothered me. We don't really get to know her family in depth and that was a big plot hole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich Story","review":"This historical novel smoothly weaves fact and fiction into a fascinating tale about 17th-century Delft, Jan Vermeer and a young woman's coming of age. It's a rich story that should be read slowly and savored, and at that, it ends too soon.Midway through, I went to the library and checked out a Time-Life book about Vermeer in order to have copies of his paintings beside me as I read about them in The Girl With a Pearl Earring. It doubled my reading pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAAAAWWWWNNNNNNNNN","review":"Not quite sure why this continues to be on bestseller lists. I found this book to be rather empty. Great idea to tell a story behind a paiting -- but beyond that, the story isn't that original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banal and Mediocre at /best","review":"WOW,what an overrated work!!!! Frankly, I don't understand all the accolades. There is not one original or interesting character in the book. The author serves up every stereotypical family member imaginable; the talented and somewhat dysfunctional artist, the amazinlgly spoiled, vapid and selfish wife, the tough as nails wise old crone of a mother/mother-in-law with the obligatory heart of gold, the nasty little demon-child daugher, and the protagonist peasant girl who is superior in every way, mentally, morally and culturally to any of the other charcters, except perhaps the \\"master\\" who does her in the end with the post of an earring. It goes beyond laughable directly to the realm of Hollywood material.If you aren't a very ciritical reader or if you are not familiar with Vermeer's works, this is up your ally but if you don't have much time on your hands and you want to read something of substance pass this one by."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating Look Into the Life Of Vermeer","review":"The best way to read this novel is with a book of Vermeer's artwork by your side! I enjoyed thumbing through it and looking at his paintings while simultaneously reading \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring.\\"This is the most fun I have had with historical fiction, and because not much is known about Vermeer, I appreciated Tracy Chevalier's efforts. I especially loved the descriptions of Griet making the paint for Vermeer, the scenes in the streets of Delft, family life in the 1600's, and the creative process of Vermeer.This is a great gift for Vermeer fans or historical fiction readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Easy Read","review":"I enjoyed this book very much because of the simplicity of the authors writing. It was easy to read, very discriptive and an image of Holland, which is not usually written about.

I finished it in two days; I couldn't put it down. The use of language and description was fascinating. I would definitely recommend it.

It gives insight into the desires and disappointments we all have to face in our life. Even one innocent choice can lead to disaster and unhappiness for ourself and others, who may be unaware of our choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting, yet profoundly haunting.","review":"This novel is a real gem of a story, written with Chevalier's trademark lyrical prose which brings her settings and characters to life. She portrays 17th Century Delft and its society wonderfully. However, I feel that the quality of this novel which gives it special value is that it has the same feeling as its namesake painting-a feeling of wistful poignancy and quiet longing. Chevalier has done well to create a storyline which is based on this feeling, one of Griet, a girl forced to serve as a maid of the Vermeers to support her family. Working for them she is awakened to the wider world around her, and as she is torn between the lavish art of Catholicism and her upbringing as a proud iconoclastic Protestant, her passion for Johannes Vermeer himself remains, which leads to the dramatic painting of her portrait, and the loss of innocence that results from it, so quietly yet powerfully embodied in the image of the pearl earrings. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully crafted novel","review":"Finishing this book is like eating a gourmet meal. You didn't need it, but it sure was enjoyable. Girl With a Pearl Earring is fine storytelling; at the close, you'll wish it were a true account of Vermeer's masterpiece. Told in first person by teenage maid, Griet, this novel creates a passionate tension like in all those great Merchant Ivory films. Repressed sensuality, religious differences, conniving women, dastardly rich folks - it's all here. This book is an excellent choice for Book Clubs everywhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"The book has a simple structure and there is nothing new or exciting in the story. This is the kind of book you should read on a plane ride but don't expect anything deep, meaningful or original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascination","review":"How imaginative of author Chevalier to compose such a well-rounded novel around the question of why the painter's \\"common\\" subject is wearing a valuable pearl earring. A memorable and thought-provoking story, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible","review":"Incredible in the sense of being difficult to believe, and not in the sense of being amazingly good. Three examples:An uneducated maid should not be expected to understand art better than an accomplished painter -- especially one of the stature of Vermeer. Yet Griet tells us she changed the composition of two of Vermeer's paintings, including the title piece, noting that she could see what needed to be changed before Vermeer did.Second, Griet speaks with an unexpectedly lyrical voice for someone who cannot read (except for her name). How she came to learn such poetical construction without proper schooling is unclear.Finally, the scene in the alley with Pieter -- after Griet shows her hair to Vermeer -- defies all credibility. It is completely out of character.This book is a fine diversion for a few hours, but it is not a great novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"work of art","review":"I loved this book! The painting on the cover of the book caught my attention and I could not stop reading. Griet was wonderful! The story read like a painting. Just as Vermeer's work looks like photographs of daily life. When I finished this book I felt like i had lived in that time and place also. And under different circumstances, Griet could hve been a great painter also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl with a Pearl Earring","review":"I recently visited the Vermeer exhibit in NYC and was captivated by the beauty of his work. I saw this book displayed in the youth section of the library, but because of the subject matter I decided to give it a read, not expecting \\"great literature\\". I was pleasently surprised by the authors beautiful use of words and although the main character was somewhat contradictory, it was a thoroughly satisfying book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant.","review":"Tracy Chevalier weaves a terrific fictional story based on the real painting by the real painter, Johannes Vermeer. All 35 of Vermeer's paintings are transcendent and evocative, but the work upon which this book is based is by far his masterpiece. Chevalier's story follows the young maid, Griet, who works for the Vermeer family and is drawn into the reclusive painter's studio. The story is subtle and sweet and heartbreaking and honest. Chevalier's writing is a brilliant example of how a writer can balance a heady story with a rich setting, never sacrificing her story to overindulge herself in her gift for description - and she truly has a gift. The book is like literary chocolate, easy to devour and fondly remembered. If you haven't read it, I heartily recommend it; it's the perfect by-the-fireside book for winter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Ever Happens...","review":"I heard so much about this book but I felt that not only were the characters underdeveloped but the story was as well. I kept waiting for something, anything, to happen, and nothing ever did.There were so many directions she could have taken this simple story, and instead it led disappointingly nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Example of Bad Writing","review":"Not only is this book pretentious and poorly written, it's dull. The author tries desperately to be blunt and sound truthful, but she basically just sounds forced and stylized. When she tries to be surprising, I just find myself irritated. The overall feel of this book is that of an amateur playing with someone else's characters - you read it but dismiss it as arbitrary and temporary. Every few sentences she remembers she's supposed to be sounding poetic and throws in a sentence like 'She said his name like cinnamon on her tongue' (I'm paraphrasing here.) I ask you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful historical fiction!","review":"The book is written in the first person, the narrator being a teenaged maid. Apart from the fact thtthte style is unconvincing (no teenager I know could think like this), the plot resembles a Victorian softcore s and m romance more than it does life in the 17th Ct. Netherlands. What is particualrly odd is that we're supposed to like the narrator, a thoroughly ungenerous, judgmental, superior, witholding, and smug character who is basically a Daddy's girl. She is happy to criticize the other women in the household in order to get Vermeer's attention, as if she were saying, \\"Daddy, daddy, I can clean better than they can. Paint me (Guess what else) me too!\\" The novel tells us next to nothing about Vermeer, his painting, or the process of painting them. Nor does it tell us anything about being a model. If you want to read good historical fiction, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but not too good","review":"This book was okay... Very well written, nice descriptions, well developed charecters, belivible events ect...But the book has little plot, no real story line and untimitly goes nowhere. Rather like everyday life. If you want to hear about everyday life (as I know some do) then you will love this book.But if you'd enjoy some plot, a bit of story and something more then day to day stuff, then this book is not for you. It is also reletivly slow to develope into even appriciatable work.Something for anyone who reads this to know, this book is highly over rated and if you read with those expectations you will be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The author, Chevalier, had a good idea of weaving a story around a famous painting, but this book is a big let-down; it was downright boring. Considering that Chevalier has a degree in creative writing, she does a poor job writing this book creatively. The characters are dull and lifeless. What's more, you just don't care about any of the people in this book. The ending is so predictable - I didn't even have to read it. I don't know how anyone can rate this book highly or recommend it, and I can't believe it made it to the New York Times bestseller list."},{"rating":"1","title":"What would Vermeer think?","review":"I personally adore art, history, Vermeer, and creative writing, but I found, in this case, the author's attempt to blend all of these elements into a meaningful novel turned out largely unimaginative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art, History, And A Great Story!!!","review":"Ms. Chevalier has done it again taking a historic work of art and creating a believable story to how this painting came about.Ms. Chevalier has a very lyrical way of writing that is not only vividly descriptive, but also draws you into 17th century Delft. I managed to read this book in one sitting since the story of Griet and her sensual awakening which is triggered by her going to work as a maid for an artist and his family was totally captivating.For a fast read that is truly a work of art in it's own write you can't go wrong with anything written by Ms. Chevalier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent plot, well-developed characters","review":"Easy to read, yet full of life. I'm a 17 year old reader and I think the book's greatest attributes are the characters. Believable, deep, and interesting. The plot was outstanding. Sadly, after finishing the book, I was upset that it was already over! When I first bought the book, I was afraid it might be a waste of money - that this would be another one of those books that goes on forever and is über-artsy, but it isn't at all.

Very enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy reading","review":"This was the first book I read in a day.

The premise was intriguing at first, but the story fell apart when she began discribing the painters life, and the way he worked.

I have read this basic story line a thousand time, in a thousand books, and alot of them were better written than this one.I wasted four hours of my life reading this nonsence. This was supposed to have been about about Vermeer and it wasn't, his name and painting was used as a hook by the author to sell her book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eclectic Garbage","review":"A book full of modern sentiments but set in the 17th Century.

I was looking forward to reading a rich novel about this painting and was quite disappointed by the writing. I thought the premise was clever, giving life to who the girl in the painting was and using that as a springboard for the story about Vermeer, his life, his family, and life during that period of time. Tracy Chevalier's writing felt stilted, the characters were not fully developed, and I was left wondering why I had read it at all.

Alas, it fell short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light and Fluffy","review":"While this novel is \\"richly imagined,\\" it lacks sophistication and depth, and the writing style leaves a lot to be wished for. Vermeer has long been one of my favorite artists, but -- while I think this is an intriguing topic -- it needs, perhaps, a different author to handle it. The book has a vacuous, \\"goodie-goodie\\" feel that strikes me as being aimed at adolescent readers rather than at adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable and thought provoking","review":"This book relates the adventures of a young girl forced into becoming a maid by a family misfortune. The struggles of someone without status or power to navigate her way through her new masters (with their contrary demands), mischevious children, and powerful community members makes for a very good plot.I would highly recommend this book to all readers. No special interest in history or art is required.Side note: This story is so well done that I think the only possible criticism might be related to its very perfection. Griet-our young maiden and main character-seems to be just a bit too perfect; both in her responses to each situation, as well as perhaps also her keen powers of observation. (Critics of Fitzgerald's \\"Great Gatsby\\" have said something similar, e.g., that Jordan Baker's knowledge of the details of Daisy's past are difficult to credit.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what they meant by Catharsis","review":"This was an exquisite book. I was constantly amazed by the flat emotional style amid the well chosen description - and the story gripped me. Griet's gradual disassociation from herself and her family is quite moving, and seems inevitable from the beginning of the story. I wanted more for Griet than what she got, but any other ending would not have made sense with the time and place of the book...I don't know that I could say I want to read it again. It reminded me of the movie Schindler's List - I was glad I had seen it, but I didn't necessarily want to relive the emotions by seeing it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really 3.5, since her other novels are better","review":"When I saw the movie I thought, \\"Wow, this really looks like a Dutch Renaissance painting in every frame!\\" However, when I read the book I felt like I was walking through such a painting on every page; which was even more awesome.I like the way Chevalier looks at and writes about art and color. When the colors of Griet's vegetables fought in the opening of the novel I knew this was a writer with an artist's eye. And who better to write about Vermeer than an author who appeciates the play of light with color, the influence of history and culture on painting, and the elevated role of women in painting while they were degraded in society. This was a highly visual novel that was fun to read. Chevalier's style is easy yet intelligent.As usual the book is better than the movie--read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl with the Pearl Earring","review":"Go back to a time when the classic painters were honing their talents, and you find yourself immersed in this beautiful novel that is a sort-of biography of Vermeer. After reading this book, I felt I knew all his secrets for producing his beautiful paintings filled with light. The story is seen in the eyes of a young servant girl who later becomes the subject of the title painting. Her feelings as a girl maturing into a young woman are heart wrenching. Well worth reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Perhaps I delved into this book with overblown expectations. Or perhaps the author intended to write a simplistic love story rather than tackle the complexity and depth of the art. Whichever the case, I was very disappointed with \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring.\\" Vermeer's \\"Girl\\" is one of my favorite paintings, so I was thrilled to hear that someone had written a novel about it. Unfortunately, Ms. Chevalier's girl does not have the depth of character that I imagine the girl in the portrait to have. Every character in the book, including Vermeer, seems so one-dimensional that I had a hard time sympathizing with any of them. I do appreciate Ms. Chevalier's understanding of the Dutch and think that her description of Delft did merit a couple of stars. But as a documentary of Dutch life and culture in the 17th century, I much preferred reading Simon Schama's Embarrassment of Riches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clumsy writing style is no match for Vermeer","review":"I found this novel impossible to finish, mainly because the clumsy, self-conscious style started to grate with me pretty quickly. The narrator is a servant girl; so the author adopts what she thinks is a child-like narrative voice. But this does not stop her indulging in an endless parade of clumsy metaphors. Eyes are 'gray like the sea'; hair 'red like wet brick', her mother's eyes are 'two warnings' (because she has two eyes? Oh dear) - and all this on page 1. The idea, it appears, is that, despite her lack of education, this simple girl is possessed of an artist's eye. But do painters think in endless drab metaphors? I doubt it. Visual art, by definition, is a process that's impossible to evoke in words. And these artless efforts, for me at least, fell woefully short. While there are some carefully researched period details, this doesn't compensate for for an dreary prose style that never feels anything other than late 20th Century."},{"rating":"1","title":"unimpressed","review":"I was so excited to read this book--every time I saw it in the book store I thought..this is the next one! However, upon finishing the novel I am left with a sense of longing for a deeper, more richly worded novel, and a plot that does not leave one hanging on for more. The plot is too simple and ends with little to no resolution. Griet realizes very little about herself, and we are left not liking or especially disliking Vermeer. One would like to cultivate a reader's relationship with him as well. I wanted much more in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss","review":"I was dissapointed in this novel. From the hype I was expecting to be transported to 17th C. Holland, and to understand more about the great painter Vermer. Wrong. Nothing happens, no insight, no layers of meaning. Perhaps a good children's book--but really, what is the fuss!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"When we meet the protagonist, her family has lost its livlihood because her father was disfigured in a horrible accident. With an opening like that, you'd think you'd feel some sort of emotion about the family: it would be hard for an author to make it so that you DON'T care. Well, Chevalier manages.There was no character that was multi-dimensional. No one grew or learned anything. The ending was a cop-out and random. I had no sympathy for anyone, except perhaps Vermeer's shrew of a wife: I'd be pretty sick of looking after all those kids with such a pathetic husband too. Somehow, I don't think that's what Chevalier intended.The Dorothy Dunnett books provide a MUCH better insight into merchant life in the early Rennaissance. Skip this simplistic, poorly written book and check them out instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Girl with the Pearl Earrings","review":"The style of writing in this novel was appropriate for a ten year old girl who is just beginning to read novels.

I think that because of her love for the book I went in with high expecatations. I will give it this: it was a fun read, an easy read, and a midly entertaining read. I just felt that it was a little too bland and just shy of really making an impression. If you are look for relief from heavier and more challenging read, then this book would be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I don't read a lot of books but this one was recommended by a friend. I literally could not put the book down. It draws you in and makes you eager to find out what happens next.

Although there are some sleazy sexual come-ons by the rich patron and other scenes, the sexual content is fairly mild and it would be appropriate for a teenager, certainly one Griet's age.

Ever had a silly grin on your face when no one else is laughing? Has your foot ever tapped to its own accord from simple joy? I paint this picture of myself as I sat in a train station and started this novel. I was consumed with the passion and multiple layers of the work as an artist is impassioned at the easel. Chevalier uses a palette of words like Vemeer used hues to cast images and make breath catch in awe of creativity. She is a new master of the literary brushstroke, evoking mental pictures and emotions, showing rather than telling me the story and setting. I rarely read a book more than once, but the plot and the prose are both worthy of greater inspection.

Lawrence Johnson's review below (dated February 8) says it all.If this book aspires to anything, it is sexual coming-of-age for the heroine. Anticipation and tension lend an erotic air, but the story never really lifts off. The bits about art and Vermeer's life may be gleaned from artbooks or biographies.It's like superior Mills & Boon romance, with its stereotypes: the downtrodden heroine, the sexy, enigmatic master, quasi-evil patrons, jealous wives/mothers/daughters. Unfortunately the narrative is limited to the single perspective of the self-satisfied Griet. But other viewpoints, such as that of her suitor, the sexy but smelly young butcher Pieter, or her antagonist, the vindictive Cornelia, would have given more light and shade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words like Brush Strokes","review":"Tracy Chevalier does a beautiful job bringing the main character to life, to such an extent that by the end of the book, you can almost see Griet stepping down out of the painting in full, vibrant, three dimensionality. While telling a rich and detailed story, Chevalier weaves in complex social issues that create a commen thread between Griet and today's women. Just like the time-intensive oil portraits which are painstakingly created layer by layer, Chevalier has created, word by word, a sensitive and touching picture of a girl with heart, morals, and determination. Don't pick this book up if you crave action packed excitement. But if you want to immerse your senses in a world long-past, Chavalier will captivate you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple yet richly satisifying","review":"Marvelous descriptions, delightful characterizations, flow of plot and the nice, not quite unexpected twist at the end, more, Tracy, please!

A good book that will surprise you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely historical novel","review":"I enjoyed this unusual historical novel. The portrait \\"Girl With A Pearl Earring\\" by the famous Dutch painter, Vermeer, apparently is considered \\"the Dutch Mona Lisa\\" because of the girl's enigmatic look as she gazes at the painter. This book tells a possible story explaining the painting. It revolves around a young maid who worked at the painter's house, and who was enthralled with his work (and him). The story takes place in the highly stratified and puritanical Dutch culture of the mid 17th century. When I finished the book, I felt that I has just read a beautiful fable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shimmering Subtlety","review":"\\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" is nothing short of brilliant. I was compelled to read it--I couldn't put it down, and read it in two days. Ms. Chevalier has woven a tale, based on speculation, that is not only fascinating and beautiful--but also entirely plausible. The author's subtle use of color and light to lead us to an understanding of the title character's inner conflict; burgeoning sexuality; and spiritual struggle (in the wake of this newly-aroused sexuality) is as delicate as Griet herself--and as passive-aggressive-forceful as VerMeer. This is an amazing read--I want to give a copy to everyone I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book- Kept me captivated from start to finish","review":"WOW! What an exceptional masterpiece! I loved that book so much i'm aiming to read it more than a couple of times. I can't even move on to another book because all i can think about is \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\". IT IS BY FAR THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I LOVE IT SOOOO MUCH. I even purchased the painting (which is framed in my room) and I also purchased the movie with Collin Firth (who by the way did a FANTASTIC job playing Vermeer, who i found as my FAVORITE character in the movie).

I found myself surfing the web for sites containing pictures of Vermeer's paintings while I was reading Chevalier's fictionalized account of how they came to life. The author has a great eye for the sometimes mundane details of day-to-day life and her dialogue is sparkling. This is one book that is well worth reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read for any artist.","review":"\\"Girl with the Pearl Earring\\" is a wonderful read for any emerging or struggling artist, or even those fascinated by art history. Chevalier takes the reader into the world of competitive Dutch art, where a now famous artist whose paintings sell for very high numbers, struggled to compose and find inspiration in a world not-so-glamorous. It's inspiring to know that even great artists like Vermeer faced the same struggles that today's artists do. The details of how the pigments were created, stored, and cherished is enlighting, while the veiw of the possible 'model', Griet, brings greater depth to an already fasniating and intriguing painting. Was the girl with the pearl earring thinking of deep secrets as she sat for the artist, or simply thinking of surviving in trying Times. Definately a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a reader from ca","review":"Well, as far as I'm concerned, I thought this book was interesting as well as facinating.

I read a couple of reviews and the excerpt and decided to try it out. Now, I'm not the kind of person who would read a historical fiction but this one was great.

She knows the BEST way to: perform every household chore; handle young children; manipulate lazy wives; grind paint for Vermeer; find a pawn shop; bargain with butchers, and fend off inappropriate sexual advances. She's a big snore. Vermeer is the artist incarnate burning with inspiration and passion but lacking any discernable personality - an ephemeral flame.If you like the following excerpts, this book is for you:\\"I should have begged him not to ruin me.\\" (page 195) , \\"Never so much trouble with a maid before.

It is the story of an impoverished girl who is sent to be a lowly maid in the Vermeer household in the mid 1600s. Her interaction with the master, whilst quite innocent, is a catalyst for suspicion and jealousy amongst other members of the household, both above and below stairs.

It is a linear slice that offers little insight in the trials and tedium of tending to a struggling artist's household and studio.You will not explore the rich values of class distinction, religious casts, beoming of age, respect or creative genius. While these elements are present, they are reduced to clichés and left to the reader to surmise.Chevalier's syntax and rhythm did not lend itself to the images, fears and angst that she was ushering us through.Chevalier is narrating from a safe and comfortable position, she never managed to transcend her main character.I am baffled that the book enjoyed such a wide following."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!

But what is truly wonderful is the 20th century voice of Griet, the maidservant, who evolves and matures under the watchful eye of her master, the great painter Vermeer. You read this book with your heart in your mouth, greedy for the next page, and to find out how the story of these fascinating characters will end. This story of the maidservant and the painter is not formulaic, Vermeer does not seduce Griet on page 1, and it is not predictable.

We enter Vermeer's world through the first-person narrative of Griet, a young sixteen-year old maid. In typical Cinderalla-like fashion, Griet is hated by Vermeer's wife and daughter, Cornelia. Griet, pious and beautiful, maintains her place in the home, gaining the attentions of the male characters.Chevalier tells rather than shows, breaking the first rule of good writing. In addition, her prose is amateurish: simplistic and syntactically dull.
