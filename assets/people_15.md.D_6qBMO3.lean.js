I was disappointed in this book. I don't know what Carr was trying to achieve with this novel, but it's a combination of mystery and science fiction that doesn't quite come off, in my humble opinion.It takes place in 2023, and it's mainly about the assassination of the President in 2018. The investigation into it takes the main character, psychiatrist Dr. Gideon Wolfe, through many confusing twists and turns, and I was left confused and wondering what Carr was trying to prove here. It was not easy reading, and it seemed as if the book had been written in haste--there was not the character development nor the detailing one expects from Carr's fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"God awful","review":"A few pages into this book I stopped and thought \\"what ...is this!?!\\"This book seems to be a collection of cardboard characters that have been combined with Mr. Carr's laundry list of complaints about current society and government.

Why don&#65533;t you pound it in our heads over and over again throughout the book? No, 25 times isn&#65533;t enough! Please repeat it like a mantra!Yeesh.That and it also reads bad makeover of a Doc Savage novel with a dash of clumsy sexuality added.I really don't understand what happened after the two \\"Alienist\\" books but this was 99% worse than either of those.I so wanted to like this novel, but it took all my effort to finish it off.All I can say is \\"WOW&#65533;... much as I would when seeing a car wreck.Mr Carr, better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck?","review":"I read both the Alienist and Angel of Darkness and found them engaging, authentic, and incredibly enjoyable.

Although some of the initial ideas were good, the plot was thin and could not hold my interest. The characters were not given as much depth, as in his first two novels, therefore, as a reader I could have cared less of what happened to them. All in all, this was a huge disappointment.

I didn't care what happened in Mr. Carr's pulp science fiction novel. Flash Gordon was better. I loved the Alienist, didn't like Angel of Death....and didn't have the strength for Killing Time. I started the book looking forward to Mr. Carr's insightful, beautifully described look into the future. Unfortunately, he offers up one or two twists on what the world will be like in 23 years, kind of like seeing the Statue of Liberty buried in the sand in the \\"Planet of the Ape's\\" movie.

What astounds me is how someone who was so masterful at creating imagery in his last two novels has done such a poor job of creating it in this book. The characters lack substance, the futuristic plot is simplistic and ineffective, and Carr's writing lacks the polish of his earlier work. I finished this book not because of its quality, but because of my respect for the author. By reading this, you will truly be \\"killing time\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh!

I can't believe it. It reads like a bad college attempt at a novel. Characters are flimsy, the narrator is voluble but without form, and the constant message that things will get unimaginably worse and so and so will feel incredibly worse...well, it has to be either another person's book under Carr's name or some ploy to earn a few dollars on a discarded manuscript. The ideology of it is childish. Yikes."},{"rating":"1","title":"big mistake","review":"After reading and enjoying Mr Carr's 1st two books, I happily grabbed this book up and was ready for an entertaining evening. Sadly, this may be the worst book I have read in the last ten years. Immature, pointless, self-serving, and just plain bad. Mr. Carr shows much promise as a novelist and it is a shame he stank so bad here. Whoever Mr. Carr is trying to emulate with this dreck should try to shake some sense back into him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"Caleb Carr should be embarrassed that this awful book is in print. An interesting premise, completely unsupported by anything remotely resembling good story-telling. Cardboard characters are a total yawn, and (worse) the protagonist is a passive witness, along for the ride, doing virtually nothing to drive the story forward. Speculative fiction, when done well, draws us so completely into its world that we experience it as though we were there, and care for its characters as though they were brothers. This book doesn't even come close to inspiring the \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" its subject matter requires. I'm glad I got it from the library, and didn't pay a cent for it. I wouldn't have bothered to finish it, but I was curious to see how far downhill it would get by the end. I enjoyed CCs first two books, but if this is what he's writing now, it will be a long time before I waste a minute on another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where do I go to get my money back?","review":"Seldom have I been as disappointed in a book as this one by Caleb Carr. Having read and thorougly enjoyed his first two novels -- The Alienist & The Angel of Darkness -- I was excited to find this newest work and very anxious to read it. Maybe somebody else is writing under his name, because this one shows none of the writing abilities such as the sense of narrative, the attention to detail, the descriptive mastery of his first two. It is almost like this is an outline, sketchy at best, for a tale of great scope. His description of the holocaust created within is so minute, that it removes all sense of purpose for the characters' actions. And he can do so much better. This is just a bad, bad book. Only his name could have sold this one to a publisher. He owes us all an apology and he owes me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Waste of Time","review":"When I saw this book I was excited for the read. His first two are great. This one is nothing but a drag. Carr tries to step into a Jules Verne feel, and fails every step of the way. His descriptions are not enough to support the tale, his characters are WORSE than two dimensional. It is impossible to finish, and tells a sad tale of anyone willing to waste valuable life-time reading this dreck.C'mon, Caleb, we know you can do better. Why not try harder, and remember your own strong points next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An embarrassment","review":"I very much enjoyed Carr's earlier novels. It's hard to believe he wrote this one, and harder still to believe it made it through an editor to see the light of day as a published hardcover.This reads like a bad Tom Clancy (if that's not too much of a tautology). There is a complete lack of character development and motivation.I groaned through half of this drivel and have put it aside. Life is too short to waste valuable time reading this cartoonish nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad.....","review":"Quite a negative surprise. I was becoming a Caleb fan, and waited a long time (for me) for this new book, and now we get this Hi-tech, Sci-Fi junk. He should stick with what he knows.

Shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jules Verne","review":"This is a puerile attempt at science fiction that is written at the 12 - 18 year level. It lacks credible science in the same way that Jules Vernes 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea described Captain Nemo and the vessel.

I'm shocked that Caleb Carr's editors, producers, handlers and the like would allow him to read his own book on audiotape with the lisp he has! I'm so distracted every time he says a word with the letter \\"s\\" in it - he sounds just like Elmer Fudd! It really detracts from the overall book-on-tape experience. What a bummer!

I listened to this book and was so disappointed that he seemed to skip over detail and ignore the wonderful fullness that the characters in his previous books evoked. It was not until the end that I realized Carr had allowed the ever money grubbing Simon and Shuster to abridge his usually excellent work - AND HE READ THE NASTY THING. This turned an otherwise interesting book into a one dimensional ecological diatribe with no interesting characters and I didn't care what happened at the end. Too bad for Carr. I thought he had some promise as an interesting and unique author who would not sell out to monetary interests. (Sigh) Another one down the drain........."},{"rating":"2","title":"A startling look at the future....","review":"I read this newest book by Caleb Carr in one sitting. I found it impossible to put down and more than a little fascinating. The subject matter seemed guite appropriate considering the tragedy of September 11, 2001. It is a disturbing look into what the future may hold for our world if changes are not brought to bear. The characters are believable and rich in color and scope. The world conditions as put forth in this novel are disturbing in their sheer probability. Malcolm and Larissa are memorable charcters and their view of the world and their desire to alter preceptions as well as the future are told in clear cut prose. The picture painted in my mind of global chaos, lifeless sea's, and abject human suffering will long remain.

I'm most impressed with the high quality of the level itself. The optics are very clear and can be focused from beyond the limits of accuracy to pretty darn close-up. The leveling system is machined brass, solid and effective. The stadia rod, though a bit short at eight feet, is well made of extruded aluminum, and is perfect for an average building site. A taller rod would be desirable in order to work effectively in hilly terrain.

Their live shows are legendary, which is good since I've always found their recorded work somewhat uneven. They have incredible longevity for what could easily have been a throwaway novelty act.This is a good collection of their early work. Highlights for me are Garbageman, Save It, and Human Fly. Other songs are good to OK, and range from just plain silly (She Said) to a tad disturbing (TV Set).

The drums are set back further in the mix and muddied up with added reverb and low end EQ. There are similar problems with the vocals as well.I don't always favor 60's music that has been remixed from the original multi-tracks, but you at least expect it to have improved fidelity.

Of those who recorded, references to their output are often vague and unspecific. You will look in vain for piano greats such as Lipatti, Edwin Fischer, Gyorgy Cziffra, Weissenberg, Yves Nat, Kovacevich, Ogden, Guller, Leslie Howard, Charles Rosen, Yudina.

They were either completely omitted or were only mentioned in passing with a few sentences under geography or some other section.

How he would get signed to bigger distribution company with this album or get hooked up with the producers who've helped to hone him into the awesome one that he is now is a mystery.

But Stan & Ollie, having fallen into a mud puddle, have been taken by two pretty young flirts to the girl's apartment. Of course, as the boys are leaving the apartment without their trousers, their wives show up with shotguns. The film's climax is the best gag in \\"We Faw Down\\" and one of the funniest endings to a Laurel & Hardy two-reeler. While the basic idea for this comedy was lifted from the Mack Sennett/Mack Swain comedy \\"Ambrose's First Falsehood,\\" its importance in Laurel & Hardy history is that the basic premise is visited again with glorious success in the boy's classic film \\"Sons of the Desert.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THOSE CHORDS","review":"Love the piano work in the Intro. for \\"For God So Loved the World\\"...

I can't seem to find anything wrong with its construction. It goes to 16 feet in 4 intervals so that you have a little more control of the rod. This is especially handy if you are working a scope level and the rod holder is inexperienced. The weight of the rod is the other thing that I like about it. It's not like and aluminum rod which is so light that you can't hold it still on a calm day let alone a windy day. This rod is just heavy enough that it will pretty much hold still all on its own all you have to do is balance the rod between 2 fingers.Overall I really liked this rod and if I ever need a taller rod I will be purchasing the same type of rod but taller."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful read","review":"wonderfully written. comprehensively researched. fascinating. entertaining. scholarly, yet really engaging prose: the sort of book that makes you feel like you are sitting down with the author and listening to them tell you a captivating story about their discoveries rather than merely reading the cold word off the dead page."},{"rating":"2","title":"She loves it!","review":"My mother gave this to my 4 month old daughter. It is small enough for her tiny hads to hold. She also loves chewing on it. Great toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes Pooh is overated.","review":"We received 2 of these for our daughter as gifts, and she never really liked them. She might rattle it for a few seconds, but then tosses it. She prefers rattles that she can shake vigorously and produce a loud sound. The honeybees make a soft sound and it's not very exciting. Also, I tried washing it once and water seeped in, which caused the honeybees to stick to the paper-picture of Pooh, and it's never rattled as freely since. The only educational use I've gotten out of it was to help teach my daughter colors since one side is purple and the other side is green."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste your time or money","review":"Tried these because they are so cheap. Tey are not good at clamping and you cannot see through the rings on a Ruger MKIII Hunter pistol with Simmons Prohunter scope. The REAL Weaver rings work perfectly however and are worth every penny.

Was a little worried after reading some other reviews, but I read the instructions first for tips before using it, and it works very well. It's my first beard trimmer, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but it was comfortable and easy to use, the vacuum works quite well, and the results were what I hoped for. Got it for a good price, so I don't mind that it's made of cheap plastic, as long as it lasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"If you want to trim hair and don't need anything fancy and don't want to spend $50+, then this trimmer rocks! It does the basics and it does a GREAT job of it. This is my second one in 8 years. It's simple, is non-abrasive, and the vacuum leaves the area pretty free of hair as it grabs most of it. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply terrible","review":"Does not vaccuum well - even when taking off a small amount of hair at a time.Because where the inlet of the vaccuum is located, it forces you to hold the trimmer at a weird angle to your face.Cheap construction as well.I'm a mechanical engineer for a product design firm - I design products for a living - this is easily in my top 5 of worst products I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING IF YOU HAVE OWNED THIS BEFORE!","review":"This trimmer no longer has a dual trimming head on it. I owned one of these for about 8 years and loved it. The rechargeable battery finally conked out and I wanted to buy it again. Though when I received it I was shocked after opening the package and there wasn't a dual head on it. The dual head is clearly pictured on the packaging, and in the instructions included. Though when I called Wahl directly to ask them about it, they told me they don't come with a dual head anymore. When I asked about the packaging and the instructions showing a picture of a dual head, they had no answer and tried to tell me who ever I bought it from was trying to scam me. I explained it came factory sealed, and they still had no answer. Not a very good response to an obvious Wahl packaging issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Trimmer Works Fine","review":"Some of the reviews for this product made me hesitant in purchasing this trimmer, but I bought it anyway and I'm completely satisfied. I find that about 80% to 90% of the hair I trim is caught by the vacuum, even though I'm not that careful about using the trimmer as directed, which is good enough for me. Overall I find the product works great and is thoughtfully designed. All of the complaints I've read (except for one that makes no sense to me) seem resolvable through reading the manual or applying common sense. Here are my responses to some of the negative reviews for this trimmer:Vacuum doesn't catch much hair: I suggest you trim by 1/8\\" at a time as directed in the manual so that the cut hair isn't too long to get easily vacuumed. Also, you have to hold the trimmer right-side-up otherwise the hair won't fall near enough to the vacuum openingPatchy shave: In the manual it addresses that issue directlyGuard comes off: Don't push the guard release while shaving"},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"The vacuum is not powerful enough to pick up shavings. Even the slightest tilt will cause shavings to miss the vacuum receptacle and litter your sink. Very disappointing product from leading trimmer maker Wahl. Brought mine back and got a Norelco T860, which I recommend for its Acu-Control system."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"This has got to be the worst case of false advertising ever! First of all, it doesn't vacuum like it says it does. Hair everywhere!. Second, it is not user friendly. The thing is large and it obscures your face. The stand that comes with it tips over very easily. If this was a movie I would give it two thumbs down!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Vac\\" Feature Is Inadequate","review":"The whole point of this product -- at least as far as I'm concerned -- is that I would be able to trim my moustache and beard without getting hair clippings on the counter or my shirt, this because it has a vacuum feature. The problem is that it misses a lot of hair clippings, so you end up having to clean the hair off the counter or your shirt anyway -- and now you also have to clean the clippings out of the trimmer, so it's more work, not less. The next problem was that the Amazon merchant, UnbeatableSale, Inc., wouldn't take it back because I used it -- which of course was the only way I could have found out that the vacuum feature was inadequate. (I could find no notification of this so-called policy on the Amazon screen from which I placed this order.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst trimmer I have ever owned!","review":"I saw the ads for the Trim-N-Vac trimmer and thought it was a good idea. But that is all it was an idea. The trim guard pops off in the middle of trimming(oops there's a bald spot), then when you put the guard back on, thinking that the guard is at the same trim length that it was set at when you started, suprise it is back to a number 1 while the lever says 4. On top of all that, the vacume does not have enough suction to catch 1/4 of the hair so you might as well be using a trimmer that does not have this feature and will trim even. This was a BIG WASTE OF MONEY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing makes me so mad!!!!!","review":"I don't generally write reviews but my repeated frustrating experiences with this thing compels me to do so.It seemed like a good idea -- the vacuum feature and the adjustable trim height, but when I use this thing, the adjustable head comes loose, which usually results in the blades going directly down to my face. Not only painful but it mows my beard down to the skin. Ouch and ugly!! Then the vacuum doesn't work all that well, and much of the shaved hair bits end up on my face, on my shirt, and on the floor.The one thing I do like about it is the smaller trim blade, which is super handy, but I have to give this a bad rating simply because it's unexpectedly mowed down parts of my beard so many times.I'd avoid this one if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing...","review":"The idea of a \\"Trim-N-Vac\\" sounded great to me, but this trimmer is a huge disappointment. It is VERY loud and wakes up everone whom is still sleeping in the morning. The \\"vac\\" part does not do a very good job, maybe collecting 50% of the trimmings at best. It is quite large and bulky, difficult to manuver. Feels awkward to use. The cutting guard is of a strange design and does not trim as closely as I would like. I'm going back to my trusty Norelco and cleaning up after myself. This Wahl trimmer was a big waste of money(it wasn't cheap either....)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ended up returning it","review":"All my comments have already been listed in the other reviews online. But in summary, I took a chance on this trimmer because my wife and I were both tired of cleaning up all the little hairs left behind on the sink. However, it's \\"toy-like\\" construction, it's lack of power, the fact that the tray falls out and the length guard came off too easy, and the lack of power of the vacuum, I eventually chose to return the unit. Maybe I will reconsider with version 2.0 or 3.0 of the unit, but for now Wahl needs to listen to all the responses and get back to the drawing board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor charging, no battery replacement, hard cleaning","review":"I thought this was a great idea and, for a week or so it was. It vacuumed most (but most definitely not ALL) the hair trimmed. However, after a couple of weeks, I could not get the battery to hold a charge and the battery can't be replaced on the thing! And cleaning out the vacuumed trimmings is not a simple process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely a disposable","review":"The product is made of very flimsey materials and has a small cutting head. This means it cut unevenly. While the bateries are rechargeable, they are not replaceable. When the battery stops taking a charge, you must throw the razor away."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better choices","review":"I puchased this a couple of years ago to replace my old Wahl trimmer. I thought the vacuum was a good idea, but it's not as effective as I would have liked; there's still a mess in the sink to clean up. It is bulky and not comfortable to use. It's difficult to clean. The depth adjuster has come off a couple of times while in use. The battery failed to hold a charge after just a few months so I can only use it with the cord.As far as trimming goes, it's not a winner there either. It takes too many passes to get the job done and it doesn't trim that evenly.I've been browsing for a more satisfactory replacement and can hardly wait for this to stop working completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"vac-trimmer","review":"the trimmer part works great but!

I spent an hour trying to beat level 3 for my 6 year old the only thing I discovered was that I did equally as well when I randomly hit the 4 keys as quickly as possible (about 57% accurate) as I did actually keeping up.

It also has an adjustable water flow rate, which can be adjusted to flow between 27-92 gallons per hour. The filter cartridges and media are very easy to replace and refill.

But, the author usually gives very very short explanation about the particular class, and just gives very wordy 2 pages long example: the remaining part to be self-understood. I read one page of the book 5 minutes, and spend remaining 2 hours in MSDN, to find out how the code the author gave works. That is really exhausting!!!!

The opening track on this CD sounds like an 80's big hair band. \\"The Wheel of TIIIIIME!!!!\\" Man, this is not what I'd listen to while reading the books. I was expecting some sort of classical music, maybe some chorals, a work in the vein of Basil Poledouris and his fabulous Conan the Barbarian soundtrack. This first track alone made me nearly want to break the cd in half and use the edges of it to harm myself in some way.Do yourself a favor and check out soundtracks from fantasy films. Anything by Basil Poledouris, the soundtrack from Last of the Mohicans, Dances With Wolves... those are albums that will put you more in mind of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"This CD wasn't terrible, just isn't the normal thing I'd listen to, and certainly not a good musical representation of the Wheel of Time novels. The inclusion of vocals was in and of itself, a flawed idea. Not only that, but there are too many cultures represented both subtly and overtly in the novels (renaissance era culture, pre-Norman, crusades-era christianity, Taoism, gypsy and gaelic, among others) that you couldn't possibly pin it down to one influence in the music. In other words, it seems like a mistake to put such emphasis on gaelic influence in the music, when in order to give a good representation of the books, you'd have to include so many other cultures as well. To be honest, if you want a soundtrack to go with the novels, I'd go for the soundtrack to the computer game. It's on the game CD as an hour or so of mp3's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Music Ever","review":"This has to be some of the worst music I have ever heard. \\"Singing\\" the words \\"wheel of time\\" over and over again is hardly what it takes to call a song a theme of something.

There is no musical value to be found here, don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It!!!!!","review":"This music does not go with the books at all. First of all the names of the songs should be a clue. Unlike the Wheel of Time, the producer/producers of this music didn't really put much thought into making this. Listening to the music does not conjure up images of any part of the story. If i had to decide to read the books based on what the music is like, I wouldn't even look at the covers."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"Maybe the artist should have glanced at the cover on one of the books before starting this, reading one or two couldn't have hurt either.I may be wrong on the artist's goal, but due to the fact that the music fits in not at all with the books it appears that he wished to cash in on a big name, and this was it.Even modern instruments would have been OK, but electric keyboard? come on!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"God-awful if you have read the Wheel of Time","review":"It is good music for say, a video game, which is what this is from, I believe, but it does not accompany the book series at all.

It is just far too modern."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the cornyist thing i have ever heard","review":"Okay. Now I will admit that The Wheel of Time is far from being my favorite series, but i have read up to book six. When I heard this CD, the only thing i could do was laugh. It was just so corny!! I mean, the whole entire Wheel of Time Theme song with some guy sing \\"The wheel of destiny\\" or some... like that and that utterly annoying Wheel of Time chant chorus...it was just pathetic. Word of advice: Don't buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Soundtrack for a Book?","review":"A soundtrack for a book? I must admit I was a little skeptical at first. But this CD is surprisingly good. It has a slight celtic tone to it which I never really pictured WoT set to, but the music is well written and flows nicely. I really love this CD!

If you're expecting Celtic music or something similar, then don't buy it. You may appreciate it as music in itself, but if you are looking for music that describes the series, this isn't it.

This CD is nothing but a collection of songs reminiscent of bad '80s fantasy films all done by an amateur musician. There's no backbone to it, no real feeling. The whole vibe is of 'Oh, man, I made this cool noise on my synthisizer! Check it out!'. I did crap like that when I was 11, but have since learned the difference between that and *good* music! Just listening to the samples make me shudder. Personally, I don't care if this fits the series or not. All I know is that this music is something that anyone claiming to be a musician can do. Just bang around on your electric keyboard acting like you're Yanni, and that's the quality of this musician's CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music, but not Wheel of Time...","review":"I tell you first that I only heard the clips on this page. Then, I thinks it's very good music, but it sounds like it would have been better for Halo or Emperor: Battle for Dune, it's somewhat epic but too much artificial, mechanized for a fantasy saga where the newest technology is a crossbow... Buy it if you like the music, but if you are looking for something to hear while you read the books buy LOTR sondtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just dousn't fit","review":"I don't mean to be rude or insulting to the maker of this music, but truthfully when I heard this music I was really disapointed. I have never really liked this kind of music in the first place, but when comparing it the the books I was shocked that anyone could copare these to the series at all! When you read good fantisy books like these you expect good fantisy music, and this music was NOT FANTISY MUSIC. For one thing it is much to modern when you read a good fantisy book you generally expect the music to be based somewhat on what music would be like in the time setting of the book which seems to be more along the lines of the dark ages, and this music dousn't sound anything like music did in the dark ages. The only people I would suggest this sound track to is people who like this kind of music, and aren't comparring the music to the book because this music does not match the books at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling short...","review":"Very much in the style of the music from 'Kamelot', I THINK I can see what Berry is trying to achieve, but I'd say he falls a long way short.The composer would do much better to look at the soundtrack from The Lord of the Rings - big brassy balads and light provincial melodies will always suit a medievalesque epic literary work better than the music that emulates the sound that would be produced with a combination of Axel Rose and Jon Bon Jovi..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gleemen do not use synthesizers","review":"None of these songs are particularly inspired, and as other reviewers have mentioned, it was way too modern for the tone of the books. Electronic instruments and 80's-style power ballads have no place in fantasy universes.Should've gone with a Knight's Tale format if he wanted to make it modern. At least you can giggle along to the fact that it would suggest it KNOWS it's inappropriate.Besides, who hasn't read the massive One Power battles with \\"Rock You Like A Hurricane\\" in the back of their mind?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I was expecting good, fantasy-type music. The guitar was very cheesey. The first trach was disappointing; there should not have been lyrics. The lyrics may have been acceptable had they been in some other language, but it was all in English and it did not sound right at all. Many of the songs sound the same. Not nearly as good as the soundtrack to \\"the Lord of the Rings\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Folksy then Epic","review":"I supposed I had some preconceived notions about what the soundtrack to the Wheel of Time series should be. Something on par with the soundtracks of Fellowship of the Ring, Gladiator, Conan or 13th Warrior was what I envisioned being suited to the epic scope of Robert Jordan's work. Hey, even the soundtracks from Scorpion King (score), Army of Darkness or The Mummy would be more suited in my mind.Its not that the music in the Wheel of Time soundtrack is bad, it just sounds like folk music. The opening theme has what I can best describe as a \\"cheesy\\" feel to it, repeating the words \\"Wheel of Time\\" over and over again would be like the opening theme for Lord of the Rings being someone singing \\"Lord of the Rings\\" over and over again, pretty silly when you think about it. The music also sounds thin; few instruments, light production and no real emotion. If you're a fan of folk music, you might like this, but if you're a fan of epic, sweeping soundtracks, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the price of the amount of power required to play.","review":"This cd has officially become the worst in my collection, and I have britney spears. The music doesn't fit the books in the slightest. A masochist wouldn't listen to this music. It has no relation to the series, there would be no difference if a first year uni student studying audio engineering took this soundtrack and dubbed it to a black and white oriental film. The quality of sound recording is abhorrent. You can almost hear the scratches on the vinyl. RJ must have been stoned the day he approved this soundtrack. Or unconscious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad.","review":"Wow, this was awful. I'm a very big soundtrack person, and I'm a very big Wheel of Time person.

I got excited and went on the enternet to listen to the soundtrack. Well! It sucked! The lord of the ring music by howard shore is ten times better. I am so disappionted by The Wheel of Time soundtrack. The rock jazz just doesnt give you the feeling of the time period the Wheel of Time took place in. Some of the music, I thought it would turn out to be ok, but some weird sound just ruin the music. Too much rock jazz, a little would be ok, but their really isnt a piece of music that i was looking for.

This is one of the all-time greatest snapshots of recent american history ever, and a very funny and poignant movie in its own right. It is beautifully composed and filmed, with a great cast delivering great performances. Very insightful about the roles of men and women in the early 60s - shows how the stereotypes didn't suit either gender particularly well. But best of all - the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic - in addition to the sinatra and early 60s lounge classics, has several excellent Fine Young Cannibals tracks, including one not available on any album or single. As good as Diner and American Graffiti, agruably better; it's more sophisticated and thought-provoking. The American Dream changes... The people who sell it don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, poor quality","review":"Loved this flick. Lots of laughs, Danny Devito and Richard Dryfus at their best. Many of the sales tactics I first saw in this movie are still around today. Had a friend who sold doomers in New York I used to call Tin Man.Very poor quality dvd. Looks like $5.00 Bootleg. Don't know if it was produced that way or if it's been burned at home. Kept waiting for someone to standup in the movie theather and walk in front of the screen. Could not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite comedies.","review":"This movie is a classic work that has received very little ink. The story line is a classic out of the fast talking salesmanship of the early 1960s. War War II vets as well as others were looking for opportunity to make a buck selling products door-to-door. Remember all the vacuum cleaner salesmen? What \\"Tin Men\\" captures is the the down side of competition. Fortunately, for the movie, this brings out the best of the two main characters. Both have a lust for shiney Cadillacs, an idea for a good scam, and are under a great deal of stress. When these to rivals collide, literally, the movie takes off. The two aluminum siding salesmen's game of brinkmenship spirals out of control. Great flick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"Visual and cultural cliches of 1963 are run into the ground. Both Devito and Dreyfuss overact several scenes, which must mean lousy direction. A few more pregnant pauses would give more weight and authenticity.

I picked it up and read the back and we spent a lot of money at Foyle's but I didn't buy DANZIGER'S TRAVELS. However, it kept coming back into my thoughts every time we'd pass a bookstore, so at the airport, before we boarded the plane, I ran like a madwoman to the newstand and purchased a copy. I read it the whole way home on the plane, in the limousine on the ride home, and for three days following our return. I did take time out to unpack, but not much. It is a really interesting travel story, and an interesting telling of how Danziger was affected personally by the trip, but more by the people. Pick it up and see if you can put it down, I'll bet you can't. It's worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing story; best travel book around -- find it!!!","review":"This is THE book to read if you're interested in a non-touristic account of travel in Asia.

Having travelled most of the same route very thoroughly myself, some things in the book come across as a little too fantastic, and others are just wrong . To be generous these could be failings of memory. Yet, these are minor flaws, that haven't stopped me from enjoying the book.I disagree with the complaints on the amazon.uk site about the quality of the prose, keeping in mind it is a personal travel book and not a scholarly examination of the regions he passes through. We get insights into the people he meets but most importantly into the life of Mr Danziger himself. The omissions, the fantasies and ultimately the focus of the book always, like a dream, come back to the narrator and his own experience on his narrow path across the globe.Well worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her most recent book stands in contrast","review":"Luhrmann recently released a book on evangelical christians in which she hypothesizes that the practice of prayer enables them to hear the Voice of God. This book is being hailed as extremely sensitive to and gentle with her informants.It is too bad Luhrmann did not extend this courtesy to her witches and magicians. Instead she presents them as people who socially support and encourage each other to believe fantasy. As this was her dissertation work, I believe she was under some pressure at that time to please her professors who basically wanted her to debunk religious belief by deconstructing it. If that is the case, maybe she should go back and rewrite Persuasions now that she has achieved a secure place in her field. Or maybe she should do a follow-up. I suspect many, most or all of her informants for Persuasions have lived fulfilling lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can people believe this stuff? -- an inquiry","review":"The ethnographic detail (and it is quite rich)of English covens is just the beginning --the book is fundamentally about belief and thejustification of belief.

I stopped reading in disgust. Luhrmann is extremely patronizing to the population she's writing about, neopagans, and it drove me crazy.I also felt like she missed the point of what it is that we do. Most neopagans don't consider themselves as magicians primarily, and much of the ritual we do is not to create material results. Her point is that magic does not create material results but we act as though it does. I don't think either of those are necessarily true, and even if they were true, they're beside the point of a spiritual path.In Luhrmann's defense, the anthropology tradition has a long and venerated history of holding itself loftily above the people it studies. So perhaps it's not entirely her fault.

I am glad that I boughtthis video. Between guffaws I heartily recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Masterpiece!","review":"This is one of Laurel & Hardy's more famous two-reelers. It's great comedy in its purest form. The reciprocal destruction that builds between the boys and Mr. Finlayson is a comic tour-de-force, almost mesmerizing.

Sadistic person that I am, I like when over-zealous Ollie gets hit on the head with a hammer from an uninterested Christmas tree buyer. Also, Stan's meek rejoinder to the spinster (right?)--\\"If you had a husband, would HE buy one?\\" I do think this belongs in the Library of Congress list, even if this short film is slightly overrated.

Stan and Ollie are trying to sell Christmas trees in sunny California. They knock on the door of the grumpy Finlayson, who is in no mood to be bothered by pesky salesmen.

They simply want to sell a tree to Finlayson. Once relations deteriorate between them and Finlayson, and the \\"retribution\\" starts cascading, this film really hits its stride. The house, yard, car, and Christmas tree are all creatively used by the principals. The gags seemed timed in the second half of the film that laughter would slow only slow down (not stop) before another laughter-producing event would occur, and so on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic \\"Pants Wetter\\" from Start to Finish","review":"I saw this movie for the first time in the middle 70's and had wanted to add this to my collection ever since.

As the first book of a series, it shows the beginning of a story that reaches the reader, providing both characters and plot in a realistic fashion. The sci-fi/military style resembles that of author David Weber, but Ben Weaver has added his own twist of flavour to create something unique. In this first book, only the briefest of beginnings is touched upon, giving the bait to hook readers for the next book, wondering \\"What will happen?\\" Frustrating, yes - but with the promise shown in \\"Brother In Arms,\\" I think, worthwhile too. All in all, I cannot wait for the next book of the series to hit the stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brothers In Arms","review":"Scott St.Andrew, wants to be an officer to get rid of the bias attached with a birthmark.Slower than all, weaker than all, but allmost the smartest, he must take on overwhelming odds and team up with his worst enemy at the acadamy just to make it through it.I am an avid SciFi Military reader. I could not put this book down. I could barely wait to turn the pages. This author writes as good as David Feintuch, Orson Scott Card and David Sherman and Dan Cragg. the ending was slightly disappointing as there were a lot of unanswered questions, but a sequel should be underway. If you like action and adventure, read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"This book deals with the life of one Scott St. Andrew duringhis training at the Elite South Point Military Academy and thestart of hostilities between The Alliances and the Colony worlds.It has great character development and you really feel for thecharacters and thier own weaknesses; and most of the characters are killed off during the book. This brings the effects of combat on the individual soldier to life.

It is fast pace, and I promise that you won't be able to put it down. A book for young adults along with SF and action/adventure buffs.It has a little bit of every thing.....fighting, suspense, mystery, etc., etc. My favorite parts are when they fight. The story has a believable and realistic, not to mention futuristic, plot. I also feel that it would probably make for a good movie too.Trust me, this novel is worth your time and money.The theme is that Scott St. Andrew joins the South Ponit Cadet Academy. He is last in his squad at almost everything, and everyone is fed up with him. All of a sudden the colonies finally rise up against the alliance. The cadets are forced to choose between the alliance, or the colonies. Scott and his bro join the colonies, and go under an alien conditioning program. When something goes wrong...Scotts brother is killed. Thrown into combat not fully trained, to face his enemies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing given thought put into background","review":"I have to agree with the second reviewer, that given the effort put into creating background, this came out as a rather tired juvenile novel.

Fairly cheesey self-promotion, if so,"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Military Tale","review":"Weaver masterfully blends the tried-and-true elements of both the military and science fiction genres to produce a tale that is as convincing as it is thought-provoking.

It did not have as much \\"military\\" sci-fi as other books I have read. The ending was very bad, sort of like a \\"Starship Troopers\\" a want to be ending. Only thing, RAH did not write to make sequals. It seeems most military sci-fi authors do that now. Why not just write a good MILITARY sci-fi story, then a different military sci-fi story, and so on, and so on? At least say it on the cover \\"Part I of II or III,\\" and let the reader decide if he want to commit to 2 or 3 lousy book. The \\"skin\\" reminded me of the body shield in the David Lynch movie \\"Dune.\\" Maybe I did not get it, though. Do not waste your time, unfortunately, I bought the sequel before I read the original hoping to be impressed. Now I'm stuck with both books until I can find a used book store that gives me less than half price credit for in store purchase for 2 brand new books that stunk."},{"rating":"2","title":"War is hell but this is a good first novel","review":"For Scott St Andrew the only way off his home world is to join the military where he can get an education, see the universe and possibly end up as a commissioned officer. What he doesn't count on is war breaking out between earth and the colonies while he is still in his first year of training. This forces his superiors to rush the students through a \\"conditioning\\" process which turns them into super-soldiers.Unfortunately for Scott the process was bungled while he was going through it and much of this book explores the consequences of mistakes and explores themes of justice and loyalty. This is an easy to read book and Scott is a likeable character. Even, if like me, you aren't normally into military books this is still a good quick read that easily carries you through to the end of story. I'm looking forward to reading book 2 in this series REBELS IN ARMS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brother! Did this suck !","review":"It was so bad I was unable to finish the book. The setting was improbable, the characterization poor and the physics laughable. The hero falls off a cliff but is caught at the last second by someone who shoots him with an anti-gravity rifle.

A good example of this is his estimation of the Albigenses, whom he refers to as \\"people of the Reformed Religion\\". The Albigenses were a neo-Manichean heretical movement. Their faith was Gnosticism dressed up with Christian words, akin to much New Age thought today. Yet Foxe, in his ignorance, identifies with them.Just another example of the tradition among Protestants (especially early reformers and present-day fundamentalists) that the facts don't matter, just attack Rome.This book would be best read by those who let their visceral hatred of the Catholic Church over-rule their ability to think rationally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice read but beware this is not a word for word reprint of the original work","review":"John Foxe's Book of Martyrs is indeed a classic of Christian literature.

While this book is a worthy read - be aware that this is not a faithful word for word reprint of the original works but as the cover says a rewrite.

Only complaint, and its not really focused at the DVD as much as the future of this bad: Owens was a great replacement for Halford, don't get me wrong, I guess they found him in a priest cover band. My problem is it sounds like he ran out of ideas fast. Jugginator album was awesome, orginal, sounded like priest but even had a touch of alternative in it. If anyone has heard owen's newest album with priest though, I was way unimpressed. He sounds burnt out, the songs aren't catchy, sound the same, and I haven't listened to that album again.

There are other singers that have a good high range, but nobody screams like this guy. In Victim of Changes on this DVD, he holds a scream for 12.5 seconds, longer even than Dream Theater's James LeBrie's longest recording high note of 9 seconds, then he goes on to step on more of the high screams to a crescendo that is nothing less thanawesome.

Discreet","review":"The round ones don't work, mice aren't interested in making detours, so I like the fact these fit next to a wall where the mice run. Secondly, they are not so gross, because it hides the mouse to some degree until you get home to dump it. Thirdly, it is reusable. The kill, in our experience, has not been messy.I recommend checking it often, and dumping and resetting right away. This keeps any other mice from seeing a dead mouse in the trap. Once they do, they may not venture to check out the peanut butter. If you check often, and dump, you can keep catching. Great alternative to the traditional nasty looking traps. Also, your kids or animals can't endanger themselves as easily as in the case of the open traditional traps. The cover is somewhat helpful in avoiding the attraction.More discreet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mouse Killer","review":"These things are awesome if you are too squeemish for the regular old mouse traps.

This year, out of a box of 12, again 3 failed to work and two have broken so far, leaving 7 out of 12.Looking more closely at the mechanism, I discovered there is a little pin near where the trap setting arm is when set. It keeps sliding out about 3/16ths of an inch and when I pushed it back in, found I could get the trap to work. With those that had a broken plastic hook to set the trap, there was no hope.

Once you set the latch, you know you've caught a mouse by the lever in the air and the tail trailing out the back of the trap. To get rid of the dead mouse, you pop the back, lift the lever up a little to release the snap and shake it out. You don't even have to look when you're doing this. Then you just have to reset them.

This draws the catch away from the trap until it's set, then engages it.We use a bit of peanut butter as bait.

The book was published in 1980. It got the author thrown out of the state of South Carolina"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good instructional material for the intermediate player","review":"This DVD is good instructional material for the intermediate player. Steve James provides an easy to follow review of some basic blues phrases. The written material is used and explained in the video. He also talks about blues mandolin players, especially Yank Rachell. This DVD is a good place to start learning blues mandolin. This is not a DVD that centers around blues scales, improvisation or different chord progressions and blues rhythms. Instead, James centers on about four songs that he explains and plays well."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you study B&W photography buy this book","review":"This is an excellent book showing Sieff's Balck&White photographic work from the 1950's to 1980's. (287 pages worth)If Mr. Sieff has picked all the plates himself for this book then he has chosen very well because it shows his development as an artist over several deacdes.The only pictures I would have personally edited from the book were the four images from the Catacombs in Palermo 1982, they belong in another type of photo book.The photo's vary from the abstract to landscape and sum up into a pleasant blend of images.The book itself is a great example of quality bookprinting and the page size is just right to give good area for the photos.To Mr. Sieff I would like to say; \\"Please go ahead with the planned book; Homage to a 127 bottoms!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely mezmerised","review":"Unfortunatly, I have not had the privilege to view this book, but about another from Jeanloup Sieff which I was fortunate enough to recieve as a birthday gift.

To appreciate the book, one must be familiar with woodworking at some level. Mr. Sturt paints a picture of someone with professional skills in the repair and making of wagons, carts, and wheelbarrows. The book may be of interest to those unfamiliar with woodworking but appreciate the long apprenticeship required to become a fullfledged wheelwright. Tis sad that a talent so needed for thousands of years, including Egypt and Rome, disappears. When the wagon factories and the automobile came about this made the wheelwright obsolete....."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic story of craftsmanship.","review":"For centuries the wheelwright was an indispensable part of rural life in England and America. Without wheels nothing moved and the wheelwright used a combination of instinct, knowledge and experience to provide the right wheels for all kinds of vehicles.Sturt came to the scene late, in the period before World War I. His was a fully developed craft not yet overtaken by the machine age. He describes the process of making wheels, from harvesting the timber to fitting the iron tires. In the process he gives us a wonderful feel for what it meant to be an experienced craftsman.Even if you're not interested in wheels, if you're interesting in craftsmanship and the old ways of doing things, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent View into an Esoteric Past","review":"A very enjoyable read that allows the reader a peek into an era when people \\"made things\\" from start to finish and took pride in their craft.

This is the seed that launched Parliament as a Funk band and laid the basic groundwork for everything that was to come from Parliament up until ~1979. It is Funky, and you WILL dance, sucker.I'd like to add that the version of this album with the extra alternate tracks (the 2003 remaster) has really excellent sound. I have some of these songs on other releases where the sound is a little muddy and noisy, and it's hard to pick any individual instruments or voices out of the din even if you're listening carefully. On this release though, the sound is big and clear, from the sizzling cymbals to the subwoofer-bumping kick. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got up for the down stroke","review":"This is the second comming of parliament as I knew it, and boys and girls it's funky.Get this cd and start with the original version then go directly to the Alternative version then start the whole thang over again.

It sets the tone for the mothership and everything that would follow. if this isn't in your archives your just to finicky for the funk. It wasn't meant to be perfect like a showroom car. It's just good to your earhole. Dance around the house or kick back on it. A little side note...

Falsehoods, exaggerations, and omissions about Mary's history (dating relationships, friends, live-in lovers, unstable job history, her hanging out with Crown Prince Frederik in the Slip Inn \\"pick-up\\" bar in Sydney) made it shallow reading. It reads like a public relations campaign, with a false \\"edge\\" given to the reader to try to make it appear that the real Mary is in the book. However, the real Mary Donaldson is missing. It may well be that Danish journalist cannot research and write objectively about the royalty they support with their taxes. Pehaps in such a small country it is not \\"wise\\" to write truthfully about the royal family if you want to get ahead and/or keep your job.

So my sights were set a little high. They fell like one of my souffles. I feel the author did a good job describing some of the staff and made them a seem as pompus as I have heard they are. The book did'nt present the flavor of the Externship very well. Also, Not much sense of campus life (the author lived off campus). Sometimes it's hard to follow. I wish I could recommend another book, but I've never read one similar. So it maybe worth a shot. But not for $20."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deeply inspiring read.","review":"As an avid amateur cook and onetime kitchen gofer, I find it delightful and inspiring to read about the CIA, and the experiences of the students there. This is a book I return to again and again, when ever the daily round of feeding my family becomes dull or mundane - it reminds that 1) it could be worse and 2) of that (long lost in me) chef attitude of 'get it done'."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll love it, or hate it","review":"I really enjoyed this book. So much so, that I recommended it to several friends. These friends either raved about it, recommending it to others, or couldn't even finish it.I think that the writing style is the reason for this. The book is written in a very journalistic style, which can be heavy-going in full book length, and some people just can't get by this. If you can, though, the content of the book is a fascinating enough \\"behind the scenes\\" look at the CIA and the world of the chef.One minor disappointment in the book is that several students we meet early on are abandoned by the end. We wonder what happened to them -- a quick follow up at the end of the book would have served well.Still, there's enough here, that, if you rise about the style, even a non-foodie like me will find plenty to like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing and entertaining","review":"A story of growth and change; author became a chef by investigating the training of chefs.

It's a delightful true life account of a student's experience with the Culinary Institute of America. It brought back fond memories of my days in college, although my major was mechanical engineering, there were so many corollaries; awe at the unraveling of the science, the emotional and mental strain, the personal connections with other students and cultures that I would otherwise not have experienced and the newness of every day. What I enjoyed most was the author's account of daily life and details descriptions involving the details of making a master chef. Get it. Enjoy it. Savor it for the knowledge but also for the reliving of life when it was all about learning."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent account of life at the CIA","review":"I graduated from the CIA and respected this author's attempt at explaining what a unique place it is. Keep in mind that he did not endure the entire program, but he gives an accurate account of his experience.

You must read this book if you are even considering this profession."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dull, dull","review":"A perfect book if you want an adolescent accounting of a personal experience.

His passion for cooking shines through and carries this book all the way to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly enjoyable","review":"This book is brilliant and fascinating, especially for someone who continues to toy with the idea of cooking school. The only downside is that Ruhlman doesn't fully take on the life of a student. I would highly recommend this to anyone with an interest in cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best read along with the CIA's \\"The Professional Chef\\" textbook","review":"Ruhlman's books are very good, but his blog is simply fantastic and has been for long time. There's no pretention in Ruhlman. He's not about vanity or bull or flash. His focus is on gastronomy, and it's a thread that runs through all his books starting with this one. Of all the famous American chefs, Ruhlman is the one guy I'd want to spend a week with. However, this book is best read side-by-side with the CIA's textbook, \\"The Professional Chef\\" (preferably 7th ed. or earlier). It follows that book throughout and it will illustrate all that Ruhlman writes about on any given day at the CIA.This book is full of characters, and his descriptions are so clear and concise that as a reader, you appreciate the time he took to describe the people around him and the many moods they experienced. This book will make you want to indulge in his other books, too. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"As close as I'm going to get to attending the CIA","review":"I really loved this book, I learned a bit more about cooking, but mostly I got a sense of what it feels like to become a chef.

The book chronicles his transformation from a writer to a passionate cook. A good book for those who are culinarily minded or would like to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating book, wonderful read.","review":"I so enjoyed reading this book. It was a wonderful glimpse into just how serious this profession takes itself- as it should! Understanding how PERFECT everything must be makes me appreciate what these ladies and gentlemen are doing back there in those kitchens. Michael Ruhlman interjected just enough of his personality into the story to make it a personal journey,(with his conflict about his position as a writer/student or student/writer.) At the same time he conveys what the other students (the 'real' ones) were going through, and how much it meant to each of them. Anyone interested in how top chefs get to where they do should read this book - or really, anyone interested in fine food!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to read this book","review":"Buy this book, read this book - then get into your kitchen and feel inspired to create something amazing. For those of us who love to play around with food, wine and cooking - this is an inspirational read. You will never take eating at a good restaurant for granted again. I eat out a lot - maybe too much, and never really thought about the process and techniques which went into each dish I ordered.Reading this book makes you stop and appreciate the effort which goes into food at this level. At one point many years ago, I thought briefly about becoming a chef - but after this read, now have absolutely no doubts of the level of commitment and work it requires.The descriptions are so precise you can sense the aromas of almost every creation. Just buy the bloody thing, you won't regret it. I originally bought this as a gift for somebody else, now I have to get another copy for her. I want to read this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for aspiring chefs!","review":"As someone who is considering attending culinary school, this is truly an informative and inspiring read. Michael Ruhlman truly takes us into the heart of the CIA to experience the hard work and dedication of their students! It's obvious that he put great effort into telling the unbiased story, which is that the life of a chef is in no ways glamorous. This is one of the few non-fiction books I have actually enjoyed reading, and where I actually felt interested in the characters. My one complaint is that the sequence of his storytelling was sometimes confusing, and he skipped over some units while spending way too much time on others. I know Skills is important but I would have liked to hear more about the Pastry units! Overall, though, a worthwhile read for anyone considering becoming a chef or even if you're just curious as to what it takes to become a chef!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect description of how a Culinary School works.","review":"I read this book after I attended a Culinary school (Western Culinary Institute in Portland OR) myself. As I read the book it reminded me of things I went thru myself. This book is highly reccommended to anyone thinking of attending a culinary school and wondering what it is like. This book also gives you some recipes you can try out at home too. A great addition to anyones culinary library. Highly reccommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I agree with the other reviewers who have some problems with this book. First, I don't think the book is very well written. There are some clumsy passages. The writer also comes across as a bit of a whiner. He tries to convey the passion it takes to become a chef, yet it doesn't work, probably because it is secondhand. It is like seeing a friend who is in love, and trying to write about being in love, even though you have never been in love yourself. So for me this book fell flat, and I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...the CIA should pay for this publicity!","review":"I read this book before enrolling at the CIA. While the descriptions of the school are fairly accurate (it is a very stressful environment and there are many passionate and talented students and instructors), the writing itself is insipid and seems to pander to the CIA's teachers and administration (and indulge in more than a fair amount of ego-stroking to boot). What Rulhman seems to lack in his overly abundant coverage of the food industry and its players is a really compelling story. His florid descriptions from everything to making stock to the mache in the walk-in bespeak a writer suffering from thesaurus overruse rather than an interesting plot or an artful writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"great insight into a world apart","review":"We've all heard the horror stories of med school, of law school, of driver's ed. Well, learing to cook has entered the fray. It's amazing to read about the dedication required, the skills one is expected to master, even the politics behind the scenes. A great read from all lovers of food, and those who pursue excellence in any field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing!","review":"I read Soul of a Chef first before I heard about this book. I was so happy to see it in an airport bookstore before boarding my flight cross-country. I got over half way through it by landing and then took it to the beach to finish the rest there. Apparently a buddy of mine saw my copy, started reading, and got hooked too! It is such a great book. Between the two Ruhlman books I have read, I am overjoyed and will buy every book he writes. Well done and very inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like cooking read this book!","review":"The Making of a Chef (Mastering the heat at the Culinary Institute of America) is a supurb account of life at the institute.

I don't know where to go to get troubleshooting advice on how to install the game for my system, and now I have a very sad and disappointed crying 6 year old who doesn't understand why mommy wont let her play her new game.

Since then, I have brought everything that Grace Jones has released, even finding out of print albums such as Fame and Muse. However, the one vaulable of all is Slave To The Rhythm. From the epic introduction of the 1st track, to the pulasating beats on tracks 2 and 3, Slave is a masterpiece, and has not aged one bit, since its 1985 release. Track number 5, is my favorite for it shows drama and with Jones singing the title as if she has been working in the chain gang. Number 8, the familair single version, is a superb song with haunting qualites. The only track that seems a little off course was the Operattack. Weird, but hey its Miss Grace Jones. So if you like different and refuse to be punished listening to today's musical offerings, Slave To The Rhythm is a definite choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slave to the Rhythm...","review":"I can't improve on what the others have said about this effort by Miss Jones.

Compass-Point-Sessions: 8:10 (Hot Blooded Mix)Don't worry folks, the \\"Hot Blooded Mix\\" is better than the album version (which is still a great song at 6:35, by the way!) Again, just putting it \\"out there\\" for your information! Four stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WEIRD!!","review":"Grace Jones was renowned for her weird, totally off the wall recordings and performances, but she was also curiously fascinating in doing so with albums like Warm Leatherette (1980) and Nightclubbing (1981) showing a flair for verstality and imagination. However when she returned to the studios in 1985, she seemed to have lost direction. Although the atmospheric Slave To The Rythm is an excellent track that became one of her biggest sellers, the remainder of the album is an eccentric, blatantly weird affair. The diverse musical arrangements may come across as highly imaginative to some but to me it really lacks any sort of depth. Grace sounds at her most vampish on the almost gophic opening track, Jones The rythm, which is too uncomfortably strange from an equally strange artist. Recommended to die-hard Grace Jones fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Maybe one of the best transitional albums in rock......Certainaly one of the best post punk glam rock cd's from this period...One of those records I bought because the cover looked cool!.....It's my favorite Japan cd, and the only one I've bought on cd (I bought all the albums when they came out).....It still sounds fresh and funky, and Mick Karn's bass work is still the best.

Of course; superhumanly fast guitarists are a dime a dozen lately. There's a fair amount of it here, too, but here's the kicker: all this work is based on a solid compositional foundation. Steve Morse can work miracles with his playing, but it's the writing skills and melodic sensibility, more than anything else, that have made him one of the world's most respected guitarists. Stressfest falls somewhere between the Dregs and Deep Purple: there's a mix of rock, blues, soul and funk blended with a leaner, crunchier guitar sound and a hard-edged attitude stemming from his time with DP. Not just a display of shredding for fellow guitarists to drool over, this is a collection of SONGS for anyone to enjoy. Eat your heart out, Yngwie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic Instrumental Rock","review":"Steve Morse, while being a great guitar player, does not fall into the trap many other instrumental guitarists have succumbed to: bad songwriting. Many Instrumental Rock pieces tend to wander around without a central theme. This album contains songs that seem to simply replace the vocal part of the piece with electric guitar, creating a more appreciable sound. The guitar and bass' tone throughout the album is smooth and funky, as opposed to the more metal sound used by artists such as Yngwie Malmsteen. Overall, a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLEASE NOTE, THIS BOX SET IS SNOWMEN AT NIGHT + SNOWMEN AT CHRISTMAS","review":"This box set lists as \\"both Snowmen books.\\" Not very helpful.

I have had it for over two years and bring it to the gym five times a week and it hasn't shown any sign of wear and tear. The fabric and zippers are high quality. It has numerous storage compartments which is great for keeping your gym gear organized. I use the drop bottom to store an extra workout towel and shower towel and one of the end storage compartments for additional items as contingency plan just in case I forget to bring something which happens now and then. As far as the size measure out the 26 inches for the length and that will give you a good indicator if it is the right size for your needs. I haven't had any problems fitting it into a gym locker but it is a large bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"I purchase duffel bag for my honey and he loves it.

Liberty and most other L&H; short films are easily worth buying at the same price you would normally pay for a full-length film, because there are more laughs in 20 minutes than there are in most full-length comedies.The plot has L&H; escaping from prison, and they quickly change out of their striped prison uniforms and into their regular clothes while being chased by police. In their haste, each one accidentally puts on the other's pants. They look for a place to change their pants, while inadvertently being caught repeatedly with their pants down in public places.One of several places they duck into to change is the elevator to a building under construction, where Stan accidentally hits the lever, bringing them up to the top floor.There are very few comedy films of any era that can compare to those of Laurel and Hardy, and this is one of their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mind Stretch","review":"For anyone who is a little tired of the old explanations given by the churches about God and existence, this little book written in the sixties is thought provoking and stretches the mind to places where you never thought it would.

A stimulating read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery Road is quite simply one of the finest albums I own.","review":"Mystery Road is a beautiful combination of rock, folk, and a touch of bluegrass without a twangy southern voice. This collection of songs is truly an album (a distant concept these days), and one song flows nicely into the next. The album has a nice blend of rock (Honeysuckle Blue, Wild Dog Moon) and some more folksy songs (Peacemaker and Straight to Hell).To those of you who are unfamiliar with Drivin N Cryin (or who have only heard one or two songs), I highly urge you to check out Mystery Road. If you like R.E.M. or the Indigo Girls, you'd probably like DNC. This band is a quality group of guys who care about making good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality reproduction","review":"When I ordered this CD...I was very much looking forward to it's arrival and I expected that it would be in good condition.What I got was a very poor reproduction that skips throughout the entire cd.We have several cd players in the house and it's sad quality is quite evident.I won't be ordering from this merchant again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I first heard the group on a radion station while living in the South and loved the way they sang.

After an extended break in period it now feels fine.I've bought most of the tmac line of shoes, and if you liked any of the previous generations, you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unsung Karloff Performance","review":"The main reason for owning this collection is the superb, yet surprisingly underrated \\"The Black Room,\\" a period film in which Karloff plays twin brothers, one good, the other evil. Karloff is exceptionally good in this 1935 film, which never received the recognition of his \\"Frankenstein\\" or \\"The Mummy\\" films. Production values of \\"The Black Room\\" are first rate, even though the movie was made on a low budget. Karloff makes the material glow. The other films in the collection are fun, but do not achieve the quality of \\"The Black Room.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly awesome Karloff collection","review":"This is one of the best Karloff collections out there. Most of these films were put into the \\"Shock\\" and \\"Son of Shock\\" packages that were sent to many local TV stations across the US and then which were intro by a favorite horror host of the 50s/60s/70s..many, many rare classics that hardly get shown on TCM and AMC.

I bought 2 sets of this product beacuse my daughter has a lot of hair and there are only 14 rollers. If you use small pieces of hair you'll definately use all 28 rollers. Her hair stayed curly all day, which is definately unusual.

I have very long hair and I like to wear my hair up in a french bun or just straight down. I use these rollers on the top and bangs and curl them tightly. Then I fluff my hair using my fingers instead of a comb or brush to separate each strand of hair. I get more fluff using my fingers. Then I gather the ends and pin to the top and back or I leave my hair straight down. My hair looks so fluffy and full of curls. It is amazing how these little curlers work! It's fun to experiment different styles of hair-do's. I use it also on my little grandchildren. It doesn't burn their scalp and they are light weight. My children even use the rollers as a toy. They make circles and chains. It's fun and they are great! You have to try them at least once. I guarantee you will be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"Ok, this has to be the worst product I have EVER BOUGHT!!! It is impossible to use, and the results don't last at all! I followed the directions one night, and after struggling to get them in my hair, I went to sleep. The next morning I woke up, took out the rollers, and had gorgeous curls. But, I saw a tiny tangle, and gently ran a finger through it. The entire curl went straight! Plus, after spraying it with hairspray and walking around a little, they were ALL GONE!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! It is a complete waste of money, and just really pissed me off! Spare yourself the frustration and DO NOT BUY!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T PURCHASE","review":"This product is terrible...my hair never has issues taking a curl and this simply didn't work!

What Margaret Buchholz has done here is to collect an extraordinary range of first hand accounts from two centuries of observers concerning their visits to, occupations at, and thoughts about the New Jersey seashore. It may be easy to discount as mere anecdote, but historians and ethnographers turn again and again to the unimpeachable witness of those who actually lived in(as opposed to wrote opinions about) real places and real times. Hurrah for Buchholtz for finding, preserving and sharing such precious documents! The fact that this is a delightfully easy book to read only adds to the pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fivespeed Destroy all other bands here","review":"With the exception of local greats, Fivespeed (AZ! ), this cd drags.

Listening to 'Low Spark' makes me long for the 70's, an age where long tracks were commonplace. The title track was a great song then and still is today. The sax work on this track is just amazing. Chris Wood was one-of-a-kind, no other sax player has ever equalled him in his experimental playing. Every track is good with my least favourite being track 5, I just never liked this song but that's just me. Mobile Fidelity did a superb job with this package as they usually did with every title they released. The sound is very good for this vintage a recording 'that warm analogue sound' best sums it up. This was in my opinion, Traffic's best album. Island's remaster is quite good as well but probably can't compare with the gold version in terms of fidelity, the gold disc sounds cleaner to my ears. This is a must-have if you can find a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love This Entire Album But...","review":"This particular recording of this all-time classic \\"Low Spark of High-heeled Boy\\" contained a strange background track - almost as if there was another recording going on in the background that was picked up in the making of the master - like a ghost track of the same song but completely out of phase with the song. I surely don't remember hearing this in the original LP. So this is definitely a quality assurance problem with mastering the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"one ofthe all time classics of the seventies","review":"I would like to give it 4 1/2 stars, but I can't give half stars. The reason: 5 star ratings should be reserved for albums like: \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\", \\"Forever Changes\\", etc... Steve Winwood is perhaps best known for his solo mega hit album in the 80's, \\"Back In The High Life\\". It was lite rock and had massive appeal in the mainstream. I thought it was boring. Traffic, on the other hand was edgier and far more artistic. They were, at times \\"psychedelic\\" which took them outside of the mainstream and put them in the \\"indie\\" (today's term) fold.Traffic had many good albums besides this one, especially \\"Shootout At Fantasy Factory\\".

Low Spark, alongside John Barleycorn, is a high point for this band. Focused, fully realized, and musically and lyrically diverse and eclectic, Low Spark is a sophisticated album by a wonderful group of musicians.In \\"Hidden Treasure\\" and \\"Rainmaker,\\" you have two acoustic numbers that are cut from the British folk cloth; and in \\"Light Up Or Leave Me Alone\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Stew,\\" you have two great electric rock tunes with some sweet guitar lines compliments of Steve Winwood, who, believe it or not, can hold his own next to the likes of Clapton and Page. And you have the title track and \\"Many a Mile To Freedom,\\" longer, more experimental tunes that borrow from jazz and progressive rock sensibilities.That's it--six songs (plus a bonus version of an extended \\"R&R; Stew\\").

Low Spark IS part of the album called Low Spark....What gives here?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One for the ages...","review":"The 60's changed the way people approached music. From the Beatles to Jimi Hendrix music became much more than a form of entertainment. Became part of everyone'e life. A way to understand and express feelings. Music dictating behavior. Life imitating art. There are a few albums that represent this transformation and \\"The Low Spark...\\" is definitively one of them. It is not perfect. It is human.

After my initial impression (see review below) I have been listening to this cd virtually every day and every day I still find incredible beauty to it. The title track is simply the best studio-recorded rock song of all time. It is very rare to find artistry such as this on any other recording. The best songs (Hidden Treasure, Low Spark and Rainmaker) are more like journeys than songs - absolutely transcendental.This is definitely the best Traffic cd. All the others are more patchy, though still worth buying. But for the apex of this great, sublime band's career, buy this cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone Has Done It Better","review":"As other reviewers have said, this book was not my cup of hallucigenic tea. My best guess at what the author was attempting was the injection of a Camus character in a Beckett play as filmed by Fellini-- all the existentialist angst of the masters yet none of their profoundness.To be fair, there were wonderful exchanges and insights (10-15 at most) peppered throughout this 243 page book. However, most of the book feels like the author wrote a wonderful sentence and then took funny blue/green/red pills to take the edge off... and became really impressed with himself and his ability to \\"get\\" the absurdity of our modern times. I wish he would have sobered up, consumed a bag of M&Ms; and written the book the cover promised to deliver: \\"a dark comedy for overlit times\\" that is \\"satire with a capital 'S'. \\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight, rigorous prose","review":"This book is extraordinarily well written, and Lipsyte is a master diagnostician of our modern condition.

A person's thoughts are important, as is everyone's right to read the thoughts and stories of someone else. I didn't burn the book as an effort to enforce censorship, but rather my anger at the book for having taken up as much time as it had. The book is slim, yet I found myself struggling through it, forcing myself to read it. I truly hated this book.Every sentence attempts to be clever. It seemed to be an attempt at writing by someone in high school who does not have assistance from an editor. Some lines were genuinely amusing and insightful, but it was so difficult to stomach the rest of it to get to them.In burning the book, and writing this review I have freed myself from the despair I had felt.Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Palahniuk-esque","review":"The Subject Steve is an interesting book. The story is about Steve (who insists he is not Steve) and the actions of his life through a media-plagued society. The plot is relatively hard to grasp, in the same manner as Fight Club. And similarly, Lipsyte's style of writing is very much in line with Fight Club's author Chuck Palahniuk. Steve has a very edgy, driven rhythm to the prose and certainly entertains all along the way.At times, the story becomes extreme as it dives into bizarre sexual experiences that certainly seem misplaced. Overall, still worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Lipsyte's Best","review":"I loved The Ask so I decided to pick up Subject Steve. Unfortunately, this book just left me cold.

The bubbles do splash water all over the floor. There is a feature that says it will maintain the temp. of the water, but it doesn't, it gets cold quick. The manicure massager is ok, but it is in an awkward place. The vibration and the bubbles are nice but that's about it. Also, there should be a selection for bubbles only (without vibration).

After getting through the beginning, and getting used to the writer's style, it is like being an anonymous viewer of a documentary film.

Apart from the fact that they both came from wealthy families, how they tie together (except social class must have helped her get the story) is unpersuasively developed. Hopefully the real Naty is far more interesting than the character painted. The presumed despair and disillusionment of the wealthy after the revolution was insufficiently presented to move me one bit. Fidel is portrayed entirely unsympathetically. The poor are hardly mentioned. The idealism of the revolutionaries are mentioned in passing. What exactly was the point of it? Naty as metaphor for Cuba? Maybe, but that's a pretty simplistic reading of Cuba--one of the great tragedies and dreams of this century.

This is an amusing comedy, with Stan and Ollie trying to protect employer Jimmy Finlayson from blackmailing in-laws by trying to hideout in an amusement park funhouse!

Sadly, the film is not complete, large segments are missing, it's a silent, and watching it is not for the casual viewer, hence my two star rating.

(A few missing scenes are replaced with shots of the original shooting script.) While the fight sequence at the beginning is good on its own (especially some of Stan's more lively legwork), the pie-fight sequence is truly a masterpiece of over-the-top excess--a \\"pie-fight movie to end all pie-fight movies\\" in Stan's words. It's impressive to see: how many ways a pie can be thrown; the long shot at the end showning dozens of innocent bystanders being drawn into the melee; Anita Garvin's delicate attempt to rid herself of she's-not-sure-what after she slips and sits on a pie. These are eternal images in the world of slapstick. It may take some persistence to obtain this, but it's worth the wait.

Not the life Joan envisioned. Posing as her brother who hated school she attended in his place and proved to outsmart all the male students. Circumstances had her elected Pope while she continued pretending to be a man. Her future was one of conflict and strife.I got caught up wondering whether this was a study of history or fiction.

Not only does the heroine hide her feminine birthright through the uniform of the church, but cloaks herself so successfully in that garb as to obtain the highest position in the church - Pope! Pope Joan delivers a sequence of events too true to be fictional. It is a novel of deep dark history; fascinating reading and a compelling story. Pope Joan is cataloged \\"Historical Fiction.\\" I leave it to the reader to eliminate the word \\"fiction\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"slsilveira","review":"Excellent book - Being raised a Catholic and not always agreeing with the Church on the treatment or \\"place\\" of women, the story of Pope Joan has always interested me. The Church being so powerful is more then capable of hiding or distorting information (think of the many things that we know exist in the Church's hands that they won't release to the public. Why? Maybe Dan Brown does have the answer, at least in part). This is an incredible novel surmising what Pope Joan's life might have been like from birth to death. Her need to educate herself and hide the fact that she is a woman. The better part of the book is her life leading to the Papal chair and the character she had to have had, but also shows the human side of doubt in self and God and attemp to always do \\"right\\".

And while I have to give the author credit for creating a rich storyline from just a sparsely documented and highly speculative piece of history, the writing just doesn't stand up as a piece of quality fiction in my mind. This book elicited many groans of \\"ugh, seriously...?\\", with a plot that is just too convenient and coincidental for smart reading. The character of Joan is well constructed and her good heart and dedication to learning are inspiring, but I'd recommend going to a piece of nonfiction or just reading the author's note in the back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Eye-Opening View of the Catholic Church","review":"My mother suggested this book to me, and although at first I didn't think I'd enjoy it, I was so glad I read it. Not only was the writing exquisite, the story superb, but it was extremely well researched.

A great book for anyone intersted in Catholicism or World History, or just a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pope Joan is an excellent book!","review":"Although I don't usually read books on the lives of popes I found this book to be excellent. The quality of the writing, plotting and character development is superb.I knew, from various histories, that women were treated very badly in those day. This book brings the hardships women faced alive. As a bright, intelligent you girl Joan had to beg her brother to teach her to read and write. If they had been caught she would have been very severely punished. Joan's struggle to over come the prejudices of the day makes a fascinating story.The story is much broader than this one subject. The author has captured all of the aspects of Joan's life from when she was born until she dies. This is an amazing feat!I highly recommend this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadfully written and researched","review":"I read this book through a Book Club, and that is the only reason I finished it. The historical research is dreadful and inconsistent. One of the pivotal scenes in the book has a Warrior Bishop and his attendants celebrating Mass unarmed! The explanations by the author in the rear of the book are very much in keeping with the paranoia of conspiancy theorists. The writing style was uninteresting, and the plot line was loaded with unbelievable coincidences. There may or may not be any truth to the medieval story of a female Pope, but this book does nothing to help solve the question."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big disappointment","review":"I have to give myself 5 stars for finishing this simplistic, predictable effort.The premise is fascinating but the author didn't develop a believable read - and the romance was just too much for me - more like a Harlequin romance novel.

If only...\\" (Cross 157).","review":"In Pope Joan, the author Donna Woolfolk Cross gives the world a very rational idea of how a woman would try to live in a Catholic dominated world. The main character Joan is placed in a realistic setting. By following her through a journey we discover her eagerness to learn and yearning to become something in the world. The book is meant to start controversy and have support for its theory of there once being a woman Pope. The tale by itself though shows what one can achieve in life. Being a female during the Dark Ages influenced how Joan was able to control her life and the decisions she decided to make."},{"rating":"2","title":"A COMPELLING ADVENTURE","review":"When my book club chose, \\"Pope Joan\\" I was chagrined, assuming it would be laborious, tedious reading of ancient fact. NOT! I pleasantly discovered that factual history combined with an equal part fiction, makes a winning recipe for intoxicating reading. As the reader, you are off on a journey with Joan, \\"a \\"mere woman,\\" scorned by her society. Her excursion is packed full of ingredients for superb drama; a brutal childhood, cunning deception, grisly wars, feasts and famines, intelligent scheming, treacherous brawn, and an enchanting love story. Cross does an excellent job of keeping the reader entrenched in the action, allowing rest only in intimate moments. I can see this book made into a sweeping epic akin to \\"Cleoprata\\" or \\"Ben Hur.\\"Read this book for the fiction, but realize while doing so, you amass factual accounts of 800 B.C. culture that is engrossing. What a wonderful way to study history!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"Fat Assassins (The Fat Adventure Series)I love historical fiction and this book didn't disappoint. This is a fascinating topic and Donna Woolfolk Cross did a great job. She developed an elegant heroine and encapsulated the reader into the story.

I haven't watched the series yet and I hope they did justice to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Hope for Joan the Pope","review":"I was eager to read this book for I was expecting an exacting, honest account of a female pope and her trials . . . well the book delivers the factoids and that's about it. In the hands of a more deft author, this book could have dazzled its readers. But, unfortunately, it comes across as silly and adolescent."},{"rating":"1","title":"anachronistic and silly","review":"This book imagines what Pope Joan would have been like if she were a 20th/21st century, pro-abortion, agnostic with a lack of understanding about Catholicism. I laughed out loud when I read the author's statement that she wasn't a Catholic, which was good because 'it meant she wouldn't have biases' about her subject.The conceptualization of Joan is silly. At 4 years old, she ponders gender inequality. Later, she poses as a man and joins a monastery (that part is plausible), but has no faith, never prays, never believes in anything beyond human capacity, idealizes her mothers Norse Gods, and only believes in science -- probably NOT likely for a medieval person. At one point, she attempts an abortion because a child would get in the way of her professional ambitions.All in all, the book lacks depth and spirituality and it has no literary style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex and Fascinating","review":"This was the first I've ever heard of 'Pope Joan' and I found the story to be no only interesting but written with tender truth. Tender truths not just about the character but also excerpts that you can apply to your own life. There's wisdom in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After reading the glowing reviews, I was ready to sit down to a good read. I must say that I was terribly disappointed. It seems that the author took a good opportunity to tell a fascinating story and enlighten readers about a time unknown to most of us -- but fell into the trap of telling a love story. Glad I read it before my book group purchased it -- it didn't live up to its hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Mother","review":"Donna Cross does an admirable job of fleshing out the legend of POPE JOAN. In this tale the future pontiff is born in Frankland to a tyrannical English canon and his Saxon slave wife. Joan persuades her older brother to secretly teach her to read, starting a life-long love of scholarship. When the opportunity presents itself, Joan hides as a male to further her education, even forsaking the knight Gerold, the red-headed love of her life. Joan's tale, in keeping with the legend, can only end badly. A few of the plot elements stretch credulity, but overall this is a good read with bright, vibrant characters. I always love a tale where an oppressed woman breaks away from the system and realizes her full potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor re-telling of a ludicrous conspiracy theory","review":"\\"Pope Joan\\" is a contrived rehashing of a late medieval fable circulated originally (centuries after the underlying events were supposed to have occurred) to attack the church from a distinctly non-feminist perspective. This book updates the legend in a way that illustrates two curious phenomena: feminist carelessness with historical fact and the appeal of outlandish conspiracy theories. The events described in this book neither happened nor could conceivably have happened, much less been covered up by some sort of wide-ranging clerical conspiracy. You will not find a serious historian who believes this story even remotely plausible. In contrast to effect of the best historical fiction (e.g., Robert Graves' I, Claudius; Sigrid Undsett's Kristen Lavransdatter; Marguerite Yourcenar's Memoirs of Hadrian) this book hinders rather than contributes to a deeper understanding of the rich reality of human history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"This book was an excellent read! I loved how the author developed the character; how we saw a justification for so many of Johanna's choices, through her mistrust of men, her desire to learn, her anxiety to do right. Johanna was clearly a misfit in her society, yet we were able to sympathize with her. I especially enjoyed her instances of cleverness: the interpretation of the parable of the mustard seed; the episode with the goat and her milk; the test with the maternity urine. Cross also deserves five stars for the medical backdrop that she continues through the novel, from the perspective of the midwife and her herbs and all the healing that Johanna does throughout the novel. An engrossing, delightful read, but a worthwhile one as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real fun page turner","review":"This fun book is a real page turner. While you are enjoying this entertaining book, you will learn about a frightful period of time when men considered the woman's brain was in inverse size of that of her uterus, and the husband was permitted to beat his wife, as long as the weapon was not too large. Did Pope Joan exist? Maybe not this woman who sounds like a 20th century libertarian, but certainly the bones that the story is developed on must be true. Read it to decide for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay; it's a novel","review":"4, not 5, stars...I felt the beginning sections needed some tightening up. It's possible that I would have preferred literary journalism to \\"historical\\" fiction. In some ways, Joan was a slighter character in her own story...always (or mostly) more virtuous, smarter, and cleverer than all around her. Cross gives us a huge amount of background information about the environment and various parts of society. This is an entertaining book. I now want to read other treatments of Joan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pope Joan","review":"The book was fine and I enjoyed the story.

Pope Joan was a book that was recommended by Amazon as a book that a reader that liked Da Vince would also enjoy. I did a little research and actually wanted to read another book about Pope Joan. When I went to the library Donna Cross's was the only one available. What a fortunate situation!I was enthralled by this book. It was interesting and readable and the sad and tragic part is that a lot of the fews of women have not really changed that much. Readers learn many of the myths that men perpetuated over the centuries.I would definately recommend this book to young women who feel that they cannot achieve. Joan showed that women a overcome adversity.At times some of the coincidences were a little far fetched and its sometimes hard to believe that Joan pulled this off, but it was a different world.This book has encouraged me to read other books on the same subject. It's great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story -- terrible terrible writing","review":"Pope Joan is one of those books which make you think based on its concept; unfortunately, the writing and characterization is awful. If Danielle Steele were to write historical fiction, this would be it....The concept is fascinating; a woman, disguised as a man, becomes an inspirational doctor and eventually the Pope.Could it have happened? Blows my mind to think about it. Cool stuff.Could it have happened as written by this author? No, not at all. The depiction of Joan as a youth is terribly unrealistic; the language she uses is not authentic, not even for a gifted child. There is a romantic sub-plot which is not believable, and seems to be thrown in. It is not consistent with the overall characterization of Joan.If we're lucky, maybe it will be a movie-of-the-week with Tori Spelling sometime soon.(Note that the afterward is surprisingly informative)"},{"rating":"2","title":"FASCINATING and FEASIBLE CONCEPT - a FEMALE POPE!","review":"Well, in reading Pope Joan, I discovered that either truth is stranger than fiction or fiction is stranger than truth.

The bang is the author makes herself available via telephone to join your group discussions. A female pope!? It is diffinitely a subject which is cause for discussion and to have the source available is great! Donna makes you feel right at ease, no question is too silly. You must check out her Web Site. The book is a must for every book club. We can't wait for her next book and the Pope Joan movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you wonder","review":"Cross does an excellent job of making the 9th century feel real to the reader. I felt like I knew Joan well by the end of the book. I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a pleasant surprise!","review":"This is not a book that I would have chosen to read. It was selcted by a member of my book discussion group, and I can remember groaning! Historical fiction? From the 8th century? What a surprise to find that I had trouble putting it down once I started it. The characters became so real and I truly wanted to know about their lives. Whether or not there actually was a Pope Joan may never be proven, but this book really provokes thought about the possibility. It also says a great deal about women's roles in the world and about the value of education - something we often take for granted. I'm sure that this will be a work that I will re-read in the future, and I'm sure that it is going to provide an excellent topic for book group discussion."},{"rating":"2","title":"what fun","review":"this book is in my top ten favorite books. fun read with many historical facts about that time in history mixed in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pope Joan-","review":"This was one of the best books I've ever read! So full of emotion and description, totally made me feel like I was there experiencing life along with her. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pope Joan","review":"I needed the book, because I was reading it with a book club. In fact, the author was going to be calling our book club to give us her insights about her book. The book came later than I expected, but I didn't pay extra shipping. It was brand new, and half the cost if I bought the book in the book store. Loved the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting reading","review":"This book was chosen as a book club read. It is interesting from the first pages and got my summer reading off to a good start. A definitely would recommend this book if you like history or even mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"Great story line, good pacing, interesing glimpse into life in the early years of the church."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting history","review":"Interesting bit of history told in a compelling fashion. Although it took sometime to get into the book I enjoyed it once I finished. I would recommend for someone who likes historical fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"Even thought the author made it very clear that this book is a work of fiction, it reads like a cheesy Harlequin Romance novel. The other disturbing element is that she portrays Pope Joan as a modern woman in the 21st century would be. The story is totally unbelievable. I found the dialogue between the characters to be far to contemporary considering that the novel takes place in the 9th century \\"the darkest of the dark ages\\" as the author states.What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pope Joan","review":"Although after reading the prologue I wanted to put the book down, I continued reading and was glad that I did. Pope Joan turned out to be a very interesting read - even if you're not into reading about history.Although I am in the dark about the dark ages and the Catholic religion, this book kept me riveted with its realistic characters, events, portrayal of women, and love story. It is exceptionally well-written and a hard act to follow.Trying to review it won't do it justice, but just look at how many stars it received and take a chance - you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars for Idea, -3 Stars for Execution","review":"What a great idea for a book! A female pope! An actual true story! What a bonanza for the author. But despite the early promise of this book, the story dissolves into some insipid dumb romance between our scholar lady character and some guy with some sword. (Who cares!) Yes, I am agreeing with some people here that she seems to have not one blemish upon her character. And her father is hilariously cardboard evil. EGADS! I am so mad at the author for squandering such a great idea for a novel, only to succumb to some re-hased fuzzy hued post-feminist garbage, chick lit conventions when it comes to character, and third rate plot. I guess we will have to wait for another book about \\"Pope Joan\\" that will reach the depth of character and artistry that you find in Toni Morrison, A.S. Byatt, and other great women authors.So a word to the author, if you have a great idea, make a great book just as good as that one idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Great idea, but a little clumsy in the execution. Cross fills out the sketchy details of Joan's life nicely, making her an interesting and sympathetic character. However, there were a few too many melodramatic made-for-TV moments -- a character dying suddenly just as he's about to betray Joan, a Viking attack disrupting a wedding just at the crucial moment. Also, most of the supporting characters were one-dimensional and predictable; the \\"bad guys\\" (and there were quite a few) had no redeeming qualities whatsoever, which made them much less interesting. I did appreciate the author's afterword discussing the historical evidence supporting the existence of Joan; it's nice when historical fiction states just how historically based it really is. However, I was disappointed overall; the subject of the book really piqued my interest, but the writing was a bit too awkward to make it a truly good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book on many levels. It was a fabulous historical description of the dark ages that brought that era to life for the reader. It was a great love story. It was an inspiring story of an intelligent woman and how she coped with a world that did not want to acknowledge or respect her intelligence. It illustrated the \\"frailty\\" of our historical records and record keeping. Most of all it was a book that entertained you while it made you think - what an accomplishment!! Truly a great read and one I would quickly recommend to many different people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good! Read in a day.","review":"I believe it would be ignorant to say the possiblity does not exist that Pope Joan was real. There is just too much historical evidence to the contrary through the 1300's. That being said, this novel was a work of historical fiction, and had some romance thrown in for good measure to explain the stillborn babe. I thoroughly enjoyed Joan's pursuit of academic knowledge and learning, and could definitely empathize with women of the period. I am a religious, 39 yr. old married woman, and my opinion is that men rarely give women of history the credit they deserve in literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the fist 1/2 of this book","review":"The second 1/2 was a bit dissapointing. I was loveing this book but it started to seem a bit far-fetched twords the end. Just too much stuff that she did/survived crammed into the second half. Overall the style of writing was very appealing to me and I felt engrossed. I would have given it 5 stars had the book continued with the believability that it did in the first half."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous Read!","review":"Book was quickly delivered in prime shape. The book is beautifully written and gives a close glimpse into the aweful times of the dark ages, which were a nightmare for women, especially women with brains. It really places you in the midst of the depression of the era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orna, Astrud-esk Very Nice Thought.","review":"Great job on this CD. Vocals are getting stronger and clear in the high notes. Orna's relaxing vocals remind me of Astud/Basia mixed with a relaxing beat. The bassist is superb. I would like more of the muted trumpet. I'm not big on some of the other electronic strings but whatever. Alice in wonderland will take you away. Great job on that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Remarkable Find","review":"Orna has a unique voice and great band on this recording. I hope she makes more, because I really enjoy listening to this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peanut Butter Duo Bars","review":"I have half a bar with my coffee every morning before my workout....The best protein bar by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"The bag is the perfect size for my Gamo Wisper .177 air rifle. It was difficlut to find a quality bag that was large enough for the Noise Reducer. In addition the bag is padded so it protects the gun and has a good moister barrier as well. I also like the fact the zipper can be locked. Well worth the price if you value your rifle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing... Trent's gotta be mad...","review":"Dude, this album is terrible. Vocals are lousy, musicalization is poor. They even change the lyrics of the songs. What was in the head of the girl who sings Closer? It's like \\"the 'rated' version of Closer\\". Instead of \\"I want to (F-word) you like an animal\\" she sings \\"I want to call you my animal\\". Does she even know the song? Has she ever heard NIN? I doubt it.Looks like they gathered a bunch of punk teenage garage band kids and asked them to record their covers and make some money with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"My girls got two of these bugs (a bee and a ladybug) at Christmas. They enjoy playing with them to this day (summer, now) and the toys are still in good shape in spite of being run into furniture and brick walls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first RC toy!","review":"Got this for a friend's 3rd birthday. It was a hit at the party, and continues to be a hit almost a month later - though her poor dog does get chased by this little ladybug occasionally. It is very easy for little hands to control. My only complaint is that it runs a little loud, but what toys aren't loud these days? I think there will need to be one of these in our home when my little guy turns 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 year old loved it","review":"perfect toy for little tots.it came fast and price was cheep for remote control toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died in <5 minutes","review":"We purchased the ladybug and inchworm buggies for our young girls. The girls raced each around the room for lots of fun. However, the fun lasted less than 5 minutes as the radio-controlled aspect of the ladybug stopped. Nothing changed. No appliances turned on in the home or phones that rang. We tried several ways to reset it to no avail. We plan to return it for a replacement as the inchworm has worked just fine. Make sure you have alternate gifts or plans if you buy this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A+ Rating for The Book of Ratings","review":"If you are the right age and were subject to the right cultural influences growing up, this book will have you laughing out loud on every page.

Highly, *highly* recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny-","review":"Truly an excellent way to spend seven dollars. Great new Ratings are a compliment to all your old favorites. I put it in the commode, and now I my wife spends twice as long in there as she used to. I think she's got a crush on Lore. Don't wait until your friend puts one in their bathroom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This book is HILARIOUS! It brings back nostalgic feelings, but is also gut-bustingly funny. I mean...who grades types of dinosaurs? Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can think of better ratings when I'm drunk.","review":"I found this book boring. I can think up wittier things to say after two margaritas. Besides, it's all someone else's opinions, and I hear enough of those. If you want funny opinions, look up Mitch Hedburg jokes online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winx Club rocks - especially Flora","review":"I agree with all of these reviews, Winx Club rocks! I am 14 years old and I love it, my little sister 8 years old loves it, and my mom thinks it is good as well. If you havent seen the show, it follows 5 teenage fairy girls who deal with boys, life problems and 3 evil witches. Even though I think this is a great show, it could do without the steroetyping. But I say this show will really go far. Really promotes self-esteem and its entertaining at that! :-[) 5 STARS for Flora!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Winx Club dolls!","review":"Flora is definitley one of my favorites. She has a dress that comes almost to her knees, which is more appropriate than most of the others. My only clothing-related complaint is the other outfit. It is a super short green top and a pink mini skirt. It looks like a Bratz outfit! Ugh!I'm not saying I hate Winx Club because of this. Actually, I love Winx Club! They are a lot better than Bratz or My Scene. They wear better clothes most of the time, they smile, and they have normal sized heads, lips, and feet.I would reccomend this doll, but if you're buying it for a young girl, then I would suggest getting the newer Flora doll instead, since she doesn't come with the inappropriate extra outfit."},{"rating":"1","title":"theyre ugly","review":"I do not like these dolls they do not look good and they look like they are on a starvation diet overall i do not like these dolls but thats me to you they may look pretty but to me they look like they are trying to be cute"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible stories","review":"I expected more from this guy but this particular cd is not entertaining at all.

It does an ok job, but not as good as the Panasonic I had before. It doesn't trim as close as I'd like.

The publisher - Works of the Chariot - is also the \\"rabbi\\" of the \\"Church of YHVH.\\"Not Jewish, so in my mind it is not authentic Kabbalah either.

Kate & Leopold is a gem with memorable scenes and a message about true love and finding happiness in life. Meg Ryan is her usual focused businesswoman. But Hugh Jackman steals the show. He's a real hunk.Serendipity is fun, but not as deep or entertaining as Kate & Leopold. But at the price and linked to K&L;, it's worth having. Premise in this film is somewhat goofy, but John Cusak makes it work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Candy","review":"I call it Mind Candy and for a good reason. You don't have to overthink it, you don't have to worry about plot twists. You see it for what it is: an escape from reality. The men are easy to look at, funny and smart. The women are people you'd like to know - not someone who would completely overshadow you. These are feel-good movies. There's nothing wrong with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"One can only guess these 2 romantic comedies are being packaged together because both rank pretty high on the 'leads who have no onscreen chemistry in a romantic comedy' list. Both have relatively good stories, pretty good direction (Serendipity in particular is quite creative), solid (if a little cliched) performances and lots of studio $$$ behind them, but both fall flat from an utter lack of chemistry. I'm only reviewing this duo because it popped up as the highest ranked romantic comedy on Amazon today- and both are among a handful of movies I have seen during which I thought \\"these leads really seem to dislike each other\\".Kate & Leopold and Serendipity are in regular circulation on the pay TV channels. If you're in the mood for a great romantic comedy, buy 'Holiday', 'It Happened One Night', 'Cousin, Cousine', 'Sense and Sensibility' or anything with Hepburn and Tracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yo!","review":"I love the beat to this song, but I'm very annoyed with the fact that he has to diss him MOM on this track. That's what Eminem's doing, and Mr. Bubba just sounds silly ripping (the awesome) Eminem off. Moving on, the lyrics are O.K. (good, nothing life changing), I like how they sing the chorus. Good rap song, I reccomend it for rap fans, but everyone else, thsi won't change your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"was he really dissing his MOM??","review":"I don't even really like rap and I like Bubba, he's very smooth and liquid and I would even dare to say that he may have been dissing someone OTHER than his mother.

The cover is different than it's foreign counterpart and appears to look like an amateur has designed it with cheapo software. The episodes for most part are very good, but there seems to be an obsession for disguises and make-up. There are some awful episodes but the serious ones make up for the bad ones. Can't get used to David Soul sporting that moustache though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Starsky & Hutch-the Best","review":"This completes my collection. The original S&H is the BEST.

Sony decided not to put a true interactive menu with screen variations and music. The beginning of each disc has an image thats quality is terrible with pixelization that is very obvious. This does not carry over into the actual episode, although is a disappointing end to the final season's package. The quality of picture for each episode is very good for a print that is almost 30 years old. I'm glad to see they handled the 3 part \\"Targets Without A Badge\\" episode as it was originally aired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guevara Pops a Wheelie","review":"It is a little deceptive to refer to this book as \\"The Motorcycle Diaries\\" because the motorcycle ( a 500cc Norton) is featured in less that half of the book. However it is an excellent record of Guevara's travels around South America with his friend and colleague Dr. Alberto. If you don't share Guevara's political viewpoint you'll still find the book enjoyable. It is also well written, at times lyrical . It made me wish I read Spanish better because I imagine it is even more descriptive in the original language.Finally, from a historical perspective you can see the beginnings of Che's evolution into flaming Communism. This paleo-conservative gives the book 4 stars and a high recommendation, even if you've never ridden a motorcycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing travel","review":"The trip Che made was impressive and he could truly see how South America was 60 years ago, although I know a lot of places remains the same. He is very good at describing places, people and his own sensations. Besides, the way him and Alberto made the trip was very brave, leaving La Poderosa on the way and hitch-hike all the way up to Venezuela."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motorcycle Diaries","review":"I quite liked this book. I purchased it for a book club, it generated great discussion. Would recommend to read, it gives a great insight into South America during the 60's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Una cuestión de humanidad.","review":"Vi la película hace tiempo, y leí el libro hace poco. Yo creo que es un gran libro que merece ser analizado desde el lado humano. Creo que lo que sucedió después con la revolución es otro punto.Yo veo aquí a un joven Ernesto conmoviéndose por ese mundo de Latinoamérica que la gente de dinero siempre deseo negar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"This was my first exposure to Che. I only read the book becuase I wanted to see the movie. I found the book to be an excellent read; it was very entertaining. This book also provides interesting insight into why he became a revolutionary. Because it was written by Che, I do wonder what his motivation was in writting it. Overall, it is quick, entertaining, and informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let Down","review":"This book is said to promise excitement and wisdom, but in reality it only scratches the surface. Che's remarks about both indigenous and black people is pretty shocking as well. I found myself wondering where the insight regarding the plight of the proleteriat was (aside from a few fleeting observations already given to us in the introduction) amid his pseudoanthropological observations. Perhaps Alberto Granado will offer something more fulfilling!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting character but writing is bland","review":"I understand that he was an important historical figure but his adolescent writings are pretty uninteresting.I much preferred the movie over the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our Modern Soviet Cinema","review":"Browsing through books, you don't expect to recieve the kind of shock I did when reading reviews on Guevara's \\"Motorcycle Diaries\\". I have a minority opinion, which saddens me not becuase it isn't popular here - but because others have read only the inspiring part's of Che's life. Not to discourage reading on this side of his life, but for a complete picture - read about his other actions. Are murderers inspiring rebels? Someone who sentenced Cubans to death because they fought for the very rights we enjoy daily in this country is a hero? Sure, be inspired by an awesome travel story - and even by a young person who wanted to make much needed changes - but please, do not be inspired by his later actions. An executioner is not someone to look up to. This book is a manifesto, a 50 year tardy soviet script, and should be acknowledged as such."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bum and a con-man","review":"It reminded me a little of Mark Twain'stravel books and some of Hemingway. They were both better writers.The translator appears to be British or Canadian which doesn't help a lot ( lorriesall the way through for trucks or whatever else they were?).You can't claim he was a civil right activist: his commentsabout the South American Indians show he wasn't very much interested in other than those withSpanish heritage. I've read Hitler's book from prison , Gandhi's works and some of Marx.All are better political writers than Che here.This fellow comes off as an opportunist who happens to be a doctorwith a bad case of asthma. I think he was an educated man and very intelligent.Is there some other better example of his mature writing?I don't think this does a fair job of representing him.His only redeeming feature was his involvement in treatment of leprosy.From this book he comes off as a bum and a con-man."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Boring and Racist Book","review":"I found this book to be both boring and racist. Every page is very boring and on page 161, Che Guevara states that Africans don't bathe and 'blacks' are indolent and dreamers. He also said that we spend our meager wage on frivolity or drink. How can he make such a generalization? Shame on him! Thanks to this book, I no longer like him. Save your money or you'll be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Take on Che","review":"Before reading \\"The Motorcyle Diaries\\", I was aware of Guevara's medical background while studying him as a revolutionary in Modern Latin America. However, the Che I studied was much different later in his life, leading successful revolutionary attacks, and becoming a martyr for the oppressed in Latin America and the world. His diary reveals a much different person, revealing a side to him - the coming of age story - that almost every person experiences. This document is beautiful and personal in narration, and quite enjoyable to read. I recommend to read it whether or not if you've studied Ernesto Guevara."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Film, Bad Music","review":"Two Tars is probably one of Laurel & Hardy's greatest silent films. The print is good and the picture is clear. The only problem with this film is the music. The music in this film for the most part does not fit well with the action on the screen. In some parts especially the climatic highway scene is actually distracts away from the action. But, if you like Laurel & Hardy you should get this film. You can always ignore or mute out the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"This is one of the demolition classics. I laughed uproariously at it the first time I saw it, and it has held up to repeated viewings. Ollie and Stan are much more amoral than they are in their later films, so the humor is partly fueled by surprise as they provoke other hapless drivers. But the timing of the gags is excellent, the comedy clicks on all levels. The film is somewhat similar to Big Business, another demolition classic, though more anarchic and sprawling."},{"rating":"1","title":"the book is not well printed","review":"There is something wrong about the book. I think the book was just reprinted from an old copy with labels and marks on it. It is not a new book. There are so many print problems on this book. I wish I could show you some pictures I took from it. I was upset about it. Could anyone contact me to solve the problem?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's always old news by the time it arrives.","review":"I agree with the other reviewers, the magazine never arrives on time. It took 3 months to finally get started and now I go 3-4 weeks before a few finally trickle in. I never get them all. My address label is always placed on top of someone else's address label. I have called customer service (800-228-4957) many times and nothing has ever been resolved. I subscribe to other weekly magazines and do not have this problem with them. I will never subscribe to Life & Style again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never know when you'll get it","review":"Decent magazine as far as content for fashion and gossip, but I also agree with another reader with the fact that you don't know when/if you'll get one. I won't get one for two weeks, then I'll get three at once. Then nothing for two weeks, then one will come. Very sporadic. I emailed my complaint and will see how/if it gets resolved. I've never had any other issue with weekly magazines."},{"rating":"1","title":"this magazine is horrible","review":"i hate this magazine. it always comes late, if at all. i don't have any problems with the other magazines i subscribe to. buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for the next one!","review":"Obi is a gifted writer, and I hope The Last and Final King won't be his last and final book. It has lots of imagery, a skillful use of language, and an intriguing story. It reminds me of Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Best","review":"This novel is, quite simply, the best I've ever read, and I've read a lot. You will have to slug your way through the first 70 pages the first time through. After that, it's the Fyodor D. at his best throughout. Dostoyevsky is the only author who can elevate the reader to such heights with a mere account of a discussion over dinner. I love Crime & Punishment and the Brothers K., but this one is my favorite of all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed a strict editor","review":"This is an extremely complex book, where Dostoyevsky indulges in frequent philosophical digressions, indulging a few personal vendettas (notably and most amusingly against Turgenev) along the way. These are tedious, in places, and grind the already creakingly slow plot to a painful crawl. The book was originally published in a periodical, and in a hurry, so presumably without the strong editor it desperately needed. However, the aimlessness and intellectual bankruptcy of the atheist nihilists is crystal clear (FD's purpose in writing the book), as is the sense of panic throughout Russian society: the unrest among the serfs and young radicals presented a problem for which the ruling class had no solutions. That in itself did not make the book worth reading or indeed writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hellish book","review":"I must confess I do not care for Dostoyevsky and this is probably his weakest and least probable book. This is the book that he wrote as a kind of apology for having once been a revolutionary. While I can agree that the people who populate this book are scoundrals and this probably is accurate, the ending is just horrible. Here we have the old revolutionary, \\"People's Will\\" stalwart marching through the snow having been discarded by everyone and on his deathbed crying out for the gospels. I just did not buy it and do not think anyone really can suspend disbelief to do so either."},{"rating":"1","title":"For fans only; early L & H effort isn't typical","review":"Stan and Ollie are cavemen in this silent farce comedy filmed in 1927. Laurel and Hardy weren't yet a team, so they appear mostly as solo characters: Stan as a sissy and Ollie as a bully. There is some decent visual humor (including a shot of the prehistoric \\"flying elephants\\"), but the soundtrack for this tape is terrible, as a single 78-rpm instrumental is heard for a mind-numbing ten consecutive times. Turn the volume down and enjoy the sight gags."},{"rating":"2","title":"L&H as cavemen","review":"This isn\`t really a L&H; film, but they are both in it. Filmed in 1927 the boys had not yet beened teamed up together. They justboth happened to be cast by Hal Roach in this film as solo characters.Still it\`s a cute and funny film.

Using 27 songs, one gets all of the best Carpenters material. While it is called a Greatest Hits collection, it stands a concern why so many of the lesser known tracks make the cut. The songs from \\"Made in America\\" - namely \\"Back in My Life Again\\" and \\"Those Good Old Dreams\\" were not substantial hits whatsoever, and they seem slightly out of place on this album. Notably missing is the Carpenters masterful version of \\"Solitaire\\" - a top twenty hit in 1975 that surprisingly doesn't surface while many other passive hits make the collection. Still, the album is beautifully remastered and many have the fresh sound that is so wonderful. \\"Please Mr. Postman\\", \\"This Masquerade\\", and \\"Sing\\" are clearer than ever here and are more. Buy this if you are a fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yesterday Once More","review":"A great collection of The Carpenters songs. Was made two years after Karen Carpenter passed away. Karen Carpenter sang and did some of the drums and Richard Carpenter played the keyboards. The brother and sister sounded great on this recording.

If two CD's worth of the Carpenters is just too much sweetness for you, there are some fine single disc collections available as well, but everyone ought to have at least one CD with their best songs.

Two days after hooking up the set the remote controls (both for the cable - which was now programmed to control the tv - and the original tv control) no longer turned the set on immediately. I now have to stand there and press that ON button at least 15 times before the set actually turns on. I disconnected the set from the cable and unplugged it for an entire day hoping it would reset itself but to no avail. The set still humms incessantly when turned off and takes an eternity to turn on. I HATE THIS TV. Olevia's customer service sucks.

If his father, injured by a neighbor's mad sow, was ever to walk again, young Joss Melbourne had to raise $500 for an operation by getting the family's hogs to Prarie Town for shipment while the price was high. And when Joss' herding dog, Firetop, is severely injured, the obstacles seem insurmountable.

At least these aren't intelligently written songs in the first place, so I won't complain that Kidz Bop is somehow damaging the integrity of legitimate musicians. But come on, is there anyone out there who really thinks its normal for 4 year old kids to be singing about alcohol, drugs, and sex?

Or any of the other Kidz Bop albums. I have the first two. Big mistake. They turn great songs into horrid performances. I mean, Avril Lavigne's care-free tomboy feel is completely lost in their version of 'Complicated.' It sounds like the singer is the kind of person who's concerned with their hair, makeup, and face. The kids are terrible singers (off pitch, off melody, off key, and plain way too high) and the lead vocalists are horrid, too.

That means you have to watch the annoying chat parts over and over again.The game play is very difficult. You have to keep changing weapons because they power down. The magic is total crap because you need to put it on a weapon. So to change magic you need to change weapons. Also very annoying.This is not a game for a beginner at all.

The whole premise is NEGS in the ground chasing after you looking for a weak point to get into your body. The good thing to know is they can't travel very fast and can't pass through,over or under running water.Many times the author states using a garden hose with the water turned on and carry a possessed person over the hose to break the connection.

Stipe's voice is still really young and he just sings really passionately on almost all the numbers. There are some just beautiful songs - Shaking Through and Perfect Circle and Talk about the Passion and Laughing - these are the mellower ones. Laughing starts out with a kickin' bass run that I repeat over and over now and again- GO Mike! West of the Fields and 9-9 round out the album with edgy political songs. We Walk is just strange, but really fun to bop around to. Alot of teh album is really bare, all elements exposed, lots of arpeggio electric guitars, straight beats, high vocals and roaming bass. - thanks for reading, now order this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshing","review":"This is not my first REM experience, but perhaps one of the best. Years back, I started with their most recent CD (Automatic) at the time and listened to them backwards from there. Their recent stuff is fun, but I do not recommend my method. This CD is beautiful - pure, melodic and definitely not overproduced. Definitely up there with the \\"essentials\\" for REM if not all time.Considering the era when REM created this music, it is astounding. Emerging from a scene stuck in the murk of metal and the just plain goofiness of pop, this music is brilliant in its simplicity. I wish wish wish I would have heard this first; I would have been more than a casual REM fan much sooner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the pre-Warner years...","review":"Murmur is REM Mark 1 at their very best. It sounds like they'd been recording together for years and this sombre, reflective album is seamless and assured. Not for everyone, and it takes a few plays, but Perfect Circle and We Walk rank among the band's greatest tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff","review":"I couldn't agree with the review right below this one any more. I'm an big Replacements fan, and R.E.M. is one of those other college rock bands I'm big on. This album does not contain any hits. It was an enormous indie album when it came out, but that was it, commercial success was a long way away. I've got pretty anti-commercialist feelings in my musical persuasions, so hits don't really concern me much, but if you're looking to hear their big top ten smash singles, they're not here.This is my favorite R.E.M. album. They've changed a lot over the years, sometimes for good and sometimes for worse, but I always compare their new stuff to their brilliant debut. It's an acquired taste (much like some of the Replacements work), to a degree. Don't judge by the first listen! Stick with it. Listen to the whole album three or four times and all of a sudden... WHAM! It's one of the greatest things you've ever experienced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaking Through? More Like Shaken Down","review":"23 dollars? For a remastered version of 'Murmur' and a concert that, as someone else said, has been available online for years? Compare this to the Pavement reissues that are currently going on, which contain twice the music included here (the original album remastered, concerts, b-sides, outtakes, non-lp tracks) and are sold for the price of a single CD (14 dollars on Amazon for a brand new copy.) Keep in mind, this is not a review of the music, which in my opinion is some of the best ever made (and the only reason this isn't a 1-star review.) But I was literally shocked by the price. The ironic thing is, 'Murmur' was originally sold at a lower list-price (I think it was a dollar less) when originally issued. Making up for lost time, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"We all have one...","review":"I know Murmur's listed in many a \\"best album of the 80's\\" list, if not \\"best ever,\\" I know it was a breakthrough for a particularly progressive sound, I know people worship at the temple of Michael Stipe, but I HATE this album. We've all got one - that album that everyone tells you is brilliant, but does absolutely nothing for you. This is mine, an album that provokes near violent reactions in me (\\"Radio Free Europe\\" excluded). Stipe to me has a snoozy, self-loving vocal ability that borders on pompousity often, and the production is soporific at best, full of its own low-fi eagerness. Songs like \\"Moral Kiosk\\" are preachy, poorly constructed, and don't age well - this song sounds like it was made in the early 80's by people who thought they were revolutionary. They may have been right - now, it only recalls 100 more interesting albums that came after its release."},{"rating":"2","title":"masterpiece","review":"one of the best moments in life!! listen to this masterpiece of american music!!! amazing album!!! still rem is a great band, but the \\"garageland\\" style of music from the early albums still are the best!!!!!!!!!!!!reckoning is also great!!!!!!!! to listen till you die!!! hi hi!!!!! rock'n roll never die!!!!!Reckoning [2 CD Deluxe Edition]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Push/Pull","review":"This is an album of incredible beauty, richness, and paradox. It sounds like country music but the lyrics are nonsensical. It sounds spare yet the more you listen, the more you hear buried voices in the background. I love these songs because the words, rather than adding up to a message, work in perfect consort with the already amazing melodies. \\"Multiplying Katy Buys a Kitchen Size-ma-nightmare\\" never sounded better! And it's one of those rare albums that sounds good on the crappiest audio equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny plus...","review":"What keeps bringing me back to R.E.M.'s \\"Murmur\\" is that I can still discover something new each time I listen. Whether it's some noise buried deep in the mix, or a new interpretation of a lyric, there's always something. For longtime fans of the disc, I strongly recommend Mobile Fidelity's Gold Disc. The reproduction from the original masters is far superior to the regular discs - especially in the bass and drums. Pick this one up and you'll enjoy rediscovering a favorite all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the greatest album of all time","review":"All I have to say is that 9-9 is the greatest song I've ever heard. (I hated it on 1st, 2nd, and 3rd listen. I didn't know what was going on. It was far too confusing. But all of a sudden, I figured it out.)This may be the best album I've ever heard as well. Even though they went on to be the most creative, interesting band of the next 20 years, REM never topped this disc. I guess you aren't guaranteed to love it (but you probably will). Either way, everyone who cares about music should hear the album that started alternative rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"This is one of R.E.M's earliest works, I think the EP \\"Chronic Town\\" might be the first?

From the opening of the superb first track \\"Radio Free Europe,\\" you know you're in for something special. Sure, Michhael Stipe mumbles most of the words, that's part of the charm. R.E.M. has become less interesting as their lyrics have become more distinct. Classic tracks abound, including \\"Pilgrimage,\\" \\"Talk About the Passion,\\" \\"Catapult,\\" and \\"Sitting Still.\\" The sound redifined college rock in the 1980s.

If new bands could only make albums like this one","review":"R.E.M. has always been my favorite band of all times and I was very intrigued to listen to a remastered edition of this album (one of its best I must say). Well, as soon as I pushed play on my stereo I started singing all the songs and dancing a little bit all around my bedroom. It seems that this songs are timeless everytime I listen to them. They just get better and better!!! I knew back in the early 90s (when I first listened to Murmur) that R.E.M. would be a band I would love for many years. So, now that I listened to it again I just confirmed what I thought back then.

Although I love their more recent work, this CD stands out as the premiere REM CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"a magical beginning","review":"Murmur is a really great record, but not the superior one like many people say. The sound is kind of strange. It's like a mix of 60's, new wave/post punk and folk, and the sound alltogether seems totally original REM. The albumcover is fantastic, i can't think of any cover before Murmur that looked like that and it's in good harmony with the songs.However the last two songs are not as good as the otherBeware of bonus tracks on some versions because they only kill the mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"Feels flimsy and buttons stick. an old tape measure stapled to a stick might be nicer then this.

You will be amazed at his compassion and his staff."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Journey Through Cancer","review":"Cancer can be such a harrowing experience! Addressing the deeper underlying issues - especially the emotional and spiritual levels of the disease - is a realm that most physicians choose not to explore. Dr. Geffen's technical brilliance as an oncologist is obvious; what is truly extraordinary is his incredible patience and compassion for not only the individual(s) with cancer but the families and friends who are also impacted by this disease. \\"Journey\\" is the perfect description of the process of coping with cancer and Dr. Geffen is the perfect guide. Anyone with cancer or anyone who knows someone with cancer, will benefit greatly by reading this book and sharing it with others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gangsta King","review":"Given the subject matter, one could hardly expect a high budget production but what Gangsta King delivers is little more than a modern day blaxploitation docu-flick. Understandably Greg \\"Batman\\" Davis is seeking to portray Raymond Washington in a favorable light but putting it out that Raymond was totally against guns and never carried one is taking it abit far. Contrary to legend, the crips were violent from day one as were the L.A. gangs which pre-dated their emergence. The most interesting thing about this documentary is Batman's photographs beyond that this is one documentary you would be best served renting or borrowing from the library. The historical recreations of past events is terrible due to poor acting and this sums up the rest of the video.

James Patterson tests the limits of the reader's suspension of disbelief with his blatant tactics of manipulation. It is too impossible to believe that a niece, a fiancee, a partner and a new lover can all become targets of one \\"mastermind\\" killer after another. To have the killers turn out to be people that Alex Cross knows time and time again is laughable. His sentences are no longer than 10 words and his chapters no more than 3 pages, leaving no room for character development. I couldn't get past the first half of the book before giving up in disgust. Take my advice, check out Michael Connelly or Karin Slaughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irrelevant Ending","review":"The book which starts off the chain of mystery thrillers with Alex Cross as the main character. It is pretty interesting up til the last few pages. The clues dropped along the way were just not relevant or enough to lead the reader to the identity of the murderer.

They just put in so many bank pages I guess they thought the public would not notice they only have 1/2 of the book here. You have to go buy another book to finish the story. Don't know if the Author or the Publishing company dreamed this up, obviously they have no respect for the intellegence of the public."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good turn, but very open ended","review":"I too tore through this in one sitting. I was immersed in the back and forth that he was able to keep up with family and police work. I am just still wondering, how many mysteries are still left hanging there at the end. I read series novels to be able to keep up with the characters lives and careers, not to have to re-read them to figure out a clue I might have missed. Otherwise, this eagerly anticipated next installment to the Alex Cross saga was much appreicated by this reader!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell?","review":"I've been a big fan of books since I was a kid forced to read them when I was in school. Ironic as that statement sounded, i do like books. I also like movies. I watched Kiss the Girls and Along came a Spider. I figured the plot seems out of the ordinary and the protagonist has the intellect of Da Vinci, the books would be great, too. I picked up a copy of Roses are Red and thought, \\"What the hell?\\" The storyline was weak and it was poorly written. Nothing was as fanciful as I thought it would have been. When he finds out who the antagonists are, it was nothing like I would have imagined it. It seemed like he found them out by imagining out in his head. Most writers would put description of the clues their heroes found. This one didn't. I was pretty upset by this book. I'm going to try another one later, but for now, one Patterson novel seems enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but good","review":"I loved this book. Read it and you'll love it too.

I'm planning on reading all the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing until the last line","review":"I am trying to read the series in order, and this is the first one out of 6 that was disappointing. I thought it was sloppy. If the so called Mastermind knew what Alex Cross looked like, why would Alex then go and try to work in the hospital where the Mastermind was a patient. Of course he would see Cross and begin to run or cover his tracks. Dumb!!!! Yes the last line was a shocker, but seriously, that was the only part that sparked my interest. As far as Alex's personal life....what a mess! I will continue to read the series, but I hope this one was just a bump in the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roses are Red","review":"I love the Alex Cross series. Roses are Red kept making me ask myself \\"do things like this really happen\\" - of course, I ask myself that question with every Alex Cross book I read; I guess they do, and it's scary. Overall, the book is well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unputdownable!","review":"Read this in a less than a day! Great story with Alex Cross, one of fiction's most likeable characters. Some people knock Patterson, but millions more love his stories. For me their accessibility to all is one of the great appeals, like with Steinbeck. Most chapters have amazing cliffhangers, so it was a case of \\"I'll read just one more chapter\\" a hundred times! A thrilling unputdownable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"This is the first book I've read by this popular author. And it will be the last. The plot was just interesting enough to keep me wondering how the book would end, but the writing style was way too simple-minded and predictable for my taste. I kept thinking \\"2nd-grade primer\\".Several years ago I saw a movie adapted from one of his books, and it was good. Perhaps his stories are better told on the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep em comin'!","review":"I have to say that Roses Are Red is by far one of the better James Patterson novels I've read. While Jack and Jill is my favorite, this one is up there, along with Cat and Mouse.I was very disappointed in Pop Goes The Weasel. I had to force myself to finish reading it cause I was so bored.Many have come here saying that they would have prefered to have a conclusion to all of this, instead of a sequel. But ... isn't that the whole point. It's one of those sitting on the edge of your seat feelings that makes you want to rush out and buy the next episode.Can't wait to see where Patterson takes Cross next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful!","review":"As a long time Patterson fan, I'm convinced this book was written in a week's time. Sloppy character development, trite language, and a ridiculous ending. You can just do so much with the noble Alex Cross and his precocious children before they start to wear thin. The characters may have different names, but the story is same old, same old. It's almost as if Patterson picks the crime and the names of the characters out of a hat and then attempts to develop a plot.It appears that Mr. Patterson is resting on some very old laurels and no longer feels the need to engage his readers. It might be time for Alex Cross to consider early retirement to a condo on the beach.My only solace is that I received this book free from a book club. Rather than spend YOUR money, donate it to a worthy cause instead. Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Old Patterson","review":"I have been an avid fan of James Patterson for years and have read, or rather, listened, to most of his books. After reading POP GOES THE WEASEL I couldn't wait to read his next book. Thinking that CRADLE AND ALL was the natural title for its sequel I was quite disapointed to find out that the book totally deviated away from Alex Cross and his normal thrillers. Then I was elated to find that Alex was back in ROSES ARE RED and couldn't wait to get my hands on it. I hate to say this but this book reads like one written by an amateurist James Patterson. The plot is not intense, the language school like and the suspence weaker then the punch line of a poorly told joke. Also, the person reading this version left much to be desired in the way of entertainment. So often it is the reader that makes the book, but this edition leaves much to be desired in both the reader and content. Sorry, Mr. Patterson, but you left an ardent admirer down with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great one from Patterson","review":"This is another great novel from James Patterson. This just like all the rest of Patterson's is an action-packed novel, but there is little character development or background on the characters. This novel involves a criminal who calls himself the Mastermind. He conducts many bank robberies which seems to lead to no point. Of course detective Alex Cross gets brought into the case. This novel's altogheter is good excpet it leaves you hanging for his next novel coming out this spring."},{"rating":"1","title":"I once loved Alex Cross books","review":"I am utterly appalled at how far the Alex Cross series fell with this one. \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\" was a retread but this one was absolutely just mailed in. And the ending is not only a cliffhanger but a cheap one at that. The identity of the killer is completely out of left field and totally unimaginative. Who's gonna be the next villain? Nana Mama?And not only that, more Cross family members and/or love interests get killed, mortally ill, or injured. It couldn't possibly happen on EVERY case, ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing....","review":"This was my first experience reading James Patterson and his protagonist, Alex Cross. I had to try to grasp some of the characters which had figured in previous Cross novels. it was a fast read because of the short chapters, some a little longer than a few paragraphs. The ending seemed rushed with another murder and an unsatisfactory twist in the last chapter. This was just a vacation read, but I felt baffled and cheated when all was done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable","review":"This is the fourth book I've read by James Patterson and the last. I was okay with it up until the last quarter of the book when it became a typical ending for him. His writing is just too predictable and Alex Cross' kids CANNOT be that perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson is the only victim of the crime.","review":"Patterson apparently has deterined that the pattern for success as a writer must be offset by the failures of his hero (Dr.Cross). Cross fails to capture the killer, fails to mend his romance with Christine and fails to develop his new love interest. \\"Roses\\" allows Patterson to continue with this theme in the sequel that will no doubt tie up all the loose ends. Unfortunately he will have considerably fewer readers if he doesn't maintain some continuity of effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"These roses are wilted.","review":"I'm a Patterson fan, but didn't find this to be one of his better books.

After finishing the book I am waiting for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a book that doesn't take a lot of thinking","review":"If you enjoy books that you can just whip through in one day then this is the book for you. This was an easy read, a little to easy for my tastes. The chapters were very small and the story was missing something. If you enjoy books where you have no idea who the killer is and you just can't quiet pick out the one who did it then get another book. The ending left a lot to be desired. So if you like a quick easy book Roses Are Red is it. If you need a little more suspence and action then don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Book Different Title","review":"Like many other reviews I have read on this book, I found it very disappointing, and I only read it because in the past James Patterson has written some fine stuff. The last two books he has written on Alex Cross is very similar to his earlier stories, Did he merely change the names of the people kidnapped and murdered. I think so. I have vowed never to read another JP book again. Vicki, Canberra, AUSTRALIA"},{"rating":"1","title":"See Alex Run. Run Alex Run. See Alex...","review":"As a long time fan I am truly disappointed in James Patterson. His latest Alex Cross novel reads like a grade school primer. The focus is more on Delaware, who is portrayed as an empty shell of a man wandering about aimlessly, than on any 'heart pounding' 'thriller'. Now if you want a real dynamic character try reading Lee Child's Jack Reacher series. Fantastic!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened ?","review":"I have to say that I was extremely disappointed at the end of this book. Far from being a surprise twist at the end, it felt more like Mr Patterson was struggling to meet a deadline and had run out of ideas for the bad guy. So, at the end of the book, nothing ties in, the motive isn't clear and its inconsistent with the other Alex Cross novels. Without tying up the loose ends in Rose are Red I wonder how a sequel would work, assuming the fans of the Alex Cross series don't give up after this one.Up until the last chapter it was fairly decent, not his best work but good all the same. However the last chapter ruined the whole book and left the impression that it was poorly thought out and a very sloppy ending. Sorry !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Roses are Wilted","review":"I love mystery stories -- those by Ludlum, Marcia Mueller, Anne Perry, Michael Connelly, William Bernhardt, Bill Pronzini and Michael Palmer -- to name just a few off the top of my head. This was the first time I read James Patterson -- and UGH...It is so slipshod -- and the ending is just for shock value -- no preparation -- no follow through -- I felt as if I was being set up for the NEXT book....but you can be sure I will not read it. And the style -- there are 126 Chapters all about 2 pages long, large print, extensive margins -- and no content...And the characters leave a lot to be desired. PLEASE, PLEASE -- maybe someone else is ghost-writing Mr. Patterson's books... I have to say the plot was thrilling and interesting...but the execution (forgive the pun) was poor. PLEASE forwarn your readers....skip the roses...this time...no accolades, no flowers and no champagne on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roses are Red . . . This Book has it ALL","review":"All that is, with respect to characters made up of thin cardboard, plotting that is trite and predictible, and dialogue that can only be described as ludicrous with \\"perps\\" showing up seemingly out of thin air. This book is not much more than a quicky movie script that Mr. Patterson no doubt hopes will be picked up by Hollywood. Certainly, Mr. Patterson's tacked on ending literally screams for a sequel --- Hmmmmmmm - How about calling that book (and movie) \\"Violets are Blue\\". That would seem to be in line with Mr. Patterson's level of ingenuity.All in all, this is absolutely one of the worst crime/mystery novels I've ever read. And to top it off, the author is laughing all the way to the bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Make the Cut","review":"I found this book to be disappointing. It just didn't live up to the level that James Patterson has established for himself. The book was an easy read, and held my interest. Which is the worst part, because I invested a few hours to read the book and I was enjoying untill the ending just ruined everthing. Just when you thought you knew who the \\"mastermind\\" was Patterson threw at you a new \\"mastermind\\". When you finally found out who the villian was it was just disappointing and unbelievable. I hope Patterson's next book is better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"A thick book but a quick read without much 'meat'.

I like his story telling, his plotting, and the 2 1/2 page chapters. This book was typical Patterson. Alex Cross is charming, the bad guys are nasty, and the action is great. One drawback of this book however was the twist-ending. Without giving away too much, I was disappointed - I was hoping for a more concrete answer to my questions. All in all an enjoyable read though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best, but not bad","review":"I'm a huge James Patterson fan and was looking forward to his new book. This book was the same fast paced, page turning book that Patterson always writes, but it wasn't up to par with \\"Kiss the Girls\\" or \\"Cat and Mouse\\".

It seems Mr. Paterson is writing books to fulfill a contarctual obligation, rather than to generate thrillers like Kiss The Girls & Along Came A Spider. The plot is superfluous, empty, and very sophmoric. What happened to the Alex Cross of earlier books, where the challenges were real and intense. Please don't write junk and expect your readers to buy it. Loyalty goes just so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roses are Red","review":"Not James Patterson's best. This book was a bit of a let down compared to his others. Poor start, had some holes, but picks up at the end. Some of the story just had no reason to be there. What was that?

There is a new psychopath killer in town and he goes by the name of the Mastermind. The Mastermind plans a series of bank and insurance companies robberies while in the meantime he takes some hostages life while on his journey.

The book was a real page turner right up until the last two chapters. In fact, after the last chapter I turned the page thinking I had stuck two or three pages together. I think Mr. Patterson got tired and just stopped writing. The book doesnt end. It just stops.

Roses Are Red is worth the 2-3 days it will take you to read it. It reads very quickly, and you probably won't want to put the book down. This isn't the best Alex Cross story, and even though The Mastermind is evil, he is no Gary Sonji. As a bonus,I like the way The Weasel was mentioned a few times in this book...exciting things to come from this I'm sure.Unlike some reviews of the book, I enjoyed reading how Cross reacts to the tough situations he is faced with concerning his family.I really wanted to give this book 5 stars, but I couldn't because I saw the ending coming. Unfortunately, it wasn't such a huge surprise to me. But it is still a good ending. Overall, I thought the book was pretty good, and I sat there thinking that I really want Dr. Alex Cross to be happy, whatever that means for him.So, Cross your fingers and read like mad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is that all there is?","review":"Doesn't an author owe us a beginning, middle and ending to a story? If so, Patterson doesn't deliver. What a strange and disappointing ending to a book that moved well, albeit mimicking past Patterson plots. Should we not want to purchase the next Patterson/Cross based solely on its merits and not on the fact that we need closure to Roses are Red? This game is not being played fairly, and I doubt I will purchase the \\"must have sequel\\" to this one. Have you no allegiance to your fans, Mr. Patterson. We're the ones who got you to where you are!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Clues. No Reasoning. No Fun.","review":"This was my first James Patterson novel, picked up on a weekend vacation. I like mysteries, crime novels, etc. and I will say it really was a page turner. I was anxious to get to the end to see who was the \\"Mastermind\\", since I hadn't been able to tell so far. I was so thoroughly disappointed with the way Patterson ended it. Fans of this genre like to at least guess at who the killer might be. I almost get the impression that Patterson didn't even know. Just picked someone at the end. No clues. No reasoning. No fun.I might give Patterson one more try. He's sold so many millions of books, something must be entertaining. But not this one. I wish I'd read the reviews before purchasing. I wouldn't have."},{"rating":"1","title":"you've got to be kidding....","review":"What a disappointment....I've faithfully read every James Patterson book and especially love the Alex Cross books...but this one was a real let down.

I was read it in about a day, and the plot was gripping but nothing special. Nothing was challenging about the read, either. What truly ruined the book was the extremely predictable and unexplained ending. The murderer was too obvious that I immediately dismissed the possibility that he could be the Mastermind. I was very disappointed. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLOT TWIST SAVES A SLOPPY 'THRILLER'","review":"As time goes by I feel my admiration for James Patterson slipping away. His books aren't exactly groundbreaking, and every book in the Alex Cross series seems to be a repeat of the last one. As for our hero, Mr Alex Cross, he seems to be the Ally McBeal of the crime/thriller genre. Just how many times have his girlfriends been killed? When he's not locking away serial killers he seems to be reminising his lovelife, and dating even more women.Roses Are Red yet again takes us to familiar territory...If you don't pick this novel apart like I did you might get some enjoyment out of it. If you do, read something else, there are so many good books out there that it feels like a waste of time reading junk like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"I didn't finish it. Patterson's search for ever-more-horrible villans makes these books more horror stories than detective novels.There is very little reality: criminals can't act like Patterson's bad guys because they need to sleep, need cash, can't anticipate every eventuality, ... His criminals aren't.Also, the number of cops who have had 2 partners killed in succession is zero, much less partners who were lovers.Label it FBI-wet-dream fantasy, but not detective fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"such a waste of time","review":"When I browsed through the first few pages of this book in a bookshop, I couldn't help but falling in love with the fast pace of story, making you sweet from the very first lines, but I can't tell you how disappointing it turned out to get as I proceeded through the book, and especially at the end. I just tell you that there is no end, you just feel like a fool, spending all your time, keeping track of all the murders and so just to discover that it ends unfinnished and they probalby expect you to go and buy another book! Very clever folks, but thank you! It was the first book I ever bought from James Patterson and it gonna be the last as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't come much worse than this.","review":"This must be the worst thriller I've ever read. If you've read an Alex Cross novel before, you have a damn good chance of working out who the mastermind is, no matter how implausible it may be. This is at least the 3rd Patterson book with the same sort of 'shock' revelation of the bad guy. I resent paying full price for a book when at least 1/4 of the pages are blank due to the number of short chapters - 125!!! It will take a hell of a recommendation for me to go near a James Patterson book again after reading this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patterson always good","review":"All James Patterson books are great reads. Going back to the beginning and reading them all. . . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roses Are Red","review":"Typical Alex Cross in what we've come to expect - ridiculously overreaching genius unkillable (main) bad guy who can not be touched except by Alex. The Author seems to thrill in running the protagonist through an emotional ringer. Continually setting Alex up with the bad guy's \\"outrageous\\" \\"unthinkable\\" vile deeds, continually showing a bad guy with no redeemable qualities, but yet Alex must capture him so that he can escape later to re-terrorize Alex and his family. His action sequences are rarely coherent in a time line - villains are covered by weapons, but are able to so \\"suddenly\\" draw a weapon and start firing and/or turn lunge and escape. It is more like the author thinks in a turn based system, where everyone gets some action then waits for the other guy to go, and he gets to do all his actions before anyone can react. Very unrealistically described action sequences."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"James Patterson's Alex Cross' books have been a little up and down. This one is ok.

I've pretty much read all of Patterson's books but missed Pop Goes the Weasel so when it was referenced in this book I felt like I needed to have read Pop Goes.. It becomes difficult at times to know which books reference Alex Cross and which are completely different (ie. Cradle and All) when you see a book published. Patterson writes so many books it's hard to keep track. As far as this book is concerned, you should definitely read all previous Alex Cross books before reading this book. The ending will make a lot more sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating book.","review":"I've enjoyed many of Patterson's books in the past, but I have to agree with many of the posts here. Roses Are Red is a complete let down. The surprise ending did nothing but make me angry at the writer. The last thing a writer should do is make thier readers feel cheated, and that is precisely what he did to me. Hope Patterson learns this lesson before his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocked, bothered by ending","review":"I guess I echo the sentiments of many of the other reviewers. I have become well acquainted with Alex Cross through many readings of Patterson's books, and the ending of Roses are Red, for two reasons, shocked and disappointed. But I cannot help but wonder what direction his next Cross novel will take because of the enormity of the ending. It throws everything out of whack. I am curious to see how the next book in the Alex Cross series fares. I loved the book, until about the fifth to last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good but not the Best","review":"Overall the book was a good book. It had signature action and deduction that i have been accustomed to as a James Patterson fan, however, the book wasn't as fast paced as i am accustomed to, also i found the ending abrupt and was left a little confused. It needed a little more explantion."},{"rating":"1","title":"One for the trash","review":"Roses are Red brings to mind the old joke of the customer at the bad restaurant complaining that the food is terrible, and there is too little of it. Not only is this book lazily written, the plot is implausible, uninteresting and the chapters are too short! If one actually counted the words in this book, it would probably qualify more as a novella than an actual novel. What I particularly disliked were the holes in the plot line. It seems that in \\"Alex Cross\\"-world there is no such thing as decent police procedures. Not only that, every villian is mainly after Alex Cross and probably is someone not only close to him but in law enforcement as well. (Actually James Patterson is not the only popular author to shovel this type of drivel on his readers.) If you like believable characters, interesting well-plotted books, decent writing and a feeling of satisfaction when you've finished, this is NOT the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read!","review":"This book was given to me by a patient and was my first time reading a James Patterson book. I absolutely fell in love with this author and the character of Alex Cross. I finished this book in 4 days and went to get more Alex Cross books. This book is definitely worth your time and will keep you in suspense until the very last page!

I am convinced Patterson does absolutely no research for his books. However, this is one of the worst offenders of his books. Patterson's plots using Cross are getting more and more far-fetched. It is reasonable to have one serial killer obsessed with Alex Cross but four or more get real. I also have a lot of trouble believing that no physical evidence would be found at a crime scene. This book was horrible poorly written and researched. If you like reading tripe this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick read, but not up to Patterson par","review":"I got this book and finished it in a total of three and a half hours. Although his books are usually a quick read, I became bored with the plot halfway through. Hopefully he will provide criminal motivation and method of thinking in the next book, because the criminal seems totally out of character here. I still haven't decided if I'll read the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinished Manuscript","review":"I was disappointed in this book. The beginning of the story caught my attention, even on vacation in Cancun, but I wasn't impressed with the way our hero tried to figure things out. In other books, he played a greater role and used his trained psychologist's abilities to look for a villain. It seemed to me that Patterson was running up against his publisher's deadline and was also looking for a beginning for the next book which will probably be called \\"Violets are Blue\\"; and maybe in that story, the Mastermind will be eliminated."},{"rating":"1","title":"You must be kidding!!","review":"I agree with some of the other reviewers that this book is highly disappointing, is transparent, easy to figure out, and gives us an ending that is simply a marketing ploy for the next book. Alex Cross whines and cries his way through more than 300 pages of poorly constructed action sequences, immature dialoque, and plain old boring scenes that we have seen over and over again.What happens to these authors, like Deaver, Pearson, and Cornwell, who write such excellent books and then along the way lose their energy, creativity and desire to deliver a decent product to their loyal readers. This drivel should be a the end of any list.

Guess what, it's WORSE!!There was NO suspense at all in this book, I don't even understand why it is called a mystery or suspense book. This reads like a bad tv movie. I'll give Mr. Patterson some credit though, I was surprised by who the \\"mastermind\\" was, but not in a good way! I don't understand what has happened to this book series, it's gone totally downhill! I can't believe the same man that wrote Kiss the Girls, wrote this book!I use to buy every Alex book in hardcover, but I won't be doing that again anytime soon!

However, I was extrememly disappointed with the turn of events. The subplots (Cross's daughter getting sick) should have been developed more. It seemed like they were just thrown in to fill up the pages. As for the \\"MasterMind\\", it made absolutely no sense when he was finally revealed. I felt like there should have been a couple of more chapters explaining it a little better.

I can't wait to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham-style cheap ending, not well thought out.","review":"I had a feeling when I saw Mr. Patterson hawking this book on television ads that this wasn't going to be a strong read. As I was reading, I had hopes that I was going to be pleasantly surprised, but he resorts to a very cheap trick at the end, forcing a sequel. Furthermore, the plot sort of jumps between situations, which is normal for his books--only this time, he doesn't develop either one very effectively. This book comes across as something that Mr. Patterson did under pressure from his publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was so excited to see a new book by James Patterson, whose books I have always enjoyed. This one was a disappointment to say the least. The writing was stilted, the plot old, and the ending was awful. I had to force myself to finish it, kept thinking it would get better. I think Mr. Patterson needs to take some time off, no need to be so quick to get another book out if this is the quality we can expect. I know he can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good...

The ending was very surprising but yet, it doesn't give a a reason for why the Mastermind has done all of this.

I will read the sequel however, to see what he has come up with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson Putters","review":"The good news is that I finished the story, it did hold my interest till the end. The premise is not all that different than his other books. I always liked the main and supporting characters-unfortunately they are not fleshed out enough. The dialog reminded me too much of words in a blurb written for a comic-book. I will say Roses Are Red is better than \\"Pop Goes The Weasel\\". Patterson's books are a fast read, they're not meant for book-club readings. His books are fast, quick and non taxing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I have always eagerly anticipated the next Alex Cross book and could hardly wait to get my hands on \\"Roses Are Red\\". To be fair I must say that I did find it to be a page turner to the very end. But I felt cheated and deceived by the ending. It was just not up to par. It almost seems as if someone else slapped on the last chapter or Mr. Patterson felt he had to come up with the most surprising ending he could think of to throw us \\"off the scent\\". If this was meant to entice us to read the next book I have to say it has had the opposite effect on me. I read because it offers a better stimulation of the mind than TV viewing. This ending seems to better suit a TV movie of the week. Weak. I expected better."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid reading if intelligence is an issue","review":"I picked up the book due to the high ratings it got by some reviewers only to be so disappointed by the glaring lack of intelligence in the plot, the writing, and the characters.

This is possibly the best Patterson murderer, and the climax of the story is sure to have you wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I have read other Patterson books and they were entertaining. This book though is frustrating that it depicts basically a superman criminal that can do anything. As you go through the book to find out who the criminal is Patterson let's you believe it is one person, and OK it isn't that person, so it is someone else, which is fine. But, then to finish the book with yet a third person being the Mastermind with no support, no reasons, no background; just a surprise ending is STUPID and FRUSTRATING. I had to read other reviews of the book to find out that the answers to this book might be in the next book.I will probably look at the next book to see if it does answers some of the questions in Roses are Red, but I will not buy it. I'll read it at a store or a library. I had spent enough time and money on this junk already."},{"rating":"2","title":"the most shocking ALEX CROSS yet..............","review":"this is probably the most shocking ALEX CROSS yet.....i was so shocked with the last few sentences of this book that i had to re-read what i just read............and the next thing you know i am already somewhere in the middle of VIOLETS ARE BLUE..........such a GOOD read..............maybe not so PAtterson-like but still a fine book..............."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Roses are Red is a great read.

I have read all of his books and enjoyed each and every one...until the last two. \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\" was horrible! It was as if he wrote it in an hour! I thought it was a mere lapse of genius, so I purchased and read \\"Roses are Red\\". His writing is elementary, his story lines so stale and boring, I hesitate to buy another book by him. While waiting for \\"Pop...\\", I began reading Jonathan Kellerman. Each book was different and exciting. I have now finished every book Kellerman has written. Mr. Patterson should try one to see what real writing is all about! If he's bored with writing, as he seems to be, does he not think I will become bored with reading him?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheated by the \\"ending\\"...","review":"I found most of this book to be a very good, fast read. But I was terribly disappointed by the ending, where Patterson abruptly pulled not one, but *two* bad guys out of a hat. There's an art to creating a good mystery/thriller; a technique of placing clues & hints for the reader to find, and Patterson for some reason decided to cheat at the end and just pulled the bad guys pretty much out of thin air. Very unsatisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"No way! Did he end this book like he did!","review":"I have read EVERYTHING James Patterson has wrote. Along came a spider and Kiss the girls are untouchable! I love the way Patterson writes with short easy to read chapters, and I can not wait till he finish's this book. HE BETTER FINISH IT! I think this book would have been up there with his best had he kept writting. I loved the ending but it would have been better had it been the end of a chapter not the book! Please don't make us wait a year for the end PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!! It's time to tie up all the loose ends in Alex Cross's life. When he let the weasel go without being caught that was almost okay because I expected him to return...now we have two unclosed things along with his personal life in shambles....come on lets get some closure and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cross's light extinguished","review":"I waited with eager anticipation for the arrival of a new Cross novel. \\"Roses Are Red\\" is possibly one of the biggest disappointments of the year. The writing bordered on junior high school essays. There was little character development...just plain shallow. So much for anticipation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"should have been much better","review":"I beleive this is my fifth Patterson book and sad to say it is not of the quality I have found with his other writings. The ending was not expected and not as a exciting finish would be. Seeing all the other reviews I feel I am repeating them. I hope a great writer will see his mistake and come back with a really good novel. Best of luck Mr. Patterson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"After waiting anxiously for the release, I was so disappointed with this book. I really disliked the short chapter layout, and short sentence structure. Not the usual Patterson writing. The storyline was vague and it didn't seem like Cross contributed anything to finding the killer. I'm not waiting anxiously for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time to read","review":"This is the first James Patterson book I have read so I can not compare it to his others and I am reluctant to read any of them at this point. I didn't mind the short chapters, but all of the chapters on his personal life seemed like filler to me. I kept waiting for something significant to happen there and nothing ever materialized. And the ending, I will not give it away but it is ridiculous. I like books that I can at least find a motivation for the crime but this book totally lacks one. I gave my copy to the library because I didn't want to give it to anyone I know after wasting my time reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cross needs to retire","review":"A very disappointing book. I found myself skipping through the secondary story of Cross' personal life. The main story was contrived. After finishing, I found myself re-reading uple of sections to try and find a link between the ending(s). I think this is the last Corss book I will purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best but still very good","review":"I've read all of James Patterson's books and agree with the other reviews that this isn't one of his best, but still an extremely good read. I finished this book in three days and enjoyed every chapter. It isn't as good as Along Came a Spider but still worth reading.Can't wait for his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Patterson book","review":"I agree with some of the reviewers who were really disappointed with this book. The ending makes no sense, particularly if you've read Patterson's other books. It's like at the very end, Patterson simply said, \\"Let's see, who do I want to say is the Mastermind?\\" Why didn't he just leave a blank and let the reader fill it in (the Lady and the Tiger). I think I'll pick Nana. Bottom line: Patterson's running out of good ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Patterson does it AGAIN.","review":"Another great book by James Patterson but more than that, another great story featuring his #1 detective, Dr. Alex Cross. I love his Alex Cross books and can't get enought of them. With the other Cross stories, you could pretty much guess (if you didn't already know) who the killer was.In Roses are Red, the killer is so unbelieveable that you have to just read that last chapter several times to say \\"I Can't believe it\\" All I could do was sit with my mouth open in total shock. The \\"Mastermind\\" IS a mastermind.I can't wait for the next Alex Cross installment and I hope and pray, Alex gets this person. Roses Are Red, just like all of the other Alex Cross books, is a MUST READ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I started reading Patterson several years ago with \\"Along Came a Spider\\" and I have bought each new Cross novel with anticipation. With each Cross novel after \\"ACaS\\", Patterson becomes more disappointing. This novel is a quick read, for sure, but not because of suspense - it is because of the length of each \\"chapter\\". There is no build up of tension, the Cross children have become ridiculous characters (this book dedicates too much time to them) and the ending, although a surprise, made me laugh out loud. I want to be shocked at the end of my thrill novels, not humored. This may be my last Cross novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson improves form last outing, but not worth the cost","review":"After \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\" I swore off buying anymore Patterson books. I borrowed this from my grandmother, and wasreminded why. (Although I will say that this book was at least notcompletely sloppily edited a la \\"Weasel.\\") First, thechapter structure left me feeling ripped off--... I expect some BOOKin a book. Second, the villain in this book is laughablly shallow,and the writing about him is tranparently misleading and clearlycontrived to create the \\"surprise twist.\\" Further, Pattersonneeds to find some new material-- I mean how many times are we reallygoing to believe that Cross has an astounding revelation that thereare TWO villains at work when it happens in his cases over and overand over again?!?! Please. All in all, wait for the paperback orskip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing ending","review":"This is my first James Patterson novel. I read \\"Against Medical Advice\\" which was based on a true story and i really enjoyed that one, so i thought this would be great. Well i kept reading and reading because it thought at some point Alex Cross was going to be this great hero, and prove to be a mastermind himself. But his biggest break in the case was when someone blew the whistle on their own father. No amazing display of detective work there.... In fact Alex Cross has NO CLUE until the end of the book... and yet i'm still unsure if he really knew. There was no motive no rhyme or reason for the ending.Not sure if i want to read another James Patterson book again. My husband had warned me that he didn't like james patterson, and i should have listened. Waste of time. Will have to try another author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost 5 stars............almost","review":"I would have given this 5 stars if Patterson would have stopped the novel when it should have ended. The surprise ending was such an obvious after-thought. I looked back through the book after I finished it and the surprise ending just doesn't work. But - I'm going to read Violets Are Blue and hope that Patterson makes it work."},{"rating":"1","title":"synopsis, not a novel","review":"This book reads like a synopsis or a book proposal. It's the Cliff Notes version. I appreciate a brisk pace, and Mr. Patterson certainly holds my attention, but there is almost no plot or character development, and the ending is a total cheat. There is no build-up to the big revelation at the end- it's just tacked-on, a big let-down. This is a good idea for a novel; add another 150 pages to flesh out the story and set up the ending, and there's a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roses are red","review":"I've never gotten the book as of yet, it was to be large print and not paper back, so it was return for the correct one.

It trully was a page turner and I could barely put the book down. I loved how the chapters were short and sweet. I am now searching to find more of this books to read to get some more of that action that keeps me on the edge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book, not his best, but far from his worse.","review":"I'd really like to give this book 3.99. Its close to a 4, but not quite. The pacing is fast like all Patterson books, and the plot is involving in interesting. However, I wasn't really suprised about the identity of the Mastermind character... but i've always had a knack for discovering plot twists before they come (this is Patterson, you know there's an unexpected one in their somewhere). I'm interested in reading the next novel, Violets are Blue. I love the Cross character, but I'm hoping that the 10th book in the series will be a 700+ page masterpiece concluding the series (one guy can only take som much, you know)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roses are Red - Alex Cross's finest outing","review":"I'm a pretty big fan of Alex Cross, and after reading all of his books i have to say that ROSES ARE RED has been the best yet.The Mastermind - Cross's new rival - was cunning, ruthless and always thrilled with the many twists and turns the story took. It kept me in suspense throughout the entire book all the way to the climatic ending with the biggest twist of all.Cross was his usual interesting character, while he showed some new emotions while trying to keep his relationship with Christine - who is still recovering from her kidnapping experience - at a stable point.Patterson has come a long way since \\"Along Came A Spider\\", Cross's first outing, and now i cant wait to see him again in the continuation to Roses are Red, \\"Violets are Blue\\" where the Mastermind's secret can finally be revealed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"I enjoyed this Alex Cross as well as the first book to this series. I can hardly wait for the next Alex Cross book to see what happens with Christina."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodnight, Alex Cross","review":"Alex Cross stumbles into the nightmarish world of deceit, when he walks right past the killer once again, thinking the bad guy is a friend/colleague. This premise from Patterson is getting tired. He tried it in Kiss the Girls, and it made out ok. I was fooled and was happy about it. Got my money's worth. This time was too much, though.Patterson lost a reader in me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am just thankful I did not pay for this trash!!","review":"My mom is a rabid fan of Patterson, and every time she finishes one of his books, she passes it on to me. Well, I have now read 3 and each time I have been disappointed. I have a bad habit of reading the last page of a novel before I am halfway done with it. Well, as those who have read this \\"book\\" will know, that is where he gives away the identity of Cross' nemesis, \\"The Mastermind\\". Did it help? No, I almost didn't finish the book because of it. Not only that, but there were NO clues telegraphed to the reader that this could possibly be the person responsible for the crimes. Come on, Mr. Patterson, we deserve better than that.I will say one positive thing: your habit of switching between 1st person singular and 3rd person singular was less grating this time because your protagonist was male. Please lay off writing from the 1st person singular if your protagonist is female - it doesn't ring true!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is one of his best. I couldn't put the book down and read the entire book in 1 day. The story was fast paced with interesting twists and turns. The ending leaves you waiting for the next book in the Alex Cross series. Already recommended this to everyone I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Part of the reason we read mysteries is the thrill of trying to uncover the bad guy before the end of the book. When the author never leaves any clues and then drops a bomb, the reader feels duped. You'll never guess who the Mastermind is until the very end because Patterson made sure you can't guess! It's as if he's taken the sport out of the mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great time!","review":"I'm sorry, but some of us never seem to get tired of Alex Cross. Eventhough Patterson has multiple books out, this one is probably my favorites. Yes, the ending is unexpected, yes, he uses some devices used in his other books, but overall it's great! Highly reommended.Also highly recommended: McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD and Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Forgettable Alex Cross\\"","review":"I got hooked on Alex Cross with Kiss the Girls, Along Came a Spider and the most spectacular of all, Step on a Crack. So, when I picked up Roses are Red, I expected the same page-turning suspense. To be honest, I can barely recall the plot in this forgettable book. I think that Roses Are Red is Patterson's attempt to re-create the successful, formulaic twist and turns of his previous Alex Cross books.... unfortunately, he is waaaay off the mark. Bank robbers are taking the managers families hostage as a way to crack the safes. Normally, once I start a James Patterson, a tornado could blow through my home and I wouldn't notice, however, I had to force myself to plod through this and make it through. A slow to start predictable plot that I hope I don't encounter again."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Two Cents","review":"Detective Alex Cross is investigating combination bank robberies/murders orchestrated by a criminal called The Mastermind, while dealing with two personal crises at home. Excellent story with good twists and quick plotting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story, with a twist","review":"Roses was a great story. I found it difficult to put this book down at nights and many times i stayed awake hours longer than i should have just to read what happens next. Initially, reading the begining i thought i might be unimpressed with a muderous bank robbing spree, but the character development and the thinkening of the plot really drew me in.Reading several of Patterson's Cross novels now how caused me to really feel for the characters in the story and that is a testament to Patterson's great writing style.The twist at the end this book will have you reeling. I'm still unsure whether i like the twist or not. Nevertheless, it was totally unforseen and i kind of like it when that happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect suspense","review":"patterson does it again with roses are red! Along with \\"Kiss the Girls\\" this is another book which I would classify as \\"perfect suspense.\\" From the moment I popped in the first cassette i was hooked. I spent an entire weekend sitting in coffee-houses sipping coffee and listening to this audiobook. i was literarly at the edge of my seat twoards the ending. The plot twists in this book will drive you dizzy with excitement. As for the ending, what a shocker! Though by then I had a pretty good idea who the true Mastermind had to be. Still, I gasped. i bought \\"roses\\" after \\"violets are blue\\" came out so now I do not have to wait. I know \\"violets\\" has gotten some bad reviews but patterson is great and he can do no wrong by me. I will ignore all the nay sayers and order \\"Violets\\" right away. Keep them coming James. Get this audiobook if you love suspense combined with a great plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a marketing ploy","review":"Although I've enjoyed previous Patterson books, this one was definitely weak and had a stupid, nonsensical ending, which leaves the reader going \\"huh?\\" At the end of the paperback version of this badly contrived \\"cliffhanger,\\" which came out in Oct. '01, they print a teaser first 3 chapters of the sequel, due out--surprise, surprise--in November! Forget it, Patterson, this reader isn't going to waste the money, especially on a hardback version. It's clear that marketing was a greater motivator than artistic integrity in this enterprise.I got the distinct feeling that Patterson must be tired of the characters but is pushed by publishers and greed to churn out additional books long after he's too burned out to do them justice. Call it the Patricia Cornwell effect. In fact, both Cornwell and Patterson have focused on their characters' burnout and depression, which seem to mirror their own feelings about feeling pressured to churn out another one. It's too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book reveals Author","review":"After many years of enjoying the writing of this talented author, he has finally outdone himself just as his genius bad guy in this book. Roses are Red has successfully become the beginning of a soap opera. Guess what? I do not care for soap operas nor the way this book ended. Not only has the mastermind successfully outwitted the good guys, the author has outwitted his reader into believing he wrote a book instead of a soap opera. I am so glad that there are so many other talented authors to read just as there are channels to watch something different than soaps. He has truly become a mastermind for some other fond readers other than myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I usually enjoy Patterson's novels, but like so many other reviewers, I was left baffled by this one. To me, it seemed as if he had no idea how to end the storyline and just picked the least likely person to be the 'villian.' I was literally trying to figure out if my book was missing a chapter or two or a dozen. Also, shouldn't he come up with a new twist by now? Why any of this is a shock to Alex Cross is beyond me, since everything that happens in this novel has happened to him in the previous novels.In some ways I hope he writes a new Alex Cross novel that explains the mess he made out of this one, but I won't be buying it in hardcover, that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"contrived","review":"does anyone in cross's family have any faults? why does the author tell us somthing, then repeat it in dialogue? where's the editor? the \\"twist\\" was weak, and the ending was so hollywood. too hollywood. alex solved nothing in this book. all infor was either handed to him, or some snitch popped up for unnanounced when it seemed all was lost. contrived. too many characters are introduced in a few pages. his daughters illnes came and went. contrived. and the short chapter thing sucks, especially when he breaks it off mid-scene. he's misusing and overusing that device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak story, ridiculous ending","review":"Can't say much good about this novel, and that's a huge disappointment. I've read every other Alex Cross novel and had eagerly anticipated this latest book. What a let down.The story was so weak that I was begging for a clean, quick resolution and was only rewarded with an ending so contrived and outrageously absurd that it left me angry and frustrated.Obviously this was a precursor to the next volume in the series, but I can't say whether I will actually read that novel or not, since I know the direction it will undoubtedly take will follow the ridiculous plot-twist set up in the last chapter. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"James Patterson, I think you have run out of steam. It took me forever to read this book, because there was not much suspense for me since it was all in pretty much the usual pattern. This time we are dealing with bank robbers of the most brutal kind and a mastermind behind this robberies. Also, Janie falls ill in this installment and Alex Cross finds a new romantic interest. Unfortunately, the book gives us not much closure at all but sets us up for the sequel. I guess either Mr. Patterson is getting very greedy or he had a deadline to meet."},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I missing?","review":"A disappointing effort, particularly the lame ending. Most disturbing is the fact that apparently DNA testing is not available in our nation's capital. The villain rapes one of his victims in an attempt to create an heir, yet even when they've apparently narrowed the search down to someone residing in one building, they just can't imagine who it could be. Wouldn't DNA have helped identify the killer here or did I miss one of Patterson's contrived explanations along the way? Save your money, its not even worth buying a used paperback of this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Retorical!","review":"James Patterson seems to be striving to become the king of the retorical question. This book is loaded with them!If you are at all interested in decent character development or well written dialog - do yourself a favor and don't spend money on this book.I have read several of Patterson's books, and this is by far the worst - and it will be my last!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick ride to nowhere","review":"The best thing I can say about this book is that it reads very quickly. The title makes no sense. The revelation on the last page is contrived and an obvious set up for the sequel. No clues along the way.

Get it together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Roses are Red","review":"The first James Patterson book I read, it was recommended by a neighbourI am now hooked on his books"},{"rating":"1","title":"Puh-leeze!","review":"This book is an exercise in reader manipulation. Conditioned by the likes of Michael Connelly and Jonathan Kellerman, I was expecting a crime and a compelling search that had some semblance of reality. Instead, I experienced a peek-a-boo shell game that defies whatever scant logic the plot provided, simply to provide surprise. The sole purpose of the book seemed to be creating a compelling need to buy the follow up. That won't happen for me. The dialog and the characters are cardboard. The only way Patterson creates dimension to a character is to kill them or someone close. I'll have to be patient and wait for the good stuff. Michael, Jonathan, write faster!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me wanting","review":"This book left me wanting more- but, not in a good way. I just wanted an ending. It's as though the publisher erred and forgot to print the last chapter. If I ever read another book by this author, I will have purchased it for 50 cents at a garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Patterson, please come back !","review":"Like so many other reviewers, I have been terribly disappointed in James Patterson's last several novels! I keep buying his books, hoping that I will be as thrilled with them as I was his first several efforts - but I've been continually disappointed! There is no depth to his characters anymore, they seem very thin and superficial.The stories he weaves are repetitve with never any closure to the plot or the character's situations.I will not buy his future novels in hardcover, until the \\"real\\" James Patterson returns to write stories with characters and relationships we care about,and a plot that can hold our attention for more that five minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Shot","review":"The conclusion is of the genre sometimes termed \\"cheap shot.\\" Beyond the fact that it has no merit, it is patently contrived to provide a jumping off for the next chapter in this unending series. Janet Reno and her successor would be thrilled to learn that their title has been changed to \\"Secretary of Justice.\\" Did no editor review the MS? There are numerous similar errors, should one chose to be picky. But the fact remains that such anomalies tend to disrupt the flow for the reader, and demonstrate a lack of respect by the author for his audience. I shall not come this way again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly disappointing","review":"This Alex Cross mystery is miserable. Truly. The detective is hit with disappointment after disappointment, the sociopathic killer is exceptionally depraved, and once this ponderous riddle is FINALLY resolved, the ending is unbelievably contrived and unfulfilling. Also, a note to Mr. Patterson: three paragraphs does not make a chapter. You don't get extra credit because of a high chapter count. I'd settle for a worthy follow-up to \\"Kiss the Girls.\\" It's been several years, and I'm still waiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"a return to form-almost!","review":"ROSES ARE RED IS A RETURN TO FORM ALMOST!

In this book the \\"Mastermind\\", a genius who is behind the bank robberies, is responible for the many deaths that occur. Then enters Alex Cross who is in charge of getting to the bottom of it all. This book will make you hold your breath until the very last page. This book rocks and is action packed. Get the whole collection, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put this book down","review":"I have to admit this is the 3rd book I've read by James Patterson, I think he's great. I'm a new fan of his, but I have to say that I'm going to continue to read his work as long as he keep writing it. I enjoy the Alex Cross stories the most, and this one was awesome. I found this book extremely intriguing and the plot kept twisting and turning as you got into the book. All the way through, I think I have a lock on who the \\"Mastermind\\" is, but as the end draws near...I figure out that I have no idea. James does a great job of keeping the chapters short so that you want to keep going and so that the momentum keeps building. I recommend this book for anyone who likes to read detective books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Roses?","review":"I didn't like this book at all, very slow moving, could hardly finish it.

Just to see more blood and guts described."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible ending","review":"This was a pretty good book for the most part. It's a pretty standard mystery/thriller, but a nice way to while away an afternoon. But the ending completely ruined it for me. It simply made no sense given the way the story plays out just before this ending, which one can only imagine was meant to shock, is revealed. Had the author cared enough to try and explain this seemingly incongruous revelation, I might have liked it better. But perhaps even he couldn't find a way to make it work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roses are r.. Violets are..

She is adept at evaluating the entire spectrum of the San Francisco dining scene, from top restaurants to bargain bites.Her fourth edition book is an excellent SF reference. As a Bay Area resident, I can vouch that her descriptions of the restaurants, markets, and other food shops is on target. There were even a few new finds in the book for me, like the lunch at the SF Art Institute Café.Not only is there nice background and detailed descriptions of SF restaurants, you will learn about food and drink in the area. I found the artisan sake write up informational. I find sections like the seasonal fish and produce charts very helpful.

Stay away from this one!","review":"I bought this a few months ago, and after about three or four shaves it stopped working properly. It yanks on the hairs instead of cutting them, which is very painful! It doesn't pull them all the way out, which is even worse because it means you have to go over and over the same spots if your desperate enough to continue. Sometimes it works okay, but what good is a razor that only works half the time? Others here have noted the short battery life and change in sound when it's losing power. Mine does sound \\"slower\\" when it's yanking the hair, but that doesn't seem to be related to battery charge (e.g. it can start the shave in evil hair-pulling mode, and then straighten up and shave right five minutes in!) Even when not pulling hair, the shave is not close. Definitely find a different razor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"The battery life is the worst of any electric razor I've ever used.

But I have to say that, speaking merely as an average cinemagoer, I liked it a lot. I found the storyline to be good, the acting and direction to be more than adequate, and Chris Robinson's spider monster to be genuinely scary. The film moves along at a good pace, and the climactic final ten minutes - in the cave - are very effective. All in all, a cut above the usual horror 'B' movie output of the period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better \\"Beast\\"","review":"I highly recommend this new release over the previous \\"Killer Creature\\" double feature version.

What a hoaky monster. But it works perfectly with the plot and actors.A gang goes up to the Dakotas for a robbery. The plan is to blow up a mine, then when attention is diverted, steal some gold bricks from the suppository. Only thing is, they plan to escape on skis with only a tourist instructor to guide them.Well everything would have been fine, but the demolition man took a bar girl to the cave with him. She gets attacked and now the monster has singled out the gang to go after.The Beast has long tentacles that he likes to grab people with and then he puts them in webs so he can devour them later. The monster himself is a shaggy looking ghost type man that screams like a chicken with its liver being ripped out.Overall a pretty good flick to make out to on a rainy Saturday afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baaaaaaad","review":"Nasty copy of the original.

You can find better junk at the wal-mart or dollar store and much cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little, too late","review":"While fairly well acted for this type of flick, the pacing is awful for viewers who need regular doses of monster scenes throughout. In this case it's too little monster during the first three quarters and way too much monster at the end. The characters move around from place to placetalking endlessly about their lives while we barely even get a glimpse of the Beast. But during the last ten minutes we witness several attack scenes in a row - which left me wondering why we couldn't get more of these scenes peppered throughout instead of just saved until the end. Cool looking monster, but overall tedious viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"old and out dated","review":"This movie is old,and should be dumped into a bottom of the ocean.its boring,old and is,one of the worst movie I've seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Monster Travels At A Slow Crawl","review":"A gang arrives in a skiing town with a gold-heist plan that involves blowing up a cave to create a diversion and then making their escape on skis with the unwitting aid of a ski instructor. Unfortunately for all concerned, their meddling in the cave unleashes a hair, spider-like monster that follows on their get-away.If your reaction is to say \\"I bet Roger Corman had a hand in this,\\" you'd be correct; he was producer of note. With the single exception of Sheila Carol, who strikes the right notes as an unwilling gang-moll named Gypsy, the cast is notably sub-par. The monster consists of a fright-wig and some spider-ish tentacles, often presented in painfully transparent double-exposure. And let us say nothing of production values at all.HAUNTED CAVE is slow, talky, and utterly uninspired. Even hardcore fans of 1950s \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" monster movies will be hard pressed to find anything in it. Two stars, and that's being generous.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a flick","review":"This film was a real dissapointment for me. I bought it in a dual pack with another low budget horror 60's film and was just left with nothing. I wasn't really sure exactly what kind of movie this was...an independent film made by some students? Is it a crime/thriller film? Is it a horror movie? Horrible acting, pathetic script, uninventive special effects, and a monster that's in the movie for only about 10 minutes.

Would not be the first place to start, but would highly recommend all the Beats original studio albums for anyone looking to get deeper into ska.

Old classic tunes like \\"The Sweetest Taboo\\",\\"Smooth Operator\\"and\\"Stronger Than Pride\\" are all brought to life within this fantastic collection. Sade also shows the tremendous chemistry she shares with her back-up group, and she provides the artists ample time to showcase their talents.

I actually purchased the video around 1993 but having on DVD really enhances the concert. The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound is wonderful to hear and the clarity in the DVD format is amazing. This is a wonderful concert because the song selection spans the depth of Sade's music career with the exception of her new release, \\"Lover's Rock\\". This DVD rivals her \\"Best of\\" CD released several years prior. However, just listening to this DVD performace surpasses the experience of her \\"Best of\\" CD because her band is wonderful. This concert features some wonderful extended versions of \\"Cherish the Day\\" and \\"Smooth Operator\\" as well as great concert versions of her other hit songs.

Ranking and Wakeling were not overly opinionated lads, but they made their points eloquently and with arresting honesty. It is quite often the case, however, that you find yourself singing along to a beautiful harmony, only realizing later on what the lyrics actually say.

Now i'm asian too, and Im saying the truth about this album w/o race favor. I thought after years of making this CD and remaking it over, it was not what it should be...I think its still a good CD and it is just his first CD, but it should of been way better. Still I listen to it in the car sometimes, but not constantly....Still got mad love for Jin, unfortunately hes out of the game....And no, im not saying this just cuz hes asian and I am, im not like that. Im critisizing just as tough as I do with any other race.I'd say buy this album if you want to have a decent album to listen to and you will think its pretty god, but it is'nt up there with tupac, all of G-unit, and Eminem; in my opinion, or whatever you think is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"JIN","review":"Yo Jin album fair do is a typical but good hip hop album with hip hop beats...he got production from so cool producers and glad to say hasnt gone with the favourite THe Neptunes.The Cut wit Kanye i gota love is one of the cuts on the album..u gota hear it...got a CLUB SONg wit Just Blaze and the infamous LEARN CHINESE done bu Wyclef..the tunes are heavy but the main 1s to watch for are the sneaky 1s..Love Story feat some chick called AJA..the cut is brillant..the story telling technique makes u jus wanna sit and think about ur 1st love.. and COLD OUTSIDE wit no otha then LYFE on the hook well LYFE destroys the song and keeps it goin! the album as a whole is good and very them hiphop heads out the it a must.(it is a Ruff ryder after all) and for every1else, if u want some good/different rap where it aint bout hoes money and guns wit some messy beats then this is for u. 8/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"great lyricist wrong record label","review":"Jin the first chinese rapper to hit the game. I think this kid has alot of talent and skills, I knew from the jump that this album was going to be horrible but I bought it anyways to support my fellow asian brother. Ruff ryders is a dead label point blank. I can understanding being a rookie in the game why Jin grabbed the first deal that came his way but come on now dude you need to be foucs no one will see you better then yourself. the production on this album is trash even Kanye's beat sounds like left overs that he never had the chance to finish. Yo Jin if you ever get to read this you need to connect with THE RZA, WU-TANG RECORDS!!...use the asian market, and use rza beats msta killa's last track on his album now that's a beat worth hearing Jin on."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Second Favorite CD","review":"Only one of the three asian rappers( Allen Pineda (Black Eyed Peas) & Foxy Brown (Ill Na Na))i know but, he's the only Chinese one, the 2 others are filipino..., but thats ok.. get to the point. This album has great beats and great lyrics... Jin is one of very little rappers that actually talk about something else other than cars, sex, money, drugz, and murder... this CD would have to be my second favorite CD of all time (my first is Broken Silence, thats where I see the real Foxy Brown shyne, and no one even wrote her stuff in that album so thats even better)becauseI dont know I just liked it alot..... I think this Cd this worth buying...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Be Stopped","review":"Lot of rappers ain't got nothin' on Jin. He is the mic.

We jumped on the chance to book Jin--a rising star in the American music industry where Asians are essentially unrepresented--for the feature of our annual spring conference and Asian Heritage Month. Unfortunately, Jin did NOT show up, NOR did he refund our money. Through months and months of continuing effort, we have attained sparse contact with Jin and his manager Kamel in which they promise the money but have not seen any of the $4000.00 to this day. As students, it will be difficult for us to find the time and money to file a suit, so in protest, please do not support this artist who is unwilling to repay us students."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Guy's weak","review":"THis Debut is wack.

But then again, most cats that's going platinum now can't really mess with him but he's just not selling. i wouldn't say it's cause of him but the production for the most part is weak. the track he has with kanye is hot and styles helped the album but for the most part he has generic beats that don't match his lyrical style. i'm not hatin' on jin and hope for him to be around for years to come with better albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Wait","review":"After being push back for nearly a year, Jin's debut album is finally out. The CD certainly didnt fail any of my expectation. There are club bangers like Club Song and The Come Thru, and there are serious songs such as Love Story and Same Cry. On the song Same Cry, Jin's raps about how chinese struggles to keep up with the rest of the world,\\"Them sneakers on your feet cost $100 a pop, My peoples making 15 cents a day in sweatshops\\"On the song C'mon he rhymes how he battles other MCs\\"I'm still battling but on a different noteNot rappers, but labels, same ocean but a different boatThem CEOs must be sniffin' cokeDon't they know that I'm the dopest product on either coast?\\"Its no question that Jin's rhyming skills is great but I found the beat of songs too repetative. Some of the beats sounds kinda the same, landing this with a four star, but the rhyming skill is definitely 5.All hip hop lovers, chinese or not will like Jin's Style"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHATEVER?

I work at Best Buy, so I saw the CD and said..why not? I went to buy it, and on the way home I was listening to this CD. Instantly I got hooked by it. It's unbelievable how great this CD actually is.The only song that I dislike on this whole CD is the Club Song, and my favorite is probably Love Story.The best thing about this is that the last track where he thanks everyone, I've heard that the track was all freestyle.

The songs describe working-class anger and the frustrations of the common man with a lot more grit than Bruce Springsteen's more romantic BORN TO RUN; this band is more like DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN. Joe Grushecky is also a great chronicler of the struggles of EVERY individual, whether they live in gritty Pittsburgh, PA, upscale Cape Elizabeth, ME, middle-class Bayside, NY, or posh Lake Oswego, OR. Grushecky's opposition to Indonesia's trumped-up drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book's title is misleading","review":"I too thought this book was about Google Adsense and was sorely disappointed when it arrived. And despite its subtitle, \\"The behavioral science of advertising\\", it mostly isn't about that either.The bulk of this book is a primer on basic advertising strategy for a business. And I do mean basic; the book covers topics like the purpose of advertising, and how CPM (cost per mille or thousand) works. The book is set in large type with huge paragraph spaces. It is 202 pages, yet the primary messages could have been communicated in between 50 and 100. The primary benefit I can articulate for the book is that it is a fast read; otherwise, otherwise, I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for Adsense Campaign Techniques","review":"This book is more about the landscape of online marketing and provide very limited Adsense campaign techniques to generate reveune!

It arrived even before the estimated delivery date which was a nice surprise. Set up was a cinch and the table is extremely sturdy and level. It works very well for my sewing needs and is the exact height I needed for comfortable sewing. I remember my parents' and grandparents' card tables from days long gone and this one is much sturdier. There is absolutely no wobbling or movement of any kind while I'm using my sewing machine, which is a necessity for my sewing. I would definitely recommend this table to anyone interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"great card table/grandkids fort","review":"This is a quality product, very well made.

Yet taking it out of the box yielded a poorly constructed product that was received in numerous pieces-especially where the legs were supposed to be attached.

Maybe Target needs to kick it up notch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it","review":"Admittedly this table has a sturdy, good quality top, and as one person stated it's not quite 37\\" but that was ok. Our problem was that the the legs were attached but we found several unused screws in the bottom of the box. When we turned the table over to look more closely there were 4 holes that were never drilled (so no way to put the screws in) and the legs were not completely attached. The other screws in the bottom were meant to go into already drilled holes (also supporting the legs) that were so wallowed out the screws just fell right out.Bottom line - we returned this table - somewhere along the way someone or some machine didn't do their job - and apparently no one checks to be sure it's 100% correct. If you do order, be sure to double check that the legs are attached correctly, that way there won't be any surprises if it all of a sudden falls over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice before you purchase","review":"This is the most disappointed item I ever purchased from Amazon. The first shipment I received was missing 5 screws. My second replacement table was not only missing 5 screws, but also had a dent in one corner (although the package was in perfect condition). The amazon customer service was great, just this particular product they sell is terrible. I don't think I want to buy any Lifetime product in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Folding Table","review":"In my opinion I would not advise to buy this table. The table arrived and most of the screws holding the metal frame to the plastic table top were missing some were loose in the box. I took the few loose screws in the bottom of the box and re-installed them. One of the screws came through the top of the table, I did not know this until I got large scratch on my hand. The remaining screws are loose because they are only secured by the plastic table top and once they come out and re-installed they will not tighten properly.Very poor product in my opinion. Lifetime who's lifetime?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy Table for Inside or Out","review":"This is a very sturdy folding table to use inside or out. It cleans up easily if used outside. My grandsons use it inside the house to put their Lego kits together. I find it has only one disadvantage. It is extremely hard to collapse. One definitely has to have lots of hand strength to get the legs folded up. Otherwise I'm happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice table for the price","review":"This is a good table, better than your average card table. It is sturdy. The table surface is smooth, the edges are smooth. Safe for little heads. And the table surface is easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"The table top is great and the hardware, under the table top, is great. But, it just isn't designed very well. Every screw, connecting the metal hardware to the plastic table top was loose. I tightened every screw, but you can't really tighten it that much because the screws go through the metal and through the thin plastic. So there is nothing for the screws to attach to. I think this is why so many people have complained that the screws were loose or fell out. I know I'll have to periodically tighten the screws on my table.My table arrived on time, but the box was damaged. One corner of my table has a small dent in it and one of the metal hinges was slightly bent. These problems were not big enough for me to bother sending it back. The table top is sturdy and it looks great and I need it for a picnic in a few days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon sure does not pack well nor bill of ladings.","review":"This 37 Inch folding table is great.We bought a few from Amazon and other places at a lower cost basis too.From Amazon they arrived damaged but still usable.

Duffy knew a lot about imaginative literature, and the book is admittedly informative, but then she went and spoiled everything by applying silly Freudian explanations for every poem, play, novel or fairy-tale that she deals with. She saw incest, castration, phallic symbols, and all the rest of it in everything covered. A general collapse in the credibility of Freudianism has left this book sounding like the ravings of a woman with a dirty mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful music listening","review":"I feel this is a very deep, depressing, and bleak Tears for Fears album. It certainly isn't anything that will chear you up if you are depressed. Still the music on the cd is deep and wonderful.

Good work Orzable."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I write songs... for a living.\\" -Roland","review":"It is a good thing Roland decided to compose and play music for a living. Once again he has done it, he has written and released a new album that couldn't be any better. Every song is wonderfully put together and orchestrated, like the smooth melody of \\"Secrets\\" or the rocking sound of \\"Sorry.\\" With little synth. work in the recordings, roland shows more of the mastered sounds of the cool guitar like in \\"Sketches of Pain\\" or \\"Los Reyes Catalicos.\\" Roland has done it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning masterwork gets reissue treatment","review":"This is a superb reissue of Tears For Fears' 1995 masterwork, with the addition of all of the tracks that were issued on CD singles.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This shows us why Roland Orzabal can be anything but boring","review":"The different styles and arrangements of the songs, from the harshest of lights to the most disturbing of darknesses, and the way he plays with his voice...

That's not a bad thing, because the album was well-engineered originally, and sounds just fine in its original master.So, if you already own the original CD, and the CD5's with all these bonus tracks, there's no need to rebuy this CD. If you don't have this title, however, you are missing, IMHO, the best album in the TFF catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words cannot describe","review":"Do not buy this CD. It will irreparably diminish your interest in any other CD you own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passionate and Powerful, Time Flies While Listening","review":"This is quite an incredible release. Roland Orzabal must be very proud of what he's created here. The songwriting is absolutely sublime, his performance is superb to the highest degree. The artwork is also phenomenal, Roland looks very sophisticated, classy, and confident with his Spanish guitar throughout each page of the booklet. While I still enjoy the work he did with Curt Smith in the 80's and 2000's with Everybody Loves a Happy Ending, this is definitely a much more mature version of the band we know and love.

Her voice is unbelievable. \\"Me and My Big Ideas\\" is very heart felt."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dive from a cliff off the heights of Elemental . . .","review":"Coming off the triumph of Elemental, this record is a dissapointment. Orzibol deciding to go for a concept album, (the first for TFF since The Hurting) was a bad move at this point, as he didn't seem to have all the songs together to make it work. A lot of it is just pointless dabbling, or just filler. On the opening track he tries to go progressive but doesn't have the melody to carry it. This CDs best songs, like \`Me And My Big Ideas' (a self-parody by Orzibol on his idea of doing a concept album?) are not as good as the weakest tracks on Elemental (of which there are very few)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone","review":"First let me say that I am a Big TFF fan, however this release has just a couple of good songs (God's Mistake and Me & My Big Ideas) but it is generally just overblown, over bombastic, and just doesn't connect with me.

This soundtrack is primarily comprised of acoustic, borderline alternative songs from would-be popular bands way back when. To compare, if this CD had been released in more recent years, it probably would have included songs from Avril Lavigne, Vanessa Carlton, and possibly Coldplay. All in all the Babysitter's Club Soundtrack deserves four stars, because of the fact that the true identity of the singers of the final track, \\"Girl-Girlfriend\\" is never revealed - not even in the CD book - which dissapoints fans of their vocal sound (the Beu Sisters are a good substitute)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Short","review":"This is a great soundtrack.

I read a few titles...Mr Spock? What kind of garbage is that. I gave it one listen and I was hooked.

I was so angry that additional songs had been added, and I would have to purchase the CD again. But after several emails with Martina's fan club, and her record company I was able to exchange my CD for the new one. (By mailing it in and paying postage.)

She's so warm and loving, and I love that about her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Editorial - All filler, no content.","review":"Editorial writers are critical because they are jealous and have no talent. Often, artists change songs because they don't have the talent to give an acurate, honest interpretation, and use \\"artistic freedom\\" as an excuse for their failings.The same thing was said about the Carpenters, calling them \\"vanilla.\\" In the words of Paul Willams, \\"but what an exquisite flavor vanilla is.\\"Martina McBride has one the best voices of her generation, and doesn't need to hide it behind the usual production tricks and false \\"interpretations.\\" Because she is confident of her musicianship, she sings these Christmas songs the way they were meant to be sung, letting the lyric and melody shine through to honor the holiday.As a composer/arranger/producer, I appreciate her interpretations, as well as the production quality of this album.Thanks Martina."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Martina","review":"I got this in anticipation of taking my parents and sister to her concert when she came to my city.

Christmas is now in Sept., Oct., Nov. and Dec. Martina outdoes herself again! \\"O Holy Night\\" is truly inspirational! God will be proud! \\"Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow\\" - Makes me want it to snow. I live in the northeast and for me, snow is sometimes not very enjoyable. This CD is Unbelievable!

Audio with the kindle is great with a good pair of earphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"I was looking on Amazon for a particular Martina song that she did with Dean Martin, 'Baby Its Cold Outside,' and found it on this album, I was so excited! It Is Awesome! I could not believe the price for the entire album, incredible value. For all Martina fans this is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Normally, Christmas albums are hit and miss with only a few songs on the cd actually worth listening to. This album is NOT like that - EVERY song on Martina's album is well done. To be honest, it seems to me that many artists are \\"in love\\" with their own voice and when they make a Christmas album they twist these songs in an attempt to make them 'their' songs when, in reality, these Christmas songs actually belong to us (in my opinion, anyway). Martina seemed very aware of this and sang these songs without any pretension. My favorite song on this album, if I had to choose, would be Silent Night - the timbre and hush of her voice is awesome.In short, if you buy this album you will not be disappointed! I wasn't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing voice singing the classics we all love!","review":"Martina McBride possesses one of the most incredible voices in music, and on this CD she takes it out for a spin with your favorite holiday classics. I admit, although I'm not a humbug, I'm very picky when it comes to Christmas music. It's easy for a collection to sound cheesy and \\"Vegas-like,\\" but McBride sings with such passion and warmth that this collection immediately put me in the holiday spirit. Particularly well-done songs include \\"Do You Hear What I Hear,\\" \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,\\" and \\"Silent Night.\\" My hands-down favorite has to be \\"O Holy Night\\" as Martina's voice soars to such heights that it will bring tears to your eyes, and the orchestration is beautifully done on this one, and all of the other songs as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a great tranquil Christmas CD, don't look any further...","review":"I was hesitant to buy this CD due to the fact I consider McBride a country artist but after hearing a cut on the radio, I was won over, very quickly. There is no attempt to re-do the songs or to put her own brand on them. Instead they are done in a straight forward manner and with a strong charismatic voice that shows no hint of country leanings. This is indeed a fantastic buy for your Christmas collection. The blend of instruments and vocals is charming."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Christmas CD","review":"I pick up a couple of new CDs of Christmas music every year, and got this last year.

SHE IS AMAZING."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CHRISTMAS MUSIC AVAILABLE!!!","review":"If I could give this CD more than 5 stars I would. For years I've been looking for a CD that would play the best Christmas music in a way that preserves the original beauty of the songs. This CD finally does it. Too often a recording artist will change the melodies, add different rythms, or bend the original songs around his/her own style. In the end the resulting song is ruined by this messing around. Martina McBride simply sings the songs the way they were originally meant to be heard, and she does it with a beautiful style of her own which doesn't infringe on the writers original music. After hearing the CD I bought one for each of my family and friends for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Christmas CD","review":"I could listen to this 100 times every Christmas for the rest of my life (I'm 20 years old)!

I had downloaded \\"What Child is This\\" off of [a file sharing program] last year, and it instantly became my favorite Christmas Song. I had to have more so I ordered the Cd for this Christmas. It is absolutely unbelievable. Martina's voice is beyond description. If you're like me and like your Christmas Classics sung unchanged from their original version, you'll love this Cd. I hate it when artists put their own spin on a classic, be it country, jazz, rock, whatever. She has sung every song just the way it was meant to be - beautifully!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Martina Is Awesome!!","review":"Nothin' can go wrong with Martina McBride...Her Vocals Are Awesome!!

This song alone is worthy of the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpowers the Songs","review":"Martina McBride can be said to have a \\"great\\" voice, but I find her renditions of these Christmas songs to be obnoxious. Why do you need to practically scream the notion of \\"having a merry little Christmas?\\" I know she is trying to show off her voice, but it is a very un-artistic way of treating Christmas songs. There is no hint of true emotion behind any of these songs. Did she actually think about the words she was singing? The answer is - no."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the best!","review":"I first came across this recording about 19 years ago riding in the car with my Parents. To this day I still listen to this Album. Every song is powerful. \\"If I be Lifted\\" is my personnal favorite.

He redefined the term \\"lowest common demoninator\\" and set a new standard for mediocrity. He took the worst aspects of Meat Loaf and 1980s power-balladeers and amplified them into total and utter DRECK. But it doesn't stop there! He desecrated the grave of Otis Redding with his soulless rendition of \\"Dock of the Bay,\\" jettisoning all laws of subtlety and transforming a classic soul tune into mall-ready drivel. I bet Ray Charles had wished that he was deaf as well as blind when he heard Bolty's version of \\"Georgia.\\" This music is offensive to everyone but those with the basest tastes.

And \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\"...oh, now Michael's is DEFINITELY the definitive version. No one else, even Mr. Percy Sledge, could have ever imparted more feeling and respect for such a gorgeous song. Michael Bolton is the greatest singer of love songs to have ever lived.

The best version of \\"When A Man Loves A Woman\\" is still Percy Sledge's. And I never was a fan of \\"Dock Of The Bay,\\" but after hearing Bolton's version of it, the original version by Otis Redding sounds magnificent.I would imagine that some younger fans have listened to Bolton's \\"Georgia On My Mind\\" and have thought that he originated the song, and have never heard the true classics.

However, this version of Klondike is badly focused throughout the entire film. Dialogue is virtually inaudible.

YES - that's the story line of this book and is totally unsuitable for kids or teens. Miss Reiss is mentally unstable and shouldn't be writing books for \\"young adults\\". She should be making baskets and amends for pretending to like children.

After that I found hisother recent films such as Grind etc. He is perfect and has much talent,with his expressions alternately menacing and innocent. He is a good actor in this period. Grind is not a high budget film but has power in it. About two hours of a deeply affecting drama between two brothers on the screen, I was not disappointed at all. Hope this Billy Crudop would be still requested in Hollywood and let see him in the next film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Thick & Bulky.","review":"This will keep you sucked in but it was way to thick and bulky to wear under my dress, I ended up buying another plain strapless Wacoal bra."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product for price","review":"Bought this for under my wedding dress.

This may be the best American movie this year. Don't believe the remainder of the review which makes this sound like another feel good Hollywood type family drama. Basically the story is of siblings who are dysfunctional in their own peculiar (and often very comical) ways. As a result, they are always at odds with one another despite the common bond of the events of their childhoods. The acting is superb and makes an already good script, an excellent movie.

Both Mark Ruffalo and Laura Linney do marvelous jobs in their performances. Mark is great as the troubled brother with no ambition whatsoever while Laura is wonderful as his sister, but trying to be motherly as well. A great story - I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable short film","review":"I saw this last night and think I should review it before I completely forget about it. This film apparently started out as a short film about two people eating lunch in a restaurant and has been expanded into feature length. Fairly interesting characters in search of a plot. If your idea of drama is watching a woman try to convince her brother to go to church then you will probably enjoy this movie, but that's about as dramatic as this movie gets. I got the impression that the writer/director has not lived a particularly interesting life. I do think it is a good thing that boring people have the opportunity to make boring movies; someday soon maybe we will all have a movie out on DVD, and from those millions of efforts perhaps one or two good works of art will emerge.That being said, this film is much much better than Gladiator."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can count me out","review":"Incredible waste of time and talent. Laura Linney and Matthew Broderick were appealing, but other than that this was two hours of my life I'll never get back. The many positive reviews of this movie have me baffled - basically it is a very long, mostly uninteresting examination of a brother-sister relationship. Quite frankly I could have cared less about their relationship toward the end of the movie. For a good relationship drama go with something more like Bridges of Madison County, Hope Floats, or The Mirror Has Two Faces. Steer clear of this one at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The film equivalent of 'Friends'","review":"'You can count on me' is the indie movie 'Friends', where prickly situations about families and relationships waft in a feel-good haze. A case in point is the crucial bout of violence. The films of Shane Meadows usually feature such a scene, which have a tendency to break the fragile nature of the home or society in which it is played out. It's either bleakly final (24:7) or desperately covered up ('A Room For Romeo Brass'). Director Lonergan doesn't quite have the courage of this scene, and neuters it with tears, big smiles and hugs. This is symptomatic of the film as a whole, where even the mumbling are prodigiously articulate. And yet, deep down, the film's circular pattern, where a couple representing Happy Family die in a car, and a couple representing Family That Can't Live Together drive apart, suggests more searching themes. If the excellent Matthew Broderick had been central, you'd have had a more troubling film."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BEST THAT HOLLYWEIRD CAN PRODUCE","review":"This movie is a movie about 30 year olds with a three year old mentality. I take that back. Theyare amoeba, moving about seeking pleasure, food and sex. This they do with all the morality,conscience and scruples of single celled organisms. And it's about as interesting as watchingpond water. Ah, but everyone says it's great. What does that tell you about today's critics andaudience? My only guess why is that their lives are so meaningless that a movie like this salvestheir sense of self (do amoeba have a sense of self?) See you in the pond."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Can Count On Me Not to Recommend This","review":"A disjointed, unhappy, dark tale that moves with jerky indecision, and bizarre background music, to a anti-climax.

My advice: don't worry about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual story, good acting, interesting","review":"The little boy is very good in this movie. I didn't realize it was Rory Culkin. I'm not familiar with Mark Ruffalo but he was great especially in scenes with Culkin. Matthew Broderick was All Too Real as a boss. The characters are all Smart and have opinions, even the child. This is a rare, intelligent movie that explores important subjects. I can't think of a movie to compare it too, so it is unusual."},{"rating":"1","title":"The plot is flat and goes nowhere","review":"I was surprised that so many people rated this movie 5 stars. The story line basically meanders through a short period of time in the lives of a sister and brother... and there seems to be no climax to the plot. It's just flat. It's not that the acting was bad -- I thought the actors were quite convincing in their roles; the story line just seems to go nowhere.I also didn't appreciate how Terry (the brother, played by Mark Ruffalo) used so much foul language around his sister's 8-year-old son Rudy (played by Rory Culkin).I like movies that make you feel good, and this one lacked that trait.

I could have done without watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was pointless","review":"You Can Count On Me...Ostensibly a tale of redemption this movie is basically a waste of theaudience's time. Laura Linney plays a successful single mother whoreceives with great joy the news that her rapscallion of a brother, MarkRuffalo, is returning home for a visit. Laura's character has stayed andprospered relatively well in the town they grew up in and Mark'scharacter seems to have hoboed around and spent more than one night injail. Somehow he connects with her son and apparently has an epiphanyand his character changes.OH THE HORROR! The plot was weak, the dialogue was a joke, thecharacters were poorly drawn to begin with and had no moments of growth.Oh wait, I know I said Mark's character had an epiphany but it made nosense and was never explained. The movie seemed to start in the middleof nowhere and ended with no resolution at all.

I knew the screenplay had won at Sundance, but there was virtually no hype or word-of-mouth. What I saw was an incredibly bland, boring film, a little dollop of sentimentalism that might have cut it on TV but as a film was a huge waste of time. Then the reviews starting rolling in, and I was totally dumbfounded. What movie was everyone watching? Mark Ruffalo does a great job, and Kenneth Lonergan's acting turn was a highlight -- but the screenplay?I should advise heartily against anyone's seeing it, except for the fact that everyone seems to like it.

Second, this dvd recycles many of the moves you see in other FIRM workouts. There are very few new moves and even the supporting cast looks kinda bored. Third, this workout just did not get my heart rate up. I used 5 and 8 lbs weights and still was barely challenged, and believe me, I'm no bodybuilder.

Songs like Think Twice and Two Are Better Than One, show brief flashes of Hope. But that pathetic \\"more than a thousands words\\" song, exemplifies why so many people hate \\"christian rock\\" and Petra in particular. It's the musical equivalent of a honeydew melon.

The best track on the album is 'Think Twice' which comes close to sounding like Nine Inch Nails. The rest of the album contains a tired mix of formulaic Aerosmith styled rockers with what have to be most soulless ballads ever put to tape in Christian music.Petra have always chosen to take a 'vehicular' approach to its music - ie the music is no more than a 'vehicle' for communicating its message.

There are a couple of songs on any album that don't do anything for me, but that's true with any album/artist.This album is loaded with melodious and pleasing hard-rock songs, a continuation of Petra's long-standing tradition of musical excellence and on-message lyrics.

The problem is that the cutting end is very aggressive and as soon as it cuts through the far side of the work piece with the pilot tip, the drill bit tends to break through the material and grab it - spinning it rapidly. I am not exactly a novice with using a drill press.

But...what a waste of two hours. Kim Basinger is terribly miscast as the lead character, a woman dealing with painful memories of the loss of her father and with a mother who seems to be going mad. Basinger delivers all her lines as if she's reading a bedtime story to someone she's trying not to rouse, very breathy and whispery, and her emotional responses seem to run the gamut from A to B. She's surrounded by a capable supporting cast, but it's not enough to save the movie from her dreadful performance.At least, there's comedic value in her cheap-home-perm 1980's hairdo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I'm ready","review":"Its fun, funny, and actually informative.

The goodie openings are smaller than I expected. I've found the Eukanuba Healthy Extra treats for puppies are a perfect fit. You can fit one in each opening for a challenge, or fit two in each opening so a little sticks out on each end.

I would suggest using mainly hard treats in the end, as this reduces wear on them when your pup bites down, as supposed to soft treats which will allow them to flex and eventually break off!This is easy to clean - I stole another reviewer's suggestion and used a popsicle stick - and being rubber doesn't make a lot of noise when it hits the hardwood floors (which is why we stopped buying antlers!)Overall, this is a great and cost-effective to keep those little chewers busy for a while, and it doubles as a great fetch toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kong Dog Bone-LARGE","review":"My chocolate lab loves this!

Instead, this book teaches children that they don't have to share, but just offer another one to their friend so they each have one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hide this one from my toddler","review":"I understand that we don't always share everything, but in this book even a thing that can be easily shared like raisins is not really shared (the child mysteriously produces another box of raisins). I also hate the way that every page begins \\"MY ___! YOU CAN'T USE IT!\\" because now my 2-year-old walks around using this language about all his belongings, which he never used to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT sharing, more like \\"Alternatives to Sharing\\"","review":"This book is crap! I bought this for my toddler and wish I hadn't. My daughter already shares very well and I wanted to reinforce the behavior so I bought this book. Instead, this book doesn't teach how to share but teaches alternatives to actually sharing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Sharing Here","review":"I agree with another reviewer. Every problem proposes an alternative solution that does not involve sharing at all. Although those are some techniques that I'm sure we will use sometimes, I don't want to convey that these solutions are equivalent to sharing. I do like the other books in this series, but this particular one got put away permanently!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little strange concept","review":"Is this sharing in the 2000s? I found this whole book very peculiar. No, I'm not sharing my stuff with you - but I can try to give you something else instead. I can understand that's how it works sometimes -- but it is it really sharing. Very strange book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sharing book with very little sharing involved","review":"We have been given a lot of the Karen Katz books for my almost-two-year-old daughter. I'm not a huge fan of any of them, but my daughter likes the bright illustrations and the flaps so we keep them around. But this one is the worst. Nearly every \\"sharing\\" dilemma is resolved by something other than actual sharing. You can't play with my doll, I'll let you play with a different doll; I won't share my raisins, but I'll give you your own box; etc. It really doesn't teach kids to actually share AT ALL. Very disappointing and headed to the Goodwill box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than Brilliant","review":"It says on the container for this video that it was brilliantly filmed by Bertrand Tavernier. My own view is that there must have been a lighting technician strike. Far from being brilliant the film I saw was dim to the point of obscurity. Many scenes might have been on the radio. This is not good cinema.One wants to see something discernible on the screen. Neither is there anything original about the story except for the eastern European setting.Yes there was a campaign in the Balkans in World War I. Yes French poilus fought there.Yes the Allies won the war. Yes there was an occupation after the war. And yes war brutalizes those who are in it. Kipling wrote a poem about the thin red line of heroes whose successful use of violence is prized in war and deplored in peace. This film doesn't tell us anything new about that. I don't think it could have been new to the French either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best!","review":"Sandi Patty has a voice that is truly magnificent!This C.D. is simply the BEST Christmas c.d.

I didn't know Sandi Patty at the time, but liked the selection of songs, so I bought it. It quickly became a favorite -- my children grew up with this music. When cassettes gave way to CDs, I bought the CD. Now I have it downloaded on my iPod. After almost 30 years, I still am brought to tears when I hear Sandi Patty sing O Holy Night. I have shared this with many friends, my entire family, two husbands, and four children. This is a classic by one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard. Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent collection of songs and no issues with my order","review":"I had no issues getting this CD for a gift for the holidays.It came to me in the exact amount of time that I was quoted when I placed my order. I am very pleased with this transaction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"The best. This and Sand's first Christmas album--The Gift Goes On--are two of the greatest Christmas albums of all time. As there are many Sandi Christmas compilations now on the market, I suggest either this or Gift. Yuletide Joy and Voice of Christmas are fine compared to other artists but not compared to her previous recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read it at least 10 times already.","review":"I really enjoy this book.

Thank you Cachao for sharing your special gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible good","review":"Cachao was an icon in the latin world of music. Especially in de Cuban Latin-Jazz scene. He will always be my favorite artist and musician. Great man, his music full of latin-power called descarga de Cachao. His music were all good arranged and the musicians with whom he worked with are \\"TOP-MUSICIANS\\". I will never forget him."},{"rating":"2","title":"The older stuff does it","review":"This marks the last of the Drivin' n' Cryin' \\"old sound\\" that managed to peek out a few times in Mystery Road. When it's rocking, it's a bit more raw. When it's country, it's a bit more authentic.This is a terrific Southern rock album, and it's easily D'n'C''s second best record. After this, their sound branched out into more commercial areas. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but the real sound stopped after this record. I still love all their records, but they never recovered the energy and sweetness of their first two records.So you must get Scarred but Smarter and Whisper Tames the Lion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's definitely Babylon","review":"When I first heard this cd, it reminded me a lot of the scenes on the show, especially the Babylon scenes.

Swiss made movement, the sapphire crystal on both sides and roman numerals are all good. My only complaint is that it is too big and shiny for my taste. I would have given it 5 stars if it was half as thick and had quarter of an inch smaller diameter and did not shine like a bling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"I love this workout--it's so much fun. I love how the instructors switch back and forth, as though they are trying to out do one another. The switching of instructors and props keeps the workout exciting and fast pace! For a workout that is only about 30 mintues long, it is intense and thorough. I also own Pilates with props volume 2. Both are excellent workouts and among my favorites. They follow similar routines, but the exercises do vary a bit (enough for me to enjoy owning both), with vol. 1 being a little easier. Excellent buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read - worth picking up","review":"I definitely enjoyed reading this book and am keeping an eye out for the Corwin's next book. If you're looking for a light, fun read check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"C.R. Corwin Enters the Pantheon of Great Mystery Novelists","review":"\\"Morgue Mama\\" is riveting stuff. Corwin writes remarkable yet believable dialogue, breathes life into her fully developed characters, breezily weaves in alluring plot twists and sets her tale in a descriptive heartland. Her prose clicks right along at just the right pace. I'm a lover of mystery novels, and, based on what I've read so far, I'd rank Corwin right up there with Robert B Parker, Ross Macdonald, Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett. I recommend this wonderful novel to anyone who enjoys literature, regardless of whether they're mystery lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the average Backpacker wanting to pack lighter.","review":"This is not a useful book for the eastern Backpacker, who has been carrying 55-60 lb. on the AT and wants to reduce his pack to a 20-25 lb. pack load, without going to the poor house in the process. The book lacks personality and feelings about why we backpack.This is a highly analytical book on the technical aspects of Lightweight Backpacking in the west. Be less clinical and enjoy the experience a little more.This book is for those who mainly buy at the high end and at a few select sources. It is also assumes that most backpackers live or pack near or west of the continental divide. It does not mention our many fine supply houses in the east, nor the different environments we encounter in the east."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, the 1st reviewer works for Ryan Jordan","review":"Andy Skurka's doesn't mention he worked for Mr. Jordan at Backpacking Light Magazine. While he may indeed have a high regard for Mr. Jordan, I believe Mr. Skurka's former business relationship with Mr. Jordan should disqualify him from commenting on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor product","review":"it has a heavy chain, a hook that cannot hook securely, and sharp edge that connect the watch and the chain can hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"just superb","review":"Minister Caesar is my all time favorite anointed singer, minister, prophetess and woman of God.

It is an interesting read, but can easily be dissected and torn apart by any scientist.Also the only reason this book has a high rating is because creationist publishers and such have people go on here and rate the books high. You don't have to believe me, but it's not surprising when you think about it considering that it would be impossible to track. These guys know what they are doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"You must be kidding","review":"I cannot believe that anyone with more than a third grade education thinks the earth is 6,000 years old. If the creationists want people to stop laughing at them, perhaps they should learn some basic science."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book","review":"I bought this book for mt 981/2 year old cousin.

Made her day, Thanks for the book. You made someone very happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh man...","review":"Typically, not all the time, a live album has badly recorded or the album just doesn't do it for me. This album though is Sick! (no pun intended) Every song has a great sound to it and the band is top notch aggression when they play these songs.Pretty much the set list is any song a SOIA fan would want to hear. From the intense \\"Built to Last\\" to fan favorite \\"Step Down\\", don't expect to be dissapointed, not one point during this album does it start to get boring. At one point before they play \\"Rat Pack\\" they ask if anyone wants to sing the song, and someone actually comes up and doesn't mess up! Their voice was raspy but at least they got the whole song. Singer Lou Koller joked that the guy singing ruined the whole joke. I'm guessing they were gonna have someone sing \\"Rat Pack\\" and totally mess it up, and have that recording on the album.So yeah if you want a intense live album of a very awesome band, check this out.If your'e into hardcore or punk, you'll love this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick of throat cancer, anyone?","review":"I guess if you're a pimply-faced dweeb who likes having some moron sound like he's had his larynx removed, then this would be for you.

At least you can understand what he says.:^D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't what was advertised","review":"I ordered this watch because it was shown that it was a \\"NEW\\" watch. It wasn't. It was obviously a very used watch with an original Valjoux 7750 movement in it which is a 17 jewel and not a newer 25 jewel version. The rotor was not the decorated one but a plain one. The case and dial are the same and this is a gorgeous watch but you could tell the bracelet had been sized and the identifying marks on the back of the watch had been very wore off. I was disappointed it wasn't new. I will still be in search of a new one since this model is no longer in production. It took about a month to receive a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"sketchy","review":"I paid $500 for this watch and the bezel broke within 6 months. it feels pretty cheap although the movement looks cool through the back.

Delta has many great products in its stable, but this is not one of them. First off, the machine is way too light. a router/shaper (...) should be heavy in order to reduce vibration. Secondly, the top is cast aluminum. Good Lord, and with those horrible grooves.

What a great opportunity for children to learn how music can help tell a story. It is very straight forward in that regard. Plus, my 2-and-a half year old was mesmerized! My only complaint, and it is minor, is that the first few minutes are a little slow as they introduce all the instruments that will be heard. Other than that, the whole family loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elmo's Musical Adventures","review":"My nephew Quinn loves Sesame Street.

It's very educational and entertaining. How many kids' dvd's can you say that about?To any and all Muppet fans of all ages, this is a instant classic. I loved it just as much as my 2 yr. old son did. He loves every single bit of the video, and I have no qualms about him watching it.Two year olds don't know what popguns are. This is all just in good fun.It's a great dvd for any young child's collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful way to introduce toddlers to the orchestra","review":"I was very pleasantly surprised by this DVD. I had read the reviews on Amazon.com and was concerned about the review claiming that one of the characters was holding a pop gun. (I didn't see it anywhere in the movie.) As it turns out, my four-year old and my 18-month old sat through the entire DVD and enjoyed it immensely. It's a wonderful way to introduce your children to the orchestra and the sounds of several orchestra instruments."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent multimedia DVD","review":"Great fun for toddlers, older kids and adults! Even though I find Baby Bear 10 times more annoying than Elmo, I can sit through this one as much as my toddler wants. It's also an excellent showcase of DVD technology with the interactive games and other special features on this disc. One minor issue I have with it though is the menu that requires two selections to get anywhere. (Almost as annoying as an \\"Are you Sure?\\" dialog box)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for K-1st grade","review":"As an elementary school teacher, I'm always on the lookout for great instructional videos for the younger grades (K-1st grade). This one fits the bill perfectly. The humor really appeals to 6-7 year-olds, and the action is not too intense. I especially like how this video deals with the duck's run-in with the wolf. Makes me laugh every time. One word of caution, though: this video is a bit less than 45 minutes. More like 40 even. Be prepared for a wrap-up lesson after viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!","review":"My family throughly enjoyed this over the weekend.

He loves them!!!! Unike the Peter and the Wolf movie. I would not recommend this at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"complete disappointment","review":"This disk is a lot of sesame street characters and very little music and very little of the original story.

There's a weird section with a bunch of poems written by baby and the last chapter tells you how to get salvation through jesus christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just the basics","review":"I was a little disappointed with the book. It has all the basics, but nothing unusual or innovative. (I also bought \\"Themed Baby Showers\\", and found it more interesting and helpful. It was only $8.00, had some simple illustrations.) The Ultimate Baby Shower Guide had no illustrations, other than photos of the author's friends' children. It does contain scriptures, which were a nice touch, but I was disappointed the book wasn't more creative.

Now I can remember hearing this when it first came out the joy of hearing these four men playing together again. Now I love Dave and his music but this group will always have a special place in my heart. The cd opens with St Louis Blues which would open a lot of their shows nice way to get things started. Three To Get Ready follows which Paul shows his humor wi of Auld Lang Syne quote. Next is Eugene's beautiful African Times Suite throughout this record you can hear the joy these men have at playing together again. A wonderful album by one of the greatest jazz groups. Of course Take Five is another one that cooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Vine got screwed ROYALLY!","review":"These guys should be headlining stadiums now!!! I'm listening to it now.

I have no idea what happened to them, but this record still sounds great to put on in the summertime.Listen to the audio sample of Mountainside. If it doesn't rock you, then you won't like the album.

The duck is not her pet. The fairies sent it to her and it bothers her all the time.They need to make Darcy and Stormy dolls, too! I would buy them! I would buy Tokyo Mew Mew dolls, too! Even if it was Mew Mew Power instead! (They ruined their names in that show.)I would definitley recommend any of the Winx Club toys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful sequel","review":"I thought this sequel to Dark Fall was even more fun than the first game. This is a point-and-click slide-show type haunted lighthouse adventure game. Again, there are no characters other than occasional voices. Also again, it doesn't have any whiz-bang graphics, but the illustrations are effective, the atmosphere is moody, and the puzzles are complex and interesting. I really enjoyed this one because of some unexpected, clever turns in the story. The only complaint I have is that the game just ends abruptly. Even more highly recommended than the first game. (If you can get the Pins & Needles edition that contains both Dark Fall and Lights Out it's well worth it.) After you play this one, play The Lost Crown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Genre Disappointment","review":"This is a game which cannot make up it's mind (I know that people created it) as to what it wants to be. Is it going,as advertised,to be a creepy adventure story? Is it going to be a scary whodunit? Is it going to be a horror filled thrill ride? No,No,& No. It is a boring, plodding sci-fi wannabe,detective story maybe,brain-teaser oughta-be, ripoff! Not creepy,graphically ridiculous (there are more scenes and interesting content in a Mighty Mouse cartoon) with a plot so loose that it needsKaopectate.

I should had taken more time to actually compare the song tracks in detail and I would had noticed this version had songs titled \\"Commercial\\".

My interest was the title song Blue Flame which was evidently the opening theme song with an announcer talking over most of the song. Would not buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best CDs You Have Never Heard","review":"I bought this CD on a whim during a weekend trip to Pittsburgh, not having heard any of Brad Yoder's music prior to my purchase. I was not sure what to expect, but what I got was a great CD. Brad's voice and guitar work make for some wonderful listening and he has surrounded himself on this CD with some excellent musicians playing tasteful arrangements. However, the power of Brad's music lies in the lyrics. This is especially true on songs like \\"Land of the Free\\" or \\"James Bond.\\" My personal favorites are \\"Used\\" and \\"What You Don't Know\\" (\\"you might know Jack, but you don't know me...\\"). Fans of John Mayer and Jack Johnson will enjoy Brad's knack for lyrical hooks--and, as a bonus, they will hear someone with a rare talent for combining humor, irony, and \\"real life stuff\\" with some great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sandy Patti Xmas","review":"I've always loved this recording.

I must say that I expected more after reading the reviews. It was not scary, just unnecessarily gory. The only character that was at all likable was Solly the golden retriever. I just didn't like this book very much. For having a lot of action, it came off as a story being told, with cliche wording and odd phrases that just seemed childish, not edgy e.g. \\"trying to turn Solly into coleslaw.\\" Most of the people were wooden and the plot was more ridiculous than anything else, with a lack of motivation/explanation behind it. All in all, this was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I read the reviews for this book and even selected it for my first book club meeting. It was very disappointing. The characters were all equally developed, there was none that stood out to which I could identify and often the descriptions were just plain boring. Characters seemed stereotypical and the pages describing them were often only two pages before they were killed. It got to the point where I just skipped ahead because what is the point of reading a cliche description of a stereotyped character, that you don't develop any feelings for, only to have them leave the plot two pages later. Technically, I thought the reading level was very low- tenth grade. The alternate reality was mildly interesting, but nothing particularly clever or page-turning. I'm sorry to say that I disliked the book enough to spend the time reviewing it so that others might not waste their time if they are looking for something with any depth at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great repast!","review":"When a book begins \\"He was still alive and fully aware when she began to skin him\\" one knows one is in for a ride! In Phantom Feast, Diana Barron takes us for a terrific ride which only gets better. She deals with a circus wagon, odd circus characters and even portrays bikers as some of the good guys. In other words, this is not a typical cast of characters. The plot is excellent, and the story gets more and more exciting, right to the end. And it is an end worthy of my favorite horror writer, Richard Laymon.I recommend this novel as a unique, and delightful feast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out! It slips into your dreams.....","review":"Sometimes we make mistakes in life and we make it a point not to repeat them. My mistake was reading this book in bed just before I put out the lights. I won't do that again with Phantom Feast or any other book this great author writes. I felt empathy for the main character. I felt her fear and I felt the fear of the town. When a character tries to get away from horror only to find herself in a worse horror, I have to keep reading. When the one villain of the story is so vividly described, I realize I can't put the book down. Keep it going Diana Barron. Go ahead. Keep me up at night.

They all match the ones on the show perfect, except Stella's which I've never seen her wear and I have seen up to season 3! Another downer is that it doesn't come with anything for Layla to wear. My friend bought these of ebay and thought Stella's outfit was Layla's because Stella's is different, but then I told her and she was dissapointed coz she didn't want to keep Layla in her winx outfit all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but confusing to the beginner","review":"I haven't been playing guitar for very long (only 2 years) but in that space of time, my love and admiration for the Pumpkins has grown to often monstrous proportions. When I first bought this book, I was excited. I was excited because I was going to be able to play all of these great songs that I've admired for a long time. But when I looked at the complexity of the sheet music, I was overwhelmed. In short, there is ALOT of confusing things in the book. I'm pretty good at reading sheet music (e.g. timing, coda, crescendo, etc..) but I often got lost. If you're not too good at reading music, you might get more confused. But, if you're willing to put in the time, or if you've been playing guitar and reading music for a while, this book is pretty good. The Smashing Pumpkins are one of the best bands around. Buy their cds. They rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar Tab Book","review":"This book is dead on and a must for every Pumpkin/Guitar head!

There is so much to learn and love about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful, Sometimes","review":"Tab books have their place. Unfortunately, much of the time they are either flat-out wrong or the tabs themselves, while correct-sounding, are impossible or near-impossible to play.What would be nice is if, instead of a ridiculous attempt to tab the songs \\"exactly how the album sounds,\\" which is pointless because you lose that little pipe dream early on by the simple necessity of having to downsize multiple layers of guitar tracks into 2-4, the tab book writers instead presented tab books that were the best way to play the songs live.Aaron Stang does not do this, and as a result the Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness tab book is only marginally helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an average book with come cheesy lines","review":"The book was fairly good in tabbing out the music. I thought that some of the lines could have been omitted, though, such as: Tons-o-fuzz in Bullet With Butterfly Wings (which is actually a Fender Blender fuzz effect). If you want to learn to play these songs, just listen to the album and do not waste your time on buying the book. All of the songs are easy to play. Just tune down a half step for most of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - Well Written - Real Life - Inspirational","review":"A book that is easy to read and understand.

When, however, he wants to demonstrate how learned he is, his writing is insufferable. This novel falls into the latter category. It is ostentatiously erudite and belches Fuentes' obsessions with highly esoteric questions. It is a cold, inhuman novel, devoid of warmth, fascinated by the process of narration itself and ultimately overly intellectual.

I enjoyed the first movie better than I thought I would, and was excited when I heard they were making another. This movie is sillier than the first, and the script appears to have been written in about 6 hours. It's basically a fantasy movie that has almost no sense to it.

It features the bradys living in the 90's, but stuck in the 70's. Such as when a soliciter calls up offering the family cable service, Mr. Brady says: \\"So, you're saying I can connect a wire to my TV and in will come 50 channels? I don't think so, good bye.\\" The main event of the movie is when Mrs. Brady's old husband comes back. Really, he is an imposter but the bradys do not notice. When he whisks Mrs. Brady off to Hawaii, Mr. Brady decides to teach him a lesson on kindness. This is a funny movie and good entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior sequel- still hilarious","review":"From the amazing success of it's predecessor, it wasn't long before a sequel emerged. A VERY BRADY SEQUEL still proves to be hilarious if not better than the original. The sequel delves deeper into the Brady theme. Sexual tabboes are explored such as the idea that went through all our heads at one stage- is it possible for Greg and Marcia to have a relationship. The sexual tension between the two is hilarious and leaves us with a will they won't they idea which of course keeps the movie interesting. Unlike the first, the sequel introduces corny 70's expressions such as 'outta sight...neato..' which sound incredibly stupid yet funny at the same time.Again,the plot proves to be fairly mundane yet it doesn't seem to matter. Carol's supposed ex husband returns to be re-united with her and her childred. However, what this conman really wants is a priceless horse sculpture worth a lot of money.

I did test other scenarios to ensure this was the only component that didn't work. I guess my next step is to try a DVI (M) to VGA (F) adapter and use a VGA cable.

I would recommend this video, and as a matter of fact I have bought a copy for my friend and her son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"This DVD is very helpful to me as I learn more about my son's sensory/regulatory issues. I've purchased and learned from many books on this subject, and many contain great information, but reading about a physical activity like OT is not the best way to understand it. Having an experienced OT demonstrate (and explain) various activities has been incredibly useful.Initially, the DVD helped me understand my son's experience better and try a few things while I waited for a slot in an OT clinic. Now that we are working with an OT, I still refer to the DVD. Our OT spends most of her time working with my son, rather than educating me...being able to refer to this DVD has been enormously helpful. I'm really excited about any tool that can help me support my son's growth...and this DVD does just that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for busy families!","review":"I found this to be a great addition to my OT lending library. Since the video is divided into segments (one for each sensory system addressed), it makes it easy for busy parents to watch (and process/absorb) in small increments. Britt Collins speaks clearly, slowly, and in terms that can be grasped by parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU","review":"This is the first DVD I have ever seen that I wrote to the people to tell them YOU MADE ME CRY. WHAT A help this DVD was and IS. I put it in quite a bit.. To help our Occupation Thearpy in our HOME time. My son is in major need of his ot time every day! and this DVD made me so happy to know I AM NOT ALONE! I have somebody that understands me! they made this FOR ME! I now they did not but I feel they did. WHAT amazing help it has been. I love all the DVD's and I HOPE they make more! I will be first in line! And I will bring about 5 friends!

THIS is the first step!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for the reflection!","review":"With the day-to-day lifestyle transitions, it is refreshing to enjoy a book that applies today's life experiences to lifestyle situations in the retrospect----what a clever idea! Caren Adams' Life 101 has exposed her life's misfortunes, near misses, failures, successes, triumphs and accolades, while outlining ways in which her readers can apply the same attributes towards their own personal growth and prosperity. Though there were some editing faux pas, they were immediately transcended by enlightening lessons, funny and spiritual nostalgia, some \\"you should and should not,\\" \\"hated it then...but,love it now,\\" and \\"bless it, instead of mess it.\\" Thanks, Caren, for your insight and allowing me to \\"smell the roses,\\" which are usually an oversight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life 101 For the Young and Young at Heart!","review":"Life 101 is conversational in its writing style provoking me to think more deeply about my own life, with lessons from someone else's perspective. I am pleased when I actually learn something from a book that I can immediately use, especially, about how others are managing their money and their sacrifices but not leaving me feeling as if I have to be perfect. I enjoyed how practical and simple the lessons were, just the right amount of information on such subjects as organization, relationships, goal setting, and money, to name a few. I would recommend the book to anyone wanting to improve their life. It is an excellent self-growth book, and most anyone would enjoy reading the book but for me, it was the perfect little book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I've had this unit for 4 months and just tossed it in the trash.

Stephanie Griest's Around the Bloc is an exception. Reminiscent of my favorite, Bill Bryson, she has an amazing combination of detail, brilliant humor, and historical research that both teaches and entertains. This is a book that can profoundly change the way young people look at foreign travel or foreign study. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to study abroad as a guidebook for how to truly capture the essense of cultural immersion. Griest's re-discovery of her own culture through learning about others is an inspiring gem of a lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travel by book","review":"As someone who has always planned/thought/meant to travel and have lots of adventures of my own (but never actually had the means or time to travel), I can really appreciate all the detail and descriptions in Ms. Griest's Around the Bloc. I may not always agree with her conclusions, but I actually am grateful for them. I would so much rather hear opinions that cause me to think than feel affirmed or bored. It is almost as if she is an incredible, funny, and lively travel companion throughout this journey around the \\"Communist Bloc\\" and I get to hear her end-of-the-day assessment of her adventures and then begin to form my own. Her openness throughout the book about her experiences and mistakes help to endear and make her experiences much more \\"real\\" than a flat newspaper-style book. I have learned SO MUCH from this book about places that I will likely never visit and very much enjoyed having my eyes open to new perspectives on some very old issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"everything I have been wanting to say","review":"I lived in Asia (China, Taiwan, Japan, and Korea) for the past 8 years as an American Elementary School Teacher. Around the Bloc is the most accurate attempt at explaining the emotion, trails, adventures, and growth that expats go through living overseas I have yet to find. I would highly recommend this book as \\"a coming of age book\\" along with those of Tania Aebi's and Jamie Zeppa. I didn't always agree with Stephanie Elizondo Griest's polictics or the conclusions that she came through, however I admire her for asking the questions and digging through the difficult that most expats ignore. It is a lot easier to travel and only see the glossy, simple face that these countries provide. It takes a lot of guts to really want to know the truth. This book is about the truth of China, Russia and Cuba. In addition, most travelogs are not very well written, this is a fine exception to that rule."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Be Beaten :-)","review":"A great drum pad at a great price.

This was back when they started showing ova's on cinimax late nights. It wasn't my first exposher to anime by any means, but it was the first anime that had seen that I would call horror. I wouldn't call it scary, but it has very dark and dramatic feel, with great synth music. I don't think this could have made any better with the what they had to work with considering this anime is over 20 years old. The animation is hand drawn not computer generated, so some people would probably call it dated, but I actually prefer the old drawing style's. If you like 80's horror movies, or really action packed animes, you would most likely enjoy blood reign. It's a true old school gem that should not be over looked."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Diffrent Ninja Anime","review":"Not perfect but, great mystery surounds the whole movie because the Yoma are never fully explained. There could have been more conflict and fighting. The artwork is beautiful and the Yoma themselves are interesting, taking the forms of regular animals on earth and still containing their supernatural abilities.It is also very sad in away that how friends can become mortal enemys and how almost everything comes full circle.This is a Ninja Anime of the late 80's era of anime it is also a type of Horor Anime. The animation even to todays standards is done well IMO and the voice acting adds abit more darkness to it.This is a Movie in two 40-45 min parts.This dose earn it's TV MA Rating it is Violent, it is gory, it dose have some brief nudity and it can be very scary to children so avoid alowing them to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring movie, medicore animation","review":"This movie was the first one to teach me that once a film is transfered to the DVD format, it's picture quality does'nt necessarily have to be remastered to cause a more enjoyable viewing. Thus, it seems that it has the same picture quallity as the VHS version. Now, as for the plot, it is just as simple as boring, the main character goes on a stupid quest to search and destroy his former youth comrade who has turned evil, but no one bothers to tell us when or why' for the story begins from the middle of something. The hero's quest itself is boring and slow, and at most of it's parts not understandable. Last, the monsters in the movie are pretty stupid (flesh eating horse?!) and the fact that the entire movie consist of two seperate episodes makes this film to look as unworthy and a waste of money. I baught the movie in France and was fooled by the plot summary on it's back to think that it's a good adventure anime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nubidu's Anime review","review":"This movie blows. 2 episodes only - which will leave you uncertain about where this is going and where it all began."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tool","review":"This saw has all the power I could ever need and since I am left handed I love that the sawdust port is on the opposite side of most circular saws.

This particular one, is their 1986 original Solar release, whic does not contain the extra tracks, just as I like. The title Album track, headlines, also has a bonus instrumental version. This is by far my favourite album by Midnight Star, and the only one that contains the versions of 'Midas touch' and 'Engine No.9' that I love; not too long & not too short; just right. It also includes the ballad 'Searching for Love', with amazing vocals by Belinda and Bo. This kind of music, which in my opinion, is the best there'll ever be, is hard to come by. If you can get yourself a copy, go ahead and enjoy. As the SOS Band says, the World has music for those who listen. Long live the 80's. I love My Oldschool Music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"That Zoot!","review":"Another solid album from one of the most underrated tenor sax men of all time.

You just simply have to admire the ambition to tell us such a complete story. In this ambition he takes on the herritage of older storytelling (and also educating) authors. The plot is simple; we follow the nobelwinners of one year from the time they are chosen too the time they leave Stockholm with their checks. In the time inbetwen we get an indepth analysis of the minds and psychological functions of people who are alcoholics, suffer from low self esteem and so om. Also in his pick of personalities IW demonstrates that the goal is to educate the readers, this time moraly. the book is well woth reading both for its facts on the nobel prize, the gossip around the nobel prize and its analysis of different aspects of the meaning of life and how to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I should have read the appendix to \\"Writing One Novel\\"; what a waste of time.

If you love music which is truly timeless, you should own this CD. This artist has stayed true to his roots and not sold out for commercial success, which is a good thing for the true music lover. Time To Go blends tight guitar playing with wonderful story telling to create a gem worthy of listening to over and over. Russell envokes emotion from his guitar, and you will feel every note. Edgy at times (Been So Good to Me.com), soul searching at others (Gone), but always passionate. My favorite song is the one I'm listening to at the time. Hopefully, we will not have to wait 3 more years before being blessed with another album from Woody Russell."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Leisure Read","review":"Jan Morris captures the history of Oxford with many delightful stories and quotes. The book is great because it takes you on a journey of Oxford through the ages. The dons, the students, formal hall, college rowing are all familiar to someone who have studied at Oxford. There are also things that current students may not be as familiar with such as the history of women in Oxford.

I had just come out of a three year relationship when a friend of mine recommended I read the book.I was shocked at first, but now I'm really glad that I read it. It opened my eyes to the realistic truth behind romantic love and showed me how and why oftentimes relationships just don't work over the long haul. I don't intend to go and have an affair in the future,but hey, if I ever did (or my partner did) now I would understand how and how not to handle it.Ms. Brandt's witty and clever writing style made it difficult to put the book down.

I'm sure lots of people will read this book to help them cheat without getting caught, (she makes it clear why some people will always stray, so don't make it worse by having your spouse and friends find out about it) but I'd also recommend this to anyone whose lover has been unfaithful, especially if you want to try to repair the relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"** DONT DO IT **","review":"Im breaking a rule of my own here, reviewing an article which I have never read but as someone who has had an affair and is suffering the consequences of it(depression and anxiety) I just have to disagree with it in principle.

The person I had an affair with spent months trying to persuade me that it would be okay and their would be no consequences, despite my statement that \\"too many people will get hurt\\". Eventually, during a difficult time in my marriage I gave in but eventually I was proved to be right. Everybody involved has been hurt sooo much, particularly myself and Im now battling depression and anxiety whilst trying to hold onto everything I treasure most, my wife and family.

Sure, until your spouse finds out, and they eventually find out. How will things look to a judge then? Oh right, just don't get caught and it's ok. Because we all know the bad part is getting caught, not the actual deed.I am sure the bosses at Enron and other companies we see in the papers thought the same way about stealing millions of dollars.

I learned so much about the nature of romantic love, why it wanes, and why we are all tempted at times to pursue affairs. At least now I know the 'right' way to do it, if I ever choose to and I hope I don't, but at least I have the tools now.

My husband and I purchased this book with hope that it might guide us through how to overcome the post infidelity after math. We thought that the title \\"The 50 Mile-Rule\\" referred to the distance that you need to keep from your former affair partner for safety.Instead the book is a tactical approach to having affairs so that in the event you get caught the damage will be minimal. Although the book didn't give any aid on how to heal it did help us understand the logistics of the impact of the fall out based on how closely your social, religious, or geographical community is to the affair partner.Although the contents weren't what I hoped; in terms of writing style and organization the book is well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fabulous book","review":"Our dirty little secret is out once again.

The story seemed to be earlier, but the 2040 date is clearly later. The truth is that they are separate. This is a new interpretation of the basic premise. Lina and Nene are much better developed and more interesting characters. Priss is Priss, but Sylia has turned psycho on us. I am not happy with this new boomer hating Sylia Stingray. The animation is good and fluid, actually better than the original which was sort of awkward. I have viewed both the subbed and dubbed tapes. In this case, I preferred the dubbed ones. The dubbing is well done and I get more out of it then when I'm trying to read and watch at the same time. A good inheritor of the Bubblegum Crisis standard, but don't expect it to be quite the same.

The opinion I have about this movie may have something to do with the fact that I do not like CG's \\"glossy\\" enhancements that has become the norm in modern anime.

The packaging and the reissue itself by Arbiter records is without fault.

The last two episodes are litterally an insult to the viewer, a metaphorical slap to the face and a middle finger to boot, the end is completely made up of hand drawn slides, digitizes pictures, text slides, recycled animation and voice acting to tie it together, it seems the company in charge of animation lost their budget near the end and had to change whatever end they intended for a completely boring anti-climactic ending that makes you feel like youve wasted your life.Don't waste your money or time on this series, try Yu Yu Hakusho, Rouroni Kenshin, Great Teacher Onizuka, Full Metal (insert word here because all shows starting with that are good), but if you watch this series til the end you will regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best DVD to pick up for casual viewing","review":"Considering that Evangelion is a very story-driven anime, there are as a result not many episodes that you can pick up and watch to kill a couple hours. This DVD, along with, in my opinion, episodes 7 and 8 on disc 2, are the ones that are the least dependent on each other and, as a result, are the ones that can be the most fun to watch in isolation. These are the episodes of the pure combat and fun, before the storyline starts to get to the heavy part. Tech level is okay, but it still has those annoying promos before you can get to the menu."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good series","review":"Of the first 3 DVD this one has been the best. This is offset by the fact that there are only 3 episodes rather than 4 on it. If these DVD's were the price of regular DVD's then it would not be so bad. But anime is one of the most expensive of all the buy.The episodes themselves are quick good. They show some different aspecs of the Angels and also some small ideas about them. The characters are all changing as the series goes along and for the most part the animation itself is quite good. There are only a couple of places where they have every character doing the same movement and moving at the same time.This is a quality series and if you are enjoying it then buy this one for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmm","review":"Having never seen the series before (except discs 1-2, eps 1-8), I must say that this is the poorest of the series. Despite having new DVD menu intervals and improved chapter selection, the series suffers from the momentary silliness that is common with a few of the episodes in NGE. Despite this, you have to watch this disc in order to progress with the story, and I'm told that the last episodes of the series are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Groovy CD!","review":"A few years ago I listened to this CD in the music section at my local Borders store. I thought some of the songs were great, but did not buy it until recently.My favorite tracks are 2, 3, 9, 11 and 13. There are four I really dislike, or else I would have given this CD a full five stars. The songs that I love, especially Ken Ishii's contribution, are truly remarkable, but \\"the four\\" are strident and discordant compared to the groovy ambient tones this CD provides on many tracks and take away from the flow of the finished product...but out of 14+ songs, it isn't too painful to skip over 4.It is a well-composed and thoughtful CD, and I would recommend it to those who like international/world music and/or Japanese tunes in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"j-pop fan","review":"I was suprised considering I went out on a limb to pick this up. It seemed risky as all sophomore albums are, even as compilaions go.

It does have some very \\"eruo-influenced\\" sound in it but you'll get over it.

This isn't dense house, either. This is a deep house/downtempo combination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for clubbing.","review":"From the negative reviews I've read, I get the feeling they want some deep house music you'd hear in a club. You might hear a track or two from this CD, but this is a perfect CD for background house parties, not teeth grinding, booty shaking moves. It is smooth, sophisticated house and goes great with a mimosa, a blunt or pool side in summer. It has a constant beat, with smooth vocals, beautiful arrangements from start to finish but you can still chat over it. If someone turns it up, then I'm sure you could groove to it, but you'll wanna take your groove to a real club to take the party higher or follow it up with a stronger CD.

And this CD definitely gives me hope that one day, House music may be accepted back on radio again. You can listen to this CD straight through without skipping because all of the tracks are quality, but after one listen you'll be skipping to your favorites.

This is beautiful house groove, perfect for a rainy afternoon drive or a candlelit lovemaking extravaganza. I can add that if you like Jamiroquai's beats and basslines, this record will not disappoint. Though it is very different from Jamiroquai, I found the comparison inevitable.Sounds incredible on an audiophile system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous and truly beautiful","review":"When I think of the word Beautiful, as applied to music, I do not imagine hard pounding techno beats, nor does Blue Six apparently. This album is a relaxed, but deep and emotional collection of outstanding house tracks. Being rather partial to this kind of music it was right up my alley. Great vocals, nice bass lines. Close to Home really touched a personal note with my and thus I may be biased in my review. Grace is a great, dreamy sounding track, with a little more intensity to it; but don't get me wrong, this isn't Waxmaster. If you are looking for a great chill album to relax to, be it in bed or in the car, this is a great track. Although Waxmaster in the bedroom can be good too every now and again. :P~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Deep House for a Beautiful Tomorrow","review":"Jay Denes is a genius. This CD exemplifies the mellow yet sexy, jazzy, lush, deep house vibe that defines the Naked Music sound. Not since 4AD in their prime has a record lable released such consistently excellent work. The sultry, varied vocalists keep things extra sensuous and interesting. Contrary to another review, the production on this CD is absolutely pristine, very clean sounding, and exquisitely minimal/elegant. Denes will probably attract much attention from some big names (e.g., Madonna who suppposedly is a Naked Music fan) with this release. Hopefully their recent Astralwerks distribution deal will give Denes & company the exposure they deserve. Until the next Rurals, Los Amigos Invisibles, or Nude Dimensions 4 CD comes out, this has got to be the best dance release so far this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, relaxing - it IS Beautiful","review":"This album is everything I'd hoped Miguel Mix's \\"Nude Tempo 1\\" would be, but wasn't. Unlike that CD - which was a BIG disappointment, this one has much the same basic beat but it stays SUBDUED and in the background, rather than overwhelming the Artists.

The verdict? I believe the ND series had more impressive versions of various tracks - 'Music and Wine' and 'Pure' are two in particular that come to mind. Nevertheless, as a whole I'm just happy to hear smooth, low tempo house music from Naked Music. Sweeter Love is undeniably my favorite track, with its extra crispy high hats, sub-deep bass thumps, soulful vocals, and lyrics that can't be beat. What this CD lacks in content it easily makes up for with clean production efforts, which are thankfully echoed throughout each and every track. Give me more, Naked Music!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What, are all these people bandmember's friends?","review":"I can't believe all the 4 and 5 stars this recording got. I purchased based on these recommendations and I'm really sorry I did. Remember when those synthesizer organs came out? You could press a button and get canned salsa, carribbean, etc. backbeats.

Just when you think it might get interesting with new sounds or instruments coming in, it just seems to go nowhere,for eg., keyboards & flute etc just get stuck in (boring) loops.

Thankfully, this did not happen, as Winwood, flautist/saxophonist Chris Wood and drummer Jim Capaldi unexpectedly revived Traffic with their 1970 classic, \\"John Barleycorn Must Die\\" (but that's another review). In the meantime, \\"Last Exit\\" is a great odds-and-sods Traffic album, containing several rare singles like the lighthearted \\"Shanghai Noodle Factory\\" and the groovy \\"Medicated Goo,\\" and a pair of barnburning, jamming live tracks (recorded at the Fillmore West) in the form of \\"Feelin' Good\\" and \\"Blind Man.\\" \\"Last Exit\\" is an excellent album that no Traffic fan should do without."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good for you","review":"Despite some of the negative press it gets for being thrown together by the record company, this is actually pretty good. The opening song hasn't aged well but everything else is pretty great.Shanghai Noodle Factory, Withering Tree and Medicated Goo shows Traffic as about as good as they get. Now about the live performances, these get ragged on quite a bit, however the new remastered version they've never sounded cleaner. The quality stems for how they were recorded-basic 2 track with no being able to fix it in the mix. The performances are all top notch and of songs that are not currently available elsewhere. Sure I wish Chris Wood was louder in the mix and Stevie Winwood's organ wasn't turned up quite so loud. Feelin' Good is wonderful and full of emotion. Blind Man shows how great they were at taking a blues tune and turning it into something special.

It seems that the description is wrong. It says the kits are included but they are not. The ONLY reason i bought this was because it had the GH and KH kit included and i found it silly to spend the money on just a GH and KH kit when i could just get the other items for a only a little bit more.Needless to say i am frustrated.

Later, two cichlids died, the others were at the bottom of the tank. It was puzzling because the Ammonia and pH are at ideal levels. It turns out nitrite was killing the fish! You need this kit to test for all 4, Ammonia, pH, nitrite and nitrate to ensure a healthy aquarium. Once I found the problem, thanks to this kit, it was quickly corrected.

You will get WAY more tests out of this kit than you will out of any test strip bottle as well.I would LOVE to give this a 5 stars, but the color chart would need some improvement.

Some tests are easy to conduct, while others require that you don't lose the instruction guide (i.e. add 10 drops of chemical A, shake and wait 5 min then add 10 drops of chemical B, shake and wait another 5min). Tubes are sturdy and won't break easily when dropped; I have dropped two already and the cap stayed on, no water spilt and no damage to container. The color guide is a little difficult for me to read, since I partially color blind; but with a little aid from my wife there is no issue. I love the fact it comes with a regular ph test and a high ph test. Since goldfish like it a little above 7.5 then it is alot more useful when getting the ph perfect for them.

Hardly a sacrafice for highly accurate readings no? Also, at most, you will be mixing 2 bottles of chemicals with one test tube. It's not rocket science people.One last thing.

I highly recommend this over test strips since you get a much more accurate reading. It is easy to use and the color card makes it easy to interpret your results.

Mr. D'Arienzo seems to be too fixated on gore, not coming up with an original story line. Most of his book seems copied from other, older books in the same genre. But with more vivid detail on the violence. That does not equal good storytelling. Also, I want to point out that I felt misled by the positive reviews of this book on Amazon.com. I think many of them have been planted to sell more books. The most recent one points out that the author is good looking, that has nothing to do with whether a book is good or not and besides, no picture is in the book! Honestly, this book is not very good.

Nothing original, it is a compilation of all the world's tourist traps and overpriced hotels. A crappy, overrated, uninteresting travel guide written by someone clearly obsessed with Spas and hotels. It is blatant that the author of this turkey got kickbacks and free hotels stays by mentioning some names...

For instance, it lists no sites worth seeing in Lebanon, a country that contains 6 of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites; by comparison, for instance, the list includes 10 sites in Israel, a country that contains 6 World Heritage Sites as well (counting the one in Jerusalem as being in Israel, which is disputed still). I frankly can't think of a reason for the glaring discrepancy other than political bias. You'd think a fair and balanced list (not ala Fox News) of 1000 must-see sites would at least include the World Heritage Sites (the total of which is 851 properties \\"forming part of the cultural and natural heritage which the World Heritage Committee considers as having outstanding universal value\\").I recommend instead the gorgeously photographed \\"Unforgettable Places to See Before You Die\\" or Lonely Planet's far more comprehensive \\"The Travel Book\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could of been a grand book","review":"Its a good primer on the logistics and a good list of what to go see but thats about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst travel book........possible","review":"This has got to be one of the worst travel books I have ever come across. It does not cover anything that would not already be obvious if you went to one of the places listed here - like not to miss the Empire State Bldg if you are in NYC or the Eiffel Tower in Paris. On the Swedish section it has the area referred to as all of Southern Sweden mixed up with an island of its east coast.

The author is very biased towards certain regions of the world, and seems to think that the most important things to see when traveling are fancy hotels.

For an example, Torres Del Paine, Chile is one of the most beautiful nature wonder of the world with its glaciers, lakes, peaks, and majestic views. Instead of writing this, the author decide to descibe in detail about the over-priced hotel in the park.Author consistently writes about:1. Hotel, hotel, and more hotels.

I figure maybe 10 or 20 hotels are historic enough to really warrant being destinations in their own right.Fully 3/4 of the pages of this book are dedicated to Europe and US/Canada.

It generously devotes 97 pages to the entire continent of Asia. In China, there is no mention of the entire city and region surrounding Shanghai. And yet countless inns and gardens in Europe and the US are mentioned.I love traveling (I've been to just over 40 countries). And there probably ARE a 1000 places I'd like to see before I die.

You can pick this book up anytime you have a few minutes to spare, and put it down without worrying about how the plot turns out.It is a big world out there with many places that this retired history and government teacher is embarrassed to admit that he's never heard about before--let alone been able to notch the passport when ticking one more off the list.I don't find that a one line citation for a restaurant or hotel is too much--often just one or two per place. That information gives another dimension to the historic and cultural description. It's also OK for me that the author tends to note the high end.

I am not a hotel collector. If you aren't either, skip this book. Even the entries for neat places skimp on info about the place in order to include a long plug for a nearby, luxury hotel. There are only a very few hotels that should qualify as places to see on their own; I didn't know about the ice hotels, for instance, and those might be a kick and fairly amazing.

They are the places that make up her own Life List, and in my opinion she is right on the dime. Would these be my one thousand? The truth is - who would ever have the time, passion and experience to draw up such a list to compare? Ms. Schultz has done it for us and she deserves a gold star.

The book's emphasis, though, presents a somewhat disturbing scenario to all potential readers. On one hand, it's good that, by making the list so long, the author is encouraging us to live for a long time, but what about those of us whose time is running out? For an untravelled person in their autumn years, 1000 places is an awful lot to be expected to get through, and attempting it could even shorten whatever time they have left.

You'll be able to spend more time there, plus catch a baseball game while you're at it. Also, I was upset to see that a rib restaurant in Tennessee surpassed Rainier National Park or the Olympic Penninsula as a sight to see. What about the salt mines in Krakow or the Alambra in Rhonda?

The film has the feel of a live play, rather than a film. The acting is very good. The \\"Lodger\\" is also interesting for those who want to understand Hitchcock and his techniques. But, it was his first film and shows his youthfulness. However, the Whirlwind DVD reproduction is dreadful. The quality of the images vary from scene to scene. In general, the objects are blurred and out of focus and the imagery is very dark. The sound is not very good either. I have an old VHS version that I taped directly from television and it is of much better quality. In my opinion, don't buy this version but wait for someone else to produce a better quality reproduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"Product is thick & sinks to the bottom.

In all honesty, we are not even going to try it out, so I don't know how well it works.

At first, this little fryer seemed to be the greatest. My family uses a fryer very often, and we have had several larger ones. That being the reason this one seemed so appealing, the size. There are many problems we have encountered with this. The basket has folded up many times when emptying out hot food resulting in 3 burns. The tab on the top which houses the filter broke off within the first 2-3 cleanings and the plug continually falls off the back. I have also had the oil spurt out the top filter. The size is the only positive thing I can say about this fryer, all the other I have owned were very big and bulky. In the end size does matter, I will go back to the larger one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty thermostat, low temperature","review":"With the temperature dial set to 350, the green ready light turns on at 280. The temperature continues to rise to a maximum of 305. With the temperature dial set to 375, the oil will eventually reach 350, but go no higher. I tried cooking a batch of small egg rolls - one at a time - and the temperature couldn't get back up to 350 before each one was cooked. I love the idea of a compact fryer, but the heating element in this one isn't up to the task; the food comes out too greasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little Deep Fryer!","review":"A very nice little deep fryer.

It heats up quickly and holds it temperature very well for a small fryer. The handle on the basket is easy to attach and remove, which makes it easy to put it inside the basket with the power cord for storage. The basket and lid can be put in the dishwasher for easy cleaning. The non-stick interior is not Teflon, but looks almost like a ceramic coating and is very easy to clean. The pouring spout on one corner is surprisingly efficient. Pouring the contents into a funnel with a cheesecloth liner is easy and effectively filters the oil to be saved for another day. I would recommend this fryer to anyone who wants to fry a small batch of food for two people.Contrary to another review I read here, the exterior is brushed stainless steel, not plastic. And the handle stays in place nicely if you squeeze the metal parts together and insert them into the tab provided. It is a very well made small appliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I got this fryer yesterday and was very excited to use it because we have two little ones so we thought it was the perfect size for the amount of food we needed to fry instead of having to heat up a larger deep fryer.

Maybe I am comparing my nice old one to this one...and could be why I am so disappointed. The Cuisinart has a turn dial with temp read for 325 and 375 but just dots before 325 so you gotta guess the temp. Which I guess I could get used to. But I went to time my batch of fries...no built in timer. Disappointing. Went to open the lid when done...used the small lip on the side of the lid and burned my fingers as the steam rolled up and out. Still hurts. Went to turn it off...and no on/off switch so have to just unplug. Some of this may seem minor and I guess I was just used to these little frills. But I am going to be looking for a different deep fryer none the less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evertyhing sticks to basket","review":"Purchased this little fryer for seafood frying. Have tried multiple batters and they all stick like concrete to the basket. Called Cuisineart and they said that you need to use their recipe for batter. Have already tried that and it still sticks.

Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Small, Cute, and Worthless","review":"I've always liked Cuisinart products and use a few on a daily basis (microwave, breadmaker, toaster). I had high hopes for this mini deep fryer but after several frustrating frying sessions, I realized that its cute package was a smokescreen for a totally flawed appliance. The thermostat on mine was a disaster and it couldn't hold temperature even with a few tiny items added. The fried items were sodden with grease and were mostly inedible. Doughnuts were a huge disaster, but breaded chicken fared slightly better. The concept was great- quick frying with a minimum of oil- but it was not quick and with temperature running an average of 325 F (50 degrees short of ideal) made for disappointing frying. I returned this item and got a small unit at half the price at a major discount retailer. Fabulous results with the new unit. The only way fried food can be edible is with the proper temp. Please fix this problem, Cuisinart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good piece of equipment for the price UPDATE 2009","review":"Nothing big to report other than I would have given it 5 stars if the power cable was a bit more securely attached. They have a magnetic cable lock system that can drop the power cable off if you even touch it or move the item. I agree that safety in these things is paramount but the power cord attachment system they use if overkill if ever I saw it. I want it to come unplugged if I knock it over or even hit it hard, not come unplugged because I moved it one inch to get a better angle on the basket. UPDATE: Just to let you folks know that 18 months later its still working great and I have learned to put it where I want it BEFORE I start cooking :) Maybe should have been 5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heat Loss, Hard to Clean, Food Sticks to Basket","review":"After first use, goes downhill from there. Loses heat, does not get hot enough to make foods crispy and the food then sticks to the wire basket making a mess. Is a pain to clean. They should make the inner container removeable so you can take it out and clean it easily and properly. The whole thing is a hassle to use, is messy, oil splatters all over it and really makes it a chore to cook in it. I dont like it at all. bought it at a local store and am going to return it and say good riddens! also bought a tin canister at that same store to store the oil after use and that too is a mess and a pain. plus this fryer is only big enough for one person and one food in your meal. if you want to fry more than one food - your meal aint going to work. because you have to cook one thing at a time and when you fry food you cannot leave it out because it gets soft and limp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep fryer not as advertised","review":"I was disappointed with this item.

In my case it was very extremely useful to cover areas of ASP.NET that I haven't used in my everyday work. In my opinion, either if you have hand-on experience on ASP.NET development, or if you just want to learn, this is a great book. The author is not only knowledgeable on the technical areas, but is also a good teacher.Specifically for those who want to take the 70-315, you still would like to take some exam simulations. In my experience, the PrepLogic sim demo, provided with the book, was not as useful tool to prepare for the exam as the Transcender sim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors & Bugs Galore!","review":"I started using this book as the basis for my study for the exam. I never completed the book because it became such a waste of my time to try to figure out why the application didn't run. Many of the exercises appear to have been copied from the 70-316 book, but never adapted for the ASP.NET environment. Fifteen pages of errata, and that didn't cover half of the bugs and errors. Stay away from this book! Use MSDN - it is far more reliable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bet for MCAD","review":"After reading several reviews on this book, I finaly zeroed upon this one. It is one decision that I will never regret for. Being totally new to the .NET world, Kalani brought me quickly up to the speed. The best part of this book is the organization of content. The exercises at the end of each chapter are very good and did test your understanding of the chapter. The reason why I gave only 4 stars is that some of the topics that I got in the actual exam does not even have a reference in the book. Having said that, I still would recommend this book to go for 70-315."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great, but repeats startup steps too many times","review":"Use this book and you'll pass. This book, like its companions for 70-316 and 70-320, is terrific. The exercises are focused and on-target, and the explanations are concise. My only beef with it is that you're required to create the same damned form, and drag across the same damned labels and textboxes, and to rename them the same damned way, before you're finally off to the races on the real topic of the exercise. Considering that each chapter usually features well in excess of a dozen exercises, and there are a dozen+ chapters, you're faced with re-executing the starting steps over 200 times! Small complaint, though. It's otherwise totally effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This Book covers many aspect from an exam(70-315) point of view as well as for knowledge purpose. I read this book as well as Microsoft Press Book.One thing to note....The CD accompanied with this book does not give you clear picture about exam questions. It just asks you simple questions, no syntax questions or questions based on few lines of code. Compared to this,the CD accompnied with Microsoft press is really good. I would suggest reading this book and using Microsoft press CD for getting more confidence for exam. Also, you need to read more articles from MSDN on database chapters(Dataset and Constraints) apart from this book if you are targetting exam.

My only disppointment with the book is the exam that comes on the CD. The quality of the questions are not very good; although, I think it is only there to entice you to buy the full set of test that they market on the publisher's website. Other than, though, the book does a great job of covering all the relevant topics on the exam and I found the large amount of exercises extremely useful at driving home the material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knowledge by Doing","review":"This is a great book. I worked through every excercise and sample in the book, I passed the exam (without doing braindumps, but it probably would have been easier as the sample questions in this book are good but there's no substitute for PrepLogic etc). I can safely say \\"I have done that\\" when someone asks me about custom exceptions, asynch callbacks, creating global assemblies, etc etc. I had minor experience before starting so I found it hard going at first, that's when the Visual Studio.NET Combined Collection came in handy. If your the same then don't get to put off by the events and delegates section at the end of the first chapter, in fact it might be worth understanding the basics and coming back to it. If you want practical experience more than head knowledge, get this book. If you just want to pass the exam and struggle in a real world environment, do the brain dumps. If you want both, do both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but additional reading required","review":"This is the only book that I studied for 70-320 exam. I passed the test with an excellent score. It is very well written from exam point of view. However, I would suggest test takers to do additional reading in MSDN areas that appeared in the exam and were not sufficiently explored in the book. To name a few:- Generating DataSet Relational Structure from XML Schema- Soap Exception Handling- Securing XML Web Services using ASP.NET- Securing Serviced Components and Remote ObjectsI am not saying that the book isn't good. The author has done an excellent job in covering the vast scope of this exam. As one of the reviewers pointed out that it is impossible to cover everything.

Because of the almost perfect conductivity, there are no hot spots anywhere in pot, so i can simmer almost anything in it, and it always bubbles evenly. One time I cooked a little bit of shreded pork in it, almost no oil. You're thinking that, duh, it stuck, right? Sure, but once i threw in the diced tomatoes in, everything deglazed off the bottom beautifully. I jiggled the pot some, and nothing was stuck anymore. It was magic, and so was the sauce. This pot is a joy.Lesson learned? Good pots are worth it. Every penny and then some."},{"rating":"1","title":"MADE IN CHINA","review":"Although All-Clad states on its website that its bonded cookware is made in USA, THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE. I was informed by All-Clad Customer Service today that the 1 qt saucepan without lid and the 7-1/2 in fry pan are made in China. The ONLY way to tell the difference between these and ones made in USA is by the BOX. In very small letters on the side of the box, it says, \\"Made in China\\". The sauce pan is marked All-Clad, but whether it is identical in quality to USA-made cookware is disputed. It is my opinion that they are engaging in deceptive trade practices by not disclosing that these two items, and possibly others, are made in China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little pan","review":"I bought this pan in 2003 for only $40 when a local kitchen store went out of business, and since then it's been my main pan for small jobs. I know that many of these smaller pans are now being made in China, but I'm almost certain that mine was made in the USA. The finish is flawless, the inside is nice and smooth, and everything fits together as it should. I use it often enough that I wanted a second one, so I bought an LTD model for $15 at BB&B just last year (whose finish is also top-notch). Both perform equally well, but I have to admit, I'm partial to the look of the stainless. The only thing missing is a pouring lip - this pan is the perfect size for making good hot chocolate, but getting it into the cups or an intermediate container that DOES have a lip is horribly messy. Oh well, still a great pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Saucepan!","review":"I use this handy little saucepan all the time for heating up soup, canned vegetables, tomato sauce, etc. It's perfect for cooking up single servings, so I highly recommend it for all you swinging singles out there.

A great buy for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"I bought this to try out the All-clad line of cookware. This saucepan may get 3 stars if it came with a lid.

Over the years, we've tried all different makes and models of other brands, but nothing bests All-Clad. Now that we own All-Clad, we'll own nothing else (except for Emile Henry or Le Creuset). The aluminum core that extends up the sides of all the All-Clad saucepans makes for extremely even and effective heat distribution. This saucepan, which does not come with a lid, is excellent at small tasks: red wine reduction, coulis, cooked marinades, etc. The absence of the lid is understandable at the price, and actually warranted, as most sauces made in a pan this small should not be made with a lid anyway.

It only happens on a couple of tracks, only on the 5.1 mix, and it is very subtle (just a slight offset between the video and the audio). The stereo mix syncs perfectly. I also note a problem with the track indexing when listening to the 5.1 mix: If I use the skip track button on my player, I end up missing the first second of some of the tracks.

A rare story-oriented album that works as both a narrative and a collection of individual songs. The plot sketched by the songs is elliptical but coherent - a boxer/addict and his long-suffering girlfriend set out on a road trip, try unsuccessfully to outrun their problems, split up on a dark sad night both agreeing it was best (to steal a line from Zimmy), then reunite tentatively and hopefully. The melodies and arrangements are powerful and catchy, and for an old 70's guy like me, the production is stellar. Yes, there are instruments panned hard right and left, and that's just where I like them! I want to hear the piano, guitars, organ, drums, bass and voices interact with each other.

He encounters many challenges including cannibals, building a new house, making tools, and making a boat.In one scene he has to build a fortress to protect him from the cannibals. He had wood log fence, a lookout tower, a retractable ladder, and many weapons. His house was very secure from the cannibals, but took him three months to build.I really liked Robinson Crusoe, even thought I don't really like books where people are stranded in the wilderness.

Only 2 out of the 12 of us stayed with it and read it. Crusoe indeed did live a fascinating life, but it is told in the most boring, tedious manner. Defoe's style of writing is dry and unemotional. I did remind myself the book was written almost 300 years ago, and was fresh and different from other novels written in the 1600's. I have read many wonderful tales of wilderness survival: Island of the Blue Dolphin, Hatchet, and The Cay, so my expectations were high. Defoe spends too much time on mudane daily activities and not enough on Crusoe's feelings. Most of the \\"juicy stuff\\" of interest happens in the last 1/4 of the book. I wish I had spent my time reading The Great Illustrated Classic version, this book desperately needs paring down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for Robinson crusoe","review":"I thought this book was good because the adventure in this book never stopped and it kept me into the book.

Once again there are upbeat songs like, \\"King Of Glory\\", and \\"Hosanna\\", and beautiful ballads like, \\"Shepherd Of My Heart\\", and \\"There Is A Savior\\". There is the majestic sounding, \\"Unshakable Kingdom\\", and the jazzy sounding, \\"Face To Faith\\", on which Sandi proves she would've made a great jazz singer as well. And of course the lyrics of Love In Any Language are some of my favorites, \\"Love in any language, straight from the heart, pulls us all together, never apart, and once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear, love in any language, fluently spoken here\\".

'Acquiesce', hands-down their best B-side. But the biggest reason to get this version is for the demo of SMS and their cover of 'You've Got To Hide Your Love Away'. You now get a 'Liam' version and a 'Noel' version of SMS on one CD. And because the Beatles were their idols, you can guarantee an excellent cover of 'You've Got to Hide Your Love Away'(take that, Eddie Vedder!). Say what you want about Noel's lyrics.

The writing style is clunky (Harris' dialogues are full of language that doesn't employ contractions), it's very hard to read, seems dated, and takes an age to get going. It's appropriately titled though as I found the writing style as soporific as a slowly beating drum.The book is about a pitcher with the \`New York Mammoths' who learns his friend on the team, the catcher, is dying; the story being a metaphor for the human condition.

Each character comes to life as you turn the pages. They become real, feeling people. Spindler's writing style literally transports you to another place with descriptions so vivid its as if we all become part of the performing cast.

HOWEVER, this book really is pretty disappointing. The title is intentionally provocative and misleading, something which Dr. Soren readily admits to in class. Furthermore, Soren admittedly hates most horror made post-1960's and sees \\"Fiend Without a Face\\" as the pinnacle of the horror genre. To his credit, Dr. Soren wears his biases openly, but if you are lookinig for a critical/theoretical examination of horror or an overview of the genre, I would suggest you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"great disappointment","review":"The real horror of this book is the poorly planned drivel it contains- Soren floats from topic to topic, fact to fact with little to no transitions, interspersing an unfounded opinion here or there- Classifieds are a more thought provoking and entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The few, The proud: The masochists!","review":"Those who find Saramago's style appealing are masochists.

I am glad to read other reviewers' comments about a slow start and then the light goes on and you just get it. I may be slow, but it took one and a half books to catch on to his dialogue. The author is so clever, taking every explanation into several expressions. A marvel of words. His characters are so fully developed you feel like you are under their skin; not just the central characters, but down to the stray hungry dog waiting on the steps for a morsel of food from some passing benefactor. I think I have learned more about Lisbon reading Saramago then all the travel books combined. The personality of the Portuguese is exposed for all to understand. Maybe it is because I have the blood running in my veins and have been exposed to Portuguese realtives I recognize so many residents of Portugal. A wonderful read.

Fernando Pessoa had died some time ago and meets his heteronym (in other words, his other self!)to discuss about life issues. This encounter works as pretext for the author to re-tell the history of the contry during dictatorship, which had been forgotten (or deleted) from official history books. The ones who know about Fernando Pessoa's poetry and life will be delighted with this fantastic story. The ones who don't, will certainly feel like getting to know a little more of the best poet who ever wrote in Portuguese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I enjoyed this book. Ms. Finnis is very knowedgeable about Roman history and roman Britain in particular. Her characters are very well drawn and I find the character of Aurelia particularly entertaining. Ms. Finnis gets more comfortable with each book in the series (I have read 3).That said, I sort of felt like I was reading Nancy Drew or Angela Brazil. There was such a \\"jolly\\" atmosphere about the characters.

I was hoping for a well-developed and imagined picture of the social setting and daily life that might have taken place, but did not find it in this book.

The album gets knocked down a star for containing the insipid \\"The River Of Dreams\\" and the three new songs are nothing to speak of."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"This is one of the greatest cds ever. It includes classics like 'innocent man' and 'we didn't start the fire' and songs that i otherwise would have never heard of, like 'all about soul' and 'leningrad'.

KEEPING THE FAITH and the title track,both from 1983's AN INNOCENT MAN should have been on GREATEST HITS VOL.1 AND VOL. 2. From 1986's THE BRIDGE are A MATTER OF TRUST,THIS IS THE TIME and BABY GRAND,an easy listening track on which Ray Charles joins Billy. Six of the ten tracks from 1989's STORM FRONT,another million-seller for Billy,include AND SO IT GOES,WE DIDN'T START THE FIRE,THE DOWNEASTER \\"ALEXA\\",I GO TO EXTREMES,SHAMELESS and LENINGRAD. From 1993's RIVER OF DREAMS are the title track,ALL ABOUT SOUL and LULLABY(GOODNIGHT,MY ANGEL). Those three are some of Billy's last pop/rock compositions. The 3 original tracks are covers. Bob Dylan's TO MAKE YOU FEEL MY LOVE,HEY GIRL by Carole King and Gerry Goffin(a hit for Freddie Scott in 1963) and Leonard Cohen's LIGHT AS THE BREEZE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joel the genuis!!","review":"there is no question in my mind that Billy Joel is a musical Genius up there with Elton John and Paul McCartney!! almost all the songs in this vol.3 cd are hits!! go buy it,and while your at it get vol.1 and 2!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointed","review":"I consider to be one of the sincerest Billy Joel's fans this side of the Bravo.

Sorry Billy, this one was not your best selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Gimme a break!Billy Joel haven't written enough good songs to fill 3 \\"Greatest hits\\" albums. On this, the third one, the only memorable song is \\"We didn't start the fire\\". Almost everything else is so boring it's hard to stand it. Obviously, the record company try to get as much money they can, and it works, since there's a lot of people with no personal taste in music. I even tend to believe that most of the buyers don't really like music at all.

There are some very nice songs on this \\"hits\\" CD, but very few of the songs here were actually \\"hits\\".

Innocent Man is a lovely song...I don't really know any other way to describe it!! \\"Baby Grand\\" is an awesome duet with Ray Charles. \\"Lullaby (Goodnight My Angel)\\" is a very moving piano piece coupled with equally moving and thought provoking lyrics.

Worth getting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's still Billy Joel to me","review":"This collection should receive bonus points for going back and picking up a couple of hits that were left off of the first \\"Hits\\" package (Innocent Man, Keeping the Faith), but ruins that effort by not getting ALL of his Top 40 hits forgotten the first time around (Honesty, Sometimes a Fantasy). Instead, we are treated to a couple of \\"previously unreleased\\" tracks. While those are nice, I would rather have had the forgotten tracks (this is a \\"Greatest Hits\\" collection, remember?). I think that it's some sort of record industry conspiracy that most \\"Hits\\" collections leave off at least one popular song that you really wish you had, but what can you do? All in all, this is a great way to cap off your Billy Joel collection (if you don't already have all of his other albums) as he retires from Rock and Roll to pursue other musical interests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opinion on Greatest Hits Vol. 3","review":"If you like Billy Joel you'll like this. However, if you're just looking for 'hits', this is not the one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Letdown","review":"This compilation is a genuine letdown from Greatest Hits Volume I & Volume II. It starts off in fine fashion with \\"Keeping The Faith\\" and \\"An Innocent Man\\", two great singles that prove Billy's musical and lyrical genius are still in tact. But then the album focuses on Billy's lifeless AOR-period. With the possible exceptions of \\"Baby Grand\\" and \\"The Downeaster 'Alexa'\\", most of these recordings seem tired and redundant. It neglects some of his best work from this period (\\"Big Man On Mulberry Street\\",\\"No Man's Land\\") in favor of lesser cuts from Storm Front, one of his worst albums (although he seems to favor this album in concert). For a more satisfying listen of Billy's later work, pick up River Of Dreams instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"what happened to my review?","review":"Several days ago to be helpful, I wrote and submitted a review of this album mentioning its Latin Grammy selection as \\"Best Brazilian Album\\" but days later it isn't on the album page, just two very general, not very specific reviews.

It is well written in a manner that explains numerous projects without a lot of technical jargon. It explains what needs to be done and what can be done. And alot of the information will be helpful to someone who is looking to buy a used motorcycle, so that they will sound like they know more than they really know. If you like motorcycles and want to learn more about how they work, but are not very mechanically inclined, I would highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Episode 2\\" promises much but explains less","review":"If Charles Grant dies soon I'm going to kill him! Words cannot explain just how addictive this series of books is going to become for me. Its like watching the X-files back when its was going from good to great. There is a lot more than meets the eye in the mystery of this small town, someone (or THING? ) is playing with Ethan Proctor, does it have to do with the murder in Atlantic City? Or the disappearance of that girl so many years ago? One thing is for certain, we are going to have to wait a little while longer to find out. So when is the next one, I cannot wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nutty masterpiece","review":"This one took some getting used to. Most of the songs are takeoff of an original famous song or genre. None follows the original music exactly and at first I found this quite disconcerting. The words were funny, but I kept expecting the original tune. I still feel this way about some. \\"Hey Food\\" doesn't work because \\"Hey Jude\\" is one of the great songs of all time and it's annoying to hear an inferior takeoff. \\"Let It Be\\" is less great but still better than \\"Letter 'B'\\". But some of the takeoffs are masterpieces in their own rights. Forgive me, but I almost like \\"Rebel 'L'\\" better than the original, which I adore. And the genre parodies (Spector-ish girl groups, a generic Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley song etc ) are easier to enjoy. I'm glad I persisted."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest CD Out!!!","review":"When in need a the music minstry...try this one.... I have the album and I have the CD.....

Not only does this author break the rule that letters shouldn't stand for themselves, but there are actually several errors in these crytograms.

On the positive side, the quotes are varied and fun and with some re-editing this would earn some more stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I have EVERY album that Yngwie has put out, and then some. But I must admit that this album is below par for the following reasons: sound, recording/engineering, production, and the band. In addition to all of the reasons above, the WORST thing was the lack of his \\"signature sound\\". I can't hear Yngwie and I can't hear his Stratocaster and his Marshalls! The album is not raw enough and sounded like he just plugged everything through some cheap floor effects, then recorded straight to the tapes. Second: the drums...this has got to be THE WORST part of the recording. My drum machine puts out more attack and timbre than the drums mapped out here. Lastly, the song writing: \\"too commercial\\" but not commercial enough for airplay, what can be worst than that? The rest...well you can just imagine.Sorry, but this album is just terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly recorded, bombastic drivel...","review":"Yngwie has an ego longer than most Par 5 holes on the PGA tour. Unfortunately, even I have to admit that he has some songwriting talent (not that he ever bothers to show it). This album, released in 1990, is his songwriting nadir and is poorly recorded to boot. Speaking of boots, the drums sound like someone banging on a wet shoebox. I'd criticize the bass playing if I could hear it. What I COULD hear is the lead guitar. Plenty of lead guitar. Thousands of notes. Lots of flash. No statement. Bottom line is that this album is a joke. Highly recommended if you like badly shot photos of Yngwie pouting..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A WANKER","review":"If the only skill you admire is the playing of many notes in a short space of time, this is just great. If, however, you also care about the notes themselves and the musik that these notes create, than this is obnoxious. Why musik like this needs a singer ( god he is dreadfull ) and lyrics ( very generous term for this drivel) escapes me. Surely the only thing any MALMSTEEN cd has going for it is the soulless noodling at warp speed that he is good at. I would rather see him in a circus as some of his playing borders on the acrobatic - but musik it aint!!!Listen to ANDY TIMMONS. Similar if not better chops and astonishing compositions to boot. Not just many notes, but always the right ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Change","review":"Early Yngwie was great, of course, but something changed with this album.

Though most fans think he \\"sold-out\\", I think Odyssey and Eclipse proved he still had the vision he once spoke of, as well as proving his song writing maturity that some folks never seem to get. Remember how many hair bands we had? Second album they went to the pits. Though some cheese is here and there. It will never discount the validity of his ability to play guitar.

If you already have the previous trilogy box set there is no need to \\"upgrade\\", or better say \\"downgrade\\", since M:I 3 only comes with 1 disc instead of 2 as the previous set.If you never had them, go ahead, make the purchase, even better, Best Buy have them for $19.99 this week, and they include a $10 coupon for Ghost Protocol, so in essence you will end up spending only $10 for a 3-BD Box set. Not a bad deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good set, sub-par blu-ray transfer","review":"For the price, this set is totally worth it. But to be completely honest I would not have minded paying a little extra for a better remastering of the first two films. The transfer for the first two films is not bad, but it isn't great. There is still a soft and grainy quality to the movies. For a blu-ray, this should not be an issue. For those of you who say that the age of the film is a factor, I invite you to watch Blade Runner on blu-ray. You will be amazed. Now keep in mind that Blade Runner is about 30 years old already, and the remastering of this movie looks A LOT better than the transfer for Mission: Impossible 1 or 2. I suppose I can't complain much since I paid 20 bucks for this set, but still. These are great movies, they deserve a better transfer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paramount drops the ball yet again..........

They should really look into remastering their products before releasing them to the public(Especially at the prices of Blu-rays).

The simple design made them easy to put together. Once assembled, there are two means by which to connect (stack) them. My only difficulty; on the top and bottom of each unit are four small holes with stoppers. The stoppers only get placed if multiple units will not be connected. I didn't realize this until the the stoppers were in place. Removing them was time consuming and annoying, they had to be pried with a very small screwdriver or knife. I had metals handles in my tool bag and used those rather than the plastic handles included in the kit.The cubes look great in my home office.

As the preface says, if you are not interested in HOW COM+ works, then get another book. If you are looking for cookie cutter code, get another book. This book explains in good detail how COM+ (and COM and MTS for that matter) works internally. It points out many mistakes VB programmers make in working with COM+, why they are made and how to overcome them. And it is very easy to read, especially if you are moderately familiar with the topics.

After getting bitten by a large local spider she falls under the infuence ofthe marsh creatures. The Doctor needs to solve multiple problems and time is short as the marsh creatures attack the starliner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"Adventure games are the only type of computer game I am interested in, and I have played all of them I could find. This one is, without a doubt, the worst of all. Absolutely the only challenge to the game is trying to avoid falling off planks and rocks, something that becomes increasingly difficult as the game progresses. I got into the fourth world before becoming so annoyed and even angry that I quit and almost threw the thing in the trash. Not only is the game itself a flop, but my computer didn't even like it, freezing up at times in its own frustration.Another major problem with the game is that there is no way to save, so that unless you make adequate progress in a given world, you are forced to continue or else start that segment all over again in your next session.Graphics and some of the concepts are interesting, but those good points dimmed as my blood pressure rose. This is the only game I feel I totally wasted my money on."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stand to take with you","review":"I just bought my second stand like this after an old man broke my first one. They are great to take along if you are planning a ride far from home and may need a quick tune up at your campsite. I have used mine countless times, but my first one couldn't hold up to an old man who didnt know how to use it. Just don't put too much downward pressure on your bike when it is on the stand or spin the tire excessively fast. Being a portable, folding stand, stress on the hinge can cause it to break pretty quickly, like bending your elbow the direction it isn't meant to go. I was also able to fix my first one. If you have one and the plastic part of the hinge breaks, just use JB Weld and it will be good as new. Overall a great portable stand, and works flawless when used properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite flimsy....","review":"I bought this flash stand for my hard tail bike, realize that its plastic material at the bottom bracket support area is quite weak. Upon fitting it up onto my bike, I realize I can actually \\"bounce\\" my bicycle like a basketball when gently pressing down onto the saddle. Its quite difficult to fit it up, reason that its fold-able legs and top arm moves around when trying to get it up and standing. The rear wheel ground clearance wasn't very high, not good enough for me to do maintenance work on my bike as the flash stand will \\"bounce\\" when I start to pedal the bike. Very disappointed with Top Peak products, I bought both their flash stand and tune-up dx, and was very disappointed with the design....I support Top Peak a lot, I bought their cycle bags and bicycle pumps which are very good, but it seems that their bike stand wasn't!!!!! Top Peak, wake up!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"handy device but not suitable for my folding bike","review":"I bought it and thought it would be ok for my folding bikes; however on the product description page, it didnot specify what type of bikes it is tended for. But there's more detailed description on the product which type of bikes the stand is to be used. but it is for sure a handy tool for the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable enough","review":"I bought this at a local shop because I was doing brake work on my daughter's little mountain bike. To begin with, it's so tiny that it doesn't have the leverage to keep the bike elevated for long to begin with. I was using it on concrete, and it kept slipping after a few minutes, even on that rough surface. Also, the size only allows for maybe half an inch of clearance below the tire at best.Finally (and most importantly) the expandable part is made of plastic--I broke it within an hour of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a true work stand","review":"I held high hopes for the product - being that I live in a little apartment in NYC, I was looking forward to saving space. The tune-up stand is little/portable, however it was not too sturdy. The bike, while on the stand, will not withstand much torque at all. The bike fell over many times before I gave up and purchased another bigger/more sturdy stand. Forget about turning the crank, the slightest movement of the crank creates too much torque for the little stand and the bike falls over. This stand would be good for LIGHT work - possibly a light tuning of the brakes or a wipe down with a rag. Any pressure whatsoever would necessitate a bracing hand on the frame of the bike. Overall a 2/5 because it may be okay for a little person's bike or a bmx. I used it on a men's road bike size 57."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has potential, but....","review":"I cannot recommend this device for most people. This little stand, while cute and convenient to tote along in your larger tool kit, is too flimsy and unstable for anything more than very delicate work. Lube your chain carefully, or check your rear tire for debris. It even says in the included instructions \\"not to spin the tire rapidly, or apply the brakes abruptly\\". If you do it will fling itself to the ground. The stand is also rated for no more than 30lbs, so is unsafe to use on larger hybrids or mountain bikes. If only the legs opened a little wider, or they used aluminum in place of the soft plastic, I would be willing to pay more for the convenience. Even setting on a level blacktop surface, my best road bike was knocked over with a slight gust of wind. I spent more on deraileur repairs after that than the darned stand cost!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The fifth Kingdom","review":"Amazon has a reputation for selling good books.

This seems like an \\"informal\\" version of the Fillmore performance to come...the improvisation is great...it just shows how off the cuff these guys were. The sound quality?--ehh. It sounds like a straight soundboard recording, very dry. The cymbals sound harsh and brittle--to the point where it sounds like radio static. The guitars are out of tune here and there, particularly during the structured riffs. It's not so noticeable during the improvised solos, thanks to the expertise of Duane and Dickey. Most of the songs on this collection appeared on Fillmore, but here some of the songs are longer--more improvising--that's really cool.So overall--great album! The sound quality is not up to the standards of the Fillmore CDs, but for true ABB fans, this would be a great addition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allmans Live at Pre-Peak","review":"Live at Ludlows shows off the Allmans in a great informal setting at a small club around the time between their first and second albums. While not nearly as powerful as the Fillmore Concerts, this release shows off the band at a somewhat raw but growing more confident stage in their live performances. Gregg's vocals are a little hoarse, but still gritty. It's amazing how this 21 year white kid from Daytona Beach could sound like a 65 year old black bluesman.The 45 minute version of Mountain Jam which takes up the entire second CD shows what the band would soon become a year later - incredible musical interplay which show off the individual talents of the original line up. Any fan of the band for the short lived phase with Duane Allman will be pleased with this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early ABB","review":"A wonderful look at the Allmans early in their career, this show the Brothers starting to formulate their sound and direction. While the sound quality is rough because it was never intended for release, you can still find amazing versions of the classic sets. I would recommend this for all ABB fans because of the historical value. Also go to the Grateful Dead website and order the ABB concert from Feb. 1970 when they opened for the Dead. This is another HOT live CD from the early years."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Record Ever","review":"Well, at least one of the greatest. The sound quality if this album may not be perfect, but that is hardly noticeable because of the unbeleivable qualty of the music. The band is not as tight as they are on \\"at Fillmore East\\", but IMHO this is a better performance in some ways. The blues tunes on the first CD are great, and Mountain Jam, the second CD, is incredible. It is the band's jamming at their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great \\"Early\\" Allmans","review":"Live at the Ludlow Garage is a great snapshot of a band refining and developing material that eventually would comprise the bulk of their sets and the Fillmore East shows. The back story to Ludlow is the Allman Bros Band played the Garage on a Saturday night (the show recorded here) and did not have another gig until the end of the following week. They liked the Garage, the vibe in Cincinnati, and rather than drive to the next place and wait around, they proposed to play Sun-Wed for the door, the club owner getting all the concession money on nights the place would normally have been closed, admission was $1 a head (no pun intended)...Ludlow Garage was a former auto body shop, it held about 300 people, mostly sitting on the floor or in over-sized Alice in Wonderland type chairs...So the freaks in Cincinnati got to see and hear this incredible performing band as captured here...I know,I was there"},{"rating":"2","title":"A worldly Art","review":"Excellent book.

As such they have their reputation as a musical unit largely intact regardless of what may be said about some of the members individually.This disc is perfect for the casual fan such as myself. I get the hits, a few songs that probably could of been and a couple of extra bits. A concise sixteen tracks of music that is useful to have lying around for when you want to hear the pop tunes of The Police and their decidedly early 80's feeling melodies, complete with flirtations with reggae time signatures in places with Stings' beguiling vocal monotone laid over the top.Acolytes will want all the studio albums but for me this was exactly what I needed to give me the salient points of this bands career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Police Compilation Ever!","review":"Even Though This CD Is An Import From Who Knows Where, This CD Is Way Better Than \\"Every Breath You Take: The Classics\\", Because The Only Songs It's Missing Are Remixes!

Church's CD has so much variety on it, and I thoroughly enjoy his debut with another awesome Canadian Nelly Furtado. All of his songs have an amazing beat, whether they are fast, or have a slower soulful sound. He is the only one I know of that can infuse pop, r&b and soul together and do it well. He is original, and really catchy. His Jamaican roots are obvious in the CD as well. I strongly recommend \\"Shake it off\\" and I know there is more great stuff to come from Jarvis Church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive!","review":"Wow!

Initially I was pleased that my iPod's battery life was back in the 6-8 hour range but within the past month, it really took a nosedive.

The others, if you think of the time that LOTR was supposed to take place in, would not fit. Rock and third to fourth age don't go together very well. I'm not saying that anyone's wrong, it's just I think that they could have written the songs more arround the time period and about the emotions in that time. Lothlorien is meant to be a peaceful yet sort of eerie place, the music is very peaceful.

While I was reading, I was curious what will happen in the end and questioned to myself if there was a man kind like this in the World!! Yes, there was. Here he is.

Its words of wisdom are stated by an old dying man named Morrie Schwartz suffering from ALS which helps him better to understand himself and add to his prospective of living and dying in addition to his other life experiences. They boil down mainly to being more open and loving(telling more would ruin the magic of reading it). I am a living testament that the advice Morrie has to offer works like a charm for it has made me a better person to myself and around others by practicing what he says as much as a can to a certain extent. As a book it is very easy to read and understand. However what took one point of this book is its originality(thanks to Tuesday's With Morrie, which has almost the exact same theme and lessons)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful deep cleaner","review":"I hired \\"Stanley Steemer\\" to clean the carpet in one of my rooms. They did such a poor job that I decided not to let them work on the rest of the rooms. I bought the widepath, and it has already begun to pay for the almost $300 I paid for it. Not only can it remove stains, but also sucks up the dirty water quick enough that the carpet feels barely damp afterwards. The brushes do a great job of cleaning, and changing water and emptying recovery tank is very easy. Its a heavy machine (Lowes' website says it is about 13.75 lbs - that is SO wrong!), but it needs to be to dig down into the carpet and deep clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much for \\"you get what you pay for\\".....","review":"I bought this steam cleaner, which was the more expensive one, thinking that it would last at LEAST 2 years with no problems. The fourth time I used it (and I'm only using it in one room where our ferrets live), the brushes stopped spinning. After pulling it apart, I found that the one little plastic knob/stick that turns all 6 brushes had snapped off. So, I now have to replace the entire spinbrush section (for $24.00 online). Then, I found that the upper tank was leaking tons of water - it couldn't even hold the water for more than 3 minutes. After again taking it apart, I noticed a large crack in the bottom of the tank. Now, I have to replace that for $55.00. I imagine that it got cracked when I had to repeatedly try to put the tank in place - which is extremely cumbersome and tricky. I am going to replace the parts since I paid several hundred dollars for the darn thing.

I updated for the neat new features; and what a terrible surprise. The parts are extremely thin plastic that fit together poorly. Even with a new water tank, the solution runs down the back of the vacuum on the floor and inside the base of the vacuum in a few minutes. The brushes work occassionally. The water pickup is quite good if the lid is just perfectly in place. The roter brush hand tool would be great except all the water in the tank immediately makes one big puddle in the floor. This has been costly disappointment. The company has sold to Maytag; and it appears it will be discontinued. I bought this from eBay used and kept adding new parts to save my initial investment; since returning it would have cost me almost $100 shipping & restocking fees. I have now spent more than a new one costs; and have nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it was good - NOT - Should have bought Bissel","review":"Same as rest - Tank crack after 3 uses.

This thing is so poorly designed it makes Fiat look like an amazing company. Backbreaking labor in order for you to actually get it to scrub the carpet. The problem is the design which is similar to an upright vacuum. You can't actually push it however. You have to bear down and drag it in order for the brushes to make contact with the rug. Almost gave myself a hernia to accomplish half of what a pro could do. Add to that the fact that you have to empty it about every 2 minutes and you're in for some serious work. Well, you get what you pay for. Its high time Americans stopped being willing to buy junk from these companies.

Instead of elaborating on the similarities for playing pro sports and trading, it's more like a business management book emphasizing on setting achievable, strategic, measurable, controllable, flexible and positive goals of daily, weekly, monthly and yearly time span. I am not kidding. The authors did put tables of the above goals for you to fill in te blank. Though the authors also had chapters on motivation, concentration, pressure handling, routine setting, loss handling stuff but the coverage of them, in my opinion as a veteran trader and frequent trading book lover, were far from sufficient and sophisticated to help traders to turn themselves into a pro athlete and win this highly competitive game. The analogy is brilliant, but is only limited to the title. The content is not.

Although the content of the book is arguably sound, the extensive typos in this printing compromise the message to the extent that the book is virtually useless.

The other one was The Sun Also Rises, this one is definitely more interesting and enjoyable. I think he is more descriptive and sentimental.

Still, his style here is strangely anti-Hemingway-esque: too wordy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Moveable Feast","review":"My husband down loaded this for me,so this is from a female prospective. The book was for my book club. We first read the fictional rendition of Hemmingway and his first wife, Hadley,of their time in Paris, The Paris Wife and then Hemmingway's A Moveable Feast. I found Hemmingway's account slow and boring. I realize of course that The Paris Wife is fiction and A Moveable Feast is the memories of Hemmingway 40 yrs later so I recommend that if you read both you do it in a reversed order. I kept thinking that Hemmingway was leaving a lot out about his life with his first wife and getting miffed with him with being so self absorbed. Not logical but that was my experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to continue reading...","review":"I am a big fan of biographies, memoirs etc but i just found this to be a very boring, hard-to-continue-reading monologue about EH just walking around writing and drinking.

Not a fan of this book whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Version?","review":"There was a lot of static when this was re-issued. A. E. Hotchner claimed that it was a hash-up of the original and he has some authority on the matter. I've been having trouble finding an original to compare this version to. I must say, some things ring false to me. Then again, I haven't read it in years. All that aside, Hem is still Hem, and this book is one of his best.

Is it fact or fiction? To me, and others that I have spoken to, it makes a world of difference as to how I approach a book, it's characters, location, and events that take place. This book is supposed to be Hemingway's memoirs. I have no idea who is on the cover.There is a disclaimer by the publishing company that this is a work of fiction.Not to mention Hemingway's own explanation that does not make a bit of sense. \\"If the reader prefers, this book may be regarded as fiction. But there is always the chance that such a book of fiction may throw some light on what was written as fact.\\"Following that, there is a note written by M.H. that states that this book covers the years 1921-1926 in Paris.Lastly, there are nine black and white photographs of people and places that supposedly do not even exist.I became so frustrated with all of these contradictions that I did not even bother to read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting life.","review":"After reading A Paris WIfe, I enjoyed reading about the same encounters written by Hemmingway.

The 1996 version is less interesting; it also puts Hemingway's son's mother in a better light than in the 1965 version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the original edition","review":"Stick to the original edition - the text that Hemingway finished before his death, the manuscript that he - personally - gave to A.E. Hotchner to deliver to Scribners in New York. This revised edition is an insult to the novelist's memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trapse Around Paris with Hemingway!","review":"Hemingway is one of my favorite novelists. Fortunately, he is as terrific a non-fiction writer as he is a fiction writer.He shows you a Paris that was so full of life, and opportunity; You can immediately see why American writers flocked there in droves in the twenties.In this book, the writing is so good that you feel that you are drinking in the quaint Parisian bars until all hours, and that you, too, are drinking in all the sights and scenes of the most inspiring city in the world at that time.Also, from his friendship with Gertrude Stein to the guilt he felt after an adulterous affair, Hemingway holds back nothing.For two years I lived in Oak Park, IL, where Hemingway was born and raised. The community has made the house he lived in a museum honoring him, and holds a Hemingway festival. I sorely miss living there; it certainly isn't Paris back in Hemingway's time (what is?!)but it is wonderful to have a museum to such an adventurous American writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Touch \\"Moveable Feast\\" (this is a bad edition)","review":"This says it all...[...]I love this book just not this edition done by Hemingway's grandson. I just don't like when people inherit intellectual property and change it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Ernie!","review":"This is my favorite Hemmingway so far. I felt as though I had walked the streets with him... stopping off at a cafe for a quick au lait, before heading toward Shakespeare's & Company for book. This is certainly one of the best slices of time from an American ex-pat in Europe. It's earthy and interesting... plain, but rich in detail.OK, so if Hemmingway's contemporaries seem so interesting and brilliant, who are our fabulous minds? Will we not know them until we look back on their lives from their grave? Certainly it won't be these idiot celebrities that have their faces pastered on magazines. Who shall they be, my contemporary thinkers, writers, and artists?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Feast...","review":"This being the first Hemingway book I ever read, of course I'm partial to it. I fell in love with Hemingway after reading the first word of the book. His descriptions of things, and the way he pours what he knows into the paragraphs of this book are amazing. I remember reading the chapter Scott Fitzgerald, and having a perfect picture of Fitzgerald in my mind through Hem's description of him; then getting to the next chapter and seeing the picture of Scott Fitzgerald and having to take a moment to breath, because it was the perfect image I had of him. These are the things that make Hemingway unique, the way he brings out the details of his characters. I fell in love with every word of this book, and I feel extremely lucky to have recieved it from my grandfather to read. It's a beautiful book. Read it and savor it. Afterall, it's Hemingway, and Hemingway is a feast for a reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Insight into Ernest","review":"This book was read after A Paris Wife and fit with it perfectly. I loved the chapter on Hemmingway's trip with Scott Fitgerald. The scene in the hotel dealing with a hunt for a thermometer is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moveable Feast , an old but original version. Quick delivery.","review":"Thank you for the Quick delivery. It's an original edition so the copy is aged but no marks on pages. The book is still a pleasure to read. Beware that the published version post 1993 has been edited by outraged family members and is not the original MF by Hemingway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A feast indeed!","review":"This book itself is a moveable feast. It's honest, yet not depressing. It makes you believe in youth, love, and happiness. But it also breaks your heart to know that Hemingway stopped believing in those things."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"So many good things have been said of this book and I can add nothing more. Anybody wanting to understand Hemingway and disciplined writing should read or reread this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Moveable Feast: The Restored Edition","review":"I found this book, More interesting with the Restorations.

Fasinating, as from both points of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"REMOVEABLE FEAST","review":"Patrick Hemingway who holds the rights to this book has butchered the original which was meticulously compiled and edited by Hemingway's last wife, Mary Hemingway.Patrick (whom I met in Key West once at The Hemingway Days in the 1980's) has done his father a disservice by eliminating and re-writing parts of this book. I am thrilled to own a first edition of this book as it was intended in the early 60's shortly after Ernest's suicide.It seems this is a kind of Freudian attempt to slap his father in the face and capitalize on his memory. Shame on you Patrick. Write your own book.Both Charles Scribners and Maxwell Perkins, had they been alive, would have forbidden this manuscript being re-tooled in this manner.

The book is beautifully written; unpretentious and easy to read. Always a favorite of mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy Kindle Edition of this Book!","review":"The Kindle edition of this great book is not worth a dime: almost ALL the illustrations are missing, at least in my copy, and the 2 that do appear, are hazy and smudgy, like poorly done mimeographed copies. Some chapter titles are mis-formatted: the two-sided text justification format is applied to the titles, resulting in ridiculous text placement. It is a shabby treatment of a great book. I do not believe I need to add anything to the many positive reviews of this immensely readable and enjoyable volume of (partly fictionalized) memoirs from Hemingway. But spend just a bit more and get the print edition, paper or hardback, of this work, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"read sun also rises","review":"Guess what? A lot of people really like Hemingway. There are those who have never studied or even read another great author of the 20th century who has read Hem. This book was published after his death and I wonder if this wasn't something he wrote for his own kind of fun to attack and belittle everyone he knew in those years. Almost a practice writing exercise with malicious intent: read it carefully, F. Scott is famously viscously trashed but so is every single person he meets. My feeling is that if he was in his right mind - if you were to read anything about his last years he was in very bad shape - he would have destroyed this before he killed himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Movable Feast-The Restored Version","review":"Another walk through Paris with Hemingway! This time taking on the role of writer and the problems associted with writing,earning a living and finding his genre, his strengths and weaknesses.

You can of see this, Hem would never have published some of these stories if he was alive and kicking - at least he would have edited them heavily. Still it is an amazing book filled with beautiful memories of a fantastic city when it was both good and affordable. Today Paris is still a good city, but it's hardly affordable.

Here is the early Hemingway who writes the things we love to read; simple and not self-conscious, describing with purity and exactitude. How he recaptured the truth and honest ambiguity of those early days, so late in his creative life, is nothing short of a miracle in prose writing. The famous and fallible Hemingway makes appearances, to be sure, but please ignore the very few petty bits for the sake of the glorious everyday honesty you will find in places here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, Charming, Charming.","review":"I was never a big Hemingway fan until I read 'The Sun Also Rises' for the second time in my thirties and was able to appreciate it. This book allows you to feel what he felt and live what he lived in Paris in his day. My heart nearly broke for him at the very end, because of the loveliness of his relationship with his first wife, Hadley. The ordinariness of their relationship, and the transcendence, are hard to hear in their simple truth.Hemingway says, \\"When I saw my wife again standing by the tracks as the train came in by the piled logs at the station, I wished I had died before I ever loved anyone but her.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"If you snored through \\"Old Man and the Sea\\" in school, read","review":"this anyway. It's wonderful,poignant,gossipy, and a must for anyone who fantasizes about Paris in the 1920's. It is a fast read, and very revealing about what was going on in Hemingway's head before he died. His goal as a young writer was to write just one true sentence a day, and in this fascinating book, he achieved much more than that. I take back all the rude things I ever said about him as a writer, and maybe I'll go back and have another look at some of his other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful memoirs","review":"Really enjoyed this personal bit of writing from Enerst's time in Paris.

I have used zout for a long time now, I have lent my bottle to others to try and it always works. I had a friend try everything to get a stain out of the upholstery in their car and nothing worked til they borrowed my zout.

Probably the biggest CD release by Vanessa, the album has gone on to sell over three million copies in the U.S. alone, and the album garnered her five Grammy Award nominations, including Record and Song of the Year for the CD's breakout song \\"Save The Best For Last\\". That song also held on to the #1 position on the Billboard Pop Charts for an amazing five week reign.

At first glance he seems kinda gimmicky in that precious, indie kinda way, but once I actually listened to Devendra Banhart...well his music is really amazing. His lyrics are sometimes playful, sometimes sad and always surreal, and his voice is one of a kind. The songs are simple, short and mostly recorded solo with acoustic guitar, though electric guitar, percussion and the occasional understated horn or string is thrown into the mix perfectly. Devendra Banhart released another album, Nino Rojo, within a few months of this one. Both albums are very similar in sound and style (they come from the same recording session) and both have a uniform good-to-great song quality.

This is a good thing, because I believe Marc as well as Devendra to be a musical genius... So if you're a fan of Marc Bolan's, you'll enjoy his music as well... Also, I believe that fans of old style acoustic blues will enjoy it as well, seeing as he incorporates old style acoustic blues into his playing, with modernistic touches... As well as anti-folk fans will enjoy...So all in all, if you're a fan of anti-folk, old style acoustic blues or Marc Bolan solo acoustic music, I highly recommend you to pick up this cd and rejoice in his music - Savannah Skye aka DJ Dakini-NYC..."},{"rating":"2","title":"a meadow in summer.","review":"if you are at all familiar with karen dalton (you should be if not, b/c she's amazing), you will draw comparisons to devendra with her. i find that this album really reminds me of a mixture of karen, vashti bunyan, and a dash of jack white. it's a summer album, hell, it's an all-year-round album, but when i listen to this, i feel like chewing on the end of a long, sun-dried weed while walking barefoot at sundown in late august in my original northern wisconsin digs. that is this album. and all affectedness aside, devendra's voice is just plain gritty and lovely and wonderful, along with his original song-writing and musicianship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Republished !!","review":"I am so glad to see this book back in print.

Once it begins to play, it has many glitches...like an old LP that skips over and over.

Anatomy, sculpture, mold-making, firing and decoration techniques apply not only to dollmaking, but to any similar sculpture, moldmaking and casting endeavour.Patterns and instructions are included for doll clothes and creation of marionettes, as well as supplier listings. However, these suppliers are in Germany, so they may only be of limited use for those of us in other countries. The book is translated from German, but the translation is nearly flawless and is written in easy to understand verbage.I highly recommend this book to the experienced dollmaker, sculptor or ceramic artist who is interested in making the leap to creation of originals for porcelain reproduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product and non-existing support","review":"I took quite some fiddling to get the device to install properly on my XP system.

A previous reviewer had made the same purchase for the same purpose. The card works well with my laptop, and has drastically reduced sync times on the iPhone (from 5 hrs to less than 1 hr). After the phone syncs once, iTunes seems to stop recognizing the phone as a device, and I usually have to disconnect and reconnect the phone, or reboot the computer and reconnect the phone if I want to sync again. This may have something to do with the iPhone needing power, and the IOgear card not being a powered device. However, given the reduction in sync times, I don't consider this a major inconvenience."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading and flawed","review":"After tinkering around with this product and trying almost everything recommended by tech support, it still does not perform at USB 2 speeds.

Also, no where on this website does it mention an external power supply you might need, the only place it is mentioned is in small print on the installation manual.

I would venture to say that almost all of the one-star ratings out there have working cards. When using this, or any other USB 2.0 cardbus you have to pay attention to the current draw of the devices you are plugging into it. High power devices require the use of the auxilliary power cable (the little circle plug in between the USB ports) to work properly. If you connect a high power device to this card and don't have the aux power cable attached, you will see erradic behavior ranging from 'Windows can't detect the device' to 'Windows lists the device in My Computer but gives error messages when attempting to transfer files or complete normal operations.' Results can even be intermittent if the current draw is close to the cardbus's current output threshhold.

The big single released off this album, \\"She Wants to Move,\\" is just terrible, and the rest of the album is downright corny. There is one good hidden track attached to the end of \\"Chariot of Fire,\\" but it falls far short of justifying the rest of the CD.

But this is still a great album and shows that the Neptunes are more than hitmakers. They have broad musical imaginations as well. The highlight of the album has got to be \\"Maybe\\". The drum cadence, provided by Questlove of the Roots, and the addictive guitar licks, by Lenny Kravitz, add to a simple yet hypnotic groove that the album should have followed. I think the next album will be their zenith, but until then Fly Or Die is a record to grow on you. One last question though....what the hell does Shay do?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something totally different but just as great!","review":"This album is not much like first at all but it's just as addictive in a completely different way.

This album is less hip hop and more rock than the first but you can still tell it's NERD. If you're a NERD fan you know you're gonna get this album.

The album is different from their debut, as Spymob is not providing the live instrumentation, yet merits props for trying something new. Like In Search Of...

Only problem is, they forgot what they were good at: experimentation in the pop realm.There really is nothing good about this. This isn't rock, it's just noise. Song structure, focus, harmony ... all MIA.I can only assume people want to feel cool to like N.E.R.D., so they recommend this.

In Search of... was N.E.R.D first album, it was on the alternative tip, but had an hip hop edge. Neptunes album was straight up hip hop. This new album is all alternative.

Something went toattally Wrong on this CD, and there lyrics arent felt.. and the beats sure arent the same. This sounds more like a BAD jAZZ album. I was hoping for better"},{"rating":"2","title":"TiGhT CD","review":"Fly or Die wasn't exactly what I expected but really good! The songs are hot and so is Pharrell! This cd is definately worth buying! I Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok&that's Being Kind","review":"Chad&Pharell have had there say on the Chart&whatnot for some time now&on this Album like with alot of there stuff things begin to way down.they have Talent but they are wearing out there Musical Welcome.nothing happeing as far as Lyrics&the vocals&flow are not working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beats?","review":"I'm not totally familiar with NERD. I bought the \\"in search of\\" album but the only tracks I listened to were \\"lap dance\\" and \\"rock star.\\" Anyway, I listened to this and this CD was all mellow crap IMO. Ya, it'd be good music to have playing while you're doing something else maybe, as some background sounds. But as far as rap or rock go, it's just way too mellow. I tried to listen to it expecting good but it just wasn't good. Maybe my mom would like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"They would never give these songs to their top 40 artists","review":"I just can't listen to this and not think of how good their first album was. The biggest thing this album is missing is rapping (that third guy goes unnoticed the whole album). While I completely respect when rap artists are experimental or do more singinf (Cee Lo Green, Andre 3000,) it does not work here. The greatest part about the first album was their backing band Spymob, which gave the album a great live feel. Williams and Hugo play on every track, but it lacks the same intensity and ingenuity of the first album.This entire album seems to be N.E.R.D., specifically Williams, trying to compete with Kanye West. And just to prove how non-rap this album is, there is a cameo by Good Charlotte's Madden brothers.I am a huge NERD fan and was really excited for this album to come out. I would have given it 1 star, but \\"Breakout\\" and \\"Wonderful Place\\" are pretty solid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Charlotte !?!?!","review":"OK, the Neptunes are possibly the best hip hop / pop producers out there, so why are they making a rock album? This is trash. Pharrell, if you are reading this, stick to rap and pop, what are you thinking doing a collaboration with GOOD CHARLOTTE?! This album is ridiculous. Neptunes stick to producing hot rap and pop beats, and cut out this crappy rock stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time To Rock Out","review":"N*E*R*D succeeds in their goal to mix rock with hip-hop, and makes one of the years most original albums. The outrageous dance track \\"She Wants To Move\\" is pure adrenaline, while \\"Wondeful Place\\" accomplishes to soften the mood of the record. I can still see plenty of room for growth from the N*E*R*D crew, but this is a fine effort. \\"Maybe\\", which features Lenny Kravitz, is my favorite song from the album. If your into either hip-hop or rock, this is your album."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is dope","review":"Crossing rock and roll with the best hip hop production this decade certainly isn't easy, but N.E.R.D have dropped fire on this release.At first listen, it sounds a little shallow, a little too experimental. By the 3rd or 4th listen you start to realise how good this release really is. Basically, it's the best across genre's release in a while. standouts include:Drill Sergeant - 5/5Thrasher - 5/5Fly or Die - 5/5Jump - 5/5the rest are solid, at least 3 out of 5 each. Don't buy this if your expecting pharell to be singing or rapping over his usual hip hop beats that he churns out for jay-z and co. Buy this album because it proves Pharell's musical genius, as it is pushing boundaries and delivering great music at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"N.E.R.D. - Fly or Die","review":"The first time I heard the album, I didn't think it came anywhere close to In Search Of... but after listening to it over and over again, I now love it! It is definetly an album that grows on you, so don't dismiss it straight away.My favourite songs are Chariot of Fire, Break out and of course the hit single, She wants to Move.There are also 3 hidden tracks, 1 after Wonderful Place, 1 after Drill Sergeant and 1 quite a while after Chariot of Fire.Well done Chad, Shae and Pharrell!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tunes are very catchy, but the lyrics make this one sink","review":"There's no disputing that NERD's Fly or Die has catchy tunes. However, the lyrics are not very mature and really takes away from the songs at times. Or it may just be that this music is geared towards younger listeners because I found myself shaking my head several times. At least the lyrics should make sense sometimes. As far as the music goes, as I said earlier, it's really catchy. You'll be bopping your head to most of them. My favorites were \\"She wants to move\\", \\"Fly or Die\\" and \\"Jump\\". The songs have a very gloomy outlook on life. So, don't expect to be livened up by them. Most of the songs sound good and my only problem is with the lyrics. This one is much better than their first effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but it has some weak points","review":"'She wants to move' was obviously a track only made for promotion. Just like with 'In Search of...' the tracks which video's were made of, don't reflect the total feel and sound of the entire album. 'She wants to move' is one of the weakest tracks on the album (at least, that's what I think), while the calmer tracks like 'Wonderful Place' really are wonderful. The more uptempo tracks are variable in quality. The first 5 tracks are the worst of the album (except Jump, which is actually pretty good). After 'She wants to move' the quality is top notch and you won't skip a track. Overall, I think it's a great album, but because of a couple tracks which are weaker, the album scores 4 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"aah! its awesome!","review":"omg! this cd is so great! I knew it would be NERD can never fail! I get excited everytime I listen to it! It hasn't left my cd player since I bought it! SO as soon as you get a chance buy this cd!! I'm serious! It is well worth it's price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now where is the new Clipse cd at!","review":"This cd flat out kicks ass, the beats and mixing is bad ass and the neptunes are geniouses or something like that. I dont mind Pherrel taking time to make sure his cd comes out, but what about The Clipse? I been antixipating that cd since i fisrt heard Lord Willin'. personally i think there could have been at least one collaberation with the clipse on this cd, or at least Fam-lay, the other rapper on the record lable thats suppost to have a cd drop LOL. all in all, this cd is a great cd for all them neptunes, and n*e*r*d fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"if ya don't wanna give it up, don't worry bout it\\"","review":"This album made me a bigger fan of N.E.R.D. 'Fly or Die' has a much more of a rock vibe than 'In Search Of' but you can still see the same hot synchopated rhythms that N.E.R.D. always produces. There is no rap on this album but it's still a kick ass record that i recommend to anyone and everyone. Track 8 \\"Drill Sergeant\\" really has a beatles type sound to it which i really dug. \\"Thrasher\\" has a heavy beat to it that can easily get a club goin'. My favorite joint on 'Fly or Die' has to be \\"Breakout\\" because the drums and guitar along with pharrell's voice just goes great together. Cop this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this garbage","review":"I love the neptunes, but this cd [***]. Compared to there last cd's huge hits Lap dance and Rock Star, it takes not just one step back, but prolly 10. I don't think i have ever been as disappointed in a cd as this. I have been looking forward to this for over a year and it has already been sold back after purchasing it yesterday! The best song is definately She wants to move. Im hoping this is a joke and they are gonna release the real new cd shortly! Thats wishful thinking though. Might as well just download the hit single and maybe number 1 on the album and save yourself the money on paying for the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"I just bought the new N.E.R.D album and was greatly disappointed. There are only about two songs on the whole album that are half-way decent. This might be one of those albums that you have to listen to a few times before you enjoy, but I'm not going to waste my time -- in the mean time, I have to figure out a way to return this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"this album was horrible. the only good songs on it were fly or die and she wants to move. if u ever needed a reason to burn a cd this is it. i'll be crushing this fly or die cd i wasted my money on now."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO, NO, NO","review":"What the #@&% is this garbage?

So big deal hes good looking and plays instruments but the music they produce is so cliche and every song sounds like the next. Pharrell cant sing and shouldnt sing. At leased give Chad Hugo some of the spotlight too for your lame production team. One hit sounds like the other so of course theyre popular. I cant stand these guys alonig with overrated Kanye West. CRAPOLLA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is everyone taking crazy pills 'cept me?","review":"It is really sad when reputation makes up for horrible sounding music. Regardless of what great success the Neptunes have come across in the past, this confusing and ridiculous album shouldn't be getting any radio play or good press. I commend the guys for trying to do something original, but their effort was simply a good try. Some of the grooves on here have glimpses of subtle coolness, but Pharrell's voice and songwriting can distract. Lyrics such as, \\"Her A@$ is a spaceship I wanna ridddeee\\" (on single She Wants To Move) made me laugh out loud. Even with the lyrics being so corny, I recognize skills. The beats on \\"Breakout\\" and \\"Thrasher\\" are pretty dope. 2 cool songs out of 12 songs is not out of the ordinary in this day and age. The collabo with makeup artists Good Charlotte is silly. For any proof listen to the DFA remix of \\"She Wants To Move.\\" It is so many times more interesting than the N.E.R.D. original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good flow to this album","review":"Not as good as In Search Of...but much improved flow and has a consistently good vibe."},{"rating":"1","title":"certainly not \\"Lords of All the World\\"","review":"after reading Pagden's \\"Lords of All the World\\" this book sounded like a good idea. but after reading this book, it seems strange that the same person could have written them both. where the former was articulate and interesting, this book goes through a narrative that blends myth, history, and politics and ends up not doing justice to the blend or the parts. i read this book in a reading group along with several others- most of who had read \\"Lords...\\", and no one found much to like about it. if your goal is to compress european imperialism into a very short form, perhaps for an undergraduate or high school course, then it might work for you, so long as you make sure to comment on the strange discrepancies Pagden gives rise to. if you're looking to increase your understanding of the subject, however, read something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Gem","review":"I just finished Pagden's little gem. Tired of the neo-con's oversimplification and the post-modern's blather? Treat yourself to an 180 page antidote. His coverage of such a vast field is beautifully conceived and his his prose is a joy. He is justly critical of the way the West violated its core values and its own best instincts along with the rights of the people it dominated during the colonial era. But he is much more interested in analysis than judgment - a virtue fast becoming extinct in today's \\"academy\\".Pagden is one of a vanishing breed, a serious scholar who knows that truth and fairness are the key virtues of the historian.His critique of Islamic reactionaries in the Epilogue is worth the price for the book. Clearly stated, immanently fair, and devastatingly true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I was very disappointed in the taste of this item. Not at all what I expected from Splenda. It is much too overpowering, strong and when added to your beverage, that is all you can taste.

A different line-up and a different attitude. This was the first disc, and probably the most raw. You can tell that it was recorded in someone's house by a bunch of talented but young musicians. If you like DBT, I would recommend it, for sure.

Not that Ganstabilly is not excellent; it is. Just different from the other three. A bit more country, a little less rock n roll is the best I can describe it. If you are a fan of of any of the other three I mentioned, check this out too. You can see where the band came from and where they were going.BTW, the threesome of SRO, DS, and DD is one of the best 3-album streaks ever put together.

Eventually the screen would go out altogether, leaving me with a wonderful 32 inch flat-screen \\"radio\\".

After their solid debut on \\"Definitely Maybe\\", the band uncorked one of the best albums of the last twenty years with \\"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\\", which has been fittingly described as a pop-rock gem. Oasis takes all of their influences, from the Beatles, Rolling Stones, et al., and runs with them. Sadly, Oasis' hubris turned against them; they began delving into a destructive cycle of unrestrained indulgence and personnel changes, the effect of which is sadly chronicled in their subsequent releases. They may have peaked too early, but few bands have ever peaked as high as Oasis did with \\"Morning Glory\\". It's a shame it didn't last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Look Back in Anger","review":"Oasis was and remains an easy target for critics and cynics.

Oasis's sounds are almost like your listening to an up to date version of the beatles [whom they are greatly influenced by].

Now I will admit that I am not the biggest Oasis fan but this is a great album. They aren't sell-outs (thank God)! They are a band that's not in it just for the money but for the music and the fans.

My personal fav. is \\"CHAMAGNE SUPERNOVA\\" only because this is the song that got me in to Oasis. \\"DON'T LOOD BACK IN ANGER\\" is a great song too, the use of the piano was amazing and the tiny hint of John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" in the beginning is cool.

Don't buy it, simply buy \\"Definitely Maybe\\", their first commercial album and their greatest, or take a look to Blur o Radiohead instead. I save only \\"don't look back in anger\\", the reason of the second star"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite albums","review":"Close to perfect....what an album. I know every other review has said the same, but there really isn't a bad song on it. Even the \\"bad\\" ones are still pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite tunes...","review":"1995-1996 were the two years in which the rock band, Oasis scaled to the top of the world, both musically and culturally, carving an impression that remains today. They were into good times, were belligerent, total rock stars. And for once, they had the tunes to back them.This album is packed with hit songs- Roll With It, Wonderwall, Don't Look Back in Anger, Some Might Say, Morning Glory and Champagne Supernova- all released as singles around the world- all successful, all completely and utterly majestic. It was Oasis's peak, and they would never get this high again.A milestone in 1990's rock music, any way you look at it. In fact, don't look at it. Just listen to it, and cast your mind away to better times....PS- if you have an acoustic guitar, you'll be strumming these songs in no time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The second chapter in Oasis history","review":"\\"What's the Story...\\" is definitely one of Oasis' best albums. It is an incredible rock record, with loud guitars and powerful vocals. There is not a bad song on this entire album. Songs are sung by the Brothers Gallagher, Liam and Noel, who with their snappy Brit accents, deliver music which is unique and fresh. So many times their music has unjustly been compared to the Beatles. Oasis stands on their own, and this album proves it. Favorites include the ballad-ish \\"Wonderwall\\", along with the rockin' \\"What's the Story (Morning Glory)\\", and the ever anthem \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\". However, lesser none songs such as \\"She's electric\\", \\"Hello\\", and \\"Champagne Supernova\\" all help to define the undeniable Oasis sound. Culminating Brit Pop Rock, with genuinely GOOD songs, Oasis creates a classic with \\"What's the Story?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"A great album. One of the best albums of all time. However, the antics of the Gallagher brothers prevent me from saying one of the best groups of all time. They are both arrogant jerks who frequently don't finish a concert because of internal bickering which in my book doesn't rate you \\"rock and roll\\" but unprofessional. Luckily, for them, their music is very good but people and fans will grow tired of the \\"act\\". Until then, enjoy the ride while you can boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums ever.","review":"All you need to do is listen to this album and realise how great it is.Its sheer brilliance, it also shows that rock can have proper tune while making a loud noise also.While Oasis for a while lost it a bit with their two following albums, many songs off Heathen Chemistry (their 5th album) prove that they have still got what it takes, and without question Oasis WILL return to form and blow away all this rubbish music thats cluttering up the place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cant go wrong.","review":"Had this album forever.

And yet, this album is not too bad, you just have to look past all the bad stuff. Songs like \\"Wonderwall\\", \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\", and \\"Champaign Supernova\\" make for good background music, but nothing else. The rest is insubstantial, second rate pop music without point. Why Oasis are called the kings of Britpop is beyond my understanding, they have done nothing. Speaking of stealing from a better source, has anybody noticed the striking similarity between \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" and John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\"? An album with no meaning and no point, Oasis are a lego-like figure of what a proper band should be. Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"!","review":"Look I'm not gonna dwell on this for very long.

I've listened to a great deal of music from Gershwin to the Beatles, from Fleetwood Mac to Crowded House, so I have a pretty good idea about what good music is. These guys don't make it. \\"Wonderwall\\" is by far one of the worst (and overplayed) singles of this decade. Any comparisons to the Beatles, made by themselves or others, is an insult to pop music. Unless you're really keen on establishing this band as \\"a band you grew up with,\\" don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"a cloned band","review":"it's one thing to influenced by someone it's another to ride on there coattails.Oasis just takes a plenty from the Beatles.they may play there own instruments but a Puffy Daddy is a Puffy Daddy.meaning come up with something Original and your own.the vocals and the music arrangements are riding all on the Lennon&Mccartney pen &riffs.they are way to cocky as well.at best they are a 2nd tier band."},{"rating":"1","title":"uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..........","review":"This is nonsense from beginning to end. Hey Noel, how 'bout some lyrics that make some sense for a change mate! Once again, these guys are over rated and I hope failure comes to them soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Albums of the Decade","review":"With the coming end of the 90's (as well as the century), (What's The Story) Morning Glory? will justifiably be showing up on everyone's list as one of the best rock'n roll albums of the decade, if not ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Incredible sophomore effort from Oasis. Don't listen to the fanatical \\"Anti-Oasis because the Beatles are better and my s*** doesn't stink\\" dopes. This is a solid effort from a band who loves the Beatles, lifts some of their lyrics, but creates their OWN sound. Not 5 stars because the lyrics are a little goofy in places and I find a lull in certain parts of the CD where the energy just sounds drained.However: Champagne Supernova, Wonderwall, Don't Look Back in Anger, Morning Glory. With songs like these, who needs to say any more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent album.","review":"Like most other Oasis album, this one is also good.Songs like 'SOME MIGHT SAY','WONDERWALL','CAST NO SHADOW' are all very listenable,but the best is the title track.'DONT LOOK BACK IN ANGER' is also quite good. Quite a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"This band is a joke","review":"This is an overrated cd from one of the worst bands of the nineties. Lifeless, cloying, unoriginal, and dumb. Quite possibly the worst cd I've ever heard other than Alvin and the Chipmunks."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD ONE!!!!","review":"Man, it's really hard to argue with the posture of the Gallacher brothers...All that talk about being the BEST band of the world or being at the same level of the BEATLES?!? Also, oasis live shows TOTALLY SUCKS!!!! liam stands blank and static without ANY interaction with the crowd and the band is as static, without any emotion...Plus, i think they were the most OVERRATED band of all time!!!!Come on, even BLUR and BUSH were way way better than OASIS...But, what's the story is a good collection of songs...All the songs are really inspired...after this album, they TOTALLY lose their way and start to record really uninspired records!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be 5 and a half","review":"Their best album in my opinion. It's a very interesting work too. They almost imitate Beatles and other bands but still they are original, outstanding and the songs are just undescribable. Don't lose your time trying to understand the meaning of the lyrics though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only 5 stars because I couldn't choose 500","review":"Can the word PERFECT be used to describe this cd? Absolutely. Oasis have been, at one point, called the biggest band in the world. I say they are and always have been the BEST, and this album proves it. (What's The Story) Morning Glory is the standard by which rock n' roll excellence is measured. This album revolutionized the rock genre with classic songs performed by a classic band. Liam Gallagher's one in a million voice soars over big brother Noel's musical genius. Wonderwall, Champagne Supernova, and Don't Look Back in Anger are three of the greatest songs of all time ever, let alone this album. But don't discount the rest of the album. Sleeper hits including Hey Now, Some Might Say, and the title track (What's The Story) Morning Glory, (I'm already singing along in my head) turn this album from an ok disc with great singles into simply the greatest album I have, or ever will listen to. Pure Genius. Pure Rock n' Roll. Pure Oasis."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album changed my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I can not think of a single album that changed my perspective on music as much as this one did.oasis manages to capture everyday emotions through their brilliant lyrics and interesting melodies.my favorite song is wonderwall.second favorite, some might say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel Good Rock Tunes","review":"When I originally bought this CD back in 95, I found myself just playing the hits (Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger, Morning Glory, and Champagne Supernova), and skiping over the songs I didn't know. Maybe I just didn't have much time, and decided to only listen to the songs I KNEW I liked. I really don't remember.But I finally gave this CD a real listen a few months ago, and damn, it is good. This is sing-a-long, feel good rock and roll, with an old time British Rock sound....but harder. \\"Hello\\" is great way to open the CD, and I love the way \\"Some Might Say\\" begins. Great Guitars! My favorite songs on the album are probably \\"Some Might Say\\" and \\"Morning Glory\\", but I pretty much think whatever song I'm listening to at the time is my favorite! I could probably do without \\"Cast No Shadow\\" and \\"She's Electric\\", but overall, this is a solid CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get musch better than this","review":"All the songs are catchy and on this album you are guaranteed pleasure from start to finish. Fist song is 'hello' which is simple pop/rock song, then comes roll with it which is kind of annoying and my least favourtie song on the album.Wonderwall and don't look back in anger are the two most famous oasis tunes in the uk and are with out a doubt the two best britpop songs. Hey now is a great song with a wonderful guitar towards the end and maybe my favourite song. Some might say is a powerful, fast and catchy song but then next comes the brilliant cast no shadow which could have been a #1 single if they released it this song is a masterpiece.She's electric is a simple pop song and morning glory is rocker which gives the album a great mix. Then champagne supernova is one of the best songs ever but too long, then again this song ends the album nicely.This album is worth buying it is what music is missing today."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album Ever Made","review":"When I bought this album, I listened to it straight through two times in a row and I was instantly hooked. This album is perfect, literally perfect.For those who want to rock, turn up \\"Hello\\", \\"Roll With It\\", and \\"What's The Story Morning Glory.\\"For those who want to mellow out, Oasis serves up four classics, \\"Wonderwall\\", \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\", \\"Cast No Shadow\\", and \\"Champaign Supernova.\\"Throw in the amazing \\"Some Might Say\\" and you have a complete and flawless album. This album defined the 90's and brought the greatness of Britpop over the pond.Oasis-more than hype, more than attitude. The greatest rock and roll band on Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Some Might Say\\" this is their best album.","review":"\\"Oasis\\" seemed to be kind of a \\"Beatles\\" of the 90's, or so they thought anyway. Though I don't think that was the case, this is indeed an excellent album, and I suspect it will always be their best. Many would say they were britpop at it's best, just not \\"Blur\\" fans. This does include a few of their biggest hits, like \\"Wonderwall\\", \\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\", and the great closer \\"Champagne Supernova\\". And while those songs do stand out, the rest are nearly as good. \\"Hey Now\\" and \\"Cast No Shadow\\" I really like also. Front to back it's their best, and actually is one of the better albums of the decade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anyone say \\"talent\\"?","review":"These guys are really bad. The lyrics are bad; the music is recycled and watered-down Beatles. Enough marketing, and anyone can be a big star...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oasis? I'd rather die in a desert!","review":"What a load of unimaginative pap. Nothing new here boring rythmns and predictable choruses and bad harmonies - file this one under easy listening 'cos these Manchester boys are straight out of 'unimagination corner'. If it's an oasis you're after you have two options...either buy an 'oasis' bottled refreshing still fruit drink or visit your nearest sahara."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sentimental & Depressing","review":"Was having a tough day when ordering this. Music from teenage years. These were songs I liked back in the day. However, compared to most of the other music I have or listen to, Oasis is a downer. If I can get past the depressing quality of the music, it's fine.I suggest find something less depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Needed More...","review":"If one were to choose the best Oasis album thus far, I suppose this would be it. Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger, and Champagne Supernova are quite good, but there really isn't anything else on this album worth paying money for. Since Morning Glory is fairly old, chances are you've already heard the good songs played dozens of times on the radio...from there, you can do the math."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT The Beatles!","review":"What's with all these comparisons to The Beatles? Both bands are of British origin, but that is where any similarity ends. The Beatles' style included harmony & background vocals, as well as a polished sound. Oasis features only lead vocals with no harmonizing or background vocals, and seems to be going for a raunchier sound. Catchy tunes, but The Beatles? NOT EVEN CLOSE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Champagne Supercrap In the Sky","review":"This album is dated. The musicianship is mediocre at best. They can't pull it off live. You'll be more proud of the Bay City Roller albums in your collection than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"gross how can anyone listen to this crap?","review":"here's what i want all oasis fans to do:1) go get a pencil/pen and a piece of paper.2) now, write down oasis lyrics as you hear them.3) read the written lyrics out loud.unless ur totally stupid, you would notice that the lyrics suck unlike anything u've ever heard.they get 2 stars from me cuz the guitar's alrite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeless","review":"It is hopeless to keep searching for a good song by Oasis. I have to announce that I'm tired of listening to the same bad-fake-beatlelike-sound. I do not recommend this cd to anyone. Looking for good rock of the 90's, listen to Pearl Jam, Alice, Pilots and Peppers. More soft stuff listen to REM and Hottie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassingly bad","review":"Wow, does anyone actually listen to this garbage? To say overrated would be too kind...this album should be on the $1 discount shelf, and even then I wouldnt buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"DIS CD MAKES ME OASICK","review":"Dang Sun, I think that Oasis needs to stop playing and pursue a profession that they may actually have an inkling of an affinity for. That's right! I, Jeff Wilke, hate Oasis and shee yo. Peese out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it wasnt all that great in my opinion","review":"The music in this cd was repetative and boring. Maybe its just Oasis as a whole, but im not sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Wonderwall\\" is Wonderful!","review":"I love the song \\"Wonderwall.\\" Finally, a rock song that succeeds at being romantic! It's touching and poignant and I think it's some of Oasis's best work. The rest of the CD is great, too. Oasis is definitly a band to watch. The lyrics were catchy and I could picture a guy feeling that way. Very good work on the part of Oasis."},{"rating":"1","title":"British doesn't make it good","review":"Guitars and drums drone on on this album with little sense of rhythm or definite melody. Oasis are clearly ambitious artists, as they laquer synthesizers and orchestras on top of endless layers of guitars. Instead of a wall of sound, however, we get an album that sounds like mud and makes me question whether my speakers are broken. They aren't, but my taste was when I purchased this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This has to be one of the best CDs I've ever heard. The melodies are great, and Liam's voice is more singing than sneering, unlike Definitely Maybe. Champagne Supernova is a stroke of genius, although maybe a little long, and Morning Glory always gets me going. This CD makes Oasis one of the best bands of the '90s. In an age of street punks rapping about \\"da hood\\" and teen girls going crazy over 18 year olds who can't sing or write songs, it's good to know that at least one band is dedicated to true rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED..............Defintely maybe","review":"There first album is first rate and I was hooked.I became an Oasis junkie.Morning Glory is way overrated \\"morning glory\\" and \\"dont look back in anger\\" are the best songs on this album. This album is not supersonic. Is that blur i hear?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glorious Morning","review":"There is no question that WTS(MG)? is one of the best rock albums of the '90s. Noel Gallagher only begins to shine with his clever lyricism and irresistable melodies. Wonderwall, Champagne Supernova, and Hello are unquestionably rock anthems; however, do not forget the subtle delights, Cast No Shadow and She's Electric (in my opinion the closest they have ever come to Beatlesqueness). WTS(MG)? is a balanced set of infectious pure rock. Original or not, the Gallaghers produce sublime songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whats the Story Morning Glory?","review":"The story is a great CD. The songs transcend a genre, capable of reaching out to all kinds of music lovers. Dont bother deciphering the meaning of the lyrics. Just listen to the flow: It will draw you in. Three phenomenal songs build the foundation upon which this great album was built, dont judge the band until you've heard em': 3. Wonderwall, 4. Dont Look Back in Anger, and 12. Champagne Supernova. The only thing that left me wondering was how Oasis was able to attract such a legendary peice of Rock History(Jay Maas) to lend his Bass talents to Untitled track 6, and a two other supporting rolls in track 3,and 8."},{"rating":"2","title":"My rating is 10 stars...","review":"This cd is beyond words... I cannot express how beautiful and meaningful it is, for the english language cannot do it justice...

It is amazing, brilliant, and beautiful..."},{"rating":"2","title":"post pscyedelic Beatles","review":"If Lennon & McCartney had entered the studio in the mid-sixties with the technology of the late-90's, we would not have had to wait this long for the sound of Oasis!

Loud Rock n' Roll Tunes like Morning Glory, Champagne Supernova, Some Might Say. And also mellower ballads like Wonderwall, Don't Look Back in Anger.

It's a great album and your CD collection is not complete without it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing...","review":"Would have given 5 stars but I'm old school and miss the sleeve, notes, pics, etc that used to come with a purchase.

Maybe that would do it for us ???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oasis is certainly nothing like The Beatles.","review":"It is impossible to understand why the band Oasis is compared to The Beatles. This album is like thousand's that are released every day. No creativity, no punch. BORING!! They are probably the most overrated band of all times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"The Gallaghers produce an album that is lacking in originality, coherency, music ability and lyrical depth. Clearly trading on his arrogant mancunian attitude and blustering pretentious vocal manner, Liam's own self-love is ironic when compared to the superficial derivative pap on display here. There is no attempt to create any sense of emotional empathy in the songs, indeed the whining anthemic dirges are more akin to football chants. Don't believe the hype - despite the Gallagher's claims, they are still a media-manufactured creation that has been manipulated for maximum accessability: rebellion in a nice, neat fashionable parcel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired whining of the mono-browed one","review":"Essentially this CD has the same song rehashed over and over. Meaningful lyrics - HAH! This is an unoriginal piece of tripe. If you're an aspiring rock star then buy it - if Oasis could make it big then any talentless fool can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad.","review":"Not much else to say.

The worst is the lyrics though. They are just terrible. A lot of people in the US bought this album, learned this, and...well, Oasis are now over in America. Very short lived and not much enthusiasm for them anyways. They are so hyped. A lot of it has to do with Liam's and Noel's big mouths. I can't believe people follow this band and treat these guys like gods. They treat their fans really bad. Fans (and the band) think they are better than the Beatles. Please. Oasis is not even worth typing this anymore or you reading about them. So if you want some good British music, check out Blur (Parklife, Great Escape, Blur). They are the best British band this decade. Any respectable critic will tell you that."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST BEATLES ALBUM IN 30 YEARS...","review":"What the hell?!?! Here are two simple exercises for you to do: 1.) Listen to the end of \\"She's Electric\\" and then listen to the end of \\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\" on Sgt. Pepper. A more blatent rip-off I cannot imagine. Oh, and speaking of \\"Imagine\\"... 2.) Listen to the intro to \\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\" and then listen to the intro to \\"Imagine,\\" by John Lennon. Hmmm... rip-off artists? Definately Maybe. As a huge Beatles fan, the only reason I gave this 2 stars was because what they do is out of respect for the Beatles and also because Liam Gallagher named his baby Lennon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got it for a bargain","review":"I bought this for ten bucks at the local market and couldn't believe my luck that I'd gotten quite a mini-masterpiece for a bargain. I began to wonder why I hadn't paid the full price for this when it first came out! The album is quite lean (only eight actual songs), but Oasis make each song count. Some of them are way too long, but on the whole very listenable.

From their sample downloads I quickly became a fan, and when I visited London last I made it my job to find their album. I CAN DANCING AND WALKING did not let me down. On my first listening of the album, the soft mellow tones of HERDS' vocals and guitar picking reminded me that of Nick Drake.Much of the album remains very minimal in sound, often containing much more than vocals over a guitar. However, it is in this blend of few instruments and voice that an uncanny fullness of sound is reached.The album plays from mellow songs to up tempo mellow songs. It's a great album to ride on a train with. Or let alone take much anywhere. I highly recomend I CAN DANCING AND WALKING.

I have reviewed these recordings on the site of the new re-release. (It appears that the new set does not contain the excellent booklet of liner notes, so it may be worth buying this set used if you can find it.)Although these records cover a lot of the period shown in the biopic movie RAY, you probably want to skip this set until you get the Atlantic recordings box set - which covers his more well-known material from the movie.

I recommend it most highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"I read this book and after getting through about a third of it I started to get frustrated. I kept asking myself why she didn't go see another doctor. I feel like if I were in that much pain and my regular doctor couldn't provide answers I would keep seeing different people until I came across someone who could give me answer. It's like if someone has been diagnosed with cancer she usually gets a second or third opinion. It was just frustrating to me all the things she was trying. And if that weren't enough, by the end of the book no progress had been made. I felt like she could very well have ended the book in the middle and I would have been left with the same dissatisfied feeling I had at the end. I got this book on sale at Barnes and Noble for 2 or 3 dollars and I'm glad I only paid that much for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I'm not sure which book the other reviewers are talking about when they say this book is funny. I didn't find it funny at all. In fact, I found it tiresome. The author is whiny. The fact that she starts so many sentences off with, \\"My vagina...\\" and uses the f-word so much just gets old. At some point, the use of the word becomes gratuitous and unnecessary. Her delivery is bland and dispassionate for someone who is narrating her own book. This book bored me stiff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo for sharing such an intimate problem","review":"What an incredible relief to read this book. I thought I was the only one who had gone through this misery. The author describes with pitch-perfect accuracy what it is like to have a medical problem no one can fix, and the annoyance you become for even a long-term, trusted doctor who can't \\"fix\\" you. I did have the surgery and experienced some improvement. But I have never discussed this with anyone other than my husband. Boy, did it feel good to read Susanna's book. It was like talking to a girlfriend."},{"rating":"2","title":"What helped","review":"Very helpful to read a person's real experiences, thanks to Susanna. This condition can also affect the bladder. What helped me: two liters of water per day including half a litre of club soda, no caffeine, sugar or yeast.These real life stories help other sufferers and medicos to understand these conditions better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Looking.......Side Scroller??!!","review":"So this is what we get after all these years of waiting? An updated version of Duke Nukem 2?This game looks great, it has the same Duke Nukem attitude, but its watered down somewhat. The biggest problem with Manhattan Project is it's 3rd person side-scrolling view, just a terrible, backwards idea. It would have been really cool if this game used Raven's GHOUL II engine, as it stands you need a magnifying glass to see all the action in this game. The save game feature needs some work too, why do programmers want to restrict where and when I can save my game?? That is very annoying. And if you think you get a lot of weapons to play with, think again.Plus the strippers in the game don't strip like in the previous Duke Nukems, what a rip-off!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project","review":"Duke Nukem Manhattan project is a 3D sidescroller and is the fourth Duke Nukem game. You as Duke Nukem must save the planet from the mutants and their cybrog leader. I played the game in the OpenGL video mode and it runs great, Direct3D is also available. It is the best looking sidescroller i have ever played, The graphics and sound are great. The single player is quite dissappointing, The game is not very long and it is mostly shoot everything that moves and the puzzles are just find the key card. There is nothing new between the levels and it is not a hard game, besides the boss in the seventh episode the rest of the game was easy. Duke Nukem Manhattan project is disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT A SEQUEL","review":"Some of the reviewers of this title seem a bit confused as to its nature. This is NOT the sequel to Duke Nukem 3D. The true sequel will be titled \\"Duke Nukem Forever\\" and will be released someday by 3D Realms. \\"Manhattan Project\\" was developed by a 3rd party studio just for kicks while we wait for the true sequel. Think of it as a spin-off. They wanted to make a title that was a bit nostalgic for older styles of gameplay, and at the same time update that style with newer technology. And for what it is, they did a wonderful job. Now stop bitching and keep waiting for the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same Duke we all loved","review":"What happened to this game? This game is in 3rd person!! What is up with that? Poor Duke, I hate to see you go this way 'ol buddy. This would have been a great follow-up to the original, but not after playing Duke in 1st person for so long. Good-bye old freind. We all hope to see the real Duke again someday. This was a disapointment. Don't get me wrong, for what it is, the graphics are good. If you had never played the other it might be OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't run it on my computer","review":"The game requires more computer than I have - at least in order to SEE it. It REQUIRES one of two video cards - nVidia GeForce 7600 or GTS/ATI Radion HD 2600 with 256MB ram. They recommend even higher performance cards with 512MB ram. These requirements were not listed on the Amazon page. I acnot rate the game higher because I cannot play it. My computer is 2.6GHz Intel Core 2, Windows 7 (64 bit) with 4GB ram and many available GB of hard disk space left. But it only has the standard Intel chip set video adapter. I don't play often enough to buy another $100 worth of video card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont' Buy this Game if you liked Duke Nukem 3D","review":"If you liked Duke Nukem 3D, you may hate Manhattan Project. I've just wasted [amt] on this game. Problem is that you CANNOT move forward or back! You can ONLY move left or right. I thought there was a problem with my joystick/keyboard/config/etc but No that appears to be the way this game was made. I ran Duke 3D and it worked perfectly. I was really looking forward to this game and am a little upset at the [dummy] who decided to make it a \\"side scroller\\" as it just does not make sense. This is exactly why people \\"borrow\\" software and I wish I would have done that as I could have saved some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Side scroller, no 3-D.

Worst Duke Nukem game ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This is the most dissapointing PC game I have bought in quite a while. I enjoyed the earlier Duke titles and thought they were great FPS games. The Manhatten Project retains some of the feel of the previous Duke games but is not up to par with its ancestors. The biggest complaint I have is with the user interface. It is nearly impossible to control the on-screen character with either keyboard commands or the joystick. Also, the horizontal only movement and the third person perspective does not work well with a shoot-em-up such as this. I like the graphics and the game concept but control is of paramount importance in a shooter and this game just does not have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come On!","review":"Seems they've fooled a few folks, but not me. They slap the name Duke Nukem on an old Mario Bros engine and expect it to hold it's own in the wake of games like SOF2, MoHAA, RTCW and GTA3!Installed & tried the game, deleted from my HD, resealed the box and promptly returned it for a full cash refund- What a waste of time and effort- Weak pizza!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truth is it's a failed duke product by 3drealms !","review":"Don't believe the others who give this game 5 stars. This game is nowhere as good as Duke3d. Sure, if you want side scrollers then this game may be good for you although it sure doesn't beat the Commander Keen series as well as other platform games out there. Moreover, this game was released as a result of 3drealms's once again failed attempt to get DNF out the door."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your money","review":"I just downloaded the demo, and I can not believe the released this trash. It does not even live up to it previous titles. even if you go back before dukenukem 3d, the old games are far more superior. they told and old game and put a new setup on it so it would work in windows xp. dont buy it go get aliens vs preditors, or something. i just never expected 2 steps back form 3d gamers software company, they must have fired the old programmers and have a newbee programming. It is sad said hunk of junk. if you like 3rd person shooters max payne, counterstrike much beter, that is why i quit playing dukenuken in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"No where near the fun of Duke Nukem 3D","review":"Regretably this not the same type first person shooter as Duke Nukem 3D, this is a sorry Acrade style spin off that I've since gotten rid of and I warn people away from purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"GameBoy for the PC","review":"Don't waste your Gaming Computer and game playing time with this game unless you missing playing on your GameBoy. Limited two Dimension play with uncreative graphics. Not a true sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing =(","review":"As a fan of Duke from the beginning I was a little disappointed by this release. Seems like in 2002 we could ask for better...... Come on, a side-scroller with poor graphics and no network play? Thats so dated. I have a P3 not a 486. Soured by this experience I anxiously await the Duke Nukem Forever release of the \\"Real\\" game. Out in.....forever.=("},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Fan of Duke...Not This Game Though","review":"Very disappointed in this version of Duke Nukem. I didn't care for the side motion and third person view. Previous versions although DOS based were much funnier to play. Also it ran like ... on my computer running Win ME."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Sounds like a bad action movie.\\"","review":"The plot for this movie is actually quite good, a microbiochemical weapon accidently created and released on the world is captured and is being brought back from Russia, but the Russians are trying to recapture it and release it on the major cities of the world and it is up to our \\"hero\\" to stop them before it happens. What ruins this great movie is the very bad acting. When asked if he knew about Agent Red, Dolph's character said it best, \\"Sounds like a bad action movie,\\" and it is. From LT. Christian being seriously out of uniform to the underlying \\"love story\\", this movie just reeks. The only good thing I saw in this movie was Randolph Mantooth. His small part made up for the movie in my opinion. So unless you're a big Mantooth fan, this movie is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"dvd red agent","review":"hello,i do not hate it but i have not yet received the dvdis there something going wrongwith kind regardsmarc triolet"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agent Red DVD","review":"I ordered it by mistake, thinking it was WWII U-boot movie.

This is only the second time in my life I stopped watching a movie because it was so poorly done. DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad at all","review":"I thought this was a pretty good movie. Some good action, and a little romance between Dolph and Melanie Paul(who plays his beautiful, soon to be wife). Pretty good plot too. Only one bad part to the movie as there is a scene used from another one of Dolph's flicks \\"Storm Catcher.\\" The same scene is in both movies which I thought was strange. Other than that, the movie was a strong one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't get anyone to watch this with me.","review":"I bought this movie previously viewed for 2 bucks, if that tells you about the quality.

So far after 5 weekends, my friends and I haven't been able to get up the courage to watch this past the previews yet.If we do this weekend finally, and it is actually good(???) then I will come back on here and post a RAVE REVIEW. If not, this review will stand.Best Movie of the Day (when I didn't watch any other movies)-raves Erik of Longview."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Swimming With Emmet","review":"\\"Wake\\" is a catchy, infectous modern rock pop album from this suburban Washington D.C. (Virginia) band. The thirteen songs glide by effortslessly, piling on one decent hook after another. This is pop rock at its best, never to tart, never too deep, concerned (mostly) with relationships both successful and failed. The highlights include the rocking opening cut \\"Jump Into the Water,\\" the mournfully poetic \\"Broken Oar,\\" the superb, seductive ballad \\"You're So Pretty,\\" and the failed relationship cut, \\"Ed's Song.\\" There is not a bad track in the mix, though several in the second half are filler material.Overall, a sweet modern rock pop gem that deserves a wider audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"great lyrics and songwriting","review":"Emmet Swimming remains one of my favorites with thoughtful lyric and catchy verse. Musicianship is top with driving and elegant playing throughout the emotional spectrum. Great to enjoy in all moods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland vocals create disappointing effort","review":"Picked up this CD for $1 based upon the interesting artwork. I found lead singer Erik's voice quite monotonous, killing any chance to enjoy the songs and experience his songwritting. Every track I found myself thinking \\"this needs harmony\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to burst your bubble","review":"I tried hard to really like these guys, being from the East Coast and all, and Emmet being local. Maybe they are better live, but frontman Todd Watts has a very weak voice and no memorable songs leap out at you. After all, if they were good, they'd at least be at the popularity level of a Train or even a Sister Hazel. Unfortunately, they should be called Emmet Drowning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album","review":"I first bought this album in 1991 when it was brand new. At the time, as a high schooler, this album succeeded in introducing me to the beautiful words of the many traditional hymns that most churches no longer play (in favor of more up-beat \\"praise\\" songs). And therefore, the album definitely succeeded in its mission to introduce youth like myself to the timeless majesty of the old hymns. Listening to it now as an adult, I still find myself struck by the beauty of many of the re-mixes. Yes, some of the early 90's takes on the old classics now sound a but cheesy, but overall this is a wonderful album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd pass","review":"All the hymns selected are standards that have survived centuries and continue to have just as much power today. However, these contemporary artists try to reinvent the wheel on some of these songs and some fail miserably. The grandeur of the hymns are lost in replacement of synthesized modern sounds that really don't fit with these types of songs.The only track that I enjoy is Amy Grant's redition of \\"'Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus.\\" I don't believe this track by Amy can be found on any other CD. It's the one redeeming track. But isn't that what God's grace is all about? The message is still powerful. I would find a more traditional arrangement of these hymns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teenage Morality Plot","review":"This book seems to be written for young girls since it is rather simplistic writing and a series of morality events."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird man...","review":"Loved this LP when it came out on vinyl, sounds just as good on CD.

It mixes so many genres and emotions that I don't know how anyone could not help but fall in love with it.This is a decidedly dark CD, without any hint of upbeat bubbliness. The only song that could be considered upbeat is \\"Everything That Rises Must Converge\\" still has a strange darkness to it, despite being a perfectly danceable tune. \\"Nemesis\\" is huge, over the top, and beautifully evil song.While these giant, thumping tracks are the meat of the album the ballads are what flesh it out. Easily the best is \\"Faded Flowers\\" which is in stark contrast to many of the tracks around it. It is a minimalist duet that has masterfully been worked in among the other heavier songs and manages to only enhance the flow.If you want to hear one of the best albums of all time, this is it. It is near flawless in production value and musicianship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not needed","review":"The System has a built in lightning protector , not knowing this we ordered it , the had to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD","review":"The low voltage terminals for the invisible fence wire are well marked.

My next door neighbors weren't so lucky and had a lightning strike 3 months after having their underground fence installed. Now, after a storm, I just check that the fence lights are on and working.

It might be an extra $30 that you really don't want to spend at the time, but if you compare to the $100+ that you'd have to spend to get a transmitter.

It was great. I was disappointed with the new design that Mr. Coffee has gone with. Like a previous customer pointed out, when you remove the carafe the majority of the time will leave coffee on the hotplate. I have to poor my cup with a paper towel in my hand to wipe up the mess. With the new carafe you will also drip coffee on your counter if you try to pour 1-2 inches above the cup. I can tell you this almost never happened with my old model. It also seems to brew much slower. Took 20 minutes to brew 6 servers this morning. Last night I ran hot water & vinegar to clean it, so I know it's not from build up. Nothing about this new design works for me. I've decided to switch since it looks like every carafe now has the same design for Mr. Coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design","review":"I bought this to replace my old Mr. Coffee which started leaking from the bottom. What a mistake! Using the brew pause to get a cup of coffee before the entire pot is done gets coffee all over the heater element. Those windows can be difficult to read. And the thing is impossible to clean. My previous model had black lines and numbers inside the water reservoir. The reservoir was a little wider so I could get my hand in there to wipe it out. The brew basket holder used to be removable. I could take it out for cleaning. And the pause system worked with a small lever on the back that opened and closed when the pot was put on and off the burner. I gave it 2 stars because it does make good coffee, but I can't wait to replace it with something more user friendly.

Also the package's back contains the slime chamber series figures and Quidditch team figures. This Harry in his scarlet Gryffindor Quidditch robes even comes with the Crest on his robes. The other version only had crests on some figures. Harry comes with a snitch and Nimbus 2000 broom with the figer ring to fly Harry around!

I have a Volcano heatsink. After attaching the duct to the heatsink the fan is attached with long screws and tiny nuts. There's litte room to maneuver a tool or even a finger behind the fan on the short side of the duct. Getting a nut threaded onto a screw proved to be a challenge.They claim this duct reduces noise, I found the opposite to be true. While there may have been less noise caused by turbulence as they claim, the duct seemed to be vibrating, giving a whining sound. After making sure all the mounting screws were tight I tried adjusting the fan's RPM(mine is adjustable) but the vibration never went away. The whining sound was annoying enough that I didn't even take the time to test for any improvement in cooling before I removed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay at best","review":"I purchased this book simply because of the title. How many books will I find that have my last name as part of the title?I found the book to be okay at best. The booked jumped from place to place far too much. The author is in the pharmaceutical industry, and that really shows through in the deep details of the chemistry descriptions in the book. To those of us that are not chemists, this is way too much detail.The book has numerous typographical errors, and could have used a thorough spell check.The title character \\"Roger Mencik\\" plays a very small role in the story, which to me was disappointing. The connection of the title to the story is not clear until at least halfway through the book.While the story line is a good idea, a better writer could have done much more with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The jbl e100 3 way speaker system is a very good sounding,and is a super deal.","review":"These speakers produce very good sound.[...].Yes you can buy speakers ,that are smaller with more accurate sound,but for those wanting big sound in a large room,these just might be right for you.These speakers are quite tall but are fairly slim in width. You will need a lot of clean power,but the payoff is the speakers are very open dynamic and a little bright.I recommend you use a receiver or seperate power amplifiers,that have a more subdued ,or netural sound ,to give a more musical presentation..I intend to use a pair in my basement.I highly recommend these speakers and i rate them 5 stars...I thank you.

Hence I would say that its best for the experienced analyst who is already familiar with the concepts and various techniques described in section 2 and knows when to use/ when not to use them. He is truthful in what he says about needing to adapt requirements style and content to what the situation needs but in some development shops you would need to be an senior analyst to be able to vary from their standards. I would recommend it for any analyst with 2+ years experience who wants to improve and polish their ability to write requirements/specifications"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book for everybody who is involved in sw development","review":"I would recommend this book for everybody, who is involved in sw product creation. It is so CLEARLY and engagingly written, that any reader (student, business manager, programmer...) can take advantage of information. There is no 'water' in this book. You will read and almost on every page you can make a discovery: 'A-a-a... That's how we document it!' It will make clear for many people the grey area between the conception of software idea and actual sw design. Unfortunately, in (almost) all design books the technique of documenting 'what is to be done' is glossed over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Making requirements look exiting!","review":"Very inspiring book on what software requirements are about. What always seemed to be dull, became very much alive. Practical guidelines, stuff to think about in the 'problem frames'. Nice example of requirements and specification doc. Missing: elicitation - how to get information from the customer about his/her requirements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but lacks examples","review":"Although it is titled as \\"Practical\\", the greatest problem of this book is the difficulties to put the methods it suggests into practice. At least, an example for each problem frame, but this book has only one case study that covers the information and workpiece problem frames only. Nevertheless, this is a great book that takes a radical approach to requirements analysis. So I give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theoretically nice but not practical","review":"A nice theory approach to writing requirment specification but hard to put into practice. Good for someone already have lots of experience in writing requirement specification and need something from different views. If you are looking for a book for content and style in requirment spec, I don't think it helps. Besides, I do not like the author's keeping saying \\"and so on.... so on.\\" Give me an example and don't say 'so on' all the times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Up to chapter 3 and finding it useless","review":"I have just finished Chapter 3 of this book and am near livid. The author has a confusing and abstract way of writing that is infuriating for those of us living in the practical world. The discussion regarding the intangibles of requirements and interfaces is a quagmire of confusing definitions. So far I have pulled nothing of use from these chapters and am more confused than when I started reading.I am hopeful this all gets sorted out in later chapters because right now, this book is proving to be fairly useless at teaching this software engineer how to properly gather and formulate a requirements document.If you are into theoretical rhetoric, it's a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a live album!","review":"This CD includes most of my favorite charlatans songs including Impossible, Weirdo, and How High.

Modin's account is the only one of its kind, and definitely should be read. Despite the fact that there are so many book on the subject, this one is great and above all others. The way Modin arranged their defection to Russia is incredible. This story is a must or all interested in English and Soveit espionage during the Cold War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read about the 5 famous spies","review":"This is my favorite of about seven books I've read on Kim Philby and/or the Cambridge Five.

The book reads like an editedUSSR intelligence report with all the essential information removed except the superiority of MotherRussia. Further, the translation is painfully awkward. After the chapter on Philby, the ring-leaderof the group, the book totally lacks interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"I LOVE Sandra Boynton. I do not like Philadelphia Chickens.

Nowhere did it say it was missing the CD!!!!!Very Missleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids Love This","review":"I got \\"Philadelphia Chickens\\" for my granddaughter a few years ago and she loved it. The music is catchy and delightful; the lyrics capture situations that are very real to children. It was such a hit that she and Mommy and I were dancing around the house together ... For months, she would have the book propped open on the couch and dance and act out the songs while she followed the words on the page. Great learn to read tool as well as loads of fun. BTW, the lyrics are very entertaining for adults as well and the music is wonderful.Based on her enthusiastic response, I recently purchased a second book for my grandson. He's only one, but loves the music. Several songs featured on the CD (Snuggle Puppy, Belly Button, Pajama Time) are available on Boynton on Board books, which he loves. I highly recommend this for the under 12 set."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is terrific! A definite \\"must have\\". We love it!","review":"We discovered this at our public library.

We recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and Memorable","review":"The songs are cute and funny, and the tunes are catchy.

We especially like Snuggle Puppy, a sweet love song for a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!!","review":"My 18 month old loves the songs especially in the car. \\"Like a Duck\\" and \\"Chocolate Chip Cookies\\" are the favorites. The songs are not annoying so even grandma can stand it being played over and over again.We especially enjoy the ability to sing along and in the future read the sheet music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't hesitate...buy this now!","review":"I hardly ever write reviews, but I just had to share how absolutely wonderful this CD is. My 2-year-old and 3-year-old ask for it every day and dance to it like crazy. As other reviewers have noted, the music is great and won't get on your nerves. We used to only listen to \\"The Wiggles\\" and this is a great change of pace. The lyrics are smarter and the music rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 15 month old's favorite","review":"My fifteen month old son loves this book and CD. He will bring the book to me when he wants me to play the CD. He tries to say \\"dinosaur, dinosaur\\" when the Jump Rope Jive song plays. He also like me to \\"read\\" the book to him by singing short versions of the songs.Warning: The \\"Cows\\" song is really hard to get out of your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute!","review":"I think our children and grandchildren will regard Sandra Boynton as we and our parents regard Dr. Seuss. As usual, her stories are adorable. I saw highlights on the today show this morning and had to go buy it today. My daughter's a little young for it (7 months) but her 2 year old friends loved the music. It's a children's CD I like and do not find annoying (such as those by that purple creature).The book is well done. There is a page for each of the songs with an illustration. There is also sheet music and lyrics for each song in the back of the book.I'm sure we'll cherish this one for years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Philly Chickens","review":"Great item, everyone loves it. Not quite as much as Dog Train, but much more than Rhinocerous Tap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining with Wide Age Appeal","review":"I bought this book and CD for entertainment on our summer road trips and it has quickly become a favorite of all 3 of my children (ages 14 months, 5 and 8). The tunes are toe-tapping and fun to listen and sing to. The lyrics are funny and easily understood so that kids can learn the songs. I highly recommend the book and CD -- makes a great gift for new big brothers and sisters when a baby is born."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for kids that adults will love","review":"Sandra Boynton has elevated the genre of children's music to an all-time high. The ubiquitous recycled children's songs with little musical value are thankfully absent from her album. Boynton's lyrics are delightful with accompanying music that adults will recognize from the mainstream. Jazz, ballads, imaginary Broadway hits come together for great family entertainment. This purchase will give you two treats in one. Along with the CD, Boynton's book is a treasure of zany sketches and musical scores.If you have one CD/book to buy for the child in your life, this is it. The only CD that our family likes as much is Boynton's Blue Moo album. Both are wise purchases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Loves the tune \\"Cows\\"","review":"\\"Cows, we're remarkable cows, and wherever we go it's a Fabulous show, Yes we are Cows - COWS !!!\\"We have to here this song ever time we get buckled in the car and start down the driveway, and It never gets Old, great Cd Fun,fun,fun !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this CD","review":"MY whole family LOVES this CD.

Parents will be happy to put away the well-worn Raffi tape and listen to the Chickens!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Children's CD out there!","review":"Philadelphia Chickens is a masterpiece. Moms and Dads, you'll be singing along in no time. If you're anti-Barney and anti-Wiggles, can't stand to hear one more verse of \\"I love you; you love me; we're a happy family\\" you will love the variety and intelligence behind this CD. Appealing to children of all ages, including parents, this CD is truly terrific, both in lyric and in composition. Hats off to Sandra Boynton and my only question is when are you going to team up with Pixar and the Muppets to create Philadelphia Chickens: The Movie???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"This was a gift and we have listened to it only a few times because no one in the family thinks much of it.

Amazon's obviously did not review the cd upon its return."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is a must-have!","review":"The clever lyrics and variety of music on this CD make it one of the best \\"kid\\" CD's we own. My husband HATES having to listen to \\"kiddie\\" music on long trips, but actually requests this one. There's nothing more adorable than a two - year old trying to sing \\"Sguggle Puppy\\".

My daughter is 8 months old, so the CD was really more for my husband and I right now than for her. I ordered it hoping that we could work it into out in-car rotation of CD's, but small doses of this one are better. She likes it, and I think she will love it when she gets older. Preschoolers would most likely love it! Right now, many of the songs are a little annoying for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughter Therapy and More","review":"My whole household (two adults, one 6 year old, one 2.5 year old and an almost 9 month old) LOVEs this book/CD. I've caught my husband with baby in his arms and daughter jamming in their jammies to it many a night! My 6 year old received it for Christmas the year it came out and has listened to it on and off over the past two years. It has recently be revived with my 2.5 year old - she wiggles, dances and sings to just about every song! We love it because it is upbeat and catchy. Beware...you may wake humming \\"Belly belly button oh so fine!\\" But I can think of worse tunes... ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Snuggle Puppy","review":"Its hard to find good music that is good for kids,too.

It's a quick review of materials using a margin note system for overview, and more detail on that same page. Separated by subject, it's easier to read and find specifics than some review guides that mix up all the subjects. Also good for test review, my friend said the overviews in the marjins were enough to add points at test time.I've just finished first semester with A's.

I had a wonderful experience and recieved my book promptly. Thanks for your help and good experience. This is a great Nursing study book."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better study guides","review":"I bought this book because it had a CD-ROM with NCLEX-type questions. Unfortunately, the CD-ROM can't be used on computers without Windows 98 or higher. I took the disk to my college library, hoping to use the disk on one of the PC machines there, but I discovered that the disk has to be installed on the computer. Installing software on public computers is verboten at my school. This means the CD-ROM is basically worthless to me. The book itself is basically an outline of a Med-Surg nursing textbook. There are surprisingly few illustrations for a study guide.Bottom line: If you like studying dry lists and you own a PC with Windows 98 or higher, Pentium 166 or higher, 64 MB RAM or more, and 8 MB of free hard-disk space, this book might be for you. However, if you like studying with memory aids, graphs, charts, drawings, and spoon-feeding explanations of complex concepts, don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Factual","review":"After the gun ban in England the UK police changed their system for recording crime. This made it falsely appear that the crime rate had gone up according to statistics based on police reports. The British Crime Survey, another measure of crime in the UK, was unaffected by these changes in recording crime. According to the British Crime Survey, crime in Britain has actually gone down quite a bit since the gun ban. This is not to say that the gun ban caused the decrease in crime. A decrease in crime can be caused by other factors. However, it does reveal that the author failed to sufficiently research the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little of this, a little of that.","review":"If you want to learn about pugs, read this book, and then go out and buy another book about pugs.\\"The Essential Pug\\" is a hodgepodge of little bits of information, most of it not specific to pugs.The chapter \\"On Good Behavior\\" takes a lot of time to tell you basically nothing. But the author of the chapter seems to agree with me that you need to look to other sources: \\"Find out all you can about your chosen breed first [the book is supposed to be for pug owners], then master rudimentary training and handling skills.\\"No kidding.Only a few sections are really about pugs. Other places plugged the name \\"pug\\" into pre-existing material. But a lot of places they didn't even bother with that. \\"...your chosen breed.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, great pictures","review":"This book, text-wise, is nearly identical to \\"The Pug:An owner's guide\\" by Patterson. It's decent, but nothing spectacular. About half the info is generic to any breed (training, illnesses, etc.) This book, though, has wonderful photos. So adorable! It's also several dollars cheaper.

I normally use whole barley at home but needed bags for the office. I had brought some back from China on my last trip that I could not find in the US, so I tried this brand. These large bags are actually for a teapot, not a cup as I expected. As mentioned, the flavor was not full-bodied and so I will keep searching."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than it's worth","review":"I first began using the roasted barley to make a beverage almost thirty years ago while learning Hapkido. It is good for the heart, stabilizes the pancreas, and works as a fat emulsifier. It goes well with roasted corn to make an even more healthful drink. I would suggest buying it from a local Korean, Chinese or Japanese market. I just got 4 bags of roasted corn and the roasted barley for less than $9. Then you can either brew it whole on the stove, or grind it and brew it in a French Press. Both ways work well. Adding sugar or honey diminishes some of the health benefits. In spring and summer I have it at room temperature. If it is cold outside I drink it warm. Either way is great. Try 4 tablespoons to a quart of water."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak barley flavor","review":"This tea was a disappointment. The tea had a weak barley flavor no matter how many tea bags were used.

Everything that any casual fan might know is present. There's no doubt that the biggest hits here are \\"Rush\\" and especially \\"The Globe\\", but the rest is good too. Minus those two songs, the strongest stuff is the first 4-5 tracks. All are sample-filled and hit-worthy. The rest is decent and fun, which I think sums up the band as a whole also. Truth be known, if all you know is \\"Rush\\" and \\"The Globe\\", you may just want to get \\"The Globe\\" album. It has both hit songs and is solid front to back with killer tunes. Can't go wrong here though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasic Band!","review":"This compilation covers most of the best BAD songs, not that you wouldn't want to collect the individual albums, but if you just have a casual interest then you can't go wrong here.Nearly all the songs still sound innovative and enjoyable. I personally don't think they sound \\"dated\\" at all. And even if they did, so what? This type of music still towers over the dumbed down, depressing, cookie cutter garbage that dominates the pop charts today. And what about the lyrics? I think BAD's lyrics are some of the funniest, most clever I've heard. You just don't find any other band quite like them when it comes to song material.Even if you don't remember BAD from the eighties and nineties, if you give this CD a chance to let it grow on you, you won't regret it. Listen to this, and then turn on the radio and compare it to the hip-hop and teeny bopper regurgitated pap pushed on the masses today.

So disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splenda flavor sticks","review":"this is a great product but the last case I recieved, the powder was solidified on the bottom of the tube and I had to cut each one from top to bottom to get the powder out, that means I had to cut 180 tubes of splenda, I wrote the company and they offered me a coupon for 10% off my next purchase, big deal"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flavor without the added calories","review":"My husband and I loved our hazelnut flavored creamer, but gave it, and its added calories, up as part of our New Years Resolutions. This is a nice substitute, without the calories. While it does not taste as good, it is a nice treat when you want a bit more flavor in your coffee. We did not like the vanilla, and plan to try the mocha next."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hazelnut Flavor is AWFUL!","review":"I really like Splenda, but this Hazelnut flavor has a distinctly over-chemicaled taste and just doesn't have much nuttiness to it. Perhaps the other flavors are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teriffic Splenda coffee flavor","review":"I highly recommend this product. I had been buying it at Walmart for the last two or three years until they quit selling it. Thank goodness I found it on Amazon, and at an even better price than I was paying at Walmart! Thanks to Amazon I now have a standing order for this great tasting coffee flavoring! Not only does it taste great, it has zero calories!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Camper!","review":"Splenda sent me this as a sampler in the Hazlenut flavor, and I really liked it even though I am not a big fan of Hazlenut in general. I did not know if it was a creamer or just a sweetener, but it turned out to just be a sweetener. This is great for anyone who likes their coffee black but wants to add some flavor to it. It would also be cool if Splenda came up with something like this that was a sweetener+creamer.Looking forward to trying this in French Vanilla."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mocha is best","review":"This is a pretty good Splenda flavor, but the Mocha is best, in my opinion. The French Vanilla is a second favorite. Hazelnut is better than no flavor at all. I use one flavored packet and one regular Splenda packet in a large (14 oz) mug, and it's perfect. Not necessary to use two flavored ones, as it is a little pricey and one has enough flavor for an entire travel mug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splenda Flavors","review":"Awesome product that can no longer be obtained in any of my regional retail locations. Lowest price @ Amazon than any online locations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice alternative for regular Splenda","review":"The flavour of hazelnut is not so strong so it works more like an aroma.

But I don't read a romance to analyze I read to have fun (couldn't find anything to rhythm with analyze) but anyway I was a good fun book but I can't wait for Kane in Egypt. Its going to be sexy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"I've definitely read better; Kiss and Tell was slightly more interesting. Cherry Adair has a nice, realistic style, but if you're looking for deep charachters and intruiging plot twists, read Nora Roberts instead. the charachters were likable, the romance scenes were hot, but the plot was completely predictable and extremely boring.other than that, the exchange between the charachters was fun in parts, but the charachters had no depth and the storyline held no surprises.in other words, if you read romance for the sex and dialogue, you'll probably like this book; if you're looking for something more, go elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"On Thin Ice was sooooo much better","review":"After enjoying On Thin Ice so much, I really hate to do this but In Too Deep wasn't nearly as entertaining. I didn't see the chemistry between Michael and Tally. The entire book centered around their sexual encounters. Neither of them had much depth, the plot was slippery and the writing choppy. Tally was just a little too brave for me when faced with life-threatening situations on nearly every page and I kept getting the feeling that she was just a young, little girl with the way she talked and thought. It just wasn't as deep as it should have been and there were a lot of goofy phrases. However, I haven't given up yet. I still have more of her books to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhhhh...it was ok","review":"I've read some of Cherry Adair's other books and I liked them alot better than this one. I just couldn't get into the story. The fact that the guy in the story had an eye patch was just a little bit too weird for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Pooh!","review":"This book is totally Mills and Boon, only thicker. Not suitable for mature readers who are used to novels by writers such as Judith McNaught, Jude Deveraux, Teresa Medeiros, Christine Feehan, Linda Howard, ..well you get me.Maybe it was just this book, I don't know. I might try another book of hers just to see if she's what her fans says she is.All the best for your next book, Ms. Adair... :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good!","review":"This was my first book by Cherry Adair, and I was not too sure about it.

It's great, stop thinking about it and get to reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Keeper","review":"This is a book with major problems: the characterizations are shallow and the plot line thin. Add to that an unsympathetic hero and a trite story line. The romantic scenes are hot, but not especially original. And the inconsistent elements abound.I really enjoyed HIDE AND SEEK. I did not enjoy IN TOO DEEP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Troubled Pasts - Promising Future","review":"Ms. Adair has a way with taking two characters with troubling pasts and bringing them together in a powerfully, romantic manner. Her couple really has an uphill battle in IN TOO DEEP!Former Navy SEAL, Michael Wright has scars (physical and psychological) but that's why he's on a mission of revenge. Can he ignore the unexpected cracks in his hardened heart and use his enemy's daughter to achieve his goal? Can she overcome her own phobeas and trust him enough to find love in his arms? I loved this book... and the series on the Wright siblings in general. IN TOO DEEP is #3 in series: KISS & TELL is #1... HIDE & SEEK is #2."},{"rating":"1","title":"deeply dull","review":"I couldn't like Tally at all. I don't know what authors are thinking about making their heroines bumbling or witchy fools. Falling all over the place in the middle of a storm, nearly tearing his shorts off twice, and her awful singing really destroy the suspenseful atmosphere the author was rally struggling (and usually failing) to create.Essentially, we don't like Tally, so we really don't care what happens to her and the hero deserves better. But even he gets wearing after a while. Everything else is down hill from the first 40 pages on. The love scenes have all been done so much better elsewhere. A big yawn. The only thing deep about this book is how far it will put you to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had hoped for much more from my first Cherry Adair book - the recommendations had been so good. But the writing is simplistic, the characters lack dimension, the \\"suspense\\" is convuluted and not even remotely realistic, and the sex is formulaic. Silly me, to want a little romance in my romance novels! It wasn't so bad that I couldn't finish it, but I'll stick to Susan Andersen, Linda Howard and Karen Robards for my romantic thrillers from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment !!","review":"I have to say I was terribly disappointed in this book. I loved the first two books in the series and would give them 5 stars each. But this one I finally just gave up on and didn't even finish. I had really been looking forward to getting it......but after 5 or 6 chapters, I just decided that I'd rather spend my reading time on something that grabbed me....which this did not. I hope her next book is more of the caliber of the first two books Hide & Seek and Kiss & Tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Throughout !!","review":"In Too Deep by Cherry Adair is an exciting book throughout !! I loved the characters and the plot had me glued to my sofa for a long, long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"in too deep","review":"This book was magic : a beautiful love story and a wonderful end which still amazed me.If you want to read one of Cherry Adair's book, try this one you won't be betrayed by the story : a former soldier (he avoids all blondes since his former blonde girlfriend try to kill him) and a pretty blonde (who wants to begin a new life without her protecting brothers) meet together in a deep forest. The hero knows his life is in danger and she fells in love with him instantly but he resists....Cherry Adair managed the suspense till we discover the disease of the heroine and her fragility.... even the dog adds a touch of humour in this book full of suspense, hot scenes, crying instants, gun shots....Buy it you won't regret it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT, HOT, HOT","review":"Even the lack of having lost an eye, doesn't seem to make Michael Wright any less desirable. This story is action packed from the start. It is continued with a great deal of suspense. No huge surprises, but a really good book nonetheless. The sex scenes are steamy and one of the most memorable I've ever read is in this book. The constant danger will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. This is a very good book, but then all of Cherry Adair's books about the Wright Brothers are excellent. I highly recommend buying them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received item","review":"The photo is lovely.

If you have had an academic background that required a lot of writing none of this information is going to be new to you. Additionally, these documentation styles can be freely researched on the internet for a quick refresher.This book is also quite dated, pointing out that the final manuscript should be typed and not handwritten, and advises \\"The typewriter should be in good working order.

The conditioner is hard to squeeze out of bottle and in terms of improving the texture, doesn't help either. I have to dispense a generous amount even though I have short hair.

Visioneer should be ashamed to put this on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works But a Curse","review":"This is an acceptable scanner if you're looking for something small to scan an occasional page or two but the page feed design is awful. Jams frequently, has no feed delay setting, skews constantly. I normally need to scan the same page 2 or 3 times before it gets it right. For the high price avoid...Visioneer's earlier model desk scanners were much better designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scan Camera is not the most reliable...","review":"The Scan camera is not the most reliable, by that I mean in the middle of scanning it will occasionally stop picking up the image leaving you with a half-blank image.

Now I'm looking at all-in-device HP devices instead"},{"rating":"1","title":"By far their worst scanner","review":"Like another reviewer, I'm also a long time customer of Visioneer. I was excited when this new XP300 was released, but after setting it up (which was easy) I discovered that it performs horribly. In previous models, the paper flowed very smoothly through the scanner, but in the XP300, it often wiggles as it is scanned, causing the image to be blurred. Everything I had loved about the Strobe is now gone. It's a piece of junk.Instead of this product, I highly recommend the Fujitsu Scansnap. It works far better and has a built-in automatic document feeder."},{"rating":"1","title":"How dumb can a manufacturer be?","review":"This new Strobe sounded great on paper but couldn't be worse in reality. They apparently have no clue why people have liked their sheetfed scanners in the past. Each time a new version comes out, it gives up some good features from the past and adds several bad aspects. All we ever wanted was a bit more speed combined with better ability to automatically adjust lightness/darkness. Now the quality is worse, the paper insertion is worse, the duplex feature is a joke, the paper size has been constricted. I sent mine back within the 30 day return period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst scanner ever","review":"The other reviewers basically summarize it all. I am going to return it. After complaining to the company about some problems their reply was: \\"You are right, these are known problems, no solution yet\\". Every new model gets worse. They have a great idea for a product but simply don't get it. Total idiots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use","review":"I found this scanner difficult to use, especially trying to line up the paper to feed through the scanner. The software is poorly designed and organized. There is no on-off button and no light to let you know if the scanner is on. It is stupid beyond belief to not have an on-off switch or at least a light to indicate the status. As to the software, what were they thinking? Badly designed hardware, badly designed software, what was I thinking? (Actually, it was made by Visioneer so I thought it would be pretty well designed--I won't make that mistake again. I really wonder if when a company releases a bad product they ever consider what effect it has on the company's reputation. Obviously, Visioneer does not and I'd say that reflects the poor leadership of the top person in the company.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great compilation - Enjoy It","review":"ABC produced some great music and they could entertain...this is a CD that you will sing to, dance to and bring back some great memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Collection of ABC's Hits","review":"I really love listening to this compliation.

Not as sappy as, say, Spandau Ballet's. Though the music is standard 80's New Wave pop, ABC obviously enjoyed the use of strings for a few of their bigger hits...a trait that separated them further from their peers.The only issues with this disc concern the remixes that finalize the experience.

Don't be driven away by the cartoonish cover and their choice of song titles for behind all of that is real quality and a sincere appreciation for music. It is their fine musicianship and an intelligent song writing that stands out from so many bland \\"middle-of-the-road\\" Alt-country bands out today. Plus, their live shows are louder than hell and they never take breaks (except for PBR)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Much Sex (too little Jesus)","review":"The title of track 4 says it all. Drive by Truckers have a way with words and can capture the quirks of life within their masterful lyrics. Or maybe they have a quirky way of looking at life. Musically sound, these guys are a great band to listen to live and \\"Pizza Deliverance\\" is pure art from the first track through the fourteenth song. Highlights include \\"Nine Bullets\\", \\"Margo and Harold\\", \\"The President's Penis is Missing\\", and \\"Zoloft\\". Often introspective and melancholy in nature - although much humor is interspersed, the songs demonstrate great musicianship and are delivered with a unique voice that grows on you after each listen.

Pre-Jason Isbell, and they improved after he got there. Lots of unique songs and topics that one does not hear very often from other \\"mainstream\\" bands.

But this show is just horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry about this book","review":"Before I get started, I have to say I love books with very strong character development, finding out what motivates people, why they do what they do. Wally Lamb's book had very little plot but is one of the best I've ever read simply because of the strength of the characters. I finished reading The Little Friend this morning and I was so angry. Tartt spent 450 pages on drivel, yes we understand Harriet's motivations but we really don't care. She spent significantly more pages on snakes than she did on the ending and there was so much potential for a great ending. What did her sister remember? Will Harriet ever be connected to all the problems she caused for the Ratliffs? Will anyone ever recognize that Harriet needs therapy or how emotionally abused she is? Tartt reeled the readers in with an intriguing mystery in the first pages but the story plodded along to the end (it wasn't an ending, it just ended). She could have left out the first 350 pages and had a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't put it down -- fast enough!!","review":"If there's an award for the Most Irritating Novel of the Year, The Little Friend should win, hands down. At first, I was intrigued by Tartt's dense descriptive set-up and was curious to find out what would happen. But as I read on, I began to become disheartened as little did happen - and then I began to get the sinking feeling that nothing was ever going to happen. By the end of the 550+ pages, I was so fed up with Tartt's prose and with snotty little Harriet that I almost literally threw the book across the room. I was so frustrated, I couldn't get it away from me quick enough. An occasionally beauiful, but ultimately unsatisfying read. Tartt has not delivered on her promise of a precise, searing, grabbing new book. The Little Friend is the written equivalent of quicksand. The good news is that you CAN put it down, or throw it away, thus saving yourself the vain effort of slogging through to the bitter end. That's my advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"MORE PLOD THAN PLOT","review":"I have been listening to between 20 and 30 books on tape a year for the past several years, and this is the first one I have been unable to finish. I managed to get through the History of Rome and have varied from Stephen King to Stephen Ambrose to Stephen Hawking. BUT, I could not get through this one. There simply is no plot, just tedium. You know the book is overwritten when you are constantly conscious of the words the author is using rather than rather absorbing the text in imagery. I did not read Donna Tartt's first book but wish I had not wasted the time on the second. I simply cannot see how anyone could find this work enjoyable, but \\"to each his own\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"Next time I will wait and read the \\"real\\" reviews before I buy a book. This one was disappointing, and what can I say about the ending? Nothing good I assure you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of verbiage that doesn't add up to much","review":"Donna Tartt seems to have a very high opinion of herself based on the glory of her last book which lasted ten years. In interviews, she talks of other novelists such as Hemingway and Faulkner, as if they are her peers. Dream on. The Little Friend surely doesn't justify that sort of comparison. Far from it. TLF offers the occasionally clever gyrations of an intelligent wordsmith, huff-puffing to come up with a masterpiece. Alas, a masterpiece TLF is not - though it is a masterpiece of grinding effort - and an effortless exercise in condescension. Tartt's hodgepodge of ingredients - childhood imagination, murder, poverty-driven drug addiction, eccentric Southern Gothic old women, whodunnit - is a nice idea that simply doesn't convince, and ultimately bores. It's all very busy, but never finds its heart. Tartt has tried to cover all the bases, outsmart everyone, and maybe even herself. Who does she think she is fooling?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Shadows and Star Wars","review":"Along with all the valid comments by other readers, I found the pop culture references confusing. When trying to determine when exactly the story was taking place, there was Allison devoted to Dark Shadows, cancelled in 1970 or 1971, and a Star Wars figurine stolen at camp, circa 1977. Another reference put the story back in the 1960's. Don't publishers have fact checkers for this stuff?"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is NO ENDING, it JUST STOPS","review":"There are so many well written reviews already, that I will just add my biggest complaint. Donna Tartt FORGOT TO ADD AN ENDING! I thought a couple pages had been torn out of my book! Since not every reviewer complains about this, perhaps it is an accepted style of writing. However, after all the character development, and potentially exciting sub-plots, and after chasing down a potential murderer for so many pages...we are left with NOTHING. So there was no point to read it. No conclusion. Just colorful characters, none of them likeable, and vivid descriptions of disgusting predicaments that left me nauseous. I disagree, however, with giving this book 1 star, since Ms. Tartt's writing is not bad writing. A stupid romance novel can get one star. This book draws you in and makes you feel like you are in the world with the characters, and can see and smell what they do. You come to understand what kind of people they are. It just doesn't do you any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"man, oh man..","review":"the only reason i finished the book was because i KNEW, just KNEW that she (Tartt) wouldn't let me down.. however, i was wrong.. \\"the secret history\\" is my favorite book and i really can't believe how different \\"the little friend\\" turned out to be.. there's none of the same magic.. and it's definitely NOT a page turner.. on the contrary, i could barely stay awake reading it.. i'm sorely disappointed and hope that Tartt will try again and redeem herself.."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"This novel was a huge disappointment, especially since it's been described as a masterpiece in the literary media. While well written the descriptive passages run on too long. Little Harriet Defresnes is out to solve her brother's murder but the authors spends an inordinant amount of time exploring the personality quirks Harriet's relatives. At the end of 555 pages we still don't know who murdered 9 year old Robin Dufresnes so what was the point of even reading this book? For the cover price it'd be nice to see the mystery solved or have a little closure. Instead we're left with an unsolved murder and a family that is even more dysfunctional than it was in Chapter one. Over all, reading this book was waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored to tears!","review":"I suffered through 624 pages of this book. Honestly, it was torcherous. I was just hoping for a great ending the entire time and didn't get it. If you're into very,very detailed books with not much happening you will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been interesting","review":"The story is really intriguing - a small boy is murdered and his younger sister seeks answers/revenge/information. Instead the story is wordy with too much description and too much focus on non-main characters, without enough focus on people like the mother, sister, etc.Without giving anything away, the ending was disappointing to me, but perhaps wouldn't be to others. It got really slow moving at the end, and I wanted the book to be over with about 150 pages left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I've Ever Read. Sadly.","review":"I'm an avid reader, a few books a week for my entire adult life, and this is quite honestly the worst book I have ever read. I adored the Secret History and was excited to pick this up, but it was, frankly, torture. I kept reading in the hopes that there would be some kind of ending that made me glad I spent hours on this book, unfortunately I was wrong. Save your money and your time.

The ending was silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly Boring & Verbose","review":"I cannot imagine how she made any money for this book. It's boring, long-winded, and downright dull. IMO, only the Russian classic authors could get away with paragraph long sentences...I read a little over half of it, then went to the back and read the last few chapters. There was not one single character that I cared for...most of them were mere stick figures with no flesh on their bones. I've never given a 2-star review before, but I hope to save others from wasting their precious time reading this way over-hyped tome."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice imagery, BUT","review":"How about a little cohesion? Seems like every story line in the story either fizzles or goes nowhere. What about Odean? So who DID kill her brother? Couldn't Ida have been more significant? For what started out as a really interesting book, this was a monumental waste of valuable reading time. Even I could sit there and just type up my dreams that go nowhere and talk about nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, this is a train wreck, not a novel","review":"How could this happen? Did Donna Tartt's agent and editor simply not read the book? Despite a solid beginning, major flaws soon appeared and got worse until finishing the next chapter became a chore. It's a tradegy for this obviously gifted writer-readers are furious at being sucked in by so much hype and given a miserably plotted, bloated, self-indulgent, digressive excuse for a novel. Scenes went no where; character development was sacrified as the author constantly followed one tangeant after another. There was some wonderful writing that got buried under a flood of bad choices that a trusted editor should have caught. Even on a minor scale, the whole drug business seemed like something researched rather than felt; the constant (supposedly experimental?) use of parentheses was extremely irritating. I was a big fan of her first book, this one showed contempt for readers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I Had Read the Reviews","review":"I loved Donna Tartt's first book, and couldn't wait to buy this one. I certainly wish I had read the reviews, as the reviews on this site are exactly how I felt. I rushed though quite a bit of this book, hoping that it would get better. Then, when I finished, I was left with a strange feeling that I must have missed the ending somehow. What a terrible ending. Do not pay money to buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"sophomore slump","review":"After 'The Secret History', which made Tartt a near cult figure in literary circles, she took 10 years to come up with her sophomore novel. Well, so much for the long wait... To be fair, the writing is good, with a clear portrayal of a small Mississippi town and an extended family living in the aftermath of a grisly unsolved murder of a 9 year old.Harriet, the baby sister of the murder victim, picks up the thread of the mystery 12 years later, and opens up a pandora's box of secrets... However, Tartt lingers over too many characters and their side stories to get to where she is going, and the climax is, alas, a letdown, and the reader feels frustrated that the key characters don't seem any closer to achieving redemption and/or catharsis in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's still a good read............","review":"I picked up The Little Friend on a suggestion from a co-worker at my bookstore. I have not read her first book but I intend to.First off, the book doesn't give you an answer - the mystery will remain as such. However, it was a great read. I cared about little Harriet and how her whole world was falling apart. I liked her. I liked Hely, her friend. Harriet was a strong character - intelligent and a trouble-maker. At least she was not a mindless airhead like every other 12 year old depicted now-a-days.The book is worth your time. Remember the book is set back in the days where racism was still rampant. Tartt is not a racist, so I would prefer all idiots spouting that crap to stop.Enjoy the book and relax... not every mystery is solved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and tedious","review":"This book suffers from a writer enamored with her own writing ability. Donna Tartt puts together some lovely turns of phrase, but lacks the ability to come up with a plot.I kept reading diligently waiting for everything to come together, and that just never seemed to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get to the point, Ms Tartt","review":"I have to agree with most of the reviews for this novel. I was thrilled to pick it up for the first hundred pages or so. Ms. Tartt sets up the story perfectly for an interesting story--but did she deliver? No! The author drops the ball by going into painstaking detail of houses, objects, peripheral characters--and most of all, dull dialogue that has nothing to do with the main plotline. Three hundred pages later, you will be skimming page after page wondering if she will get to the point. Worse yet, the murder that is waiting to be solved in the meantime, unfolds predictably, without much suspense or twists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!","review":"As the mother of a toddler, spending what little free time I have reading a good book is definitely a luxury. After careful selection and much anticipation, though, this book was nothing but a huge disappointment and a major waste of time! It started out fine enough...suspenseful and quite interesting. However, it didn't take long before I forgot all about the murdered brother entirely, and found myself lost in the monotonous details of completely insignificant things (why DO we need to know the entire history of one cup?). Oh, and the end? Forget it! I found myself flipping the pages, certain that there had to be something else that I missed. Was it too \\"deep\\" for me? Did I somehow miss the meaning entirely? I doubt it. I honestly think Ms. Tartt simply bored herself into some kind of writer's block and decided to call it done. Ridiculous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING","review":"I can't believe I wasted so much time reading this 555-page book. The ending was SO thoroughly disappointing, that I was in disbelief. I'm the type of person who will always finish a book to the end, regardless of how bad it seems, because I optimistically hope it will get better. This did not. Too many unresolved issues, not enough character development, and most of all...they didn't even get to the bottom of the murder that started the book. I really had high hopes for this book, since I so enjoyed The Secret History. But, Tartt really fell short on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh my ...","review":"I never not finish a book. In fact, I'm usually up all night trying to finish whatever I'm reading because I can't put it down. But ... I have to say, I have just under 100 pages left to read and I just can't do it anymore. Each night I struggle to read two pages before I fall asleep out of boredom and frustration. I am so disappointed. I loved the Secret History (read it in two evenings) and much looked forward to reading this new one. And now, I doubt that the balance of the book will save it, especially from the comments below.Final comments: First, I read Crime and Punishment with more fervor. Second, if anyone in the book does anything \\"ostentatiously\\" one more time, I'm going to have to scream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Closure Please","review":"Donna Tartt has a beautiful style of writing, but evidentally has never heard of CLOSURE.

(Or is it supposed to be about a fifteen-year-old's summer fling with existentialism, in which we probably cannot expect a final resolution?) Harriet is a well developed, understandable character; however, this is not true of the other characters, which seem for the most part to be one faceted.

However, since I finished reading it, I have to ask myself what, if any, was the point of this novel. Sure, all the critics say brilliant this and brilliant that. Blah, blah, blah. I know better than to trust a critic, but I am very dissapointed in my friend. The characters, while well defined, are boring and rather wooden. The author tried so hard to describe them, I feel she forgot to make the reader like them. I also feel that the ending left a large question mark in my mind. I mean, honestly, why on earth center your plot on such a feeble, glossed over section of the character's history. As I said in the title of my little tirade, I Was Robbed!!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not reach page 50","review":"I am very disappointed in reading this book. The Secret History is one of my favorite books. Then finally Donnas new book came out. Very good reviews. Promising to be better then her debute. But I could not reach page 50. The book starts very slow, with a lot of loops going back to the same fact of the family's silence about the boys death. Several times I thought the story was really starting, but ten pages later I felt that I was at page 1 again. It also seems to me that she tried to write in a more literate manner, choosing words that are not used commonly. This only resulted in slowing down the story. Please just write the story like you did ten years ago. That was great, this sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is NOT The Secret History","review":"The Secret History is a book I read, reread, and read again (several times) in one sitting. There are very few books that seem to force you to turn the page and read on. It is easily one of my favorites. I have waited for Tartt's next book for years. Frankly, I was bitterly disappointed in The Little Friend. To say that it did not flow nearly as well as TSH would be a vast understatement. Although Tartt's descriptions of the life and times of Harriet were accurate, it was unbelievably boring. There were so many different charecters, each representing a sterotypical aspect of the time period. I can't think of one thing I liked about it except, it was written by an author who previously wrote an AWESOME book. Don't buy it, it's not worth it....I think I'll go read The Secret History again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tartt Not Sweet","review":"After what seemed like months of hype in magazines, book reviews and NPR, I was chomping at the bit to read The Little Friend. About half way through the book I began to wonder if all those critics had been given a different edition to read. The story idea is interesting, but the characters are wooden and the prose is awkward--a fine literary vocabulary, but decidedly lacking in finesse. I'd recommend Swan by Frances Mayes as an alternate read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get On With It!","review":"I loved The Secret History, so was very excited when this book was released. Yes, she does capture the South and Harriet is an appealing little kid, BUT. . .This isn't Faulkner or any other Southern writer. The plot just meandered along and I kept wondering when she'd get on with it. It was as if she used fillers on purpose. Definitely not worth my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Page Turner","review":"I could not put this book down. It's like an engaging beach read, with literary benefits. It's also like a detective story, except that there are no clues.

O.k. I'll buy the book...otherwise...I still can't get over the non-ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Little Friend","review":"I enjoyed The Secret History and The Little Friend, but they share the same weaknesses. The story-telling is rich with emotional detail, but it takes a large part of the book, which is an exceedingly long book, to get to any real action. And the ends of both books are a bit of a let-down. It seems the author didn't quite know where to go, so she just stopped.Two breaking points for me. 1) The death toll of abused animals-can anyone write a \\"serious\\" novel without a pile of road kill anymore? 2)Editing-there is a reason that good editors exist. They make art better for curbing the author's often irresistable need to fill up pages with words. Telling a well-written tale includes a healthy sense of self-restraint. An author that can edit themself is truly a gift to readers everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-read the Secret History instead!","review":"After a decade of anticipation, I was very disappointed. This book was very difficult to read. Some of the passages rambled for pages. After reading some of the flashback or dream passages, I had to go back several pages to see where the main story line left off. This book could have been a couple of hundred pages shorter with all the drivel cut out, and still been just as good (or bad). I think this is the only book (in 30+ years of reading) I have ever fell asleep trying to read. Save yourself the money, and reread The Secret History again. Ms Tartts sophmore effort fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Could Have Waited 50 Years","review":"What a waste of talent. How can someone with the ability to write The Secret History spend ten years writing this monstrosity as a follow up. The book is numbingly boring.

I read one hundred and seventy pages before giving up - and I was looking forward to reading the book !A major dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not believe it","review":"I love a good mystery novel, and reading the description on the jacket, it seemed like it might be like a mystery novel, so I delved into it. I read The Secret History a long time ago, and remember liking it, but don't remember that much about it. I chomped my way through this one chapter by chapter, even after it became clear it was not going to be a mystery. But after all that effort and time, I expected at least SOME resolution of a FEW of the story's threads, but nothing, NOTHING. I guess her deadline hit and she just had to publish what she had on hand. My anger and dissappointment negated any postive feelings I had about the story and characters developed in it. After reading a lot of other reviews here, at least I don't feel alone. Plus, I can save my husband from a time sink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sell It Back Quick","review":"I read the \\"professional\\" reviews of this book andcouldn't wait to get my hands on it. Too bad Ididn't wait for READERS to review this book. Mycomments echo the majority of reviews.

Thescene where Harriet and Hely manage to drop a poisonoussnake from an overpass and somehow have the snakelatch onto \\"Gum\\" Ratcliff as she drives below wasthe last straw. I tried to skip through to see ifRobin's death was ever explained but gave up. I'll haveto live without the knowledge. How sad to havesuch an eagerly anticipated book be such a downer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that great","review":"What a horrible and boring read, I guess she really only had one good book in her after all. The Secret History is my favorite book, The Little Friend was bad, predictable and boring. With 80 pages left and no suspense or story I was forced to skim to the end. It did not hold my intrest at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"long, boring and self-indulgent!","review":"Well, what a waste of time and money (for me!) Little Friend was. Having loved Secret History, and rating it as one of my all time fave books, Little Friend was one of the MOST boring books that I have read in a long time.I have no doubt that Donna Tartt can write, what I want to know is why she would waste her time with this self-indulget drivel? I actually thought that my book was missing it's final page, as I could not believe that after ploughing through it all, there was virtually no resolution!If you haven't bought this, don't bother - wait until it's in the bargain basement!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the Little Friend I wish I hadn't met","review":"Sometimes I wonder what planet I'm on when I read a book so highly recommended, that turns out to be so highly overrated.This book is beautifully written. Prose is layered upon prose, beautifully descriptive of a small southern town: Harriet reminds me of Scout in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" and the aunts are typical characters of early Truman Capote. You can smell the moss, and hear the drawl. You have uppity \\"nigras,\\" white trailor trash, ladies who have lost the mansion, mothers who have lost their minds, abusive fathers, preachers with snakes: even Houdini!! I believe the only charactor not thrown in for extra interest is a nun on a roller coaster.There are so many disfunctional characters in this book who are never explained that it made my head spin. This book has a lot of beginning, a ton of boring middle, and a real lack of ending.Never did figure out who the little friend was. Frankly, didn't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quantity does NOT equal quality","review":"With mucho expectation did I open this thick novel, only to find myself nearly unable to get through the chapters and chapters of pointless description and forced poetry. I confess it was painful - that awful feeling where you want to keep your eyes open, but they just won't stay open! In fact, I fell asleep a couple of times as I toiled. Is this a fun read? No way. Is it edifying in any way? Afraid not. It's just long. Tartt seems to think very little of her readers; she tries to impress with length, thinking you won't notice her lack of conviction or her inability to create vivid characters - or to plot an epic novel! People aren't as dumb as she thinks. And she should respect how hard most of us have to work to earn the money we make to buy her books! Well, never again. She's lost this fan for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A beginning, a muddle and finally an end","review":"Donna Tartt's style drew me in quickly and I had high hopes for The Little Friend. Having now ploughed through its 500-some pages I'm certain 300 of them could have been edited.Is Ms Tartt unable to leave any detail undescribed? Must everything be \\"like\\" something else? I cringed at certain synonyms (a rolled-up carpet like a log... an Aunt helps Harriet and Hely over it like a scout leader helping them across... surprise, a log). And why \\"shrubbery (privet, holly)\\"? In case readers ignore what shrubbery is? Towards the end I glossed over certain sections, confident they had no bearing on plot or characterization.Stereotypes abound too, in particular the black maids and housekeepers. It would not have surprised me to hear one of them utter \\"Mam'zelle Edith\\".Suffice to say that as I dutifully read the closing pages, I couldn't have cared less what became of Harriet or Danny and only the urge to be done with the story took me through to its end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT waste your time","review":"The ending is not even clever. It is like she just got tired of writing and stopped. The story is so complex and fascinating that I was ANGRY at the ending. The ending makes no sense. It is not worth reading through 624 pages. Truly, you will want to throw the book if you sit through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books ever!","review":"When I read the back cover describing a small southern town with racial undertones and an \\"unsolved\\" crime; it reminded me of To Kill A Mockingbird (one of my favorites.) However, Tartt is no Harper Lee. The endless inane descriptions made me wonder if she were being paid by the word. The lack of resolution was infuriating. It was as if she woke up one day tired of writing and just quit. Not only do I wish I could have my money back< I wish I could get back the time I wasted on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, boring","review":"I don't need to know every detail, like the mosquito bite Harriet's hand and she scratched it. Can't seem to remember the plot line it is so convoluted with all the intricate, unnecessary description of characters, places, thoughts. An insult to the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Friend = Big Waste O' Time","review":"Not since reading Anne Rice's the -Witching Hour- have I been so angry to come the closing pages of a book. While Donna Tartt won my heart with her fan-freaking-tastic novel -The Secret History- -- which remains one of my favorites -- -The Little Friend- lacks any sort of satisfying closure. Please don't tell me that was \\"the point.\\" If I wanted lack of closure I wouldn't read novels. Although I remained hopeful to the very end of page 624 that Tartt would use her considerable skills to tie up what could have been a compelling story, I ended up closing the book in disgust. Snakes are creepy; so are rednecks; but all the creepy and winding description in the world does nothing if it goes nowhere, which is where it went for this reader. Here's hoping her third novel respects the reader's need for a structured and tied-together plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infuritating waste of time","review":"The only reason I have generously given two stars is because I thought the plot was taking a good direction throughout the first quarter or so of the book, but went downhill from there. The completely unsatisfying ending was preceded by endless rambling. I held out until the end to hopefully see the murder mystery resolved...but no. Don't waste your time reading this book when there are thousands of others to enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderfully well written, but it ended oh so badly.","review":"\\"The Secret History\\" was one of the best novels I have ever read.And I was not disappointed when I started reading \\"The Little Friend\\". The disappointment came crashing down upon me when I finsihed reading it.Reminded me a lot of another favorite, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". To my delight Tartt was one of those rare authors who writes a stunning debut novel and, unlike Harper lee, follows it up with an even better second novel...or so I though until I got to the end.Call me old-fashioned and picky but I hate it when a story simply comes to a screeching halt without a satisfying wrapping up of all the various threads of the story, as if the author got tired or ran out of paper or ink or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and certainly over-rated","review":"This book was recommended to me, so I felt I had to finish it. Even people who don't like the story seem impressed with the characterisation, but my biggest problem with this and with The Secret History is that I never feel involved in the stories and can barely identify with any of the main characters.Both books appear technically good, but there's little in either beyond an initial good idea. Not recommended.I very nearly didn't finish The Little Friend and won't read any future books by Tartt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Library Journal Best Book of 2002 ???","review":"How many reviewers do you think were influenced by the success - and excellence - of Tartt's first novel?If the public was smart enough to pick out her first novel - and be right - might they not be correct about this one as well?The first dozen of so pages were great, but the author just got too enchanted with her own word processor."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE HEAVENS GATE OF LITERATURE!","review":"What a waste of talent!How can someone with the ability to write The Secret History spend ten years writing this monstrosity as a follow up. The book is numbingly boring. The first twenty pages or so are tolerable but the remaining 500+ are sleep inducing.Where is the story? Where is the development of characters? Where is the insight?I read one hundred and seventy pages before giving up - and I was looking forward to reading the book !A major dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"i'm so bummed....","review":"i had so much hope for another 'secret history' but this sure isn't it. what happened? i kept thinking if i read just one more page it would get better, but it never did. the whole snake thing was just too much, too ridiculous. i don't think this would even make a bad movie. c'mon, donna, where's the stuff?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss Scarlett, I don't know nothin' 'bout plottin' novels!","review":"Swept up in the rapture of her own dense, boozy, swampy verbiage, Miss Donna done gone and misplaced her plot! If someone can find it for her, the great American novel might have a fightin' chance. As is, it's goin' down with the rest of the old, Deep South. Guess she was just aworried 'bout bein' taken seriously as a poetic type writer. But I fears she done gone hog wild with them words. Miss T stuck in some action parts, but they sure ain't long enough or real enough to save the rest from asinkin'. Mammy needs to kick some sense back into Missy T's head I think. Git her back on track."},{"rating":"1","title":"In desparate need of an editor!","review":"It is the story of a 12 year old lost in a world of depressed and nonsensical adults caused by the unsolved murder of her brother years before that drones on and on with descriptions and commas and semi colons and colons and paragraphs composed of one sentence!!Please! The story, in and of itself is gripping but one must find it in the wordiness of the writer. This book reads like someone chatting on and on in your ear with you waiting desparatly to find out what is it all about??? And the ending leaves a lot to be desired! You finally get to the meat of the story and \\"BAM\\" it is over with loose ends flailing every which way. My advice - leave it unless you have nothing better to do and enjoy long winded talkers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where oh where has our little Tartt gone?","review":"What have ten years done to Donna Tartt? As one reviewer put it, in recent photos she looks uptight like she's just sucked on a lemon, and now she has written this lemon of a book! She seems to take herself VERY seriously. And it has taken a toll on her writing. Is she suffering an identity crisis? She seems to be torn between art and entertainment. If she really wants to write poetry like Eliot then she shouldn't be writing novels for the common folk. The Little Friend is, to be kind about it, not the most exciting read. Tartt may be in love with the sound of her own voice, but it's presumptuous of her to think anyone else will love it. In ten years, she has become more academic than she was before. The Secret History was one of my favorite books. I sincerely hope she gets down off her high horse and writes something enjoyable again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I was so relieved when I finished this book! I was on a waiting list at the library for it so I was eager to read it, but I must say it was tedious reading. I wanted to give up several times but thought I should continue, so I was quite dissapointed when I came to the end and nothing was resolved. I soon tired of Harriet's sullenness. Although the other characters were well written, there was no pay-off.If you have a lot of time on you hands, go ahead and try it, otherwise I think you should pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think my book is missing the last chapter....","review":"I have never read Tartt's first book - so I have no basis for comparison. However, I was extremely disappointed in this book. I found the story interesting, and I fell in love with Harriett. However - the main premise of the book is based on her brother's hanging. Little Harriett decides to find the killer. 550 pages later - we have no conclusion to our mystery, and the book ends without any kind of real *ending*. I'm either missing the last chapter, or there's a part 2 I don't know about. I doubt I'll read another Tartt novel after this. Never been so disappointed with an ending before."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE MOST INFURIATING BOOK I HAVE EVER READ","review":"THIS STORY HAS LEFT ME TOTALLY AT A LOSS FOR WORDS.ALTOUGH I WANTED DESPERATELY TO FINISH IT I COULD NOT.THE STORY WAS LOST IN TOO MANY OUTSIDE PERSONALITIES & PLACES. IT'S NOT FOR READERS WHO ENJOY A GOOD STORY LINE."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment.","review":"This book is awful. I'm glad I borrowed it from the library. I finished it and was disgusted with how weak the ending was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soured on Tartt","review":"I read The Secret History and fell in love. The relationship lasted ten years. Tartt seemed cool, a talented chick with integrity. But our love affair is over. A little friend came between us. A little friend who is definitely not cool. Donna's not the same writer I fell for. Maybe success went to her head. The Little Friend is too rich for my blood. But Donna's in another stratosphere now. She's left her people behind and taken up with some rarified cats. I wish my baby would come back down to earth and get real again. Get writing good again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author's conceit","review":"The Little Friend was one of the least pleasurable reading experiences I've had in years. Tartt did a terrific job on her first book, The Secret History. That book was magical AND suspenseful. With this new one, Tartt strains to achieve an even higher level of magic, but that is NOT a quality that can be forced onto the page. Instead, she offers up is page after page of over-heated, meaningless description and contrived character development that simply does not achieve significance. It is almost as if she, in her inflated self-belief, has tried to trick readers into thinking that The Little Friend is some sort of literary masterpiece. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Little Friend is a desperate work of artifice that falls short of mystery and poetry. Her first book had both qualities, effortlessly. This time she has tried too hard, and the result is hard to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Kill a Mockingbird look alike , Set in the 70's","review":"If I had not read all the rave reviews over this, my expectations might not have been so high, and I wouldn't have been so disappointed. This is a look alike of To Kill a Mockingbird (names of characters have been changed to \\"protect the innocent\\"-and perhaps to avoid questions of plagarism)so,I'm not sure why this book/story was 10 years in the making. Tartt does have a way with words, but the lack of originality was surprising. If you haven't read To Kill A Mockingbird, then this may be new territory for you-it is not totally without merit. If your still curious, check the book out from your local library,borrow from a friend, or wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"Aren't there laws against false advertising? The Little Friend is touted as some kind of literary masterpiece/opus/mystery. What it really is is a protracted mood piece, a series of dense vignettes stuck randomly together. The author shows off her facility with words, lots and lots and lots of them. Okay, we're impressed. Great vocabulary. But does this chick know how to tell a story? Or did she accidentally leave the plot at the bank? A page turner this is not. A convoluted homage to Faulkner, Dickens, Stevenson and Harper Lee it most definitely is. But just because Miss Tartt can allude to her greater forbears does not mean this book justifies the cost, nor does it mean you will enjoy it. Big it is. Generous it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?????","review":"I wish this book had ended differently, Actually, I wish that it had just ended. I thoroughly enjoyed reading \\"The Little Friend\\" with its wonderful attentive detail to atmosphere and characterization, but when I closed the cover, I felt cheated. I'm dismayed that I spent all the hours, many of them late at night, turning pages and devouring word after printed word, only to find that when it ended, there was no resolution. Nada, none, zip, zilch. Bleah. I like my books to have an ending. It doesn't have to be a warm, fuzzy, happy, feel-good ending, just an ENDING!I sure didn't find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Little Friend","review":"To enjoy \\"The Little Friend,\\" one must not only suspend disbelief, one must abandon it entirely. This thin tale, bloated to epic proportions, is an exhausting mess of a book. The only reason I finished it was because I was reluctant to hurt the feelings of the friend who loaned it to me and recommended it with great enthusiasm. Ms. Tartt leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination, excruciatingly detailing everything possible, from facial expressions, to clothing, to settings, to what the character did - or did not- or perhaps possibly did or did not - see, think , do, etc. (The screenwriters will have a very easy time of it.) There is not one truly engaging or believable character and the author telegraphs every supposed surprise. Worst of all, this really a distasteful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like it...","review":"I am an enormous fan of The Secret History; it has been my favorite book since it was published. I could hardly wait to receive this book in the mail & read it. I am sorry to say-there is no good reason to recommend this book. It is way too long; the storyline about the redneck Ratliff family is boring and feels out of place with everything else (even though those characters are part of the \\"plot.\\") The main character is not too likable-though she has a really lousy life-so you can't blame her for her behavior. I hope this book turns out to be an aberrant blip in the remainder of Donna Tartt's writing career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a long wait for so little","review":"I can't tell you how excited I was to see the new book by Donna Tartt. I continue to rave about Secret History for its detail, intrigue, etc. After reading this one, I am almost embarrassed about my past propaganda...It's almost unbelievable that this is the same author. In the last book, you couldnt wait to turn the page to see what happened to each character. In this book, I honestly couldnt have cared less. I kept on reading expecting to find some hint of that fabulous writing but was disappointed with each chapter/section.I was almost happy to see that other Tartt fans here agree with my assessment...I was wondering if I was losing it.Trust me. Some things aren't worth waiting for...."},{"rating":"1","title":"How disappointing...","review":"After recently finishing The Secret History by DT, I eagerly purchased The Little Friend. After such a masterpiece, I was tremendously let down. I read on and on (just as you will do if you loved TSH), hoping and hoping, ending up bitterly enraged at a solid waste of my time. DT's prose is hypnotic. Her characters are deeply engaging, but in the end the denouement evaporates like a death moth to flame. The most satisfying climax may be your own hurling of the book across the room in agonized frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where were the facts checkers?","review":"This author can write words, but words do not a good book make. Too many bits and pieces with only occasional good writing and plot development. Too many errors. The biggest one being that few meth labs were found east of the Mississippi River until 1980s! (First one found in Mississippi was in 1985.) Now if I can find that one fact, why couldn't this author--or at least her editor? The dead brother with red hair is supposed to look like his grandmother, then by the end of the book, Harriet, with black hair, is the image of the same grandmother. I could go on. I think Ms. Tartt is living the good life on the success of her first book and never got around to putting this story together until time ran out. Wish I had read these reviews first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harriet's Hauntings","review":"This novel may drag a little, but then, all books over 400 pages tend to.It's very interesting on the point that this seems to be a study about a girl haunted. And how could she not be? Her family is a gallery of horrors and monsters and she seems to try to hold to a semblance of normalcy. Is that the reason people have to see her as a bizarre character?Her mother is an emotional cripple, her father's a plain creep, her grandmother lives on another word, and so does her sister.Following the fascinating loops Tartt has designed, the horrifying consecuences of her acts prove that the \\"whodunit\\" motif is just wool pulled over the eyes. This novel is so much more than that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwritten...","review":"...and not at all to my taste. The prose is excellent, but there is far too much of it, with far too little to say. Also, I have a strong feeling that Ms. Tartt has been reading Angela Thirkell. The descriptions of Edie might have been lifted right out of Thirkell."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am a disappointed Tartt fan","review":"The Secret History is my favorite book, so I was really looking forward to her new novel. I had the book on order long before it was released. What a disappointment. It took me months and months to finish because I simply was not interested in any of the characters, the story or even the writing style. this book was really painful to read. It really isn't about the disappointing ending, but the almost unbearable journey getting there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absorbing tale of two families","review":"I really enjoyed this book! The main character and supporting cast were fascinating. I feel that the reviewers who criticized it as boring, or because it didn't come to a conventional conclusion are off base. Its full of wry humor that at times made me laugh out loud, and insights about childhood that are a bit like Stephen King (IT) on a good day, with a bit of Faulkner thrown in. The way the two families were woven together was worth the price of admission even if the book had no other virtues. I also liked that Little Friend doesn't fit easily into any genre or category. It is very different from \\" A Secret History\\" but can stand on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing.","review":"After reading and rereading The Secret History, I could not wait for Ms Tartt's second novel. I was very disappointed. I could not finish this book, because I was bored with the story that went nowhere and the characters I could not care less about. I hung in there 3 quarters of the way and then gave up. My sister managed to make it to the end and told me it did not get any better and I did not miss a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with this book","review":"This book was too long for the story that is being told. The author likes to go into little nitty gritty details that aren't important to the plot or flow of the story. There are parts that are extremely entertaining, but then it slows down and I found myself skimming the pages to get through it.I really like Harriet, though. I wound up getting really wrapped up in her and caring mostly about her more than the other characters.And I was extremely disappointed with the ending. Don't want to give away anything, but for a 600+ pages book, the ending is not satisfying and I felt like I wasted a few days of my life with reading this book and investing time into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Endlessly hoping for something to happen","review":"I guess I was expecting a mistery and got a sleeping aid instead. Honestly, I could only bear listening to the unabridged tapes while driving (there's nothing that I hate more than driving) and trying to fall asleep (for which the book did wonders).I kept hoping that beyond the endless descriptions of characters there would be at least some lame attempt to make it into a story with a plot. The abridgement of an abridged version would at least get you through the pain more quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Excellent premise, brilliant writing, but, in the end, very disappointing novel. A huge let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long","review":"I like suspense and I like mystery, and this book had both, but the story never really climaxed. There was so much unneeded description and running around. Only until Harriet went to the tower at the end did it get good and then nothing. I was disappointed.

If only Ms Tartt had followed her own advice. That she CAN write is not the question. It's whether she really wanted to write this particular novel that one is left wondering."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of Secret History","review":"The Secret History was a wonderful surprise. It was an excellent, enthralling read which I couldn't put down. The follow up was different in many ways. It was a little long, a little less interesting and not a patch on the first work. The characters though well developed did not evoke my interest. There was little sympathy or empathy with any of them. An interesting idea for a book but ultimately led to a feeling of what was the point?Tartt is a wonderful writer. The book is not bad, it just wasn't my taste. For the type of book it was someone like Carl Hiassen does it much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anachronisms","review":"The observations that have been made regarding the need for some editing, as well as praise for the beautifully drawn characters in this book, are apt.I was tremendously distracted by, and had trouble suspending disbelief over, the inconsistencies regarding just when the action was taking place. In one summer, our characters watch Dark Shadows, see the Patty Duke movie of the week \\"Me, Natalie,\\" get in trouble for stealing Star Wars action figures, and call each other \\"Dude.\\" 1969? 1977? 1983?"},{"rating":"1","title":"many incomplete books","review":"This is not a single novel, but a bunch of first drafts thrown together, and none of the plot lines or characters reach any conclusion.Tartt was undoubtedly afraid of \\"sophmore slump\\" after The Secret History, and she had every right to be afraid, as she nailed the dud 2nd try perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"600 pages of waiting to find out by whom or at least why or at least SOMETHING about the death of a nine year old boy in his own back yard and we get nothing. If it had been a terrible book I would never had gotten frustrated, because I simply would not have hung in that long, but it was haunting and the characters were wonderfully developed. That doesn't excuse the virtually dishonest cover flaps: there is no mystery, there is just dysfunctional family life on both sides of the tracks in a small town in Mississippi. Unless being depressed by most of a novel and then being infuriated by the last 4 pages when you realize that you will gain nothing by having spent some of your precious summer novel time on it, stay away.p.s.

I wanted to like Harriet and her quest to find and convict her dead brother's murderer, but the book is just so flat. We have Harriet and her large family of aunts, caretakers, her absent father, the car salesman, the gross-out of all snake-handler and his boxes of snakes. Then the Ratcliffe family, and frankly the only time the pages come alive--except for the horrible snakes--is when the Ratcliffes are present. I stuck with this book until the bitter end, and the only part about the end of the book that was sweet, is that it was finally over. Now I am be free of those pesky adverbs and parentheses that Ms Tartt finds so appealing. Oh, the pain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big Disappointment","review":"FOR SERIOUS INSOMNIACS ONLY, this book clocks in at 555 dull, slow-paced, un-evenly written pages. These pages contain lifeless characters of no redeeming qualities whatsoever, entrapped in a story so long and boring, the reader could only hope there would be illustrations to wake oneself up.What's most disappointing is the writing style. How many times (in a single paragraph - never mind the whole book!)can an author begin a sentence with, \\"Then suddenly...\\" There's no surprise or anticipation for the reader, since everything 'suddenly' happens. Along with this, the author uses such words as \\"whoosh! went the car driving by\\"...\\"clang! went the bell\\"...\\"zoom! went the bikes\\". The only thing she didn't use was 'kapow!' and 'shazaammm!' from a good comic book (and that's too bad - it would have been the only source of excitement if she did).\\"THUMP!\\" went the book cover to this book when I finished it - never to be opened again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Supremely pretentious","review":"I applaud Amazon for posting all these reviews. Would that I had read some of them before attempting to get through this impossibly wordy, empty book. Tartt's philosophy seems to be why say something with just one word when you can say it with fifty words? Truly, she appears to be infatuated with the sound of her own excessive typing. Little Harriet Cleve Dusfresnes - can you say that fast ten times? - is a heartless creation. I certainly hope she is not based on the young Tartt, though judging from the relentlessly cold prose that Ms. Tartt seems so enamored with, it's entirely likely. The Little Friend is an overcooked stew of southern stereotypes and cliches. I suspect Ms. Tartt left out the ending to prime her readers for Return of The Little Friend in less than another decade. But I sincerely hope that's not the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lugubrious has new meaning","review":"At first I was thrilled by the rich language and atmosphere of this hefty novel by the mysterious vanishing Tartt. But I soon found myself dozing off and unable to keep up my own enthusiasm for The Little Friend. I lost track of the characters. As for the plot - what happened to it? In the last analysis, neither the characters (you've seen them all before) nor the prose (way too much of a phony thing) add up. But you can throw away those sleeping pills! A great investment for insomniacs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Future readers of this book BEWARE","review":"I actually enjoyed reading this book and I even dreamed of snakes last night . . . yuck!

Which Aunt was which? What happened to the point? Believe me I have more questions.But bottom line is the author does have talent,she made me remember with clarity the thought patterns of my childhood.She would make use of it if she wrote a sequel to this novel and satisfied us all with an explanation.There is a reference to \\"your little friend\\" as being Hely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many words, too little thinking","review":"This book would have been served well by some serious editing. Unnecessary, tedious descriptions did not add to the plot, characterization or interest of the story. I did not find the text particularly well written, and so the extra words were not enjoyable. Often times, all that was needed was the first and last sentences in the paragraphs. I found it excessively boring and depressing. Things only marginally came together at the end, but overall the ending was unsatisfying, mostly because none of the characters seemed to change (except the ones that died) or grow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really disliked this book. The plot was practically non-existent, as was the ending. I LOVED The Secret History and bought this book in hardback (something I never do) because I couldn't wait to read it. It was so boring I finally just read the last chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"We've been hoodwinked.","review":"The Little Friend, the literary con game of the decade. I know why all the pictures and portraits of Donna Tartt have her looking straight ahead and unsmiling. If she were to part her lips, she'd probably burst out laughing and thinking that as Barnum said, There's One Born Every Minute. Shame on Knopf for not only perpetrating this crime, but for doing it willingly. Where is the editor who should have forced Ms. Tartt into writing an outline? Where is the editor who should have insisted on plot? Where is the editor who should have edited this pale excuse for an important novel and cut at least a hundred pages? The worse part of all this is that she shows moments of brilliance that make taking all the rest of this bad medicine even harder to swallow.This is all a sham and unfortunately legions of readers were willing to be taken in. If Ms. Tartt spends another decade writing another book, I will have no trouble at all waiting. An inexcusable travesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs an editor","review":"As someone who really liked The Secret History, I found this book a real let down - and I am NOT looking for \\"another\\" Secret History. This book is filled with too many Southern cliches and annoying characters. I'm not sure if we are supposed to care about Harriet. Frankly, I was hoping she'd drown in the watertower. For someone who is supposedly smart Harriett is profoundly stupid -- as are so many of the central characters -- and I don't care to read 750 pages about stupid people. It's also tinged with snobbery, racism and stereotyping, especially of African-Americans. The author should think twice about comparing herself (favorably) to Herman Melville and Dickens - except, of course, if she's talking only of sheer length. Maybe her novella will be better, it will certainly be shorter. Next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really?!","review":"I am dumbfounded at all these negative reviews. The Little Friendis one the best Southern novels of the the past fifty years. She doesn't wrap anything up in a bow and hand it to you resolution-wise, much like every other great writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG, SPRAWLING, DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"Do NOT get sucked in by this book! Do NOT give in the pages and pages of lush prose and evocative characters and locales! Do NOT let \\"The Little Friend\\" get the better of you! Why not? Because the absolute LEAST a 600-page novel about a girl searching for her brother's murderer should do is tell you whodunit! And it does not! What a big, beautiful, sprawling waste of time this is. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I loved the Secret History, so I had high expectations for this book. Boy was I disappointed! I read the hardcover edition, and I felt that it was about 150-200 pages too long. Unfortunately, they were not consecutive pages, so I couldn't just skip over the parts that dragged. I believe the story had promise, but the follow-through and character development weren't there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immensely unsatisfying ending","review":"Just finished this one. Let's just say that after reading 625 pages of a novel where the little boy gets murdered on page 1, it's hugely disappointing and appallingly cheap not to FINISH THE STORY and let the readers know who committed the crime.I would have given this 1 star, but Tartt is a good writer and having grown up in the South I thought her dialog was true-to-life. Otherwise, don't waste your time. I also agree that the book would benefit from some serious editing. How many descriptions of the trees do we really need?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank goodness I'm not the only one","review":"Like everyone else I looked forward to this book with great expectations. \\"The Secret History\\" is one of the best books I have ever read and I expected this book to be of the same calliber. I was dead wrongI thought the plot was thrilling, the characters well developed, I understood Harriet's pain and obsession and I even undersood why the book wasn't a \\"happy\\" one. What I did not understand was the ridiculous ending. Like others I asked myself \\"What in the world was the point of all of that?\\" Just a little bit of resolution would've been nice. I am thourougly dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lost Premise","review":"This book was overly long, and it seemed like the original premise got lost in the story. Ms.Tartt can certainly write, but I felt the writing took over the story. Certainly the book jacket is misleading. What was the story she was trying to tell? As others have mentioned, the ending is a non-ending. Was I disappointed....most definitely!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fresh Perspective","review":"Well, I have never read her first book, which everyone else seems to be comparing this one. Therefore, I had no preconceived expectations. However, after reading this one, I don't want to read anything else by this author. This was one of the biggest wastes of time I have ever read. The only reason I finished it was to find out \\"who did it.\\" Well, guess what? She (Tartt) didn't even give me that satisfaction.The first couple of (long) chapters were good and interesting. It was downhill from there. Tartt bogged us down in detailed descriptions of things that had nothing to do with the plot. I literally skimmed and skipped through entire pages!Do NOT waste your money on this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I don't know what happened here. Somewhere between The Secret History and The Little Friend Ms. Tartt forgot that she's supposed to be telling stories. Where is the story in this book? I actually returned it after suffering through 200 pages -- I didn't care how it ended and developed an intense dislike for Harriett. The other characters were mired in cliche, both classist and racist, and the faux-Southern Gothic writing style came across as just plain faux.Hopefully Ms. Tartt returns to the basics and concentrates on telling a good story, rather than writing florid prose for the sake of writing florid prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree...","review":"with the above negative reviews. I finished the book last night and could barely slog through the last 100 pages. Where's a good editor when you need one? The book detoured into too many directions with an unbelievable resolution. I thought Tartt left behind her original premise of Harriet's solving the murder of her brother and went into a writing frenzy about rednecks on speed. I loved The Secret History, but was disappointed by her second effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half Hearted Effort. I want my money back!","review":"This book is an insult to its readers. I want my money back!!!Donna Tart is wonderful with words, but there's no plot here, no message, and even no ending that I could see. I loved her first book but this book has a rambling, go-nowhere style that is shocking for an author of her abilities. I am a published writer myself and I think if this had not been Donna Tart's book it would have seen one rejection letter after another. And HOLY COW where was the editor!!!??? Was she locked in a closet until after the book was printed? This isn't even a passable first draft of a book. Shame on you Donna for not applying your considerable talent to make this the book it could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the ending?","review":"Reading a 550 page book for me can be daunting yet this book entertained me enough to continue only to reach the end and find that there wasn't one. Ms. Tartt certainly is an able writer but to leave the reader after so many pages feeling let down is not a good idea. I didn't read her first book and now, thought the critics raved, will probably skip it after being so disappointed with the conclusion (or lack there of) of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letdown","review":"I just need to agree with all the other reviewers who awarded this book just one star. I DID manage to get to the end but only because I thought such a novelist deserved commitment. But it was such a disappointing read. It's a book that starts well but quickly fades away and leave the reader quite bewildered. I agree with others when one seriously wonders if this is the same author who wrote The Secret History. Luckily I borrowed it from the library, so didn't waste my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laborious and bursting at the seams","review":"I simply agree with all that has been said beforehand on the overblown and mindless prose. There is hardly any character development and is bursting at the seams with tartty racism and a patronizing attitude. A horrific second novel. Stick to secret history and do not see the movie when it is made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regardless of her past work...","review":"I know the pitfalls associated with comparing an author's second work to their first, especially since the public abhors change and wants the artist to keep producing the same art that made them so initially famous.However, Tartt's second novel fails alone -- even if TSH had never been written, TLF still fails on several levels. It lacks focus, is in need of much editing, and the central plot isn't a strong enough thread to keep the reader interested. The characters are predictable, and there is no resolution at the end (which is fine, in some cases. Tartt is no Hitchcock, and didn't provide us with enough mini-resolutions to make up for the gaping hole at the end).Between her first novel and her second, Ms. Tartt seems to have become seduced by her own hype. This book comes across as egotistical, and ultimately, selfish. It wasn't written for us, it seems. Only for members of the court eager to get a glimpse of the Emperor's new clothes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A whole lot of nothing going on.","review":"I am just completely baffled that the author of \\"The Secret History\\" could have written such a pointless and unsophisticated book. I could not put \\"The Secret History\\" down. I cared about its lonely narrator even as he was drawn into this fantastic and terrible group of friends. That book was witty, allusive and self-conscious.This book devotes an entire chapter to the death of the family cat as though that really were a significant event. Some reviewers suggest that there is some kind of social commentary on racial injustice going on here. Are they kidding? These characters came right out of \\"Gone with the Wind.\\" This is like 555 pages of Nancy Drew. Twelve year olds are just not that interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Masses and the Ph.Ds agree","review":"Those bored with this novel aren't necessarily mass-market readers or instant gratification junkies--I'm getting my Ph.D in English Lit, so I have pretty high tolerance for dense material, but I'm finding this an interminable, excruciatingly dull read. Every time Harriet bumps her knee or rides her bike, we have to hear about it for ten pages. The longer I stick it out with this novel, the more it seems like a parody of itself. Speaking of boring, has anyone else noticed Tartt's self-satisfied views on race? She constantly beats us over the head with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm exhausted!","review":"It has never taken me so long to finish a book. The best thing about Ms. Tart's Little Friend is it showed me how musch self discipline I can muster. For a while I thought if her next book comes out a decade from now I will have just finished this one. My expectations parralelled the hype--unfortunately the end product missed the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait or the time","review":"It's not that Donna Tartt can't write; it's that she can't STOP writing. What the editors did, I cannot guess -- there are no typos but this book would benefit by some paring down. The story of a downward spiraling family, it offers no resolution, just a long, long read but not a satisfying one. While I admired and enjoyed reading her debut novel, this one disappoints. Three-quarters of the way through this sad story, I realized I didn't like any of the characters nor did I care very much about them. Ms. Tartt's writing is curt -- and full of asides, like so -- and I felt as though I were reading a first draft that, yes, was 10 years in the making."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm putting it down now","review":"As an avid reader and having recently read \\"The Secret History\\", I eagerly looked forward to this novel. Ugh...I'm 300+ pages into and really have no investment in the characters or how they evolve. This exactly why I decided to skim other readers' reviews. Thank you! Perhaps one day in the distant future I will pick up the book again...but at this point it seems a laborious task and a waste of time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"I have never written a review before but I felt the need.The end of this book just infuriated me. Every critic that proclaimed this book to be \\"amazing\\" must have been high. I didn't mind the 600+ pages or the endless descriptions of sights, sounds, and smells. I actually enjoy a long book with attention to detail. However, I did mind the many hints that pervaded the book that never seemed to go anywhere. I felt that Tartt was tired of her own book towards the end and,instead of investing more time and energy into it, through it by the wayside. I just wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Grotesque","review":"I could not finish this book. It kept spiraling downward with more grotesque and stereotypical characters on every page. I couldn't finish it.I don't understand why the critics raved. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first 400 pages were slow, but then it got OK...","review":"If you liked \\"Secret History,\\" then go read it again! Don't read this. This was a hugely disappointing second novel. I loved \\"Secret History\\" and its rich characters and yummy details and great plot. This novel just plodded along with characters that you didn't care about or what to learn about. The book crawled along, but the last few chapters were OK. A decent payoff for the labor of surviving the first 400 pages. In a nut shell: Skip this book and re-read \\"Secret History.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I Gave Up Too","review":"Loved Secret History (as did many readers) but just couldn't get up the steam to get through this one. Importantly, SOMEONE (another reviewer) took it upon themselves to give away the ending (don't worry, I won't) so that definitely took the wind out of my sails as well. Shame on you! C'mon, fellow readers, you know better than to do that to those of us looking for some words of wisdom!Personally, I think the book is not worth the time investment. But go read Secret History ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthwhile chunks floating in a distended mass of words","review":"In 1992, Donna Tartt published The Secret History, an overly-praised piece of well-written juvenilia which generated much undeserved hype. A decade passed before her second novel, The Little Friend, came out. Like her previous work, this one starts out on a promising note, with pages dripping of Southern Gothic and parallels with To Kill a Mockingbird. Unfortunately, the narrative drags on way too long with pointless detours and false starts before much of anything really happens. Although there are some interesting regional caricatures, what this text needed most was a fearless and honest editor. At least now we have a five letter word for \\"over-rated.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The only mystery is the hype - WHY???","review":"As the other reviewers have already noted, this was a tiresome, detailed, lengthy read - and, that was only after reading 1/3 of the book. The prologue was great, but, the rest of the story just dragged on and on and on..... In my long history of reading, this in only the second book that I just couldn't finish..... The only reason I stayed with it for 189 pages was so as to not hurt my husband's feeling on his choice of a Christmas present - he was mislead by all the hype also. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAAACK!","review":"Most reviewers here have hit the proverbial nail on the head regarding Donna Tartt's \\"The Little Friend\\". I only wish I'd read them before I wasted money and time on this rambling, long-winded, unresolved tome. Hire an editor, Donna baby, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Preposterous and disappointing","review":"I really liked her first novel, and liked the premise and promise of this at the beginning. However, the plot was preposterous - NOBODY would act the way these characters do at the end. Why do the black and lower class white characters speak in dialect, but the \\"resepctable\\" whites don't ? The druggie low life types were straight out of a made for TV movie - cardboard and unbelievable. We know she can write well, so why crank out comething like this ? I only finished it (grumbling all the way) because I wanted to know the solution to the mystery, and guess what ? More disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Last Christmas I ordered a few things from Amazon, and this book was one of them. I first saw it in a teen magazine, and from that summary along with Amazon's summary, I thought it was going to be good. Boy was I wrong. I never read it until this Thanksgiving, and just finished it today, when it normally only takes me a week or less to get through a book. This book had no point, and all the author did was ramble on and on about stupid things. She explained far too much, and jumped around more than a bag of jumping beans. I was very disappointed, and very sorry that my mom spent $15 on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed Attempt to Become the New Harper Lee","review":"There are a lot of negative reviews already, but if mine will deter just one person from reading this book, then adding my 2 cents is worth it. Yes, there are passages of beautiful description and some intriguing characters, but these are lost amid the hundreds of pages of worthless material. One gets the impression that Tartt was trying to write a portrait of Southern childhood that would rival To Kill a Mockingbird, and that might explain the \\"show-offy\\" verbosity of her prose. I started to suspect that she collected her favorite bits from writing exercises, journals, and abandoned short stories and threw them together hoping we'd be so impressed by her language we wouldn't notice the appalling lack of plot.No, you do not find out who killed Robin, and I'm fine with open endings when they have a purpose, but this strikes me as sheer laziness."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not boring- it's infuriating!","review":"I do not believe that this is a racist book at all- there are racist attitudes held by some characters, but as others have pointed out, it's set in the south in the 1970s. I didn't find this book at all boring either. In fact, I loved the entire thing until I got to the ending. At that point, this book made me furious. Hopefully this is not a spoiler; if so, I am sorry, but this book didn't really have an ending. It just came to a stop, all of the threads of the mystery still dangling in the air. That is why I'm giving it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring....pointless waste of my time","review":"I can not believe the glowing reviews others have left for this book. This is my first Tartt book and my last! I wanted to ditch it 1/3 into it.. but I have a rule to finish every book.I did not find one character to like, no good story line to keep me interested (besides finding Robin's killer! don't hold your breath!). I actually committed a first for me - I threw this book in the trash barrel to spare anyone else from picking it up.That says it all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"This book, for all the publicity and hype, had nothing to remarkable to reccomend it. I was not struck by the writing, was bored and doubtful of the plot, and felt the strongest thing I got from it was the writer's self-congratulation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Donna Tartt's The Secret History is one of my all time favorite books and one of the few books that I have actually read twice. I eagerly anticipated the release of The Little Friend and could not wait to get started. I'm sad to say that this book in no way compares to her debut. The Secret History is both intriguing and eloquent. The Little Friend is neither of these and is a chore to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss the plot resolution?","review":"Although the positive reviews about this book are correct in regards to this author's ability to tell a story, you should not underestimate the need of a reader to find resolution to a story. You will read this book and get all wrapped up in the characters...but at the end you will throw the book down in disgust. Not only will you NEVER find out who killed little Robin, you don't find out the resolution to a SINGLE plot point in the story. Everything is up in the air. I could not help wishing that the author had cut out a bit of the rambling dream stories and provided instead an actual ending to the story. I wish I had never read this book as I find myself often wondering if there is something about the story I just missed. Did the author give us a hit and I just missed it? Sadly no. This book is simply a beginning and a middle....no end in sight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"Don't waste your time. The book was interesting until the end. Very good plot but the ending was horrible. I read her other book and it wasn't that good either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Enjoyed the book very much. A page turner, I looked forward to reading it ever night. I think the lousy reviews on Amazon are way overdone. Judging by the ones written about this book I probably will not pay attention to them anymore as I read many books and found this one to be excellent. The first ten reviews I read on Amazon were pretty awful and not reflective of the book I read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the plot?","review":"After wading through 500-plus pages of poor imitation Proust, I was sorely disappointed with the unsatisfying denouement. Tartt seems conflicted; is she a commercial writer or an artiste? Is she literary or entertainment-oriented. With this, she's neither. It simply does not add up to a cohesive whole, and it asks a lot of any reader to make excuses for her not-so-little shortcomings. The Little Friend has little to offer to any kind of reader. The commercial aspect is a ..., and the literary aspect is forced, tries too had to be \\"great.\\" I wouldn't wish this on the most patient librarian!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've ever wasted time on","review":"If you like disappointment, not finding out the ending, characters who disappear, getting pulled into a scenario that just vanishes with no explanation, etc. then this is the book for you!After spending hours reading this trash I was furious when I got to the end. There is no end. None whatesoever. In the middle of a light conversation between two characters...BAM, the end. Ridiculous.Robin's murder is completely forgotten, the issue with Libby's maid wanting to \\"get what's coming to her\\" is forgotten, issues with the Ratliff brothers are forgotten, Allison's strange dreams are forgotten, etc. etc. etc. I could go on forever.It's as if Tartt started 20 little stories on notebook paper, never finished them, and then called them a \\"novel\\".She should be ashamed of herself. I'd be embarrassed to put my name on the cover of that monstrosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I purchased this book as soon as it was published, and couldn't wait to read it. I have finally read it, and I can't believe how disappointed I am. I absolutely loved \\"The Secret History\\", it is one of my all time favorite books that I have ever read. This book, as is her style, was fabulous when it comes character developement, scene descriptions, dark and gloomy mystery. But why couldn't she wrap up the loose ends and give the reader some sort of answer to the question of what happened to Robin? That was the only thing that kept me reading to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Second","review":"I have to agree with the reviewer stating that Tartt needed a better editor. How can anyone possibly compare this book with Ms. Tartt's first, The Secret History? The Little Friend was too detailed and drawn out...the novel lacked a consistent plot and the story was all over the place. I was sad to continue to the end of this novel because it was so terrible. Hopefully, we'll see an improvement from Ms. Tartt in future novels..."},{"rating":"1","title":"meandering, dissapointing...but hard to give up on","review":"Reading this book is like watching a baseball game where the score wildly and unexpectedly changes every inning - and with it, your interest in the matchup. At first, your team is up by three runs and the game is exciting. Then it's down by seven runs and you start to lose interest. Then they pull even, only to fall way behind again. Finally, in the 9th, your team loads the bases and can win with a grand slam, but instead meagerly pops out to the first baseman.My point: the book has some very promising parts - enough to keep reading - but is interspersed with meandering episodes that don't further the plot. Ultimately, as the book finally begins to pick up, it ends with a whimper, making at least 50 percent of it irrelevant. Ultimately, it's unfulfilling, somewhat frustrating and almost a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than a disappointment","review":"Like most readers, I looked forward to Tartt's second book, but I made myself wait until I could find a used copy. I'm sure glad I didn't pay full price! The Little Friend is a book that makes you want to skim pages to see if it eventually gets to the point. There are rambling descriptions of people, places and points of view that seem to have absolutly nothing to do with the story or character development. While these descriptions are often well written, in the end, I felt like they were a waste of time. I often found myself wondering if Tartt was trying to fill a book with a prescribed number of pages, to satisfy a publishing contract."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was so disappointed!...","review":"Like everyone else, I loved The Secret History. I only recently read it for the first time and was so excited about The Little Friend. While I enjoyed the character of Harriett, I was VERY disappointed by the ending. I just couldn't believe all that build up for 500 pages and then we learn absolutely nothing at the end. I felt like I wasted two very valuable weeks reading a book with no conclusion. This is the first review I've ever written of a book but I just had to say how disappointing the books was - especially the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tartt lays an egg","review":"Alfred A. Knopf publishers really deserve to put a warning label on the jacket of this deathly dull dud of a novel: CAUTION MAY INDUCE SLEEP! They also should be held liable for their outright misrepresentation of this book as a thriller/mystery. It is neither. But I guess they need to lie in order to make back their money. Tartt seems to have gotten carried away with the sound of her own pen - she writes in longhand apparently, though it doesn't make this book any better - but too much of a \\"good\\" thing is truly bad. Tartt can't make up her mind whether she's a commercial authoress or an academic. I hope she goes for the former and not the latter! Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"major letdown","review":"Like many other reviewers, I was a HUGE fan of 'The Lost History\\". I thought it was one of the best books I had read in many years. But 'The Little Friend\\" is a major disappointment. I couldn't even get through the whole book before I sold it on amazon[.com] to cut my losses. Interesting premise, but in dire need of some self-editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Like other reviewers, I couldn't get through this book-- and as someone who did her time as an English graduate student, I have the stamina for wading through less than thrilling work. But why do it if you don't have to, especially if you're expecting something compelling? The Secret History had a much tighter plot that moved along nicely, all the while creating a real sense of menace and melancholy. It was also fun to read. Reading this, I kept on waiting for all the dense descriptive passages and hints of violence to amount to something-- reveal a secret, or build to a conclusion. It didn't. I don't think this marks me a simple-minded reader. But I do think it indicates a real problem with this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I was lucky...I got this from my public library, so I haven't wasted any money, just time. It was a big disappointment to me, though some of the writing was good. There wasn't much insight into the characters and was certainly unsatisfying in its ending. I felt that the author had just done short stints of writing, little pieces of this and that, and then had strung them together to make a book. What really bothered me was the media hype around this book (front page of the NYTimes Review of Books, People magazine, a syndicated book review feature in my local \\"free press\\", to give some examples) which gave the impression that this was a wonderful book and that time spent reading it was worthwhile. I feel that I wasted my time and didn't come away with anything worthwhile. Maybe the author simply didn't know what to conclude, which is why there was no conclusion. I think she was searching for what this book was to be about, but never found it. Silly and boring, unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and depressing","review":"Boy, what a disappointment. After waiting years for Donna Tartt's next book, I snatched this tome up the minute it came out. Although Tartt's writing is still sharply observed and her phrasing crystalline, there's no real narrative arc here, and the situations in the book are unrelentingly miserable and depressing. It's very difficult to write about boredom, alienation, and abandonment without making your readers want to slit their own wrists in despair, and unfortunately, Tartt's book doesn't succeed. And the mystery promised in the opening prologue is never solved--we never find out who killed Robin, which, after 500+ pages, seemed like a rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip The Little Friend and go straight to Secret History","review":"I read The Secret History last winter and LOVED it-- even gave copies as Christmas gifts. I picked up The Little Friend anticipating the same, captivating stortelling and drama. WHAT a disappointment. I actually feel angry that I just wasted my time reading 550 pages that led NOWHERE. The story was slow and needlessly descriptive in so many places, I ended up skimming a quarter of the novel. I definitely feel cheated and would suggest skipping this novel in favor of Tartt's other, far more successful work, The Secret History."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely Disappointing","review":"As one who read Tartt's first book and much enjoyed it, I was looking forward to The Little Friend. What a disappointment it was, and I say this not because it didn't adhere to the classical form of the murder mystery. I didn't expect that it would or should.Why wasn't this book edited? Most of the middle section could have been eliminated; it served no artistic purpose: it didn't advance the narrative, nor did it enhance the character development. The Ratliff family could have been established as trash in 20 pages, tops. The ending was contrived; it's as if the author couldn't think of any way to get out of the situation she'd created and just took the path of least resistance. Numerous plot flaws. Loose ends. You get the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nancy Drew meets Harriet the Spy in beautiful prose","review":"Disappointing 500+ pages of gorgeously written but improbable and uninteresting story. Too bad the main character is 12 and named Harriet. I could not suspend my disbelief long enough to believe a 12 year old would engage in most of the activities I read about for hundreds of pages. I kept hoping a real story would emerge amongst the masterfully developed elderly sisters or the split and saddened family of Harriet. After the intense and complex psychology of a Secret History I found the motivations, antics and \\"suspense\\" of this new book underwhelming and at times formulaic. When she's hiding under a chair we get her view of the floor, if she's in the woods we get a leaf by leaf description, twice we are made aware of the mud rings on the warehouse door - memorable enough the first time to notice them a second time several hundred pages later. If you liked Nancy Drew....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was hooked into the book immediately. I read several books per week, but found this book to be very disappointing. I haven't a clue what this author was trying to tell us. It is unfortunate because the writing and suspense was for the most part superb! The book didn't end....it did not leave you hoping for more (unless you are like me and wanted to understand what the past 700 pages were supposed to climax into!) It has been a long time since I have been this disappointed in a book. If someone could explain to me what Harriet learned from the torture she experienced, I would love to hear from you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ten years of garbage in the making","review":"I thought the book was very messy. You find emotions being forced onto the page which doesn't help at all. It is a labour to get on with it and at one point picked up war and peace and thought \\"maybe\\". Then i put it down again and thought it through. My conclusion was, do not buy this money making future film. it's a good flu/aeroplane/trashy read and no more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tartt should fire her editor.","review":"This book was incredibly long without needing the long drawn-out pages upon pages of desciption. I honestly think 100 pages could have been cut out without damaging the plot in any way.The title has nothing to do with the story and neither does the creepy doll head photo on the cover. I kept waiting for some chuckie-like character to be introduced to explain the hideous cover. Now I know why this book was in the bargain bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST BOOK EVER WRITTEN","review":"This book was horrible! I cannot even tell you how disappointing it was to start reading it and be totally bored to tears. If I could, I would return and get my money back!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The clue is in the title........","review":"I've never come across a book with a more insipid title, and it should have been a dead giveaway as to what's in store. If you think about it, who in their right mind would write 500 odd pages and after all that effort, name it something so nondescript.Sadly the reviews are accurate - there's no plot to speak of, which I have to agree is a bit much after hauling that bulk around in the hope of some closure. I don't blame Ms Tartt so much, I like the sound of my own voice as much as she does, but what did her editors think they were being paid for??"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Novel Is A Sham","review":"Coming in at a laborious 555 pages the novel starts out well with an unsolved murder of a child. The next 554 pages are consumed with overwrought, boring characterizations and inept attempts to sometimes write in southern dialect and sometimes not. In some places her grammar is not only incorrect, but not even incorrectly artistic. This writer is so annoyingly sure of her genius that this misconception bleeds through every misbegotten sentence and ill begotten phrase. I wouldn't be surprised if Ms. Tartt financed the publication of this novel herself. I absolutely cannot believe a publishing house would consign this piece of S*#t to publication. To get what I'm talking about check out the author's photo on the back cover page!"},{"rating":"1","title":"4 hours of my life I want back","review":"Yuk. A mystery which is never resolved, boring, one-dimensional characters, and unbelievable events."},{"rating":"1","title":"overwrought and overrated","review":"A rock-bottom book that features a tinkertoy plot, derivative characters, and purple prose. This book manages the neat feat of going on forever and getting nowhere. Was there no editor, or was he/she simply ignored? To keep your dignity as a reader, get the real thing from Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor, Barry Hannah, Richard Ford or ol' Bill Faulkner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-aggrandizing Piece of Trash","review":"This book had some promise - the first chapter or two made for an interesting read. After that everything went to pot.It was quite obvious that the main character, Harriet, was a young Ms. Tartt. Or, how old Ms. Tartt envisioned young Ms. Tartt. This book was self-aggrandizement on an epic scale. Reading this was like wading through a swamp filled with so much bull that you could hardly move because of the smell.It took me over two years to finally finish the book. I started reading it approximately 15 times, each time putting it down for more interesting and intelligent texts, such as \\"The Cat in the Hat\\". I'm still not entirely sure what this book is about...murder, meth, snakes, or summer camp.This is the first and only book that has made me say the following:\\"I will never get the 10 or so hours of my life that I spent reading that back.\\"Seriously, Donna Tartt should have paid me to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to expectation!","review":"Count me among the HIGHLY disappointed. The Secret History is one of the best books I've ever read. The Little Friend, however, left me feeling very cheated, mad that I'd spent time getting involved in the lives of characters that went nowhere. IMO Ms Tartt is a talented writer. Her descriptions of character and events are vivid. Reading this book was like a winding train journey in which the train hits the brakes before reaching any recognizable destination.If you loved Secret History as much as most people, you'll have to see for yourself, but save a few bucks. Borrow a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystery Unsolved!","review":"Why I bothered to finish this book (when I didn't even like any of the characters!) is a mystery to me... as is the ending of Tartt's book. I guess I hoped that Tartt would form some kind of dramatic conclusion or surprise ending. But the only surprise was that there was NO ending and the mystery was never solved! I'm sure not going to hang around for a sequel. As a lover of literature, I usually come away from any book with at least one good thing to say. After \\"The Little Friend,\\" however, all I could say was, \\"I just read really bad book!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't wait to finish","review":"I enjoyed reading this book originally but it became very tiresome. The characters didn't engage me and the stereotypical degradation was overdone. Even though I was anxious to be done reading the book, I,like other reviewers, was stunned with the unfinished ending. I feel snookered by all the hype that went with the \\"long awaited\\" publication of this book.This review is actually of the book, not the abridged audio CD. Guess I entered it in the wrong place, sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the ending?","review":"Reading a 550 page book can sometimes be a little daunting yet this book entertained me enough to continue only to reach the end and find that there wasn't one. Ms. Tartt certainly is an able writer but to leave the reader hanging after so many pages was a turn off. I didn't read her first book and now, though the critics raved, will probably skip it after being so disappointed with the conclusion (or lack there of) of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame!","review":"Okay, first, don't read this if you don't know the ending...oops, what ending? You read 555 pages to never find out who the murderer is. The shame of it is, the book is so well written, but there is no closure to this book at all. Donna writes so well and this book had me as engrossed as The Secret History did, but I really feel now, that I wasted a lot of time reading this. And oh, one last question....Who is The Little Friend that the book is titled after??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Hurled At Wall","review":"I am not surprised by the fact that the professional reviews of this book are competely opposed to the reader reviews. I really doubt if the professionals actually read the whole book. If they had, they would have thrown it against the wall in anger just like I did. I did not expect a typical detective/mystery story, but I did expect a couple of answers at least. The characters are superbly realized, but a story can't be all character and no plot. And if an unsolved murder is the propelling basis for your whole book, you darn well ought to provide some ideas about whodunit. Book is lying on carpet, pages ruffled, will make a good hefty doorstop now."},{"rating":"2","title":"How it is like Secret History","review":"The Little Friend has a similarity to Secret History in the underlying sense of dread that builds as the plot progresses. I got right away that this book was not going to be about solving mysteries or revealing secrets..it's more of a coming of age story. Although I was a little disappointed in the ending at first, after thinking about it, I realized that the ending fit better with the overall tone of the story. The satisfaction of this book must come from an appreciation of Tartt's language. I found myself re-reading passages just for the pleasure of it. Her ability to draw character is such that I really felt like I got to know real people, living in a real place. I look forward to more from Donna Tartt, she is a major talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Little Bore","review":"What a disappointment! Too long and embellished. Where was her editor? Several little mysteries were contained in this book - none of which was answered. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"wtf?","review":"as a teacher, i can only wonder, which book was written by ms. tartt: TSH or TLF? clearly, they were not written by the same person. i stumbled upon TSH a few months ago, and felt like i discovered something special, and i did. TLF is the least entertaining book i've read in a while. i would like a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't want it to end (and it didn't)...","review":"Great stuff, To Kill a Mockingbird meets Steven King, only better. Ms. Tartt has a great ear for dialogue, writes flawless prose, and does a great Southern Gothic riff. Read and enjoy. Plot somewhat lacking and the book just stops rather than ends, but this is trivial. Inspired me to go buy her other book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't realize I had enjoyed such a bad book!","review":"Lesson learned here. This was a stay-up-late good read to me. I am so very glad I didn't see these reviews from disappointed readers before I started TLF. I might have missed out on one of the most enjoyable reading experiences I have had in a while. I thought the character development was excellent. And as for \\"who done it\\", I think it's pretty clear what the author was aiming for here... and I was not one bit let down. Just the opposite."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up","review":"I've only waited six years for this book to come out - since I got around to reading The Secret History kind of late in life, after it had already been around (and I resisted it for years) - but still, that book blew me away when I finally dove into it. The Secret History's a true masterpiece of storytelling and mood. So. How can I accurately convey my feelings about The Little Friend? Sadness. Disappointment. A sense of being let down. Also a feeling of concern for the author. Was she bullied into cranking out this false new book? Shockingly little of The Little Friend rings true. It's all grinding and machination and hard work that doesn't gel. I don't believe that Tartt's heart was in it. I almost couldn't finish it, and when I did, it left me empty. With a feeling of having been duped. Where did Tartt's magic go? Or was it all a beautiful fluke to begin with, too good to be true?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little let down","review":"For the first 50 or 100 pages of this novel, I thought that I was going to enjoy it more than The Secret History. I thought the characters were wonderfully vivid, especially Harriet and Hely. But as the book went on...and one...I got lost, and lost interest. The novel's climactic scene drew me back in, but the ending was extremely disappointing. I like novels that don't wrap everything up neatly, but, seriously, I thought the last few pages of the novel had been ripped out of my book. It just ended, leaving me wondering what the point of the whole book had been. Although The Little Friend is well-written, it lacks something to hold everything together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Done It?","review":"Do you think we'll have to wait another decade to find out who did it? This isn't really an online review - another one wasn't necessary given the accuracy of 99% of the other reviews already provided by customers - it's just a plea for some information. When I skipped past about 350 pages to read the final chapter, it was to break the boredom and find closure to the suffocated plot. I was blown away when I didn't find it! Unbelievably, I actually had to backtrack and skim through the 350 page quagmire to find it, only to be disappointed again. I was about to poll some friends who I know are reading the book, but was too ashamed and afraid to admit that I missed something so obvious. Kudos to Amazon for printing so many reviews, they helped validate the disappointment....Looks like we need an Afterword from Donna Tartt to clear this up - but I can't hold my breath that long!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We've waited ten years for THIS?","review":"\\"The Little Friend\\" is a 250 page story in a 550 page book andthe publishers should be sued for leading us to believe that this is a mystery, which is not. Look, I loved \\"The Secret History\\" and a lot of Tartt's shorter work. Her ode to Willie Morris is one of the most touching things that I've ever read.But, this latest thing is horrible.About the only thing that I can appreciate about the book is herdead on sense of Southern dialect and dialogue. Other than that, nothing. I hate the characters and I suspect that she's not really crazy about them herself, ambivalent at best.Sorry. Maybe in a another ten years she'll come with something that will be worthy of her time and ours because \\"The Little Friend\\" is certainly not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Ms. Tartt","review":"First of all, I absolutely LOVED \\"The Secret History.\\" So, I'm quite saddened to dislike this novel as much as I do, because it really does start off really promisingly. (As promisingly as it can, considering it starts with a murder of a little boy.) Yes, it's really well written. Yes, it's quite moody and the characters are all very fleshed out. But Ms. Tartt has her work cut out for her because she expects to keep the reader's interest while unfolding a virtually plotless storyline through the eyes of a twelve-year-old girl: not an easy task for over 600 pages. Do not be fooled by the jacket cover: this is NOT a murder mystery and there will be no big moment of \\"AH-HAH!\\" in the end of it. Just more moody, broody, albeit lovely, writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"About 1% of this book was interesting","review":"Of close to 600 pages, I'd say the first 20 and the last 50 pages were interesting. The rest of the book was brutal. For god's sake woman, put a plot in there!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully written, without a plot","review":"After waiting 10 years for Donna Tartt to write another book, I alternate between being sorely disappointed in this, and vastly impressed by her beautiful prose. Though the writing is splendid, the imagery vivid, and the characters are sublimely developed, the plot plods along at an interminably slow pace, and the ending is atrocious. By the 555th page, the reader would appreciate having an ending, but Tartt refuses, merely ending the book wherever she saw fit, with absolutely no point whatsoever. This doesn't hold a candle to her debut novel, \\"The Secret History.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my...money back!","review":"I've never written a review online before, but I just had to try and stop any other massive Secret History fans wasting [$$] of their hard earned money on the most boring book I've ever read in my life (well, one of them.)The characters are incredibly cliched, the story is non-existent and the ending - well, it just sort of tails off lamely (although even this comes as a relief after about 800 pages of overwritten waffle.)I had to see if any other Amazon readers hated it as badly as I did, and was pleased to see that the majority did...Again, I loved the Secret History big time - but this book bears about the same resemblence to that as Little Nicky bears to Citizen Kane.I cannot warn you strongly enough. Do NOT waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying on tape too.","review":"I checked this out on tape from my public library. After 5 or 6 tapes, I still didn't know what it was about, and I stopped caring. If I hear the narrator say, \\"Harriet said\\" at the end of one more sentence, I was going to scream. I never finished it. It was that bad. I don't know what the hype is all about. Spend your time on better things."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I've ever read","review":"After finishing this very tedious and overly-hyped book, I am convinced that the book that I purchased had the wrong book jacket on it.

I can safely say that this is the worst book I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a shame!","review":"\\"The Secret History\\" was so great what a shame that \\"The Little Friend\\" is such a nightmare. I was so aggravated trying to read this mess that I had to get rid of the book as fast as I could! It's the most boring bit of crud I've ever read! Do NOT buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunningly Bad","review":"At the end of _The Secret History_, I was disappointed to find that the newest literary genius had written a rather engaging potboiler, if not much else. Still, I considered it a good first novel, and a compelling--if showy--novel.Then came this monstrosity.Showing the daring brilliance of Caleb Carr or Steve Martini, Donna Tartt's _The Little Friend_ is a sad little tale that starts out with a glimmer of promise and ends like a movie of the week. It's sad, shopworn characters and tired, threadbare cliches are neither insightful nor entertaining. This is a boring book with bad diction and a thoroughly disappointing ending. Just ...pitiable throughout.The worst part may be that the first book was a potboiler dressed as a novel. This time, it's not even dressed up, and Tartt doesn't even give a resolution. Ambiguity is essential in good novels. Unfortunately, Tartt didn't write one.Don't read this book on a dare. Run away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"I would rather have watched the collective work of Uwe Boll in one sitting than have read this book. It would have been just as entertaining and rewarding.The quality of Donna's prose is breathtakingly exact in its measure to elicit an intense expectation that could divine the all...That's how this book feels; a culmination of a message that abruptly stops. I feel as if an omnipotent computer just revealed the answer to life, the universe, and everything is 42."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can something so long, go.... well... nowhere?","review":"While Donna Tartt is undoubtedly a magnificent writer, \\"The Little Friend\\" went from beginning to end with little direction and absolutely no continuity. From the get-go the plot seemed simple: a child (a very, very, very intelligent child, mind you) wanted to solve the mystery of her brother's murder which occurred years earlier. The vagaries and wanderings of the plot, however, turned it into something wholly different and somewhat uncategorizable. Not only did the ending lack any insightful connections, but the initially exciting climax ended up hitting the fan with a resounding splatter as well. I finished asking myself two questions: What was the point of the novel... and who was the little friend ANYWAY?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I am one of the many lovers of \\"The Secret History\\" and have, like most of you, waited for Donna Tartt's new book for 10 years. To say I'm disappointed is almost an understatement. \\"The Little Friend\\" is a boring book with dull characters, filled with stereotype after stereotype. The story goes nowhere, and as the reader it is hard to stay interested or concerned about any of the characters, especially Harriet! I have to force myself to read it everyday and I'm not sure if I can even finish it. I've tried to give it chance. I wanted to love this book. What happened Donna Tartt??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks The Power of The First","review":"I am on page 200 and have just started using this book as my bedside drink coaster. This is where I relegate such books that I cannot finish but am ashamed to put on the shelf yet! I was mesmerized by Ms Tartt's first book but this has absolutely no draw. It is reminiscent of \\"Other Voices, Other Rooms\\" but not as corrupt and tantalizing as Capote's work. It smacks of Tennesee Williams, but not hard enough to read through. I was waiting for \\"The Secret Friend\\" since the day I read the last page of Ms Tartt's previous book, \\"The Secret History\\". I am sorry that she seems to be distracted because I KNOW she can write such things as dreams are made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Outstanding","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in the last dozen years. Tartt's mastery of the subtleties of southern culture during a particular period is wonderful. Ultimately, this is a very vivid and gripping portrait of the innocence of childhood, and how easily it is lost. I found The Secret History a bit indulgent. This novel is spot on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd been waiting (but apparently not long enough)","review":"Okay, it's been said before, but bears mentioning again: The Secret History this ain't. The languor of childhood in general, and Deep South rural childhood in particular, are brilliantly drawn. But that's all that's brilliantly done here, and a careful mapping out of stasis is awfully little to get out of a long, long book. The stabs at real plotting peter out again and again, and a fair amount of the writing is filler, distraction to get from one set piece to the next. I still can't wait to read what she writes next, but after The Little Friend, my anticipation is mixed with a little trepidation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake Faulkner","review":"We all bought the book because we all loved The Secret History. At the tender age of 29 I'm suspicious of anything contemporary, but Tartt wrote a wonderful book once; if nothing else, I was curious of the follow-up.It wasn't apparent from the start. It was only after a hundred pages or so, that I realised that before Tartt began to write The Little Friend, she had swallowed in large quantity, then digested, and then regurgitated most of rather well known books by William Faulkner. It doesn't matter that her style resembles nothing of The Snopes saga (no, of course it doesn't - her style is flat, listless; Faulkner's was brilliant, bold, poetic) it is the characters that sound strangely familiar. Did Tartt really think no-one would notice? But apparently no-one had.Finally - did I really suffer over 500 pages for this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, This Books Stinks","review":"I bought it for $1.50 and I really want my buck fifty back. This has got to be one of the most awful books I have tried to read. I can't get past page 40. Honestly, how many pages to you have to use to talk about the same thing but using different words? It seems Donna just likes to show off her use of big words.Don't buy this book...even if you just pay $1.50!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOORRRIIINNNNGGGG","review":"This book was SO boring. I bought it upon its release because I loved The Secret History. I tried, I really did, to finish it and actually enjoy some of it, but I just couldn't do it! I am about halfway through and whenever I pick it up, I convince myself that, finally, something interesting is going to happen. No such luck. It just plods along, with no real end or plot in sight. I just wish I hadn't bought it when it was released because then I would have had the opportunity to read these reviews....Don't waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"over-the-top prose that smacks of racism and elitism","review":"I was very eager to read this book after having enjoyed The Secret History - but boy, what a bummer! This book feels like it's 5,000 pages long and very familiar. It's like a campy pastiche of cliches from other famous, better books. Even the main character's name seemed contrived - Harriet Cleve Dufresnes, how is one supposed to pronounce that? I am relieved to see that other readers noticed the slightly racist tone of parts of the book. I would like to add that there is classism at foot here too - i.e. Tartt's reprehensible portrayal of the white trash characters, used primarily as comic relief. I wonder how Tartt would feel if she were on the receiving end of that. There is a noticable lack of humanity in these pages that results in boredom. Ten years to produce what? A faux great novel. Can't recommend it, sorry. I hope she get sher act together again. It's just a cryin' shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exasperating Ending","review":"I picked up this book by chance at the library, and based on the summary, I thought it was going to be a great book. It was a slow starter, but I did develop and attachment to the characters and the plot was very intriguing. It grew boring in certain spots and I would actually skip a few pages ahead in the book until I found something a little more exciting. I was really looking forward to the ending to find out \\"who done it\\", and have never been so disappointed in my life. The books end very abruptly and I really thought I had missed something. I went back and read over the last couple of pages again to make sure but there is no closure to the plot. The ending was exasperating and I am angry I wasted my time reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How awfull!","review":"At the outset, I have to state that Secret History was one of my favorite books. When so many years later, I heard that Donna Tartt was not a Harper Lee, I was truly excited and eagerly anticpated this release. Now I wish she had been a \\"one hit wonder.\\" What an awfull book. I have struggled through 3/4 of this thing, trying not to be defeated by it's pompous and irrelevant description, lack of plot, and ultimate letdown (while reading this monstrosity, I have completed three other very satisfying books). Tartt starts off with a promising premise, but gets completely bogged down in self-indulgent descriptive asides that make this novel infuriating to read. I don't think one ever finds out who killed Robin, and quite frankly, I don't care..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a little disappointed","review":"One of the reviewers states that this book was not intended to be a mystery or a crime story in the vein of a Stephen King or Anna Rice novel but is more a work of literature. If it so then why did Donna Tartt uses the shocking hanging of a little boy as an attention getter on the FIRST page of her novel? She should have realized that most of the readers would then expect to learn how it happened. But there are no answers to this MYSTERY because mystery it is. It leaves a feeling of disappointment. The author should have been more sensitive to the fact that having started her novel the way she did the reader would be entitled to beleive a resolution would take place but there is no 'closure' in this book and the frustration overides the admiration felt at places in the book for some beautifully written parts. I can't help think that the author couldn't wait to get it over with at the end and left us hanging there (... no pun intended)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A must miss","review":"The secret history was good enough to warrant purchasing this hardcover....so I thought.

WRONG!!Like others who have reviewed it, I kept on and on and on....thinking it was going to pick up soon. Not so. I even approached it for a while as a \\"self-discipline exercise\\"..all the while eyeing other books waiting to be read. After about 150 pages, although I hardly ever admit defeat, I gave up. I think I will investigate her first novel as from what I've heard, it's much better reading. ...that is...after I've read some other authors for a change."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?","review":"Is it the price of fame that a talented young writer gets forced to publish something in the hopes of topping his/her initial success? Is it our commercial capitalist culture that thinks the public will just eat it up? How did the smart authoress of The Secret History come up with this flaccid, downright campy second effort? Was Miss Tartt under that much pressure to produce? Some writers only have one book in them. That could be the case here. Whatever the circumstances, The Little Friend is not little - and it's nobody's friend. If you want Southern Gothic, stick to Capote, a true original. Tartt's treading water here, trying hard to come up with her next cash cow. She strikes out on all counts. Maybe she should pen a memoir and explain what happened. Might be more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hooks you then leaves much to be desired.","review":"I loved The Secret History, so when I heard that Donna Tartt had a new book out I decided to check it out.I liked the beginning of the novel. About 200 pages in it was a struggle to force myself to read more of it...the end gets a little better but offers little in the way of resolution. I just expected more. The parts of the book about the Ratliff family are especially mindnumbing.I will say that Tartt is an excellent writer, and the only reason that I gave the book even 2 stars. She creates such beautiful sentences and paragraphs, but fails to make much of a story. By the time I finished the book I didn't even like Harriet, let alone any of the other characters in the novel.Also, I REALLY wanted to find out what happened to Robin but his murder is barely talked about past the prologue."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO, what's the point??","review":"They say about the Secret History, Ms. Tartt's previous book, that if you can get through the first two-thirds, the rest is fantastic... and so it was. About The Little Friend they can say, if you can get through the book, you've read a crappy book. Although the character development was wonderful, and the descriptions of a dysfunctional southern family provided a lot of insights into human behavior and attitudes, I got to the end of the book asking myself if they publisher had neglected the last pages that would have provided a point to the book. It could have been a good mystery, but then, the mystery is never solved, and the reader is left wondering, \\"so what?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Less is more","review":"Seven months ago I put The Little Friend on my Christmas wish list and was thrilled when I received it as a gift. Seven months later I finally finished it and I think I owe my gift giver [$$$]! If this book was brilliant, I sure missed it.Everything about this story was long and torturous. The sun-baked Mississippi landscape, the bible thumping, quasi-racist, emotionally clueless characters, the crazy-...premise and the anti-climactic climax which was no climax at all since that would imply a building of tension and action that begs for a resolution. Suffice it to say that 20 pages from the end, I was able to put the book down for the night and not pick it up again for two days, that's how much I didn't care about Harriet and the fate of her family.I can say a lot more, but like The Little Friend, what's the point. Less is more. Read the first chapter, the last, and that's all you'll need. Everything in between is boring, long winded, depressing, and completely unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be missing it, too","review":"I certainly enjoyed Secret History and waited months to get my hands on The Little Friend--boy, am I glad I got it from the library instead of paying for it! I've been reading it non-stop for the past few days and now, exactly halfway through it, it's boring the hell out of me. What's with the snake obsession? I understand that fondling them is a big deal in some religious rites, but are they supposed to be a metaphor for the evil Ratliff family? If so, I get it already! The excruciating--and nearly senseless--detail of the Odums and Ratliffs was so inundating, I felt it really took away from the momentum. I even skipped to the end of the book, which I hate doing, just for a reason to keep going. But even then, it was so convoluted that I fell asleep. I'll try to to finish it, but it's going to be difficult. If you need a sedative, feel free to wade through this tar pit. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book With No Ending","review":"After diligently reading the over-descriptive pages and pages and pages of this disappointing book (I loved the Secret History), I was angry at the ending which left the reader hanging with nothing but questions to ask the author. Talk about FRUSTRATING!!!!! What happened to Harriet? How about her parents? Did they go back with each other? Who killed her brother? Did Harriet really have epilepsy? Did the police ever find out what happened? I agree with some of the other reviewers that the character descriptions were well-written but they led you nowhere and the book was entirely too long because of these. And the question of the year.....What the heck does the title mean? What's with the doll? Who's the \\"little friend\\". Arghhhh! Sorry, Donna. Can't recommend this one. Try again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Southern Reality Book","review":"The characterizations are superb. I will read it again and enjoy how well the author drew these differing portraits. I would have been delighted if there had been no story at all. The plot was preposterous--what I would expect in the juvenile adventure section of a library. However, that did not spoil the richness of the characters. Any writer would gain immeasurably by reading how Donna Tartt drew, painted in, shaded, highlighted, etc. these unforgettable southern people. A Reality Show between book covers. Adult plotlines and development will come--once she puts her mind to it. Read the book, ignore the plot. Enjoy the fantastic people."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT??","review":"I can't really say anything that hasn't already been said here except that the ending was horrible; very unsatisfying...there is no real resolution. I also didn't get who \\"the little friend\\" was either. The book came so highly recommended but I can't believe I just wasted several days reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gad-zeeks! What's going on here?","review":"Hello? Is anyone home at Harriet's house? What about Donna Tartt's house? This book was really disappointing. Empty characters in empty rooms. Plotless narrative and banal dialogue that leads no where at all. I read an interview with Donna Tartt somewhere after I had finished the book (is there anywhere were she hasn't been interviewed?) and I was astonsihed to read that she said that novels should have something going on in them, that their main purpose is to be entertaining and that there should be a strong plot and an adventure story - and that novels should not pretend to be literary! Is she kidding? Did she read The Little Friend when she finished writing it? Believe me, there is no plot, no adventure and it's not entertaining. Plus, it strains very hard to be literary and it just seems contrived and cloying - just like an Southern woman past her prime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on Characters, Short on Theme","review":"Donna Tartt creates some memorable characters in The Little Friend, and has an uncanny knack for helping her readers to \\"see\\" the locales in which she places her story. Unfortunately, great characterization and atmosphere do not a great book make. The coming-of-age epiphany at the end of the story falls flat in the face of hundreds of pages of build-up. From a writer as skilled as Ms. Tartt, I expected much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing denouement","review":"I agree with all of the negative reviews.. read Tartt's first book many years ago, loved it. I finished this one and wanted to heave it across the room. While Tartt is unquestionably a talented writer, this book lacked cohesive structure (I'm an English teacher). Where was her editor? Did he/she actually read the whole book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A guarateed cure for insomnia","review":"In nearly 40 years of reading, I can count on two hands the number of books I have NOT finished. I can now add \\"The Little Friend\\" to that not so illustrious list. And why you may ask... simple, I could not stay awake while attempting to slog through this incredible bore of a book. Overwrought, overhyped and worst of all, overwritten, this novel gives new meaning to the word tedious. With so many excellent books out there waiting to be read, do not waste one moment of your time on this fiasco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been half as long","review":"The text on the back is misleading - this is not really about a girl solving her brother's murder. It starts with a family torn apart by the loss of a young boy, and one of the consequences is the neglect of his younger sisters. It's not until 150 pages in that one of the sisters then decides on who the murderer is, and that she will kill him. It's not until the family of meth heads enters the scene that you really care about anyone at all, and Tartt makes her descriptions so detailed that you can get a lot of the content just by skimming. It was interesting enough to read to the end, but the ending didn't really give me the satisfaction I had hoped for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little friend","review":"I have to say that I loved this book. I didn't want it to end. she is a wonderful writer.I was a bit frustrated at the ending but I was okay with it. I miss the book now that I am finished with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Promise, but......","review":"This book is a paradox. I actually listened to the audio version read by Donna Tartt. She does an excellent job. The story starts out well and then about a quarter of the way through I found my mind wandering and would have to go back and listen again. Made it through to the end, but like most everyone else, it left me flat. I am not going to defend the author in regards to the mystery not being solved. We read books (or listen to them) to escape from reality. Yes. Life doesn't always have a happy ending, but mysteries need resolve and she failed to deliver. Now, Donna Tartt is a fine writer. At times she did remind me of Harper Lee. Some of her writing is poetic and beautiful. I have not read her first book, and have no qualms about doing so. I will even tackle her third if she publishes one, but she has got to know that the majority of readers WANT RESOLVE."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Little Friend","review":"I called in sick to work to finish The Secret History, that's how good it was...when this book came out I bought the hardback right off the shelf and...Well, I'll just say this...this was one of the WORST books I have ever read. Horrible and oh so boring. If you're thinking about getting this book my advice is just to run the other way or at the very least get it from the library. God, it was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Long Slow Laborious Read","review":"I normally read 2 books a week, and it took me three wks to get through this one. And it was not because I was savoring every page. This could have been a good read at about 175 pages. Loved Harriet (an old soul) and some of her eccentric aunts. Isn't this what editors are supposed to do?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Her Little Friends Are Evidently the Critics","review":"Imagine \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".Now, take away Atticus.Then, take away a social conscience.Finally, remove any sort of satisfying conclusion to the story.Add 100 or so pages of very dense narrative about very vague characters.Stir in lots of critical hype.You've got \\"The Little Friend.\\"There are a few bright spots. Harriet, like Scout, is an engaging character. The snake hunt has some suspense. The Sunday school and Bible camp passages are fun, as well. However, most of the story seems as unfocused and annoying as Harriet's sister and mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but...","review":"Having loved The Secret History so much, I couldn't wait to read Donna Tartt's next novel, and she certainly made us wait a long time! Unfortunately, this book does not compare to her first, I'm disappointed to report. Her first book came alive and I couldn't put it down; this never really grabbed me and I struggled through it. If you're looking for a great book, pick up a copy of The Secret History instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"The \`blurb' on the back of this book leads you to believe this will be a murder mystery about the horrific death of a young child. When you read the first few pages you are gripped by the tragedy and mystery of it. You are primed for a satisfying tale that will ultimately answer the question the book asks in it first pages. Who murdered Robin?Well, I wish I had checked in with Amazon before investing my time into 600 plus pages. If I had done so I would have known that we NEVER find out who killed Robin. Sure, we read about the damage and long-term effects of his murder upon his family but if that's the story you are looking for Alice Sebold will much better serve you with The Lovely Bones.The Little Friend offers no mystery, no compelling tale; it simply meanders aimlessly with stock characters who have no great insight and ultimately give you the feeling of having wasted your weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Organized Trashing??? Hardly","review":"Dear Lovers of this book: Yes, we who are disppointed DO Get IT.It's a Southern thing. It's about loss of innocence and race and class and laconic summers in small town Mississippi,we just don't think Miss Tartt GOT IT. It's not the writing, it's the storyline which, contrary to rumors in certain graduate English departments, is pretty damned important to a novel.As for me, I am not part of any organized movement,just pissed off. I bought two copies of this book and gave one to someone else and then had to apologize for it. And it was my Mother, who took a degree in literature before most people writing reviews here were even born!'Nuff Said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks the Big One","review":"The Little Friend is the worst book I have ever not finished. What on earth did Tartt think she was doing? TLF is like night to The Secret History's day. Did Tartt have a lobotomy sometime during the past decade? Maybe she's been too busy having a love affair with herself. Boring, boring, boring. She needs to take a class in novel structure and character development. To be avoided, even boycotted."},{"rating":"2","title":"from a Yankee","review":"If you're looking for a thriller which ties everything together neatly at the end, this book is not for you. If you're interested in a moody, Southern setting and powerful character development, then you will love this book. I cared for the main character Harriet and found her very sympathetic. I loved many of the other characters that Tartt developed-the maid, the mother, the grandmother, the best friend-and I enjoyed the emphasis on a family of strong women (with the exception of Harriet's mother).As another reviewer said, Tartt is aiming for Faulkner territory not Grisham. You meet some riveting individuals in this book. No everything is not resolved at the end. Then again, it isn't resolved in real life most of the time either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello the best tragic writer of OUR TIME","review":"Donna Tartt captures the vividness of tragedy. She is amazing. I seek to find other modern authors whose words resonate the emotional accuracy and voracity for life's unavoidable conflicts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst book ever written","review":"Ok, so it's not the worst book ever written (that coveted award goes to Martin Amis' \\"The Information\\") but it comes pretty darn close. At 300 pages in, I kept thinking that the book would surely start soon, after all this was Donna Tartt, it had to turn out to be great in the end right? Wrong. After 400+ pages I knew it was never going to amount to anything other than a high school student's attempt at Carl Hiaasen gone badly awry. Not only were the characters utterly unlikeable, many seemed to exist for no other reason than to... well exist. This is tosh of the higest order. No plot, no \\"journey\\" to follow, no wit and no fun.Ms Tartt, I hear there are vacancies at Burger King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to say the least","review":"The Secret History is one of my favorite books, so naturally I had high hopes for this one. I had browsed through it when it first came out and just couldn't catch the wave. I bought it for a couple bucks and am happy not to have paid more than that. I struggled to get through it, was determined that I would, but it was painful and took weeks. There are entirely too many words spent on setting the scene and on characters that don't drive the plot. Then around mid-denouement, the author seems to run out of gas. I also agree with others who have said in their reviews that the book is a rehash of many other books based in the South, that Harriet is a reminiscent of Scout, the pre-teen heroine from To Kill A Mockingbird. I really expected something more original from Ms. Tartt, and for her editors to edit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"Unfortunately I tend to agree with the majority of the comments here. I loved TSH and was eagerly awaiting Tartt's next book. I was befuddled when working my way through TLF, wondering if I was missing something...it lacked plot and direction. The characters were great but at the end of the book I was left wondering where the journey had taken me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Like a few of the other reviewers, I also put the book down yesterday and thought to myself - was that a waste of my time? It sure feels like it was ... I still want to know who killed Robin and why? The ending felt more like Tartt got tired of writing and sort of gave up. I wish I had given up 300 pages before..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book ended up in my trash can","review":"I really was looking forward to reading this book, however, by page 250 or so, I just wanted it to get to the point so I could put it behind me. The author's style of writing is intricate and delicate, making for long and eloquent sentences that wound their way into to paragraphs full of promise and drama. The disappointment, however, is how the author failed to make any of these paragraphs tie into anything even resembling a plot. What is sold to the reader on the back of the book as a mystery, is in actuality a muddle of characters, plots and subplots that have absolutely nothing to do with one another and failed to fully mature. I wasted so much time on plodding through this morass, that by the time I finally reached the wretched, anti-climatic end, I immediately threw the book away in frustration and disappointment. I didn't even feel it was worth of inclusion into my personal library. What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really liked this book!","review":"I was hooked by the very first words. I thought the story was good, but felt like the ending was not really the end. I guess I wanted some answers, but in real life, we know that it not the way it is. In all, I enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too frozen for this amigo","review":"Absolutely terrible. It kills me that Tartt could have strayed so far to the back of the freezer to pull this one out, knock off the ice and stick it in the microwave.As I read this absolutely boring book, it reminded me far too well the feeling of pain one gets after eating a freezer-burned burrito. The torture of acid reflux as it creeps up your throat, causing excrutiating pain in both your chest and back.Unfortunately for me -- however bad this book is, much like the fact that I will eat another burrito, I'll probably buy another Tartt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work right","review":"The product is quite alright, I guess.The particular piece just didn't work right beyond the first couple of times I switched.

A lot of fans throw hissy fits about the third film for a variety of reasons (most of which you will not understand unless you're an avid comic reader), but personally I like it quite a bit and I consider all three films to be a solid arc. Whether you're a fan of the comic books or you just want a good sci-fi/action film series to get into, this set is worthy of a spot on your shelf.

Completely unbelieveable that she was remotely capable of being a senator let alone a presidential candidate. Worse, Hunt didn't even give the pleasure of a twist ending. It's only surprise was that Hunt DIDN'T try to make it anything other than UTTERLY PREDICTABLE. I also agree with a previous review: If I had to hear one more time what they ate for dinner or about the martinis they drank, I was gonna puke. Totally vapid characterizations and writing style.

It almost sounds like there is an echo or that you are listening to the album live. In fact, some songs are decent, but others are just horrible. The songs where Noel sings tend to be the better ones.And by the way, the SACD down-mixed MP3's of the album floating around on the internet sound NOTHING like the actual SACD.

Her performance in nothing short of stunning, particularly in the authenticity of her pure slavelike dialect. Ken Howard, as Wilson, has moments of clunkiness, but is never more powerful as when defending a point of honor. The rest is very serviceable, the cast competent to the task, the writing well-measured in maintaining the purity of Twain's prose.

It was the \\"voice\\" in the writing, or rather the lack of it, that troubled my instinct. Whether or not the story is true, Ms. Khouri was not adept at telling it. Her dialogue often ran like a 6th grader's - predictable, the type of writing that without a sensational plot, has little else to promote it. Interestingly, the more expository parts of the book were better written. I imagine, that was easier to convey in a convincing tone.

So I thought I'd judge the rest of the tracks on the very short album which for some reason still sounds too short with the 2 bonus tracks added. I have to say that this album hasn't aged well at all and the sound quality is poor.

In fact, in many places it was so absorbing I simply couldn't put it down.The story of how the S-Five sank and how Savvy Cooke and his men fought to survive afterwards is amazing, but the author has done such a great job of research that it's all believable. It's educational too. I didn't know much about submarines when I started the book, but I do now.

The doctor said, \\" She would have to give up running as a sled dog!\\" Will Gary have to give up racing, too? You will have to read the story and find out.

This set has very little of the ESP type interplay that you would normally expect from this group. Perhaps they didn't quite know how to interpret the old standards through the new sound. In any case, the songs go on and on without really anything very interesting happening. Shorter blows a couple of interesting solos, but Miles uniformly sucks. Most of the time, he sounds like he's purposely blowing in the opposite direction of the microphone. You can barely hear him. Williams' symbol dominates the mix-- it's really hard to hear anything else clearly. All in all a very disappointing set from a great band. I wouldn't waste your time unless you are a Miles collector. I certainly can't imagine why anyone would want to listen to the complete set of this concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of music-crit wannabes","review":"Beware of reviews written by people who think they are music critics or historians. The popular take on this recording is that it gives a portrait of a major step in the development of Davis' music and the quintet that had just formed. Maybe so, but that doesn't make it interesting, and isn't that what your average listener wants? I love the music that came out of the 60's quintet, but here, they don't seem to know what to do with the older tunes. The result is a lot of long, aimless soloing, without any of the interplay that made this group so exciting. Add to that some horrendous sound quality on the first two cuts (Herbie Hancock is barely audible) and this just doesn't cut it.

However, this action film almost put me to sleep. I spent the entirety of the movie anticipating the end. This movie is sporadic, there's no script whatsoever, and this has got to be one of the worst performances by Tommy Lee Jones (not as bad as Men In Black-terrible movie) that I can remember. Benecio Del Toro can't save this movie in any way. Tommy Lee didn't get much help with the script, so that's why his performance wasn't that good. You have a specially trained agent who goes haywire and starts killing people, but it never explains why he went crazy in the first place. What triggered this behavior?..I don't know. Come to find out, Tommy Lee's character actually trained this guy and now is the only person that can stop him. The movie was only an hour and a half long, but it was pretty excrutiating. It almost bored me to tears. Please don't buy this movie.

Well this is one of those kinds of movies, except when you're not laughing, you are snoring. But I might add, there is suspense... you will be asking yourself \\"When will this senseless movie ever end?\\"Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro fight in the woods camouflaged with their little man-made knives... making ooga-booga grunting noises as they swing away for 10 minutes. Then they disappear again in the woods for a while to construct another lame knife and do the ooga-booga all-over-again.If you want to laugh at one of the stupidest movies ever made... rent this movie, but by no means buy it.

But then most thrillers are 'predictable' by the time the critics review them. The question is \\"Will this 'predictable' movie entertain\\"? YES! William Friedkin knows how to pace his action movies and this one is no exception. Tommy Lee Jones is his usual (read 'predictably') fine acting self and Benecio Del Toro gives further evidence that he is a major talent. Both characters, co-participants in a deadly and bloody 'hunt/hunter' tale, are well developed, nuanced, and terrific to watch. Ease up on the fact that you know who is going to win and just settle in to a fine action/psychodrama movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drive in movie for the noughties-boys and their ugly toys","review":"A huge amount of talent has gone into a pretty thin chase movie which has none of the panache of say The Fugitive. Undoubtedly, Mr Jones and Mr Del Toro are watchable (and bankable) actors. Because it is R rated - lots of knives and descriptions of how to carve up a man - it's audience I guess is lonely young men who fantasise about violence, or who have a thoroughly unhappy view of humans and relate better to dogs and squirrels than they do to their neighbours. Interesting to see Mr Maltin gave this an above average review whilst considering the director's earlier masterpiece - To Live and Die in LA - an unworthy film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two great actors, one terrible film","review":"This movie is contrived and implausible, and I don't know how it can be billed as a thriller with its total lack of suspense. Why these fine actors chose to act in such a film, I'll never know, but I don't know how either of them kept from rolling their eyes when both of them, during a police chase, found time to forge and create their own knives. Give me a break. The tiny side plots about Del Toro's love life and Jones' work for the wildlife service are there, I suppose, to make their characters seem more interesting. The only thing I can imagine making them more interesting is their refusing these roles.I'm so glad I rented this movie before purchasing. Now I only have to lament the loss of four bucks.Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made for tv surely","review":"Halfway through this I wondered if in fact I was watching a parody of the Fugitive.How either of these actors agreed to be a part of this over the top, ultra cliched, poorly executed mess is anyone's guess. The plot and scripting don't get much worse although there are a few moments of decent action but you've really seen it all before. Pretty blah editing and direction to boot.Watch out for a re-enactment of Predator in last 10 minutes before an overly bloody and tacky close.One redeeming factor for The Hunted is that it was refreshing to watch a film that ended predictably without resorting to a trendy twist that a lot of films employ these days 'to set them apart'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk...and a bloodbath, too.","review":"This would be a standard Tommy Lee chase picture except for all those scenes the other reviewers describe as \\"realistic\\". Tommy and Benny apprarently have no muscle, no tendons, no arteries. They just hack and hack and keep on hacking.I like action and maybe I'm getting old but I am so damn tired of seeing over-the-top butchering of arms, legs, torsos. Enough already!As for the story, its entirely cliches, start to finish. To make things even worse, we're supposed to feel sorry for Benny (war vet snaps cliche).What a terrible waste of two fine actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too boring for me","review":"I found this movie to be a cliché through and through. It was predictable and pretty boring. The cat and mouse was just tired and rehashed. Tommy Lee Jones is much older than Del Toro, so while he was believable as a teacher, it was beyond belief that he could hunt him down and fight him as if he was just a young athletic himself.There isn't much dialogue in the film, at least not much that matters much. There aren't any good twists or surprises. There are other cat and mouse movies, Cliffhanger and Shoot to Kill, two examples that are set in the woods, that are much more exciting and offer more plot twists and more developed characters.Not much of a recommendation here. Certainly one to rent if you need to see it, I can't imagine seeing this twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...not bad at the beginning...","review":"The move starts pretty good, but by 2/3 the way it becomes so unrealistic as to become almost unwatchable.

Supposedly all he sees people as is targets, except for a little girl and her mom, and just about everyone else he meets.Buy Rambo instead, you'll be glad you did.

Yes we've seen it all before and better. And it isn't laughably bad enough to qualify as camp. It did come close though when the adversaries stop in the middle of a life and death chase to make weapons; Tommy Lee goes native long enough to knap a flint knife as Benicio uses his blacksmithing skills to forge a blade.

I highly recommend The Hunted."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Dissapointment","review":"You'd think with two major stars (Tommy Lee Jones & Benicio Del Toro) this movie would work, but these two guys have absolutely no on screen chemistry whatsoever. But, they are not totally too blame. The plot is very weak, meandering, and basically nonsensical. The chase scenes are typical Hollywood action cliches. This movie was billed as a suspense drama, but the only suspense I encountered was when it was going to end. Thankfully, Benicio Del Toro can be forgiven for this movie after seeing his marvelous performance in 21 grams. The same can be said for Tommy Lee Jones, as he did a good job in The Missing.

Maybe I am a twisted individual for liking this aspect of the movie but I think there's something cool about it, especially for the reason that he hunts those who do the hunting-call in equalization. The movie also highlights the issues that plague soldiers when they come home from war.

This unusually ambitious but embarrassing action yarn tries to create explosive entertainment using a very serious issue, and a predictable &#65533;plot twist&#65533; and a finale involving an explosion at a Federal building which takes the emergency services a good fifteen minutes to respond to doesn&#65533;t even come close to being worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"So close....but so far.","review":"Well it looks like an interesting idea. The injured hero righting wrongs can also appear as a terrorist from the other viewpoint. The film raises some good questions but fails to explore them fully. The film portays well the \\"Genovese\\" effect in war and politics. Which means your life is only worth saving if it makes a good soundbite. The Arnie hero gets abandoned all the way along the line until it suits to rescue him. The villian \\"the wolf\\", turns out to have the same motivation as the hero, revenge for the loss of a murderd child. I think the original script was probably a lot better before the execs got hold of it and made it more digestable. America is not ready to understand \\"why\\" they are hated internationally. In the name of free trade nations are seeing their cultures overrun and will fight to preserve their way of life, just as America would. But I spose that just ain't Arnie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arnie... please!","review":"The scripts that must be coming to Arnie must be very limited or somebody really pulled the wool over his eyes. In this film, aside from some of the action sequences, there is very little to enjoy. This films has too many holes in the script to be believable that will generally insult the intellegence of the viewer. If you are an 'Arnie' fan, probably renting the video would be a viable option. However, without such devotion, I would recommend a 'pass' on this one. Wait for a free TV viewing, and only if you have some time to kill. Recommendation from Howie is One star (probably star is that option was available)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Me arnold, me kill you now...ungabunga","review":"I give this movie a bad rating because of the way they messed up the ending. There is a very, very good scene at the end where he uses an ironic method to kill the bad guys.BUT THEN THEY COME BACK TO LIFE!!! So arnold picks up one of them and throws him head first through an electric curcuit baord, and then he chops up the other bad guy with an axe. Now remeber, he's supposed to be a fireman, not Connan the Barbarian!!!!This is just another typical Arnold flick where the movie producers make him look like a killing machine.and for those of you who don't know...\\"ungabunga\\" is a phrase from the old captain caveman cartoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great after all this time","review":"I have to say that there are a lot of people who feel that Arnold is too old to be doing these type of movies. After seeing this one, I have to say they are dead wrong. Arnold does here what he does best and that's be the hero.He delivers a great performance and at the same time he is an action hero. Loved this film and am looking forward to seeing Termintator 3 Rise of the machines when it hits theaters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Arnold Set","review":"This is a great Arnold set for the fans! Eraser is a really fun flick. Collateral Damage was good, not his best but still very enjoyable. My set came with 2 blu-ray discs. 1 for each flick, not a flip disc. I gave it 4 stars for lack of features but they are really good action flicks.Eraser had some really cool high tech ideas for its day, many of which ended up in the Perfect Dark games.Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys classic action flicks or is a fan of Ahnawld."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrocide!","review":"Arnold kills colombian couple and adopts their son. Delicious! Makes me want to fight terrorism, or kill couples and adopt their children, or maybe both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-reaching","review":"I rented Collateral Damage prepared to be entertained. I don't think that anyone has ever claimed the Arnold movies are anything other than mindless entertainment combined with sophisticated pyrotechnics. Which is fine - I can get with that.Unfortunately, Collateral Damage just tries too hard to be better than what it is. I could see the gimmicky plot twists coming from a mile off! Because I knew what was going to happen, it really deflated the ending. That combined with the low-grade special effects, which looked very fake at times, stunk.On the upside, Arnold's performance was fairly on par and entertaining enough. The beginning of the movie was probably the most interesting part, showing his grief and rage at a system that considered his family's life inconsequential in the face of larger politics. Too bad that the movie couldn't sustain that level of interest throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Ain't Action","review":"In a world of Spiderman, The Matrix and Charlie's Angels, what we don't need is an aging action star wasting millions of dollars making a movie where the main character is running through jungles with an axe on some sort of lame attempt to seek revenge on those who killed his wife and son. Not a complete waste of time, but I hated spending money to see this movie at theaters. I'd have to be out of my mind to buy it. It's an ok effort and surprisingly it's Arnold's acting skills that make it more tolerable than the so called action. If you really wanna see an action movie that will make you go Ooooh and Ahhhh watch Resident Evil or wait for the new Bond movie that comes out later this year, but please don't waste more money on this movie which is barely worth the price of a movie rental at Blockbuster on coupon day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, how far has Arnold fallen?","review":"What an unbeleivable piece of garbage. Aside from cameos by John Leguizamo and John Turturro, this film was an unbeleivable waste of time about a fireman attempting revenge for the deaths of his family.This is a feeble attempt by Arnold to relive his glory days when he was a box office draw.The release was pushed back due to the events of 9/11, but this movie is so bad it should have never been released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad copy!","review":"This disc had \\"freezing\\" issues and finally stopped altogether. Unfortunately, I didn't watch it until the 30-day return deadline had expired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Is Jamie Lee Curits When You Really Need Her?","review":"Arnold, if you're listening, you still have the muscle to make movies. What you don't have is the writing. This is a ninety minute Mexican travelogue with a twenty minute action flick attached. This film could have been dynamite. The characters are right, the action is solid and the subplot is chilling. But the long forestory just slows the film down to a snail's pace. This film needs a drastic rewrite. Buy True Lies and let this one wait until it gets recut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie i've ever seen","review":"When i first heard of Arnold Schwarzenegger doing a movie about battling some terrorists, i was hoping for a action packed thriller. This turned out to be the most boring time i've ever spent watching a movie. I was hoping that once he got into columbia, he would blow things up, shoot some badguys, rescue some hot chicks, and do Kung fu. But all he did was slide down and elevator shaft and swing an axe. I couldn't believe how boring this \\"action\\" movie was. Do not buy this, or even think about renting it."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],H={key:0},B={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",H,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(M,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-390a8b90"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/15.md","filePath":"people/15.md"}'),R={name:"people/15.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
