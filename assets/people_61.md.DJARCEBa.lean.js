I heard the song Four Leaf Clover on the radio by chance one day, and I went into the music store, had a listen to the rest of the songs, and bought it the same day. It has a great blend of rock and pop that is just easy to listen to. Most of the songs are faster paced, with a few exceptions that cannot be spoken poorly of.

Brooks & Dunn have their own sound, and they work within it wonderfully. Ronnie Dunn is a fine vocalist... one of the best. I decline comment on Kix's singing. Kix and Ronnie divide up singing duties pretty evenly on their regular albums, but on this greatest hits collection only a few Kix cuts appear, while the bulk of the album is dominated by Ronnie. You may draw your own conclusions. Again, Ronnie is a fine singer, and the album as a whole is infinitely enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was great!

It knows that \\"fan\\" is short for \\"fanatic\\", that authors and musicans attract energetic (or otherwise unengaged) partisan proponents, and thus that most reviews will be favorable and inflated. The most suspect favorable reviews here are those that praise this book's litary qualities, for the long and short of it are that it has none.

What a bore! Of all the books I have ever read, this is the absolute worst. It lacks the quality of keeping the attention of the reader.

I am in yr10, and I love sci-fi, and fantasy, but this book was a failure. The characters are dull and dry, without life, and are unable to rouse our sympathy(or interest). The storyline is patched and unbelievable, and the ending suggests to me that Wyndham thought \\"Oh, I'd better finish this in the next 10 seconds, here's a good band-aid solution...\\" Do something better with your time, like they said on Billy Madison, \\"You'll be dumder for reading it.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"inappropriate for children","review":"This is a book many children aged nine or ten to twelve or so might enjoy, but I would not have my own read it and I don't recommend you have yours read it. It teaches them the wrong lessons. It tells us that problems are best ignored, that you don't have to ever grow up if you don't want to. It encourages xenophobia and paranoia (in the popular, non-clinical sense of the word) and--I don't know how to put this delicately--cold-blooded violence. (Although the adult psyche will probably prove impervious, I recommend it for only those adults with a high tolerance for simplistic drivel and badly constructed prose.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was forced to read this book","review":"my english class an i had to read this book ! the only interesting part is that David is in love with his cousin! haven't teachers ever heard about child abuse? i would give this book 0 stars if it were an option ! *IF YOU ARE A TEACHER THINKING OF ASSIGNING THIS BOOK PLEASE THINK AGAIN*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meaningful science fiction that-gasp!-actually has a plot","review":"By complete chance, I came across this book, and was shocked by how well done it was. Being a language freak, I'm quite fussy about what I read. This was a pleasent surprise. Unlike such titles as Brave New World, this author actually had a story to back up his theories. I've seen novels that are focused on this subject before, but none quite like this one.

In public school grade 5, our teacher liked to read to us from one of his own books that he brought to school. This and one other stand out in my mind some 45 years later. The other book was Cue for Treason. We were transfixed as he read only 1 chapter each day and only on the condition that we were on our best behaviour. He was also our music man and I found out recently that he has had a jazz band for some years now.

It has always been one of my favorites. As a confused teenager trying to fit in, I identified completely with David and the group. They were different. They didn't fit in, but they didn't understand why everyone else thought it was wrong to be different.I appreciated the way the group found each other, stuck together and made sacrifices for the greater good of the group, which allowed them to find a place in their world where they were permitted to be themselves. I even named by business after this book.It is such a parallel to the unfounded prejudices we find now in our own world, and it opened my eyes to my prejudices I didn't even know I had. This book changed my way of looking at people.I've always wondered if it really was post-nuclear-war earth, or if it might have been PRE-pre-historic, or even a different planet...HMMM...I think it should be required reading in every adolescent age school program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what is human anyway?","review":"It appears people still do not understand what the author is trying to say in this novel.

That said, this is excellently written and a very satisfying story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read for any age!","review":"I read this book back in high school, grade 10 I think. This was the best book I have ever read and I have read many other good books! Obviously most of these high schoolers who bash the book are a bunch of high schoolers with NO imagination! It was a timely story which took advantage of our internal fear of the end of the world and thereafter. What I liked even more is that what the author predicted what could happend didn't seem too unrealistic. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent Wyndham","review":"I first read this book (or most of it ;-) in high school and must admit, although it was a rather interesting concept, did not find it particularly fun to read. I reread it recently and have to admit that it is a fine piece of science fiction (if you can call it that). Wyndham skillfully handles the religious prejudices of society towards the deviations and their bizarre behavior towards those who do not adhere to the 'true image'. Seems to be a popular book for high school which is unfortunate since so few people who read it at that point in their lives can really appreciate it (and, as we can see in the reviews here, are likely to rate it poorly). Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work","review":"I love this book, not because I find the plot intriguing, not because it presents a provoking thought on human religion, and not because it's science fiction. There're too much of those good stuffs in other books too.I love it simply because it's beautiful. It makes us yearn for that human passion in unity, described by Wyndham as the children's telephatic ability, which actually is a human ideal. It successfully blends fear, tragic and hope into a memorable story, with fear and tragic finally fading away under the wings of hope.It you haven't pick this book up yet, my advice is don't miss it for anything..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This is a book that I read as a child and I was very thrilled to get my hands on it again: It met all of my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book.","review":"Well, ok, I am writing this to balance out the reviews of the morons that gave it 1 star, so I'll try to make it short.I read it when I was 10 and I loved it because of the concept of telepahy and then I read it again 19 years later and I loved it because of the way it demonstrates intolerance, ignorance and religious fanaticizm.Read It!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not one of Wyndham's best","review":"I really do enjoy this book, I find myself thinking about all the questions raised about 'deviation' and 'the norm', I could see why a grade 9 student would hate it, the book itself is a little dull, but to an educated person, I think that they could really enjoy it. Kind of a social commentary book, but very thought-provoking nonetheless. If this is your first Wyndham book, I would try 'the midwhhich cuckoos' first, to get the feel for Wyndham's writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"This story was a good look at judgement, the casting out of innocents, survival and more.

I did not dislike the book; it was very well written and once I started reading, I found that I could not stop. However, both the ending and the characterization left much to be desired. But my real criticism was not with the book, but with the way people interpret it. Many students in my class believed it said that religion, especially Christianity, was wrong. I could not disagree more. What the people of Waknuk practiced was not Christianity, but something that was almost a cult. When the Fringes man talks to David about the true image, I get the impression that Wyndham was aware of this as well. And on a lighter note: Is my class the only one that found the romance between David and Rosalind rather disgusting? Come on, they're COUSINS!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great Book","review":"I agree the cover is definitely misleading!! But what a book.

That was true, this is fiction, but human nature - good and bad - doesn't change, and is realistically and lovingly portrayed here. Real villians, real heroes.

It was awful, it was overated as a classic. No I don't hate it because it was forced apon me, it was a week book. The ending was odd and much to fast. There was a big lead up to nothing. The climax was a black hole of emptyness. When written it may verywell have been good but it was not up to todays standards. There are so many better recent books I have read.

The new characters seem to be more subtly introduced, but the stories don't feel as lively as those presented on \\"Salty's Secret.\\"One note: narrator Alec Baldwin retains Salty's \\"sea dog\\" voice from the \\"Salty's Secret\\" collection; however, he has forgotten the voices he had established for other characters (even Elizabeth, the steam truck). I guess most kids won't notice, but why jazz up the narration if there isn't going to be continuity?

While his other albums have great songs, they don't have the overall strength as Goodbye Jumbo. Well, that has change because Dumbing Up is his best work besides Goodbye Jumbo. I was very impressed with the quality of the song writing throughout the whole album, from beginning to end. There are a couple of ok songs, but most of the songs are very good. It starts out very strong with one good song after another and finishes very strong also. I also love the meaningful lyrics besides the strong song structures. I think World Party (really Karl Wallinger) will go down in history as the most overlooked artist.

Having a young daughter of my own I was drawn in to Lin's character feeling each setback and struggle along with her. A page turner. A compelling story. A great read. I highly recommend it for anyone who has ever felt alone as they battle against the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"The House Of Pendragon - Am I Missing Something?","review":"I bought this book on the strength of the 3 reviews posted on the first page of the book entry, all of which gave it very high marks. There is some good writing in the genre of fantasy/historical fiction, and I am always in search of it. This wasn't it.I guess the plot twist of Arthur actually having a (gasp) daughter was supposed to be enough. The characters are not even remotely believable and the action is strained to the point of histrionics and repetitive to boot.I have to confess that I quit reading it a little more than halfway through, which is almost unheard of for me. So if the last part morphed into reasonably engaging literature, it's my loss. But I won't be buying the other two."},{"rating":"2","title":"an Authurian legend story like no other","review":"This novel blends fiction, history and legend into a story that brings to life a new aspect of the legends of Arthur and the Round Table.The story is told through Lin, who along with her brother Dafydd was born into slavery. The book is of her story, coming of age in a cruel world; of being abused and violated by the kings and queens she was born to serve. Yet through the story, Lin never loses her spirits. She, unlike the other slaves, questions her destiny. She can't accept her life, and she doesn't understand why the others are so passive about it. I came to admire her spirit and spunk; her actions are rebellious and never submissive. She stands up for what she believes in.Through time we learn all of Lin's story, and how it ties her to the legendary King Arthur. The story is a different twist on the Arthurian legends, and one that I enjoyed the entire way through. I couldn't put it down. It's engrossing, entertaining and very well written.Two thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best in the Elm Street novel series so far","review":"Tim Waggoner blows David Bishop and (especially) Christa Faust out of the water with PROTEGE.

King Britt a/k/a/ Scuba does an excellent job of bringing you music that will always sound fresh and inviting for years to come.

No halogens would be, as the technology is totally different. However, these are much much better than blue tinted bulbs or other bulbs that claim to give the HID look.

I can recommend either model, highly, but my preference is for the larger one.

Every day, in every moment my life is more satisfying and more fun. For me, the true beauty of Instantaneous Transformation is that my life dramatically transformed without me doing anything. I've discovered the true magic of being (instead of doing). Since discovering Instantaneous Transformation I've had the most satisfying relationships, the best job, the most money and the most fun.

Too bad, because I liked the direction it was headed, but some direction/excercises on how to do that NOW thing would have been helpful. I guess you need to take their workshops for that. And what's with the trademark every time the 'instantaneous transformation' words came together? Kinda cheap, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money","review":"I bought this book while browsing through the self-help section.I read it in two days. And after having finished it and putting it down, I felt like: 'And now what?'I have read a number of self-help books and I can say this one comes at the bottom of the list.The authors did not come up with any original ideas, only rechewed ideas, put in different terms, that others have already addressed. The book is not even that well-written.So please, do not spend the money you worked so hard for on this book. There are other books or tapes well worth it, but this isn't the one.One VERY SERIOUS criticism I have is: People that have gone through traumatic situations in life, DO need the help of a therapist, maybe even combined with some chemical treatment. And even remotely suggesting that just concentrating on being here and now, and finding a way around your W.O.R.M's will do it??? Come on. That is totally irresponsable.This book is definately a thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close, but no cigar!","review":"This is a good book, if you are interested in self-improvement, but perhaps a better one is John Cantwell Kiley's SELF RESCUE, which has been around for over a decade and is still valid. It details some methods that actuall work. Or try one of the books on self-hynosis, like SELF HYNOSIS by Alma and Lambrou. Those techniques definitely work. Actually, they are simply positive thinking carried a bit further, to a more effective level.Joseph Pierre,author of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our Journey Through Eternity"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vague","review":"I found this book to be very vague. The basic message seems to be that one should feel their feelings a basic principle of psychotherapy. They also convey that feeling your feelings or living in the moment requires no effort. I strongly disagree with this point. When myriads of negative messages are sitting in one's psyche it takes a consious effort to deal with them. Typical of their over simplified approach is that one needs to forgive to be able to live in the moment. If forgiveness was this easy we'd all be doing it. In an idealistic state they are correct that living in the moment is the goal. The road to getting there they completely ignore leaving the reader sime vague hints about letting go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I felt like this book was a total waste of money. I can't believe all the positive reviews about it are for real - it doesn't seem like anyone who has actually read it and who has also read any of the great \\"self improvement\\" authors could ever think this book was anything but a poor imposter. These folks gave it a good try, but they are just stating the obvious and repackaging very old, common practices of self-improvement.

This is a book with style and no substance.Comments such as \\"What I resist, persists and goes stronger\\" are not new.I kept waiting for some great insight to be presented but it never was.

To save you the trouble of buying this very short book (the advertising section for their other books and workshops is about as long as one of their few chapters)I sum it up for you:Live in the present,don't judge or critizise, just notice what happens, and the feeling will go away, don't resist emotions etc etc Some stories to illustrate their points are outright ridiculous,e.g.,the author gets a nasty burn on her leg while riding a motorcycle (and goes on and on about how much it hurt) but instead of going to a doctor she sits around hurting all day long, takes another bike-ride, puts a little ice on the wound and learns to live through the pain by visualizing its colour and how much water would fit into it (one of their principles- take whatever feeling comes and live it!)Not worth your time or your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In a Class of It's Own!","review":"\\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work\\" by Ariel & Shya Kane is a breath of fresh air in the everyday smog of life.

The book is about learning how to live life to its fullest and to be satisfied in all aspects of your life. The authors suggest we put awareness on how much we pick up prejudices and life choices from our surroundings. The Kanes go through \\"The Principles of Transformation,\\" a toolset for looking at how you relate to your life that allows you to have a slight shift in how you experience things.

Unfortunately their catchy title (as evidenced by all the positive reviews) is helping do just that. Don't be caught!! Spit the hook out and swallow something of substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new under the sun","review":"This book and the ideas proposed by the author's have a registered trademark! This is an oversimplified layout of acheiving internal peace and transformation. The authors propose that living in the moment and forgiving others are the means to achieve inner peace.

But of course, the book is about completely the opposite, i.e. how to work at not working!So, just another self-help book thinly disguised as a non-self-help book.Interestingly, a book that does pay off on this book's title goes under the title Radical Self-Acceptance,by Tara Brach.

Working on Yourself Doesn't Work has absolutely nothing new to offer in the field of transformation by being in the Now. It is a silly sham of a book. I am certain publishers must have believed this too so the authors self published it..as in ASK productions, Inc. Indeed it was a production that yielded nothing but my loss of 12.95 for which I have asked reimbursement.

Working on Yourself, etc. is a real piece of retro - go back about twenty years when everyone was writing self-help books that were all hailed as life-changing.

The Kanes, sensitive and insightful people who are clearly enthusiastic about life and sharing with others their experiences and observations, explore with the reader the behaviors and tendencies that people have developed over time that limit our ability to live in the present. The simple experience of reading the book brings this awareness. The Kanes explain and illustrate their principles of transformation with simplicity, honesty and compassion. Keeping their language clear, straightforward and thoroughly understandable, they offer their personal experiences, which are very touching and sincere, with clients, family members and each other as examples of the effectiveness of this incredible phenomenon of transformation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book, supporting you in not trying to get better.","review":"This is a great book. It has all the principles you need to be happy or better yet 'to be'. The Kanes know how life works. Sometimes it's hard to be in the moment, but after another read in the book (i've read it twice already and will read it even more often) I get reminded again how to get into the moment (by trying not to get there). The book is very easy readable but goes very deep. My life has changed for the (much) better because of living by these seemingly obvious principles. I would recommend the book to anybody who wants personal tranformation and has tried alle kinds of workshops trying to be a better person. This book is not about trying to be better but about knowing how to be.

I could really relate to that, and could recognize many instances in my own life where I have felt upset about something and vowed never to let myself get in that position again.

The authors basically fit a brochure into the space of a book by double spacing, including useless drawings, and leaving lots of blank spaces. Skip this and go right to the THE POWER OF NOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"so simple and yet so effective!","review":"Only the three described principles reveal such a good!When I put my awareness to it I am fascinated how often they show up in daily life. They explain the mechanism, that keeps us away from living in the moment and they do it in such a way not to analyse but with humor to see what is.Through this I experienced a profound change, which without aiming for change, makes my life more valuable, more satisfied and richer, for example in relationship to friends, parents, my daughter and myself.This book is a true treasure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vague and oversimplified","review":"This book has some great ideas, but they aren't exactly new: you must forgive others to truly be free, live in the moment, be self aware.

There are a lot of other books that do a better job of explaining these concepts."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disapppointment","review":"Not to take away from those that rated this book well but this book promised a lot and delivered very little.

This book is one more instalment in his apparently endless series of tomes berating clean air and water. Basically, the book boils down to Arnold's outrage at the fact that environmentalism has value, and can compete for the dollars of good citizens, who use their economic clout (through foundations) to protect the environment. The book proves the maxim: capitalists want capitalism for everyone but themselves. Arnold can't stand the fact that environmentalism successfully competes in the marketplace and the marketplace of ideas. His response, as always, is to insult. A thoroughly disagreeable book, and a worthy addition to the Arnold repetitive oevre of industrialism for industrialism's sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vague and sloppy logic","review":"Undue influence is good if you are a a fan of red scare McCarthyism. This book demonizes people who place the health of communities and ecosystems above the profit motives of companies. This book is a sad reminder that the environmental movement needs to reach out to more people especially in rural America where folks are skeptical of conservation measures.This book supports increased mining, clear-cutting of ancient forests, and destruction of habitats for profit. Very disturbing material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selfish liars who want to eat up the earth","review":"It is digusting to see these kinds of books that tell lies about what is happening to the planet and about the people who are trying to save it. Humans are not the only sacred species. We might want to demonstrate how godly we are by showing some love and empathy for the other beautiful creatures and places that God made for us. Instead, people like Arnold want to burn everything good as fast as possible. This book is full of slanders, libels and undocumented assertions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blatant disregard for logic or accuracy","review":"As a professional scientist working in a biological discipline, I can assure you that this book is neither accurate nor even logical at times. Facts are grossly inaccurate or intentionally misleading, and not surprizingly, it's the facts which are left out that are most glaringly obvious... This is just another radical and paranoid account of this subject matter. A great read if you want insight into the psychology of the fearful and delusional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five percent logic, 95 percent nonsense","review":"Ron's right, there are a few instances where the enviro-nuts have gone overboard and just don't make sense.

It's just really out of left field, but some how it was pulled off and didn't seem totally ridiculous, great cult film type of feel.Some good tense scenes, some fine acting by young Jodi Foster, and hey watching the film you would think martin sheen really was a child molester irl!A good pick up in my book.OH, I almost forgot the sound track... for shame. It sounds like it was wrenched from a cheezy 70 porno flick. When the tension hook comes in the form of \\"waka-chicka-waka-chicka\\" you know something has gone terribly awry.

Production value is like a bad 70's after-school special. NOT a thriller or suspenseful in any way. The score had me laughing, I think it may have been tracks from the Barnababy Jones TV show. It's a horror all right, horrible story, writing, plot, character development - you name it.

I am having a little difficulty lowering the volume as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great quality, not completely wireless","review":"I had this product for a very short amount of time, in the interest of fairness I will say the sound quality was great and loved the comfort of the set. This was a purchase for a new home office. Loved the features listed to pick up calls remotely, adjust volume and great distance from the base. My only complaint and reason for returning it, is that the unit by itself is not completely wireless. After I received it I learned I had to have a headset lifter device to get it to answer using the headset, when I heard \\"simply purchase the add on and tape it to the phone\\" I decided this product was not the one for me. If you have a commercial land line this would be a great product. If looking to add on to a standard personal phone (home office), be prepared to tape the lifter to your phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pantrontics Wireless Headset","review":"Wireless is wireless - the product review state good receiption I beleive up to 300 ft. This headset when in a range that it likes works well, but as soon as you are about 100 ft away the receiption gets poor continuously cutting out so you miss half the conversation.

Once the headset is setup (by your office tech person) and the battery is charged, the only difficult thing is to rememember to place the headset back into the base station for charging the battery.The add-on automatic handset lifter (Plantronics HL 10) is a must have for this headset system, so no more fumbling with manually removing the handset from the phone to use the wireless headset. Simply press the call button on the headset and you can remotely answer and hang up the phone as the small motorized HL 10 lifts the phone handset up to answer a call or sets it down to hang up, even when away from your desk!We are also going to try the add-on Call Indicator Light which I understand is compatible with a simple 1/8\\" headphone Y-adaptor to expand from one HL 10 port to two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work and slow response for refund","review":"Tried to set up with Cisco SPA525G2 phone, but it did not work at all (the phone did work with another model of Plantronics headset.)

His main character is realistically torn between the flattery of a popular bully and the cameraderie of new friends who are way outside the in crowd. That alone will cause young readers to buy into this story. Patneaude adds suspense, some memorable characters, and drama, along with a satisfying conclusion. Young readers will almost certainly forgive the preachy and over-long finale wherein the bullies get their due.

All the hype, Quentin Tarentino's admiration, exciting and flashy advertising, limited (25K) release, ability to buy it before the official release date - I've never seen anything quite like it before. So I finally got the movie, dropped everything and watched it. What a dissapointment! I knew that it was not a great filmmaking but I could not imagine how bad this movie really was. It's trashy from start to finish. No acting to talk about, no decent editing (scenes drag on forever - thank you for the fast forward button), no musical score. If the director went to study with Ingmar Bergman (as some reviews claim), he probably flunked the course. Yes, I have to admit that Christina Lindberg is cute and the color-coordinated eye patches are trendy, but she cannot act. Overall, waste of time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A cruel picture indeed...","review":"A truly banal and grotesque movie with completely raw and indecorous scenes of phony violence and penetration that seem to arbitrarily punctuate the otherwise lame plot. At this point, I deem it unnecessary to go into the details of the story for the mere fact that it's completely pointless, and has been summed up in all of its glory elsewhere. The \\"Tarantino\\" reference seems misplaced at best, as this move bears no semblance to his slick stylized mayhem and tension driven flicks. One can compare viewing \\"Thriller\\" to observing the proto-art of the Neolithic era and noting some very oblique similarities of the pornographic cave carvings to the works of Rubens. So, in that anthropological sense, it is a quite curious yet not a wholly pleasing experience. Buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost the worst movie I've ever seen","review":"I don't understand how people actually enjoyed this movie. It can barely be considered a film, it's more of a porno, and a very bad one at that. The music was terrible, honestly, I've heard better music on early Nintendo games. The action scene where she beats up the cops with 4 or 5 simple moves took an agonizingly long 4:15 in the extra-slow motion the director insisted on using.

Even if you think this CD is older, still get it because it's still very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This should be retitled \\"Greatest Dance Hits of the 90s\\"!","review":"This is a great compilation! 17 of the 90s greatest dance hits on one explosive cd! What could be better! Songs like \\"Missing\\", \\"Where Do You Go?\\" and \\"Another Night\\" represent the earlier years of 90s dance. \\"Dreamer\\", \\"I Like to Move It\\", and \\"Boom Boom Boom\\" are defenite club hits! But among this vast list of party smashes are just a couple of ultimate hits. \\"Beautiful Life\\", beautifully performed by the best group on the planet, Ace of Base, is one of them. The other is \\"C'mon & Ride It (The Train)\\" by one of the decade's biggest dance acts, Quad City DJs. These two hits are for sure the biggest dance tracks ever! This is an amazing party cd (I bought it in summer 98, and this album helped me party on down!) and everyone who wants the biggest club hits of the 90s needs this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best dance collection ever?","review":"This CD will be great to listen to years from now. It's tough to say this about a lot of various artists dance CD's but this one is very good and well worth buying (if you haven't done so already)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"This was a pretty good cd, just like ultimate dance party 1999, except 1999 rules! These songs were mostly good, but some of them weren't good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good manual","review":"If you are starting out on a telemetry unit, or just want to review some anatomy, physiology and pathology, this is a pretty good book. It also gives info on contemporary testing and surgical interventions for cardiac diseases. A little pricey, but I would reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and badly bound","review":"The \\"useable\\" content of this book could easily be distilled down to 12-15 pages. Nichols uses the book as an opportunity to strike out against those that he feels have personally wronged him. The \\"evidence\\" that he draws on is heavily biased. His stated strategies are often contradictory and to top it all off the book literally fell apart...the binding is cheap. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whether you are a CEO or activist, this book is Junk","review":"This book is not even worth the 27 cents you can buy it for. Don't waste your time, there are much more sophisticated and contemporary ways of advancing business interests in a responsible and highly profitable way. To live without integrity might be alluring to some, but ultimately it is not fulfilling or patriotic. I am proud to live in America. This guy sucks, from a corporate American standpoint. Nick Nichols, stop wasting our time with this kind of trash, we dont want it, and there is already enough mind pollution in our country. Leave good thinking to those who can do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Defense...","review":"Ever wonder why companies do such a rotten job defending themselves against meritless attacks? Nick Nichols tells you why. It's lack of guts and the pernicious belief that allowing your corporation to be smeared is somehow smart PR. This book provides invaluable advice on what to do when you're in the media cross-hairs. I loved the chapter about how media icon Bill Moyers covered the chemical industry with \\"no questions asked\\" because both he and PBS believe that one side tells all. A tough, funny and very serious book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rules for Corporate Profiteering","review":"Social equity in business is obviously a totally foreign concept to Nick Nichols. His Rules for Corporate Warriors is nothing more than a recipe book for companies looking to pile up big profits without any concern for the environment or social justice. Activists have made great progress in recent years forcing companies to change how they do business. Now comes this book of strategies for stopping \\"attacks\\" on business by \\"radicals.\\" For those who don't want to see a return to the days when companies cared about nothing but their shareholders, this book is a call to arms. Take out your dogged-eared copies of Saul Alinsky's classic and let's go get \`em."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written Corporate Diatribe","review":"Mr. Nichols no doubt feels upstaged by his more eloquent business partner, Eric Dezenhall, and his writing ability. As he well should. I do battle with some of the same groups he describes in his book and though some of his tactics may be applicable, his hysterical and poorly thought through style of writing forced me to ignore the better parts of the book and just struggle to get through it. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Sharon","review":"Just had a baby this winter and I started following FitTV on one of the Discovery Channels- well I discovered Sharon Mann. She is incredible. Not only does she have more energy than anyone I know but she is fun and easy to follow. She gets me going most mornings and now I have her DVD so I can do her workout whenever. Sharon Mann mixes it up so you can't get bored or too fatigued but results are a given when you follow her direction. There is no way you can just sit and watch her show you have to get up and participate. Love her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The new release doesn't work but the older version did","review":"A couple years ago I bought her complete box set from my local video store. I LOVED her workouts! I never got bored and I reached my target weight in only 5 months. It was great for the winter months. However, after a couple years of use, 2 of the 3 CDs got scratched so I reordered them from Amazon.However, the since the time I bought them, they have redone the cover design and it is evident also the quality of reproduction for the CD has been compromised. The new versions don't work properly in my dvd player. I even went out and bought a new dvd player after Amazon shipped me a second set of videos which didn't work. The problem didn't go away. Basically, they either don't read, or when they do read in the player, the menu doesn't work right or the video skipps. Very dissapointing since I actually looked forward to working out with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!","review":"I love the cardio DVD. My favorite workouts are the kickboxing and the hi low. I think it was a great investment. I do her every other day for my cardio and have enjoyed it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a lot better","review":"Given the single review I thought this would be a good addition to by collection of gay genre films. Overall I was very disappointed. I have seven other Philippine movies that are well made. This one was disjointed, hard to follow, subtitles would fly across the screen with not enough time to read. Overall, it felt like a high school production. I think I understood what the writer was trying to communicate, the circles of life, but he did not execute well."},{"rating":"1","title":"she can do better than that","review":"Tebaldi had beautiful voice, but she is boring here. Callas is far better in this role, really."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen Renata","review":"All I can say about this album is that Renata Tebaldi is the greatest Mimi I've ever come across (and I have 6 copies of Boheme). Her lyricism is unbeatable. I cannot listen to this album without weeping. BUY THIS NOW!!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for experienced yoga fans!","review":"As much as I like and respect Rodney Yee, I found this video too basic for me. Each stretch is not held long enough to allow the muscle to relax. I felt rushed through the entire AM session. For me I have to pause each pose to achieve relaxation and then continue. In doing that it disrupts my zen space. In short, if you have NEVER done yoga before, go for it. This video is short 20 minutes sessions, and will give you a flavor of what yoga is. On the other-hand, if you are a yoga enthusiast, try one of Rodney Yee's other videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ways to start and end your day","review":"I have used these sessions for the last few months and what a difference they have made in my life. The PM yoga is a bit more strenuous than the AM version, which is strange, but they are both very, very effective. This is good stuff!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Place to Start","review":"I first picked these up on VHS a few years ago, for stress relief. The AM Yoga portion is a relatively easy routine for a quick dose of energy to get your day going, but it was really the PM Yoga that did the trick for me. Some of the poses in the latter are initially challenging, but after a week or two became second nature. I can't praise these sessions enough. Now that my VHS player is long since toast, I'm ecstatic both are on one DVD unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"AM is OK, PM is Horrible","review":"The AM section of this DVD is OK for beginners like me. It moves a little quickly, but I got the hang of it after a couple of sessions. The PM section is HORRIBLE for inflexible beginners, and it is NOT relaxing or soothing at all. Most of it requires you to stand up and do very harsh, fast pulling and twisting of the legs and back. I thought the PM section would help me get to sleep, but instead I went to bed with my back hurting & creaking, and feeling stressed out and frustrated. I will have to find another DVD to get a soothing stretch before bedtime. I would not recommend this DVD to beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing in English, Instruction in French - Can't Return It!","review":"I had to open this dvd (cover in English) and select play on a menu written in English to find out that ALL of the verbal instructions were being given in French. Now that I've opened it, I can't return it per Amazon policy! I'm sure it's a good dvd and would love to find out but I'm not willing to take the risk of buying another one at full price when it could be as useless as the first. I don't speak the French language. (By the way, it's not anything that can be changed on the menu - my only option was to select French subtitles!) I think I deserve a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Unless your almost dead this DVD is just too easy and is not really Yoga. I have an old Rodney Yee VHS 20 minute tape that was great for a quickie and thought this was the same in DVD.

I wassurprised then to find the PM so much better then the reviews said. TheAm section left me feeling sleepy like I want to go back to bed. The PMis energizing. The poses are held longer so you actually feel something- though I wish for still longer! I suggest switching the Am & PMsection. I think this may work better.One pet peeve: wish they did not move so fast between exercises. Thisis my second Rodney Yee DVD and the other one left me frustrated as wellin this respect. I find myself always playing catch up and the twistingto look at the screen upsets my alignment and equilibrium and does notrelax me.I do like how they explain how to use props and you get to do just that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Fast Too Vague","review":"I have taken Tai Chi (Taiji) as a class and I have self learned Belly Dancing and the number key compoent for these two practices to be useful and succesful is: Posture!! And while I know both of these practices are not yoga related, the point is in every physical discipline posture is key. This DVD tells you nothing about posture at all and since its a beginners DVD I would think it should. In yoga stances he never tells you what position your hips, shoulders, and back should be in. All and all I find it too confusing. Plus he speeds through yoga much too fast. I've never taken yoga and even I feel way too rushed. As soon as you get into a stance your changing before you can even \\"feel\\" the stance. I think it would be great as a routine to set up for someone who already knows a little yoga, but its definatly not for beginners. Big ol' disappointment if you ask me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great yoga video!","review":"I bought this DVD so I'd have the opportunity to do yoga at the hotel since I travel a lot and could never make it to the yoga classes at the gym. I think the AM and PM sessions are excellent for beginners. You really feel refreshed, stretched out and relaxed afterwards. I would recommend this to anyone who is just starting out in Yoga."},{"rating":"2","title":"AM/PM Yoga for Beginners","review":"Excellent for beginners and those who have to be careful because of back/neck problems. It helps me start the day out with a positive & happpy outlook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This should be titled pre-beginner. The morning exercise hardly even gives you a stretch. It really is just a waste of time. The afternoon exercise is a little more of a stretch, but neither is close to being a good solid yoga stretch/workout. I am just a beginner, but this is totally a waste of time and very limited energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sergei","review":"Yoga for the 21st century. Superficial and rushed.If you have ever done any stretching or yoga this will be too easy for you. Perhaps geriatirics would find it useful. The elementary poses are not \\"held\\" at all diminishing their value. There is virtually no emphasis on \\"breath\\" and breathing, a second major fault in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, could be better","review":"A great introduction to yoga. Pleasant and easy to follow, but very hurried in presentation. If you plan to follow along with the DVD you will find the poses hurried and impossible to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"boring if you're fit at all","review":"I find this yoga DVD not nearly challenging enough. I felt nothing at all happening. Nothing is held long enough and worst of all it was unforgivingly boring. Especially the long commercial they force you to sit through at the beginning. The most excitement I had was trying to figure out why this is at the top of the yoga DVD's on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I have had several Rodney Yee yoga videos in the past that were great so this purchase was easy. The product delivered is of a very poor production quality. It actually looks like a recording of a recording. Not expected from a DVD. Getting beyond the production, the exercise content is very minimal. The instruction is for ABSOLUTE beginners (people that have never attempted yoga) which is frustrating because the DVD cannot be returned now that it is open. Wish I had paid closer attention to the reviews and description before this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"I bought this DVD because I wanted a couple short workouts to fit into my weekdays, but the advertisements that you HAVE to watch have done nothing but irritate me. They suck up time I don't have, defeating the purpose of the DVD. The workouts themselves are fine, although I expected a bit more guidance since it also says it's for beginners. I think their teaching style just isn't right for me, I like to be reminded to keep my back straight, to release/hold my breath as I perform a certain pose, etc. These two like to use their pose terms, which doesn't mean anything if I have no idea what that means. Also, there are only French subtitles - no English."},{"rating":"2","title":"AM PM Yoga Review","review":"This video is EXCELLENT for the person who needs to start their day more flexible, but cannot over exert their body for any reason. I sell this DVD in my massage therapy business and it goes like hotcakes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wore out my old VHS tape and upgraded to DVD","review":"I had this set on VHS and particularly LOVED the am workout with Rodney. It's short enough to squeeze in between the school bus pick up and leaving for work but seems to really hit all the right spots to start the day well. The pm one with Patricia is OK but I bought it for the am one alone. When my tape wore out - I told you I use it a lot - I was SOOOOO happy to find it still available on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy yoga for relaxation and decrease stress","review":"I have been using this tape/dvd periodically for the last 3 years. This is a great tape on simple exercise using easy yoga. I am a physician and I frequently suggest patients use this. This is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety and stress. This is a classic for stress reduction. Rodney Lee does an excellent job in demonstrating and explaining the exercise. anyone can do this including the elderly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Workout with mediocre production","review":"I like that this DVD has two completely different workouts. In particular, the morning half is a wonderful way to wake up.The reason I don't use it much is that it plays a 5 minute (seems like 20) commercial. Always. No skipping, no fast forwarding. Drives me nuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent AM yoga - PM yoga lacking","review":"If I were rating only the AM portion of this DVD (with Rodney Yee), it would definitely get 5 stars. Unfortunately, the PM portion is ruined by Patricia Walden. For starters, she apparently missed the \\"for beginners\\" section of the title. She also seems to have devised a program much more appropriate for NOT relaxing at the end of the day. I do the AM portion every morning and am very satisfied with this. I just wish Rodney Yee had done both segments."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for seniors","review":"I have tapes by Lelias and Peggy Cappy which are mild and for beginners. The a.m. part of this is mild and Rod Yee is adequate. The p.m. portion by Pat Walden moves too quickly and without timely explanations. I am in my 70's and some of these postures are impossible for me as they would be for any beginner of senior age. Another big minus is that the production seems as interested in shooting beautiful scenery as they are in the yoga positions. Even though the scenery in Death Valley and the Hawii beaches are dramatic -- there is no excuse for having long distance shots of yoga positions. This is not for beginners or seniors."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my first yoga DVDs that got me started 3 years ago","review":"I love Rodney Yee...

I very much enjoy AM Yoga For Your Week, also by Rodney Yee, which I give 5 stars. I had high hopes for this video, but must give it only 2 stars. The DVD has two practices, one for AM, led by Rodney Yee, and the second for PM, led by Patricia Walden. I find the AM session very simple, so in that respect it is good for a beginner, but I feel that Rodney speeds through the poses extremely quickly. I use the pause button to allow time to hold the pose before moving on, but I feel this really interferes with the session. In contrast I find the PM session much more challenging, expecting great flexibility and at least moderate strength in the poses and transitions. The pace of this practice is much better however. Due to this unevenness I do not recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick shipping & perfect condition","review":"I like this yoga video from the past. I ordered it and it came right away in perfect condition. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"we love rodney","review":"This dvd is short enough to squeeze into my (generally rushed) morning routine, but still gets the blood flowing and the stretching I need in order to get through the day. It is not very demanding, but is great for someone like me, who is recovering from an injury. I bought this DVD on a review that said it was good for recovering. I am going to buy his \\"AM yoga for your week\\" b/c I love Rodney's style. I even got my mom to try it when I went to visit her, and she's hooked. She went around telling everyone we saw how much she loves Rodney!!

It is short but includes quite a few poses and is a good start to the day. The PM portion is too difficult for me but the DVD is worth it for the AM portion alone. I've gotten many others to use it too and they feel the same. Still the best for a 13 minute workout in early a.m.(I use the 3rd & 4th section) that has stretching, bending and twisting at 6 years.

I bought this video years ago and the AM section with Rodney Yee has helped me to strengthen and resolve issues, as well as prevent any further injuries. The PM video, however, is not so great. That one just hurts and you may as well throw it out. But its worth it to buy to AM routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"I have been practicing Yoga for 2 years, but I am still a beginner. The morning workout is too short and seems like it should be the evening/relaxing workout. There are very few true Yoga poses. I do not get much ouf of this Yoga video. Doing streches on my own would have the same impact. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"When you just need a good stretch","review":"I would consider myself a beginner, having worked with Yee's Power Yoga series almost daily for only a little over a year now and enjoying it quite a bit. But instead of a work-out, sometimes I really just want a routine that helps me wind down at night before going to bed, and Patricia Walden's \\"PM\\" part is doing that nicely. The only complaint I have is that the voice-over is a bit mumbled.I have done the AM part once -- in the afternoon: I really can't see myself doing this right after getting up early on a regular work day. Sorry, Rodney, I will have to stick to coffee on that one! Nonetheless, the routine itself is of the accustomed quality, if you know any of the other Yee DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Short, just like the length","review":"I just bought this DVD along with another Yoga DVD. This one is more of a meditation and relaxation video than a workout video. Most people say the segments are each 20 minutes long, but that's only if you do all of the meditation. The workouts are actually 13 minutes for the AM and 18 minutes for the PM. The other video I purchased has so much more to offer with more than one routine and much more length. If you don't want to spend a lot of time working out, press stop when you're ready. This video is over before you know it. In addition, the PM section wakes you up more than the AM, so I'd reverse the order when using. Definitely go for a Bryan Kest video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"This was not what I was looking for in a morning Yoga DVD. The music is so loud I can not hear him when he talks.

I am new to yoga-- and I kept turning my head in attempt to see what the people were doing.. when they would change positions. Half the time, the video would start showing nature scenes without the person (Keep in mind.. sometimes I was still attempting to master the position, figure it out, or a change just went unnoticed)-- ie. flying through the sky or over the sea. I guess you're not supposed to be looking at the TV screen?After awhile, I got used to the exercises and didn't need to watch the screen. So I guess I could have enjoyed the scenery... but I just thought of it as a waste of my time...I prefer the Yoga offered though Yourself!Fitness' Meditation Garden option...

The AM routine is very soothing and short-- about ten minutes. It's beautifully shot and the music is relaxing, and the poses are very simple. I actually like this better at night.The PM program is longer-- about 25 minutes. It's also a little more energetic than the morning version, and includes more standing poses. It's also beautifully shot with relaxing music.While each segment is very nice, it's not a lot for the money.

Yoga has changed my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"End your day annoyed","review":"I really wanted to enjoy and appreciate this program. I am a longtime fan of Rodney Yee, and I like some of his other work very much. For me, the trouble was with the P.M. section -- I found Patricia Walden to be so incredibly annoying that instead of growing relaxed and ready for restorative sleep, I got more and more tense. Her instructions were unhelpful and even though the poses were quite basic, I found myself getting turned around, and even felt physically uncomfortable at times, simply because the directions were unclear.Simply put, this is just not good. I'll try Rodney Yee's other work, but the next time I see Patricia Walden's name associated with a project, I will be certain to give it a miss. I wish I could return this disk, but unfortunately, the fact that the program itself is defective does not qualify as a reason for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Addition to My Daily Routine","review":"I suppose it probably isn't fair for me to offer a review for this DVD as I've only ever done half of it--the A.M. Yoga w/ Rodney Yee; however, just that section alone makes this DVD worth every penny! I had never done yoga before, and this is a fabulous introduction to it. By the end of it, I always feel simultaneously energized and relaxed and completely ready for the day! Every pose is very doable and all you need is a yoga mat, a strap (I use one that I removed from a duffel bag, though actual yoga straps area available to purchase), and a folded blanket. I start my daily exercise routine w/ A.M. yoga and then move onto a different DVD, but starting it w/ A.M. yoga makes exercising something I finally enjoy and look forward to everyday!"},{"rating":"2","title":"am/pm yoga excellent for the beginner!","review":"Rodney Yee keeps his yoga relaxing, gentle and to the point. Perfect for the begginer as well as the experienced yoga student the 15 to 20 minute time factor makes it easy to fit into any ones routine. Wheather it's am or pm now you have no excuse not to have yoga become a part of your excercise protocol. And the price works too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AM YOGA A BIT TOO FAST","review":"The actual moves are great, but he sequences a bit fast. The stretches/moves should be a bit slower to change from one to the next, to really benefit from the routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the AM!","review":"I absolutely LOVE the AM yoga routine. It is very easy, and it's great for beginners. It does exactly as it says it will: wakes you up to be ready for the day while keeping you relaxed. This is also great for me because it helps me to be less anxious throughout the day. It may not be descriptive enough, but I recommend actually watching ANY follow-along fitness video before trying to do it. That way you aren't staring at the tv while trying to touch your toes.I didn't really care for the PM yoga routine, it didn't seem to flow as well for me. It was much worse than the AM for giving detailed directions.I loved the AM so much, I'd recommend you buy it for that alone. This is great paired with Rodney Yee's \\"Yoga for Beginners\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great yogaphobes like me","review":"This is a nice and easy yoga work out. I've used it off-and on for years and really enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to get started with Yoga!","review":"I'm new to yoga. I always wanted to do it, but was very intimidated by the whole process. Rodney Yee's morning workout (the A.M.) is great to get you going in the morning by easing you into activity instead of jumping into it. However, the reason for the tapes 4 star review, instead of a perfect 5 is that Rodney does seem to have a tendancy to speed through. From the little reading I have done, it seems that you are to hold a yoga pose for much longer then Mr. Yee istructs us to do so.Then there's the Patricia Walden portion (the P.M.) is perfection. She is consistently instructive in helping us maintain and achieve better posture and correct positioning. Not to mention that, in my opinion, her routine is better paced for us beginners. Lovely experience. In fact, I enjoyed her workout so much that I went on to order more DVDs of just Ms. Walden's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need my AM Yoga like most need coffee...","review":"I've been doing Yoga for about 6 years now and I can say that the PM Yoga is definetely not for beginners. However, the AM Yoga could be used at any level. The AM series wakes me up gently, both body and mind. The PM Yoga is challenging but I'm so happy when I do it! However, my lower back is usually sore during the relaxation stage and I haven't figured out which pose is causing that. Anyway, I highly reccommend for someone who doesn't have a lot of time to devote to Yoga but does has some time. It's not a time to hurry, it's a time to slow down and relax and take care of your body."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are better Rodney DVDs!","review":"I am partial to this because it was my first yoga DVD. It is pretty slow like other reviewers have said and I grew out of it quickly but it is great when you don't know anything yet. If you are a total beginner you might like this. I think there are better Rodney DVDs available. Look at his older ones, not his newer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rome vidio \\"When Rome Ruled\\"","review":"I am very disappointed in National Geographic for this product. Very cheaply done, a lot of replays of the same scenes throughout the vidios. With all the history available for the Roman Empire its like they were choosing to tell us what they thought we wanted ie, Gladiators, it left a lot and I mean a lot of questions that I was hoping to get answered. Who wants to hear about one of the most disapointing emperors of Rome with Caligulu, when you can talk about many many more leaders who people dont know about. I can think of many others who will tell how Rome cracked the eggshell out of the normal Roman small country and taking Veii, the first foreign territory taken from the Etruscans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong picture on DVD cover.","review":"Presumably someone at the National Geographic HQ knows the difference between the Acropolis in ATHENS, GREECE and the remains of the Forum in ROME, ITALY right?

Please correct this mistake NG!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incomplete","review":"FYI, this DVD contains 6 parts plus a bonus part.

But a couple of years later it gotten kind of dumb and boring. I have to say I like the first one. The new edition to the first Ghostbusters on DVD is great. It has alot of great features like theatrical trailers, making of, deleted scenes, and the tracks and trivia. The tracks and trivia is my favorite because you'll find out of what really happened during the movie. I hope they make a Ghostbusters 3 soon, that would be awesome. I think Bill Murray is hilarious and so is Dan Aykroyd. But there not that funny in the second one. The second one just has references to the first Ghostbusters except for the jello scene. If you don't have any of the Ghostbusters movie stick with the first one because it's great, the second one is not very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far better than the original","review":"This is the best movie ever, ever.They have pink slime and it makes things slimy and than dance. I laughed a lot at that crazy toster!The black Ghostbuster talks a lot more in this one, which is neat, because that helps erace prujudicice.My frind Sean makes me watch this movie a lot, but thats okay becuase were frends and this movie it the best ever ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would REALLY Love To Review This DVD (but...)","review":"When I opened the packaging and fought with the DVD seals (I hate those!) I excitedly threw the DVD into my player only to be severely disappointed. IT WAS THE ORIGINAL GHOSTBUSTERS! Somehow an original got placed into a Ghostbusters 2 box! I now am the proud owner of two copies. I tried to take it back but the store has a no return or exchange policy on CD's & DVDs.Be Warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the best sequels ever","review":"this film was more creppy than the original in so many elements: the slime was growing when people were p*ssed off. the scoleri brothers were scarier than slimer the song monologue when the ghostbusters were in the nuthouse Vigo the painting shows up more than Gozer in part one. Though there are punchlines that people might repeat such as the \\"sometimes s**t happens\\", it could've work better as a comedy like the original. Anyway, this is the only sequel i watch during my senior year because there were somethings that made me freaked out. I have the entire soundtrack and I get crazed on the sequel whenever I'm scared or in a jolly mode. This if the first movie you should see on Halloween then the original and so forth."},{"rating":"1","title":"No where near as good as the first Ghostbusters","review":"I don't understand! where did Ivan Rightman go wrong! Ghostbusters an awsome film it was good at the ending of the first! It didn't deserve a sequal easpeacially as dumb and boring one like this pppppppfffffffffff pethetic! And Slimer my favorite ghost looks nothing like he does in the first. Well you should see it anyway if you liked the first. YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS FILM!!! I guess. Also see this film Ghostbusters"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ehh... inconsistancies but it's still GB","review":"Okay, the second movie is cool- but all around it's not as good as the first. The whole Egon/Janine relationship is thrown to the winds and she hooks up with Louis of all people. I personally have never liked Louis as a character. Egon says some things that the character wouldn't say \\"I think they're more interested in my Epiditymus...\\" do you happen to know what part of the anatomy an epiditymus is? Here's a clue it's not his nose or his feet. And the scene with Dana and Spengler in the lab at the first has always disturbed me as oddly done- Egon just isn't acting like Egon. The best part of this movie is more Winston/Ray interaction-- and more Winston all over. He didn't get to talk much in the first movie. The special effects are cool and I wish I could get a print of the painting at the end for my wall- so overall it's an average movie with a special kick, because it's the GHOSTBUSTERS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Distinguished yet Forgotten Valor","review":"If the global conquest of earth by the forces of Evil hung in the balance and could be tipped in the favor for the good of all mankind by these three sorry looking men of distinguished yet long forgotten valor - let's just say that I hope you know some really good prayers.

But they've all gone their seperate ways! Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) is once again a scientist at the university. Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) has become a bookstore owner with books about, of course, paranormal activity. And goofball Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) has become a T.V. show host about the strange and unusual. But, in a court case, they must deam their proton backpacks once more! Get ready for this out of this world movie that is one of the best sequels ever made! Some people don't agree with me on this, but it IS one of the greatest sequels ever made.

(We would all say it was for the money, of course, but I think I know what Mr. Murray was talking about after sitting through this).The Stay Puft Marshmellow Man attacking NYC in the first film was funny.The Statue of Liberty used to help NYC get its groove back was just lame and silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good film but NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL","review":"I've always liked the film.

So, The spark between her & Peter was lost.Bill you can NOT beat his performance in both films as Venkman.The DVD package. Lack of anything special. NO EXTRAS EXCEPT 2 EPISODES OF THE ANIMATED SHOW.

YOU GUYS DID NOT EVEN TRY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun sequel, but not as good as the original!","review":"I remember going to see it in theaters when I was 9! I thought it was very cool to see the Ghostbusters come back to save the day from Vigo the Carpathian who's spirit resides within a painting, and who is planning \\"the season of evil\\" for New York! Even though the tone is more light-hearted than the first film (even with the one great scene with the Statue of Liberty smashing her torch into the huge mold of slime kicks butt), and we are missing the old Elmer Bernstein score (although Randy Eldman's music score was good), \\"Ghostbusters II\\" was and still is a good movie for all ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite must have if going to Poland","review":"I bought this for our daughter's trip to Poland through her University.

Many of the tracks have little 1/2 second pops of noise right at the beginning of the song. It sounds like there was some problem with the digital conversion. It's very noticeable with headphones. With \\"Up up and away\\", it sounds as if the very beginning of the song is sliced off. A couple tracks have very quick unnatural fades.I think junior engineer \\"Johnny Presto\\" was given the duties to hurry this project out. The overall audio quality is very degraded from the original vinyl release of \\"Greatest hits on earth\\". This is very noticeable with \\"One less bell to answer\\". The original recordings of this group are clean, clear and lusciously transparent. It's a shame this CD does not reflect that.

Incredibly talented all around... singers, writers, arrangers, everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vocals by a great group.","review":"Truly great sounds from an inspired group of vocalists--many 5th D fans assume the group was primarily Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr., but listen, if you will, to the Bacharach-flavored Jimmy Webb tunes \\"Orange Air\\" and \\"The Girls Song\\". The harmonies are phenomenal--Florence LaRue and Ron Townsend, I feel, have been two of the most underrated vocalists in the business. This collection also has two hard to find 5th D classics: the stellar \\"Light Sings\\" and the individual-but-collective Laura Nyro cut \\"Black Patch\\". PLUS, just when you thought you were overdosing on Marilyn McCoo's sultry operatic contra-soprano, the compilation highlights the amazing live version of the Adrissi Bros' \\"Never My Love\\" featuring MMc's true diva pipes. Simply awesome. The CD is well worth the price--I can't wait until they reissue \\"Portrait\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up, Up and Away","review":"Have always loved the Fifth Dimensions and on long car trips the sounds of old school fill the time.

OK, it is very strong and clear, it can sing very high and very low. But does that make a good voice, does that make expression? To me, Whitney's voice does not sound sensitive nor does it sound pleasant. To me, it's rather a voice with a huge lack of expressional character. It expresses nothing to me but a woman who wants to break all chords and alter the music business into an olympic competition for breaking chords. Also the Georgia Mass Choir is somewhat disappointing, I've heard some good RnB and Gospel but this album is one scream to me. There is no spiritual softness here rather an unbalanced attempt to pump religion into a commercial record. Religion as an individual process is not promoted in here. Also the non-gospel Whitney songs on this album are kinda weak and sound fairly hypocritical to me. If u want a good gospel album pick Mahalia Jackson."},{"rating":"2","title":"This justifies her gospel roots so very well!","review":"I loved this album! Whitney's mix of gospel and inspirational songs are fabulous here! I love her joyful Joy to The World and I go To the Rock. And Step By Step sounds very good here.

There are a few songs I don't recall from the movie, and the ones that she sang on the CD, were not as they were in the move. For example---Who would imagine a King---She sang this with the Childrens choir in the movie, and alone on the CD. She sang about three or four songs with the adult choir, and only heard them once on the CD and that was at the end. For a soundtrack, I would not recommend it.

I remember so fondly, listening to the album, Somewhere in my Lifetime years ago and thinking how powerful Ms. Hyman's voice sounded. Damn........."},{"rating":"2","title":"PH definitely has got true vocals","review":"A legend that could definitely outsing a few people, Phyllis Hyman had one of the prettiest voices I have ever heard. When I learned news of her passing, I was devastated. Everytime I hear one of her songs on the radio, I get goosebumps. She certainly had a beautiful voice, and not too many singers that are out right now give her the credit that she deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"I love Phyllis Hyman's sultry voice. It's a shame that she never received full recognition for her fantastic singing ability. We lost her to soon. I gave this CD 4 stars, not five because, unfortunatley, I got a CD that is damaged. Disc 1 skips at cuts 13 & 14. I purchased the CD for the song \\" Somewhere in My Lifetime.\\" Of course, this has nothing to do with the music, but I was rather bummed about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Let The Title Scare You","review":"Although I don't like the title, the music is worth listening to, I just skip the first song. Even though some parts are like Nitzer Ebb and White Zombie, Oomph! doesn't weigh to heavy on them and becomes a band with it's own style. So far I can't stop listening to this CD several times in a row when I feel like hearing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Go-To Traveling Field Guide","review":"I love these guide books.

A fair critique on the downside is that it may be a little over the top from a theological standpoint for some and there is redundancy in concept and some of the stories that are told. Overall a small price to pay for an enjoyable read that is a great companion to The Big Book and Twenty Four Hours a Day. The best critique on the upside is that this book can be enjoyed and something garnered regardless of your current place in life. You needn't be in AA or be a substance abuser to gain some real pearls from this beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funner to do than it looks","review":"I was disappointed when I received it, as I was hoping there would be useful information there about Texas, like the state bird, state flower, famous old-timers that made Texas history, etc.But it was a delightful puzzle to do.There are many different colors and shapes and patterns, which made it more challenging,especially if I didn't look at the box to see where the pieces went.It is BIG, I had to turn it sideways to fit on my table (see photo).It's a keeper, for several more builds."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Chandler Writes Like A Slumming Angel\\"","review":"I am a huge Chandler fan. I would have given this excellent collection of stories (and essay) 5 stars except for the atrocious number of typos! Totally ruins the flow of the story! I also wish that there was a linked table of contents."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHANDLER WARMS UP","review":"I have reviewed Raymond Chandler's seven Phillip Marlowe detective classics elsewhere in this space so there is no need to go into detail about his place in the detective genre pantheon. What is interesting in this series of short works is that Chandler is working out the 'formula' for what he expects out of his detectives. Those qualities get worked out in Marlowe and thus take their place as very good literary work indeed. Even here Chandler exhibits the sparse but functional dialogue that holds the Marlowe series together. If you have never read Chandler in novel or short story form here is your chance. There will be no place for Agatha Christie-type parlor detectives for you after that. For sure.If nothing else get this book for his essay that gives this work its title. This is his take at the time (early 1950's) on the genre's place in the literary pantheon. Now his long ago off-hand remarks are the wisdom of the academy. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short stories without Marlowe","review":"This book collects a few of Chandler's short stories together, along with the essay that gives the book its title. The essay reads well, and gives a simple, clear statement of what Chandler dislikes about the murder mystery genre. You can read the details for yourself, but I'll give you a clue: read Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple, then one of these stories. The differences fix the problems that Chandler saw in the genre as it existed before him.Although I like the Philip Marlowe novels, these are short stories (far less than novel length), they star different characters (none of whom are Marlowe), and generally seem weaker than Chandler's novels. They keep the same dark, gritty tone, but one or two overdo the 1940s slang to a nearly impenetrable level. They're all worth reading, though, especially \\"I'll Be Waiting.\\"//wiredweird"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, what a cheap piece of crap!","review":"The silver work was extremely crude. There were barbs of silver on the seams of the mold. The stone looked like a cheap marble my kid bought at the super market; to make it just a bit worse...the \\"marble\\" was literally hot glued in place with globs of glue at the points where it is cemented to the silver. I honestly have seen better jewelry in my daughters Barbie play set.

This is also a must-have album for 'N Sync fans. They are in this album as well. The real star of the soundtrack is Phil. He recorded the songs he wrote in five languages, and played drums on all the songs. This guy worked hard on this soundtrack. This is one of the best Disney soundtracks ever! Probably the best since The Lion King! Thank you, Phil. You certainly made me proud to listen to this great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tarzan Soundtrack","review":"This was a very good soundtrack. VERY good. It's not Phil Collins at his absolute best, but it's still pretty good. At least one reviewer before me has asked who the orchestra was. Sorry to disappoint you, but that's three synthesizers playing in unison. Mancina's score would have been better with a real orchestra. I take away 1 star from a 5 star CD for the score."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was and stills such a wonderfull production","review":"wonderfull and unforgetable soundtrack that every one should buy TARZAN SOUNDTRACK."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's upbeat and fun.","review":"This cd is so cool. Phil Colins is a great singer and so is 'N Sync so that makes it cool too. They have up beat songs and slow songs so it just a mixture of everything. I would buy it any day(if I had the money)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's got a lot of beat!","review":"Now, I'll admit, I'm not much of a Phil Collins fan, but the Tarzan soundtrack IS very good. I really hate Trashin' the Camp, though, and I think N' Sync was a waste of good talent for such a stupid song. I adore \\"You'll Be In My Heart\\", though, and also \\"Son of Man\\" and \\"Two Worlds\\". I really wish that they had more songs be that were sung by the characters, though. All in all, cool soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely tearjerking and awesome","review":"I love Phil Collins, and this just made me an even bigger fan. This movie is awesome, it made me cry because of the bond between the family! Everytime I hear most of the songs, I start remembering the movie and start crying! This is one of THE best soundtracks. I'll finish w/ one sentence: SEE THE MOVIE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW...So powerful! AMAZING! I LOVE IT!","review":"This is a great soundtrack! I love every song. The only problem being that it's too short. But the songs really give the listener the feeling of the movie, and they're so emotional and well written they should definately get some awards for this one. CONGRATS Phil Collins, its GREAT! I'm only 16 and you would think a young person like me couldn't appreciate an artist like Phil Collins, BUT I LOVE IT!!!! You'd think the only reason a person my age would listen is because of N'SYNC...not me. I'd rather hear Phil Collins! One of the BEST ever for Disney! GREAT JOB...and the movie's great too!!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome album for a spectacular movie","review":"I have been listening to this for almost a month and just last night saw the opening night showing of Tarzan in Hollywood....Ladies and Gentlemen..This is a great piece of art and entertainment. Phill Collins was a superb choice! As with most soundtraks, this one will deliver the pleasing mental pictures of this animated masterpiece. The \\"son of man \\" spot was so moving, as Tarzan transitions from boy to man, that our audience spontaneously cheered and applauded! All I can say is what a movie! and buy the soundtrack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great listen!","review":"This is a wonderful soundtrack! The opening theme/sounds are more reminiscent of \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" than a Disney flick, and the songs are excellent - great rhythm, drums, vocals, etc. (Instrumental music more like \\"Princess Bride\\" in sound.) Phil Collins is fantastic - I could listen to him croon forever. Like everyone else, I think it's way too short (hence 4 stars). But worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Soundtracks in the Music Industry!","review":"This soundtrack is incredible. Phil Collins is a terrific singer (one of my personal favorites, as a matter of fact), and whoever composed the instrumental music is a genius. There's not a single song on this entire CD that I do not like. The whole thing gives me chills nearly every time I listen to it, and that's a good thing. So if you haven't heard this soundtrack yet, then take my advice and listen to it. It really is awesome, and it is worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Soundtrack","review":"This is actually the second CD I've bought of this soundtrack. I rarely buy soundtracks, but loved all the songs on this one. So did my daughter, whose constant playing scratched the other one up so much, it was unplayable. It was worth buying a second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tarzan Soundtrack","review":"This soundtrack was a big hit with my 2 and 3 year olds. They both sing along and tap their feet to the music. This is also a very adult friendly Disney soundtrack as well! Well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music to my ears","review":"A wonderful collection of songs that people of any age can appriciate. I would recommend this CD even if you're not a fan of soundtracks. It a creative blend of sounds that are thouroghly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Congratulations Phil!","review":"Yep, as you all well know now, Phil won an Oscar for \\"You'll Be In My Heart\\". His first Academy Award. And frankly, it's about bloody time. :) He's worked his tail off for years, and now it's payed off. This CD, Tarzan, is definitely a CD for the whole family. Young & Old will enjoy it, even without seeing the movie. (I still haven't.) Enjoy it. :) I have, and will continue to.Once again, congratulations Phil. You deserved it, buddy. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is awesome!!!","review":"This is the best CD I own right now. Phil Collins does a marvelous job of writing and singing these songs. I just wish there were more spoilers in the songs. But there are enough if you think about it. I can't wait to see the movie, and these songs , the whole CD is truely inspiring! A must for all Disney fans, or aspiring teens, kids, and the whole family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PHIL YOU HAVE REALLY OUT DONE YOUR SELF THIS TIME","review":"This the most outstanding piece of music, of the century. I LOVE IT. I got this soundtrack for my birthday in Feb. 2000, and I hadn't even seen the movie yet. untill I listen to this cd. After that this is all i talked about. And now I own the movie, and as a matter of fact i'm wathing the movie as i write this. After my band director listened to it we now play all the songs as our feild show during the football season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney has done it again!","review":"I have had the soundrack the day it came out! in fact, I even preordered it. I think that Phil Colllins did an excellent job and I give him Kudos. When I saw the movie the music was even better. I especially like the drums. Tarzan was very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"In the tradition of Disney soundtracks this cd had a healthy dose of scores and great upbeat songs. The main track by Collins was well received in mainstream radio and still plays well.Overall I enjoyed it greatly and am glad it received good reviews. It complemented the movie very well indeed.What I got out of the soundtrack and the movie was a good dose of inspiration to making the most of one's fate; would be disappointed in Disney otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to sing along to!","review":"This soundtrack gets you in a great mood! Son of Man and Strangers Like Me are great songs to sing along to and Trashin' the Camp (with 'N Sync, all you teeny bopper fans out there) has got a great, jungle-like beat. I would definitely recommend buying it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing!","review":"This soundtrack is absolutely awsome! I bought it for my children, but I listen to it myself at work! It is beautiful and my kids just love it! The whole thing not just 1 or 2 songs. I have bought soundtracks for other movies, but this is by far the best. The drum beats are addictive and the lyrics are motivating. I can't stop when I hear this! Big cheers for this one! The second song is perfect for a bedtime lullaby to sing to your own children. The melodies are haunting and beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great CD","review":"I bought this primarily for my kids to listen to after they saw the Disney movie, but now I listen to it more than them. The five main songs are outstanding and really have an \\"up\\" feeling. At first, I didn't think I would like having a couple versions of the same songs on the CD (I thought they were just trying to fill space), but now I really enjoy hearing the different variations. The last few tracks are all instrumental and are a little slow compared to the beginning. Depending on my mood, I either listen or simply skip back to the beginning. It really is a great CD. Phil's voice and drums are fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The soundtrack even sounded fabulous at the drive in theater","review":"You know how bad drive in theater speakers usually sound. When I first saw this movie it was at the drive in, and I still thought the sound was great.We have heard alot out of Phil Colins over the years, this is an extraordinary soundtrack which stands out in my mind as one of his best acheivements.Great for kids and adults!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Never before having been a Phil Collins fan, I bought the album after hearing \\"You'll Be in My Heart\\" on the Disney Channel. Every Phil Collins song on this soundtrack is amazing, from Phil's duet with Glenn Close to the fun harmony with pop boy-band N*Sync. I absolutely love this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moves Like An Ape, Looks Like A Man, Sounds Like Another Hit For Walt Disney Pictures.","review":"The soundtrack to Walt Disney Pictures' final film of the era known as the Disney Renaissance is nothing short of tree-swinging, howling, good, old-fashioned family fun. My favourite tracks are: \\"Son Of Man,\\" \\"Strangers Like Me,\\" \\"Two Worlds,\\" and of course, the Academy Award winning song \\"You'll Be In My Heart.\\" If you loved the movie, you'll enjoy every second of this soundtrack. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH (Tarzan Yell)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not outstanding","review":"I would say this album contains songs in the typical Phil Collins style. All soft without any outstanding performance. Sorry, Disney, but this is not the way to go!!! What happened to those great soundtracks like 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' and 'The Lion King' (by the way, if you want a good soundtrack, get the Lion King II album. Tom Snow should write more for Disney!). Disney should start to concentrate on quality again, instead of having a popular, all-star cast !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big dissapointment","review":"This CD could have been so much more. There were excellent harmonics but Phil didn't pick them up and run away with 'em, but reverted back to ordinary melodies instead. This could have been a great CD but... I don't recommend it to anyone who's easily frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Soundtrack Hurts!","review":"except for 'Stranger's Like Me' this soundtrack sucks. None of the songs have any African rhythm or compositions to them, and Hans Zimmers sidekick- Mark Mancina's (Moll Flanders, Speed) score sounds like it belongs with 'Pacohantas' than 'Tarzan'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeesh","review":"While other artists like Brian May and Peter Gabriel have tackled serious and very good soundtracks (The Road Warrior, Passion) Phil Collins has turned out a silly and largly forgettable collaboration with Mark Marcina. Of cource its for a Disney film (an apparent indication of how low Phil can go)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Bites","review":"This is a horrible CD that I bought because II liked 'n sync until i found out I hated thei song and now I hate them 2! Even though the rating says 1 star I give it -9999999 stars. save your money. get a refund!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Ruined It Phil!","review":"As an avid Disney fan with a wide musical taste, I find it quite easy to appreciate the value of most music. However, the songs \\"you'll be in my heart\\" and \\"two worlds\\" not only make me want to retch, but also show no particular compositional talent whatsoever, opposed to some of Disney's past memorable songs where it is quite evident. I fail to see why Phil Collins won an Oscar for his work. The rest of the songwriting that year must have been absolutely dire, not that this wasn't. If I was allowed to give a no-star rating I would and I will be praying that Collins is banned from taking on any more projects with companies that I once had a lot of respect for."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll be in my heart is the greatest song in this CD...","review":"Phil Collins is amazing... if it wasnt for him, I wouldnt buy this CD...although the movie is very touching... anyway, if you are a Phil Collins's fan, buy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"marvelously sang and put together","review":"Phil Collins did an awesome job of puting this soundtrack together and so did Mark Mancinia. it is my favorite cd and i encourage, anybody who doesnt have it, to get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful soundtack!","review":"A well done soundtrack! The best since the 1994 smash hit, \\"The Lion King\\".

I've always been a big Phil Collins fan and he didn't dissapoint me. Being a percussionist I must say on that aspect it was wonderful as well.I think this is the best soundtrack they've come up with yet. I hope the movie's as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most memorable CD since the Lion King","review":"WOW! This is one of the best Disney soundtracks in a LONG time. It's easy to listen to, the drums are just awesome, and the songs are catchy. Ever since I got the CD the first day it came out, I've been listening to it nonstop! This CD makes up for all of Disney's recent flops (except Mulan...I loved that one). I think it was a wise choice for Disney to choose Phil Collins to do the music. He adds just the right touch to the songs to make them very memorable. Go out and buy this CD - it's really good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"BEAR RUN was thought provoking and moving. I really connected with many of the characters.

However, after a couple years of use, 2 of the 3 CDs got scratched so I reordered them from Amazon.However, the since the time I bought them, they have redone the cover design and it is evident also the quality of reproduction for the CD has been compromised. The new versions don't work properly in my dvd player. I even went out and bought a new dvd player after Amazon shipped me a second set of videos which didn't work. The problem didn't go away. Basically, they either don't read, or when they do read in the player, the menu doesn't work right or the video skipps.

The first disc is incredible. Not a bad song. Disc two is disappointing. There's way too much stuff from the 80s. This just isn't the band's strongest material.

With the expectations of removing thumb prints, dust, and run of the mill streaks from the equipment. Spaying a fine mist of the product on one device at a time. Then using the provided towel to remove it after a gentle brushing. Well, it did more harm than good by leaving a fine film all over the screens. I will never used it again have not purchased any screen cleaners in fear of more of the same.After several months i was window cleaning using a squeegee. Well i tried it on the old Samsung TV after cleaning the squeegee and using a little Culligan water since it's filtered. It worked. It took a few times and it was not perfect but it was much improved. So i then tried it on the Apple Thunderbolts. Those turned out looking like new. The water just falls to the counter.

My issue was the damn thing broke in a month. It would only focus from 10ft to infinity, and then it wouldn't autofocus AT ALL and the manual focus ring remained locked between 10ft and infinity. I called Sigma and they said it would be 2-4 weeks before they could repair it! Even though it was still under warranty and I bought it less than a month ago! They said it was simply \\"policy\\" and there's nothing they could do for me.

It's solid, reliable, good resolution, constant 2.8 minimum aperture, comes with its own bag. However there are a few things I don't like: it's quite heavy, 24mm with DSLR is not wide enough for many landscape situations, there is a shadow when using the D50 built in flash, noisy with autofocus (but very smooth with manual focus), D50 AF light is partially hidden by the lens hood. Anyway a very good lens for this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst focusing I've seen","review":"I did only about 30 test shots with this before deciding to return it. Not one picture was in focus. I do know enough about depth-of-field to rule that out as the problem. Even at f/2.8, there should be some sharp feature somewhere within the focus rectangle in the viewfinder. There wasn't. Not even once. I've never had this problem with any other lens, ranging from expensive Nikkor primes and zooms to inexpensive Tamron ultrazooms. Lenses have to work, straight out of the box.

For one, you must read the graphic novels or manga before even watching the first movie. The manga provides a deeper plot and background story to ALL the characters, not just Noriko and Shuya. It also provides a more intense understanding to what's mentally happening to the kids, kind of like what they did in the second movie. The first movie, only provided the idea of what a Battle Royale is, but the second movie tells you what it's doing to the kids and the consequences.

This is the third C & T book that I've bought that has not been edited. I won't be buying any more.

The question is -- how often is 50 going to rap like he can, instead of putting out lazy, poppy singles? Unfortunately, Just a Lil Bit is every reason to hate 50 Cent rolled up into one disastrous track. The beat is produced by the normally-O.K. producer Scott Storch, but Storch cooked up a real clunker of a beat here. And it doesn't help that 50's lyrics are so elementary, and the hook is so god-awful that it actually hurts my brain to listen to this track."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is only just a Lil Bit","review":"50 Cent needs to decide if he wants to be tough or wants to be elementry. This song is very juvinille and 50 Cent needs to figure out some better rhymes. His full CD's are catchy, but he uses the same ryhmes over again. For example he has rhymed \\"good\\" with \\"hood\\" way to many times. This single is OK for the beat, but 50 Cent needs to decide to be real orgianal gangster rap or poppy. The rhymes aren't very good in this Single.I wouldn't bother buying this unless you are a big fan of pop music and 50 Cent.I hope this helpedCheers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a better Product Description","review":"I bought these gloves for my job seeing that they are for Fire and rescue, well These gloves are not NFPA appoved, not BBP resistant, and are not for fire fighting.

If there were any doubts about this woman's ability to carry a movie on her shoulder's, Legally Blonde blows those doubts out of the water.While certainly not shakespeare, the film wisely doesn't take itself too seriously.

I first saw it like 2 months ago when I said oh look Legally Blonde is on my mom was like oh cool lets watch Im just like I don't know it looks stupid and boring but 5 minutes into the movie I was laughing so hard that I found little tears coming down my eyes. It was wicked hilarious. Especially when Elle Woods(Reese Witherspoon)showed up with a costume at a party and nobody else was wearing one. There is totally funny refrences to stuff in this hilarious movie not only is it funny but it makes you feel good about yourself. This is the funny movie I have been looking for it is definetley not like some stupid movies that are supposed to be funny but not funny one little tiny bit. For example Caddyshack 2 and Legally Blonde 2 Red White&Blonde this movie rocks law school.

Reese Witherspoon had fantastic charisma and carried the picture. When I saw that MGM Studios had released a Special Edition on DVD, I found I just couldn't resist it... I went out and purchased a copy. I must say, I cannot regret that decision. Despite the fact I paid a bit more than I would have liked, I found that I was compensated for it, by the seemingly endless array of special features that I had the pleasure to discover. Not to mention I also found a coupon for two dollars and fifty cents off a bottle of Nicole nail polish enclosed. So, all in all \\"Legally Blonde\\" has a quality about it that makes it worth a look. And although some scenes may be questionable for children, it is generally a feel-good film that can be enjoyed by the entire family."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiration for my blond granddaughter!","review":"I loved this movie! It has the original appearance of being another teenie bopper \\"fluff\\" movie but ends up showing that petite, blond females have a brain and talent to become more than an ornament on some male chauvinist's arm! It also illustrates the cultural difference between the \\"stuffy\\" east coast and the \\"open-mindedness\\" of the west coast. After raising a petite, blond daughter I know that dynamite does come in small (and blond!) packages! Good job, Reese!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the time!","review":"This movie was a pleasant surprise - I was not expecting a whole lot, however the charm of Reese and the plot had me interested the whole way... Despite the initial 'I am going to hate this thing about some sorority queen' feeling, the movie progresses into something just simply great fun to watch. I found myself cheering our 'dumb blonde' right up till the end once she starts to take the law school thing seriously. A lot of cute twists and gotchas that far outweigh other movies in this category!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Legally Blonde","review":"Legally Blonde succeeds because of the entertaining Reese Witherspoon. Convincing as the ditzy blonde who proves to her snob boyfriend that she is just as smart as him (if not smarter). There are plenty of hilarious scenes in this film providing a rewatch factor. It's one of those films that is fun to watch if you have friends round.DVD SUMMARY: Visually, almost reference quality and in 2:35 widescreen. Plenty of special features including about 8 deleted scenes. Overall, worth buying.Note: I have avoided the sequel, however, based on the constant bad reviews. SOmetimes directors should quit while they are ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legally Dumb!","review":"Beautiful Reese Witherspoon is the silly but highly-motivated title character in this by-the-numbers comedy. Witherspoon's star potentiol carries this stinker of a film pretty far. The female audience will surely get a kick out of this one. Reese gets to show that despite the fact that she is dismissed as an \\"annoying bimbo with big breasts\\" that she is actually a \\"very smart annoying bimbo with big breasts\\". This movie is far too cute and fluffy for my taste but if you're in to that type of stuff, knock yourself out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fluffy","review":"I enjoy a great fluff movie as much as the next person, but this was just too over the top. This movie was just too cliche, had too many product placements (hello, Clinique) and was just full of too many holes. I know movies are full of holes, but these were just too big for me to overlook.One of the holes I had the biggest problem with was that she took the LSATs at the last minute and breezed through it, and then turned around and applied to law school. This all seemed to happen within a few weeks, and this is actually something that takes over six months to do. Since this was actually vital to the plot, I just had a hard time looking past it.If you want to see a good Reese Witherspoon movie, check out Election."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Some thought this movie is just about some little DUMB BLONDE!

I just watched this film to see the big praise for it, assuming it might be funny. I found myself hating it more than anything. Reese acts like such a ditz in this film that at times it really annoyed me and the storyline itself was silly with only a few okay parts that could in no way save this film. And I heard there is a sequel to this film? Oh no.I know this is supposed to be a feel good movie but come on everyone has to admit it is more stupid than anything. And I can't believe Reese wants to be remembered like that. Thankfully she has done other movie roles that are much better.Anyway, for people who have not seen it, don't expect much intellectual stimulation. It's pretty simple and foolish and Reese acts like the stereotypical blonde in the beginning who becomes smart in the end- case closed basically."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves this movie!","review":"Glad I was able to find this movie on Amazon.

This LA babe would do anything to get her man back, even that means she needs to get into Harvard .Although the story is fictional, but I find it very inspiring. Elle Woods comes to Harvard Law School for the wrong reasons, however she discovered what her heart truely desires through hard work, trust and supports from other good-hearted people. It is a beautiful and funny tale of courage, confidence and miracle. I believe that Legally Blonde is one of the best in its genre, entertaining yet philosophical.Warning: the sequel is quite unsuccessful in comparison to this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legally Insane","review":"This is a very funny movie. The first time my wife and I watched it we loved it. I recently bought the special edition for a great price. It has great replayability. The storyline is great and the music is fresh and upbeat. About time blondes got to chalk one up for all the dumb blonde jokes. Fans of movies like \\"Shallow Hal\\", \\"Deuce Bigalow\\", and \\"Shrek\\" will probably enjoy it. I highly recommend it if you need some comedy and empowerment when you are having a bad day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Witty!","review":"Witty and smart is how I'd describe this movie.

Definitely a movie to see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent light entertainment","review":"So much is great about this film. Ok, it's not flawless - there are a couple of really silly bits - like the courtroom scene with the pool cleaner's guilty admission and his boyfriend's response. But it's great, feel-good fun. Very well directed, tight script for the most-part and the performances are all great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearably bad.","review":"Not to mention brazenly manipulative. Reese Witherspoon is game, and there are several other fine actors that do their best, but the movie manages to be profoundly unfunny, manipulative, and two-faced about its message (the rather trite self-empowerment theme being ultimately at the service of pushing the great goal of traditional marriage-the movie couldn't end without it). An utterly catastrophic attempt to capture the charm and intelligence of Clueless."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all been done before!","review":"I guess when \\"Clueless\\" and \\"American Pie\\" became hits the teen movie industry went over-board. It's always the same story line and the same basic plot. You don't need a high IQ to watch this movie. How many times can film producers use the same basic plot line again and again!I found the movie boring, dull and to be quite frank would much rather go swimming with \\"Jaws\\" than watch that again!If you don't buy this movie, it will be one of the best decisions you could make!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $7","review":"'Legally Blonde' has its funny moments - moments where you burst out laughing at how incredibly stupid the situation is, which I guess is the point of the movie. It's fine if a movie wants to be over the top, but 'Legally Blonde' isn't over the top enough to be funny. Sometimes it takes itself seriously and other times you're supposed to laugh at the characters. The plot, of course, is entirely predictable and formulaic, and Luke Wilson's character is just boring.That's not to say you won't like the movie - the girls I went with liked it. Just be ready to suspend any sort of critical disbelief if you want to laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOOKS ARE DECEIVING!!!!","review":"I LIKE THIS MOVIE.

It has great acting and a very original plot. Reese Witherspoon does the best job as Elle Woods! I love this movie so much because it's about a dumb,blonde go-girl who tries to make it at one of the hardest,smartest schools that there is. How she tries to handle being \\"smart\\" is what makes this story so hilarious! Everybody out there,this a definitely must-see movie! The DVD version also contains some great special features,including the cool music video \\"Perfect Day\\" by Hoku."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEGALLY CONNED","review":"Seemes an utter waste of talent. Reese Witherspoon and Selma Blair were the best part of the highly uneven CRUEL INTENTIONS. Seeing them back together should have been a delight. But in this movie the first plays just plain stupid and the second a jealous, not too likeable character portrayed too positively. But the main reason I felt legally conned by this is how it sells itself as light comedy. That lured me in for an easygoing two hours of movie, but that ain't what I got. I wasn't in the mood for heavy-handed delvings into cutthroat competition and sexual harrassment. And Blair's character was away too insensitive with the title character's plight with both to be the sort-of heroic character she's ultimate portrayed as. There's at least one character in the movie considerably less unlikeable than Blair's but mercilessly trashed in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical!","review":"Legally Blonde is one of the craziest movies I've ever seen. Reese Witherspoon shows that she truly has a knack for crazy blonde-moment comedies.The movie centers around Elle Woods and her relentless pursuit of the man of her dreams, whom she had been dating until he told her (on the night she thought he would propose) that she didn't fit properly into his family's ideals for a suitable future spouse for him. This is when she did what every rational woman would do...Apply for admission to Harvard Law School--where her ex was supposed to attend. She studied her butt off and finally got in. Then, she realised that this wasn't going to be as easy as she had hoped.Eventually, everything goes the right way for her, which wasn't exactly the way she originally planned...and everyone (well, almost) gets not just what they want, but what they need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie's Great, Amazon instant video's not.","review":"I tried to purchase this to comply with my Amazon Instant Video app, but the movie refused to download for my daughter and Amazon charged me for it.

I then bought the second movie, which downloaded, and showed up in my app. I attempted to watch it, and the app crashed every two minutes during the movie. The downloading problem might have been unique to me, but the fact that I got charged for it was not pleasing.

Reese Witherspoon is so endearing in this movie as the brilliant, but clueless Elle Woods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Thumbs Way Up!","review":"Reese Witherspoon gives a great performance as Elle Woods, a popular and pretty sorority girl, who can be slightly ditzy at times. She's certain Warner, her boyfriend, is going to propose to her, but, instead, he dumps Elle because he thinks she's too immature and dumb.Determined to get Warner back, Elle decides she wants to join Harvard law school, where he's studying, hoping that he'll realize she is smart enough to be his wife. Shockingly, Elle gets accepted into Harvard and moves in to one of the dorms on campus (along with her adorable, pink-clad Chihuahua, Bruiser), but there's a problem. Warner already has another girlfriend.I was really surprised at how entertaining and amusing this movie was! I figured it was going to be another stupid, boring teen movie, but it surpassed my expectations. An added bonus on the DVD is the deleted scenes (nearly ten). I highly recommend Legally Blonde to people of all ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quircky film with a mix of fun while light on intelligence.","review":"Where do I start? The film starts off when Elle Woods, played by Reese Witherspoon, prepares for her date with the love of her life, Warner, believing that it will finally be the night he pops the big question. When he unexpectedly decides to break up, simply because he's going to Harvard, and he doesn't think Elle is very smart, Elle decides to go to law school too to win Warner back. But the tables turn when Elle finds out he already has a fiancee.Shortly: This film begins with a clueless type attitude and doesn't totally meet the hype the film has, but the humor eventually grows to be hilarious, and Reese Witherspoon turns out to be a total delight. While the film has a \\"goofy\\" everyday teen plot, this film is possibly one of the most charming comedies around. This film is definetely worth a gander."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reese rules. *sigh* Do I sound to teen-ish? =0)","review":"Believe you me, this is not just another teen movie.

It's a waste of money and a big fake.On the upside, though, \\"Legally Blonde\\" is 'a feel-good girl-power [movie]'. It's one of my favorites and it should be your's too!

Within 10 minutes, I was bored out of my mind and ready to sneak into another movie. But, I stuck it out. It was BOUND to get better right??? WRONG! The plot was completly predictable and unfunny. A blonde girl gets dump by boy. Goes after boy. Finds out boy isn't worth it. Finds a better boy and gains self-confidence. Blah, blah, blah. Throughout the whole movie, I didn't \\"laugh-out-loud\\" for one moment. There wasn't even a chuckle. Maybe at the Nail (or hair) salon, but it was a FORCED chuckle. I can never understand what all the hype was about. Just because Reese is adorable doesn't mean the movie is.P.S.

Plot points in the other reviews aside, what you get is a fun plot, a great sendup (and portrait) of sororities, law school, and trials, and no scenes that you would be nervous about having in a date movie. You won't regret this one. My wife pointed out that she has a different dress in every scene -- I suppose you could have fun figuring out what goes where on the second time through. It's worth seeing twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Fiction - A blonde in Harvard Law ...","review":"Just Kidding! But that is the whole premise of the film, right? And yet it isn't offensive and it has a cute moral message of becoming the best that we can be. Reese Witherspoon does a great job as a beautiful blonde who has never been expected to do anything more with her life than look beautiful, who then surprises everyone around her (including herself) by going to law school and suceeding. Even though she goes to law school solely to get back her dumb social climbing boyfriend, in the end she recognizes her own worth and not only betters herself but also manages to nab a great new boyfriend (played by the ever adorable Luke Wilson). So it is truly fiction -- pure entertainment that can only be enjoyed when you completely suspend reality. But isn't that what we go to the movies for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Legally Blonde\\" RULES!","review":"\\"Legally Blonde\\" is one of the funniest movies in the world.

That it had no point, it was a waist of your time, and just killed good brain cells? That was my opinion of this \\"comedy\\". I didn't even crack a smile once. This was a \\"comedy\\" correct? It wasn't a comedy. A comedy makes you smile,laugh, feel merry. Personally, I did not get any of those feelings from the movie. If you like slapdash comedies that should have went straight to video, then this is for you. However, if you want something with a little more depth... Try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastless, unfunny concoction.","review":"From the flip title which should offend people with or without visual impairment, to the interminable male-bashing, to the gratuitous overuse of four-letter words, this \\"dumb blonde who's really smart\\" mess of a movie stands out as one of the poorest big-name efforts in years. Even in the most surreal, over-the-top comedies there has to some grounding in reality and some cohesiveness in storytelling and character development.This picture needs to be re-edited so as to make it a satire of the kind of militant feminism which seeks to emasculate men and glorify women way beyond necessity. Reese Witherspoon's performance provides enough nuance for such a reworking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a plain good movie","review":"Yes even with all the stereotypes about blondes and their love of fashion the movie moves at a good pace and has a great story line.

Just an all around good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious comedy!","review":"This movie is one of my favorites. It's a fish-out-of-water comedy about a feminine, ditzy (but actually quite smart) sorority girl, Elle Woods (Witherspoon), who goes to Harvard Law School to get her boyfriend back. She ends up realizing that she's a lot smarter than people give her credit for, and succeeding beyond everyone's expectations including her own. The movie is hilarious the whole way through, and Witherspoon plays her part just perfectly. This is also one of those movies, at least for me, that you can watch over and over again and not get tired of it. I recommend everyone who enjoys comedy to watch this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I had expected!","review":"When I heard of this movie, I automatically thought of a stereotypical chick flick. I was right about the chick flick part, but I really enjoyed this movie. I found it hilarious in some parts with a somewhat believable storyline to it. This is a very entertaining movie with plenty of laughs. (Now I can't wait until I see the sequel...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"very entertaining","review":"A very smart young woman from California decides at the last minute she wants to go to Harvard Law School to get her very shallow man back. In the end she gets serious and proves to herself that she is too good for him anyway. It's a good story made great by all the humor along the way. I really loved her Harvard admissions video, the little dog bruiser, and maybe best of all was the loud wimpering scene in the restaurant. I've watched the movie several times, and still find myself laughing my way through it. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legally Blonde - awesome!","review":"Enjoyed this \\"cutesy\\" demonstration of power of determination to accomplish a goal. Always wanted to go to law school - simplified but entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best comedies of 2001","review":"This has got to be one of the best comedies I have seen this year.It was too perfect.Reese Witherspoone was perfect in this movie.The cast all did a perfect job in this movie.The movie was not only very funny,but it had a bit of a moral to it.The moral is to believe in yourself and thats a very good moral.If you saw Clueless and loved it,then you'll definatly love Legally Blonde"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as funny as I thought it would be,but still OK","review":"This movie was OK..it wasn't as funny as I thought it would be,though.i wouldn't bother to buy this movie-just rent it if you're curious.it's just about this bimbo girl who goes to law school to get her boy-friend back.it was kind of stupid.there were only a few funny parts(during the murder trial).Don't waste your money buying this-buy Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter or something!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blonde ambition","review":"This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time! Every clever writing in the screenplay isn't displayed very often in other movies. The producers hired a brilliant hairstylist and costume designer. The character's appearances match perfectly with all other aspects of \\"Legally Blonde\\". Reese Witherspoon is a terrific actress, especially here. If you're looking for a great and unique comedy, \\"Legally Blonde\\" is perfect. Even the men will enjoy this. By the way, I wonder if the \\"bend and snap\\" really works."},{"rating":"2","title":"I should cover my face......","review":"...to admitting I like this film. First time I heard about it I brushed it off, a chick flick of sorts, I had no interest in it. But as I started getting to know more about Reese Witherspoon I had to watch this as it seems to be one of her best films. With her innocent look and acting I cant help but like the film. I know its eird to have a guy admit to liking this film...but Im very open minded ha Not a bad film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Malibu Barbie Lawyer","review":"I graduated from law school recently, so seeing the Hollywood version of law school inLegally Blondedid make me gag. Law school isn't fun (neither is law practice). Despite that, I was able to laugh throughout this movie at the originality of the humor and sheer inanity of the plot twists. The fates collide to make Elle's first year at law school revolve around fashion knowledge more than habeas corpus. Reese Witherspoon holds the plot together - she's able to portray a blonde bimbo at one point, while also conveying a sense of confidence and articulateness. Her acting makes the movie believable and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surprisingly Funny and Witty Movie","review":"When my wife forced me to watch this movie, I originally thought that this was going to be a \\"chick flick\\" that I would have to sit through. I was sure that it was going to be a one-joke movie. I was pleasantly surprised.This movie was smart in delivery. There is no doubt that Reese Witherspoon carried this movie, and I doubt that anyone else could have. She was able to portray her \\"ditzy blonde\\" character as someone with true intelligence and confidence.While the very ending is a little lame, the entire movie is enjoyable and well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"Love this movie I so think Reese was right for the part. It was just a movie that all of us need something new to the movies these days. Ryan should be very proud. This is a movie for the whole family to see. The movie I saw her in before this was Cruel Intention which was a great movie and I do think you need both of them in your movie collection. It such a chick flick but who cares it's a great movie and a great performance by Ms. Witherspoon. She got by vote if she ever ran for president."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozer","review":"Hoping to find some new material in this movie, I was greatly disappointed. This is a retread of old ideas, about becoming, about dumb blonde jokes, about spoiled rich kid jokes, about nothing we haven't seen already a dozen times already. There were only two genuinely funny moments, other than that, it was time I'll never get back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legally Blonde","review":"I have always enjoyed Reese Witherspoon, I think she is a very talented, smart, funny, and beautiful actress. I hope that people really notice her talent in this role. Reese Witherspoon is hilarious as Elle, a steriotypical blonde, California girl. Elle really shows everyone, especially her boyfriend Warner that thinks she isn't smart enough. I never laugh out loud in movies, and this movie had me laughing the whole time, Jennifer Coolige is also very funny as the woman from the salon! ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Legally Blonde","review":"This movie is the funniest, most awesome movie I have seen in a really long time. Reese Witherspoon shows that if you are blonde you have all the fun and brains no matter what people say.Sure, the part wheen she takes over a case is a little unrealistic but this is Reese Witherspoon we're talking about and she can do anything!One of my favorite parts of the movie is when Reese is buying a dress and a saleslady tries to rip her off but because Reese majored in fashion merchandising she gives the lady a really funny tounge-lashing. This is the best movie that has come out in summer 2001!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Teen's Legally Blonde Review","review":"I thought Legally Blonde was a hilarious movie about a blonde going to Harvard. Just that concept makes me know the movie is a comedy. I went to see this movie with my boyfriend, and even he thought it was funny. I really liked this movie because Reese and all the other actors are great, the theme is great, and it's just a fun, kickback movie for teens to go see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"Reese Witherspoon is hilarious and perfect in her role as a stylish, sorority girl dumb blonde who makes it into Harvard Law school in an attempt to win her boyfriend back. I love the premise of the movie, and there are laughs the whole way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is great!","review":"Aside from side-splitting laughter and a witty plot, Reese did an awesome job playing Elle! Elle's spunk and charm was totally captured by Reese. Plus, this movie is very well written. I think it's my 2nd fave movie (\\"A Walk to Remember\\" being my 1st!) I really don't understand how some people don't like this movie. That's just plain weird."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good for its genre","review":"For a movie completely aware that its artistic vision is humbly limited to the protagonist's choice of matching shades of loud pink, should critics punish it for setting its goal too low, or credit it accordingly for actually reaching that goal? This dilemma easily resolves in favor of the latter alternative, much in part because a movie this saccharine is a bit harder for the bitter cynic to bite.A capsule synopsis might be all that is necessary: a fish-out-of-water comedy in the \\"girl-power\\" genre, with some romance thrown in for good measure.Always warm from beginning to end, the movie does occasionally fall flat in some of its attempts at humor, not bad for a comedy in which almost every situation precipitates laughter from the audience--after lowering the standard for wit and intelligence, of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent movie","review":"I always watch this movie when it comes on tv, but I wanted my own copy and I love having it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound is really bad","review":"The shipping and handling time was reasonable. The price was not bad to be a \\"brand new\\" movie, however, the audio is very poor. I had to turn my tv's volume up really high and still the audio wasn't good. Also, throughout the whole movie, the audio randomly goes on and off completely, this happens constantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and very original!!! Resse Witherspoon shines!!!","review":"I really enjoyed this movie! I thought it was really hilarious and Resse Witherspoon played a great part in this movie. Nobody could have done it better than her! It definitely has you laughing from beginning to end and rooting for Elle every step of the way. It is definitely a movie I can watch over and over again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware: This Is NOT The Original SE Release","review":"FYI: Anyone purchasing this thinking their getting the SE version think again. With the lower price MGM stripped the flip side of this disc that contained the special features (ie, deleted scenes, featurettes, Hoku's \\"Perfect Day\\" video, etc...). All features except commentaries are gone.What bums me out is that MGM didn't even change the UPC code on the DVD from the original version. Personally, I think this is a shoddy business practice. You won't know what you're getting until it arrives at your door.The movie itself is great fun. I'd give it 4 stars. But skip this version unless you have it in your hands and it states on the box it's the special edition (there are still some floating around)."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just another pretty face","review":"Dumped by the man that she loves, Elle decides to overrule the statement he's made about her not being serious enough, and make a motion of her own by getting into Harvard and attending law school. It's entertaining and satisfying to see how Elle retains her unique flair for life but finds herself motivated to be more than just another pretty face. In the midst of almost everyone telling her she's not smart enough, not serious enough, not tough enough, Elle determines to prove (almost) all of them wrong. The one who believes in Elle from the first time he meets her is a surprise - you have to watch to find out who he is! The neat thing about this movie is, many of the people who judge Elle to be a certain way in the beginning, the ones Elle finds herself up against - classmates, professors - end up rooting for her in the end... and Elle is the kind of person who, by not holding a grudge, wins in more ways than one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie!","review":"Reese Witherspoon who plays Elle Woods in this movie plays a very good part! I think Reese is very nice!!! I like her outfits alot, they are really cool!!!!!! I think Warner is messed up alot , he needs to get fixed!!!!!!!!!!! I like Emmet, he is real nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the year's best comedies","review":"This was a great movie-- funny, smart, heartwarming and inspiring-- in spite of stupid trailers and bad reviews. I usually avoid the average teenage fare of dumb slapstick stupid guy humor like the plague. But this movie develops a great story and characters with character, even the villains who you love to hate. Watch it and laugh, let your heart glow and your eyes fill. It's one of my favorite movies of the summer of 2001."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbie wannabe","review":"Elle makes an impact when she wants to go to law school. She makes a big spectacle of herself. After losing her boyfriend, she decides to enroll in Harvard to try to win him back. Are we supposed to take her immature perspective and gawdy fashion sense as the gospel truth? Not very appealing. The film takes the airhead too seriously. Will the ditzy teen comedies never end? It is the worst teen movie I've ever seen. In fact, it's the worst movie I've seen in recent years. If a person skips out on Legally Blond, they won't be missing anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The DVD only played thru first 5 minutes of the movie.

Don't listen to what the critics say about this movie. So the movie has a \\"surprisingly well developed plot\\" huh? Yeah it does, but the plot is is simply one big dumb blonde joke that some idiot decided to make into a movie. Just goes to show the slipping mantality of the American culture.

The double-sided DVD contains much more commentary and information than any normal human could stand to absorb, but if I were a student looking to learn about the movie industry this would be a good place to start.For some reason, either the transfer to disc or the original print has strangely saturated colors that had me scrambling to adjust the color, tint, brightness and contrast on my television until I gave up and decided the effect, which I didn't like at all, may have been intentional, although the cinematographer's audio commentary didn't mention it.People who live in Massachusetts may find the cheesy attempts to use locations in Pasadena to pass for Cambridge to be the most entertaining aspect of this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Good Movie!","review":"Legally Blonde is a great movie with lots of laughs and a bit of mystery. Lawyers will probably like it. It stars Reeese Witherspoon as a popular, pretty blonde named Elle who wants to become Mrs. Warner Huntington III, but when the cool and rich Warner (Matthew Davis) dumps her to go to Harvard Law, Elle decides to go too and becomes one heck of a lawyer helping out her hairdresser friend (Jennifer Coolidge), solving a mystery that involves an old friend of her's (Ali Larter) and finding the man she really loves (Luke Wilson). But will Elle find out why her professor (Victor Garber) acts nice to her, or that Warner has another girlfriend (Selma Blair)? Watch this awesome movie to find out if Elle graduates from Harvard Law."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly entertaining and hilarious","review":"Reese Witherspoon shines in this flick about a silly blonde going to Harvard Law School. I really enjoyed the characters, plot, soundtrack and background shots.

All the jerks get dumped, and all the nice, good people end up happy! The insults and comebacks are top-of-the-line, and everyone has a good time.Legally Blonde is about a blonde, Elle Woods, who is very intelligent and just applies her intelligence to cosmetics, clothes, and fashion.

The best song on this baby is Yesterdays Gone with one mean riff that runs continually throughout the whole song, pushing it along. This is one that should go on any best of complimation albums. All this talk about Def Leppard and Iron Maiden ticks me off, neither one can stand up to Saxon's long standing metal attack. Thanks Saxon for all the great metal youve given us.

In my opinion Stephen Lang uniquely helped bring these gangs together as one collective group of young teenagers. He taught them survival through circumstances that proved a gem. Although Stephen Lang had demonstrated a certain harsh reality it was without a doubt filled with a warm compassion blended with truth which helped create a newfound group of kids at the end of the day. No longer were they against one another but as one, a team of kids that came to discover something profound about not only themselves. Survival, whether he or she was black, brown or white.

Early \\"industrial\\" experiments that influenced many bands that followed, including Jane's Addiction.

I will be ordering another one from the same place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Happy!!","review":"First time purchasing a live plant through the mail. I was really surprised at how well the Bonsai tree was packed. You would never have realized that the plant was mailed. It was in pristine condition. The plant arrived earlier than I anticipated, which was great. The soil was still moist. It was a nice specimen, had a very nice shape and was as tall if not a litter taller that what was specified. This was a great purchase, which also included super saver shipping. Extremely Happy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonsai tree","review":"I purchased this over a year ago and it is still doing well! Bonsai trees can be fragile and very tempermental if it is not a good species. I remember receiving it very quickly and it came with some nice directions on how to care for it.

Off I go to buy three new gifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Out","review":"While I am not an expert in Bonsai, it appears that neither was the person who was growing this tree. The tree that I received had very little if any resemblance with the tree that is shown in the photo. I would be careful before buying bonsai tree's online unless you are seeing the actual tree that you are going to get. This tree was just a chop job of trimming and there were a few scars on the trunk where wire had been left on too long and too tightly during the training process. I would invite others to think twice before buying this tree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent flashlight/well engineered","review":"This is a well built flashlight, I already own 3 of them! A fourth (the three head model) is coming soon. It's strongest point is the fact that you can stand it on its own; perfect for roadside work, even under the hood, hands free. It has gotten wet (rain) and it goes on with no problems or flickering. I Have had mine for a year now and have not replaced the batteries in any of them---the light is whiter than normal incadescent bulbs or even krypton. As for the looks, well it is an illumination device--it is not meant to be fashionable! (that is probably why the bigger models are either black, titanium colored or camouflage. Also for the prior comment saying it is NOT titanium--well the flashlight would probably cost over $500 if it were really made of real titanium!

A clever homage to exploitation movies of old, dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century, it always remembers to be a sexy, funny and crazy ride. And they really do deliver the \\"greatest chick fight in cinema history.\\" And the greatest wet t-shirt gratuitous-fest. And dialogue so over the top, your lips are numb.

This is, without a doubt, the BEST EXPLOITATION FLICK EVER MADE !!!! Great looking babes camera-shot the way we hounds always wished they were, in sexy outfits we voyeurs relish more than oxygen, incredible action and catfights unparalleled anywhere, fast-dialogue that requires several screenings or a rewind to get, and no, I\`m not on the film\`s payroll. To make matters more obtuse, there isn\`t even an exposed pair of breasts or an bare ass in the entire movie!! (Which some men won\`t be pleased about, but screw \`em). AND the 3 female leads are lesbians, or so it would seem, another first for a film of its kind. This one makes most Tarantino films look like 'Shrek' sequels. ALL straight men with working \`nads are required to see/own this flick, multiple times, and most gay women probably have it already... allah be praised !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick ass!","review":"It's got hot chicks with killer bodies, cleavages in low-cut dresses out the wazoo, and crazy, chick-fighting goodness. What more could you ask for from your B-exploitation flick? How about some hot lesbian sex between said hot chicks and gratuitous, impromptu wet T-shirt fights involving previously mentioned hot chicks thrown in for good measure? Got your attention now, huh? \\"Bitch Slap\\" is that movie. You can call it \\"Grind House\\" minus the stripper with one leg and zombie flesh-eating nonsense.It's got enough action and shootouts for two movies, and has some great stunts as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"But 5 Stars for Crap!","review":"Lesbian movie? Yes, if you're a straight male. Think over-the-top explosions and physical violence, and double that. Oh, and I meant mindless, meaningless violence. Stupid attempt to portray the 3 girls as lesbians but is as believable as everything else in this movie. Lucy Lawless is advertised but actually has a 5-minute throw-away role as a nun covered in traditional long habit, disappointing.

The best art in this film is on the box cover. Definitely don't judge a movie by its cover. I almost turned it off, but I gave it a chance. I was a fool. It progressively worsened until the credits started to roll. Others may enjoy this for low-budget effects and acting. I feel foolish buying this for $3.00 (used). It has joined my coffee grounds at its new resting place in my trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm... what was that supposed to be?","review":"I knew it was gonna be bad when I ordered it, I was looking for something stupid to watch, something B movie-ish. I was a bit confused who the targeted audience was: lesbian octagon fighters, horny teenage boys, James Bond novel readers, etc.I don't know, maybe that was the point. It was making fun of all of those things, but it was not so good. Cheesy, but not good cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"109 minutes lost!","review":"First let me say that I love off-the-wall movies. Asian cinema has some of the best. This is not in that category. This movie was a waste of my time. While Zoe Bell's stunt work was cool the rest of the movie sucked out loud for me. Rent it, you might find it to your taste. Don't buy it and waste your money as well as 109 minutes of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth watching.","review":"This movie had better bits on a famous web sight. All of the action scenes were pretty pathetic and the worst part is they even say this is a better than average B movie. Stick with real low budget B movies and don't even wast more than $1000 US dollars if you want to make a real B movie. I will stick to older crappier movies that used to be shown at 3 AM twenty years ago for my entertainment. The women on this movie are great eye candy, but even that gets old quick since they don't show too much anyway. Not recommended unless you just have to collect movies like this. I thought with the way society has gone the last decade or so this might actually be a good movie, it isn't. Marina on her Hot for Words sight can keep having her guest on though. I am just not going to waste my time on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three hot chicks does not add up to a good movie.","review":"Wow this is bad and I mean unwatchable.

The plot, characters, and overall tone of the movie is simple. Beautiful violent women trying to find money in the desert, yet each woman has her own agenda for being there. There are girl fights, nuns, secret agents, lots of guns, and a murderous asian woman called Kinky. Personally, I liked the fact that the story was uncomplicated and the film contain many cliches. If anyone has listened to the director and cast commentary on the dvd, you'll know that this film was intended to be a fun piece of entertainment. Not an award-winning blockbuster, hailed by mainstream audiences as a work of art. It's a B movie, nothing more and nothing less. I think if you give the movie a try and don't expect to much from it, you'll be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ACTION FILM OF ALL TIME !!","review":"Yes, I would recommend this item.

I do not usually write reviews on Amazon, but I wanted to come in and give someone fair warning that this is mind-numbingly bad. You'd better be really effing clever if you want to spoof something that is terrible to begin with and have the end result be anything other than awful, and this movie fails. The only point I can give them (there's the one star for ya) is that in reading some of the other reviews apparently they were TRYING to be that awful.

Some parts of it are slow. The writer created a very futuristic interesting concept, but it seems like it was written in a hurry - not enough time to delve into the characters' motivations. Beginning actors. Whoever wrote it has potential. The director has potential, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Die-hard Fans Only--Get the DVD instead","review":"I was disappointed with the sound quality and song selections. Most of Dusty's best songs were relegated to a medley, and a sloppily-sung one at that. The disco-era tunes were probably lively ones to watch, probably with backing dancers and fun stage antics, but on the audio cd, it all comes out sounding like the tapes I made during the '70s by setting my portable cassette recorder next to the television set. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this cheap junk...","review":"In all the years I have used laptops for work, I have never been motivated to actually buy my own personal laptop in addition -- until now. My company got me an IBM Thinkpad, and it's a piece of junk. It's so bad, I actually forked over $1800 of my own money to get a Dell. The Dell is lightyears beyond the IBM in every way. The IBM is less than a year old, and has already had the motherboard replaced under warranty. Everything about it screams \\"cheap\\", from the lousy keyboard, to the nearly non-functional touch pad (it constantly jumps around, causing you to lose just-typed text).

I believe it is David Attenborough's incredible love for the animals and birds he watches that gives his writing such inspirational power. Each chapter covered a central theme of bird life, such as flight, finding the right partner and nesting, so that by the time you have finished the book, you have lived the life of a bird yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"An indispensable book for any bird lover","review":"As someone who has had a lifelong fascination with birds, I bought this book more for the photographs than anything else. After all, I knew everything about them already, right? Well, boy, was I put in my place! I learned things about these enigmatic creatures that I never would have imagined. One of the reasons this book is so enjoyable is the fact that Mr. Attenborough makes his own awe at the sheer wonder that birds are readily apparent, rather than speaking from the lofty heights of so many of his contemporaries. It's almost as if he is sharing his journey with the reader, and the two are making these discoveries together. And the hundreds of color photographs are incomparable, almost heartbreaking in their beauty. To make a long story short: if you love birds, then you MUST have this book. Period. Thanks, Mr. Attenborough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bird Book!","review":"My grandpa gave me this book last year and I still love it! I just turned 15 and now I am re-reading it again!

Most of their songs sound like a bunch of blue collar slobs banging out their tunes at the local bar on Saturday night. Everything they play sounds very flat, noisy, and musically amateurish----a racket really. None of the band members are good at their instruments, and Bruce Springsteen and his E Street Band are no different from any of the hundreds of other blue collar bar bands in the USA, except Bruce just had more hype!

From the first track I was loving it! I thought this man is truly a talent and couldn't wait to see how he had matured as a songwriter by the third disc. Sadly I didn't get that far, and by the second half of disc one I realized that \\"The Boss\\" had done like so many other....he sold out!

But bonus is perhaps too generous a word. Forty-seven minutes and twenty-one seconds? Better than nothing, I suppose, and there are some gems, like \\"Trapped,\\" \\"Viva Las Vegas,\\" and \\"County Fair.\\" But considering the incredible wealth of material still not released by Mr. Springsteen, the disc fell fall short of expectations. Where are older rarities like \\"Richfield Whistle,\\" \\"Sugarland,\\" and \\"Don't Back Down\\"? Or, for that matter, newer live treasures like \\"The Promise\\"? Any fan could easily have filled the remaining thirty-three minutes with superb material, so why couldn't Columbia Records?As for discs one and two, Mr. Springsteen said it best: \\"depends on who's doing the listening.\\" How do you fit a thirty-plus year career into one hundred and sixty minutes?

It is a known fact that Springsteen wrote the song and released it before Manfred Mann and that Manfred Mann covered this song along with 2 other songs from the Sprinsteen Asbury Park album subsequently. And puhleeeeeeezze, Bon Jovi????? Get real. Even Bon Jovi idolizes Springsteen. Springsteen is a legend and his music is timeless. His music has lasted 30 years and will last at least another 50 years MR. Duran Duran fan. Springsteen is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

This is by all means a collection of great songs, but it's merely an expanded greatest hits collection and NOT a collection of essentials. So if you want hits, buy Greatest Hits for less money.

You're supposed to be writing a MUSIC review, not some irrational, right-wing political screed.

The calendar sold 1 million copies.The documentary is all in French and is not subtitled. It is filmed in black and white, which actually heightens the contracts between light and dark and shows the male body in the most flattering light.The documentary focuses on the models rather than the photograhpers and support staff. I guess this is the whole point, but while watching it you wonder what the make-up artists, the hairdressers, the lighting technicians were thinking. Some of the young men were obviously heterosexual whereas a few shots had homoerotic tension during the photography, but not overt sexual play takes place. The most interesting thing to me was how relaxed these nude men were around 6 or 8 photography staff.This 140 minute DVD is a tribute to young male athletic beauty.

She by no means is looking to the US or various European labor movements to save the world but instead, by locating labor and capital in a world-historical perspective Silver is able to argue that auto workers in the global south are today strategically located in the same place auto workers in Detroit were located in the 1930s. Her basic argument is that wherever capital relocates, workers are then proletarianized, and organized working class resistance begins. She does an excellent job of illustrating that capital has always been mobile, and that through spatial fixes and product cycles, resistance follows capital's mobility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please supply more info on product...","review":"The is a quality pump but I would have bought a different one if I had more info.

I would recommend this pump for use on a live well, bilge, etc, but not with a washdown hose on the end as it can burn up the impeller as stated in the instructions within the box. The best bet for a quality washdown pump is the Jabsco Par Max 4 4.3gpm. This pump is an on-demand pump so you can have the breaker on and when you need water you just pull the trigger.

I should mention that this has never happened with any other shampoo we have used on him, and now that I have switched back to his old shampoo, we do not have that problem anymore. Also, this is lightly scented, but to me it smells like the shampoo we used to use on our dog -- not really a great smell for a baby.

No problem there... science fiction is well-populated with works of the type; Arthur C. Clarke and Michael Crichton come to mind.

This would be OK if it was just serving as the background for interesting science or character development.But the science is silly, which would still be OK if there was a meaningful message here. There isn't. The character development is superficial. The only characters that aren't stereotyped are entirely selfish and self-interested, and they're the good guys oppressed in this bad, bad world.

Sure, Jessica Simpson can sing (especially in her beginnings with 1999's lukewarm smash Sweet Kisses), but not particularly on this DVD. She has some serious vocal affections that hinder her natural sound and distort her pop croonings (she comes off as a Britney wannabe). Interestingly her most timid and boring tunes from In This Skin sound the best (including \\"My Way Home\\"). Her rendition of \\"Take My Breath Away\\" is decent, but her awful performance of \\"Angels\\" falls very short of expectations (she sounded much better on VH1's Divas Live). In the end, her Reality Tour 2004 is a decent but much less stellar concert given by a girl who does have talent. Throw out that Britney-trademarked growl, Jessica, and all the unnatural vocal affections and you can soar. Decent, but not great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this DVD after watching Jessica Simpson's latest music video \\"These boots are made for walkin'\\".

When I listened \\"Take My Breath Away\\" I was totally pissed off. She should in no way try that classic pop song.She can't dance. Some other young singers like Britney may not sing good too but their dance look entertaining. Her move on the stage in no way looks like a star's.The costume looks aweful, looks like pajama and striper's first layer outfit.

Far From It","review":"Jessica Simpson is a talentless bimbo. She is more concerned with shopping than she is with being a singer role model - a title that she so proudly proclaimed after bashing Brittany and Christina for showing too much skin. We all know now that the hypocritical Jessica Simpson would shed her clothes if the price were right.

The majority of of the tape was camera panned still photos of museum prints and the history of the Aurora through past to present. If you were expecting a well produced high school science film...you won't be disappointed, but two minutes of actually watching the Aurora far surpasses this video in beauty and wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably awful...","review":"\\"Into the Heart\\" takes equal turns being thick-headed and cheesy. It purports to be \\"the stories\\" behind the songs but it regularly is nothing of the kind. Instead it focuses at great length on how the songs were mixed-something probably interesting to somebody but not me. His greatest weakness is that Stokes seems to have no concept of the spiritual dimension of the band-a fact that strikes most critics as crucial to understanding U2's music. Though he has clearly interviewed Bono, the quotes that the author uses often seem ripped from their likely context to support whatever Stokes already believes about the songs. The photo captions are howlingly hideous-the type of joke your three year old would tell and you only laugh because you love. I love my three year old. I hate this book. Save your hard-earned cash. Shoot, save the cash you find in the cushions of your sofa!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Maybe it was more like buyer beware, I was really disapointed in how superficial and extrapolated the content of the subject was.

Would also recommend \\"U2 At the End of the World\\" by Bill Flanagan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have used an editor.","review":"This otherwise readable book is so fraught with typos and poor grammar that it is almost embarrassing. \\"Running To Stands Still?\\" \\"Freedom has a scent/ Like the top of a new born babies head?\\" Honestly, it is like reading a first daft by an unskilled writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment: Interesting background, but no insight or depth of thought","review":"I don't want to be redundant with the other reviewers, but I too was disappointed with the content of this book. Stokes seemed to harvest much of his information from old friends and old interviews - with very little analysis or insight from the band. His speculations seem banal and quite shallow with no understanding of the theological, spiritual and political power and depth of the messages found in the music. U2 deserves better and the definitive analysis of their songs has yet to be written."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 \\"The Stories Behind the Songs\\" \\"Great Book\\", \\"Very Well Ilustrated\\"!!!!!!","review":"This is a great book that explains the stories behind U2's songs, through the album \\"Vertigo\\". It explains that the late Joey Rammone, really liked the songs in the \\"What you Can't take With YOU\\" CD. Also in this cd, there are songs like \\"In a Little While\\", and \\"Kite\\", and it explains that these songs are about \\"letting go\\" of someone you love. Sometime during this period, Bono's daddy died, so you can really feel the emotion, U2 puts into these songs. Also, the song \\"Stuck in a Moment, You Can't Get Out Off\\", refers to the late, lead singer of INXS, Michael Hutchencel. It explains he got stuck in a moment he couldn't get out of, and he commited suicide. So, don't get Stuck in a Moment You Can't get out of. Also, it explains that a lot of U2's songs are related to the gospel message in the Bible. Anyway, this is a great book, for any U2 fan.

This book has no brain, really. The writing is ok, and it has a few good lines in it, but for the most part it has no flavor to it. The art, which revives the noir detective stories of the 30's, is the only reason this book deserves to be read. Other than that, it just mopes around going from page to page. The fact that O'Sullivan can just mindlessly kill people page after page (yes, about 30 pages are just textless gunfights) makes the story boring. By doing this, Collins has removed the human element of the character which is the only reason most people read graphic novels in the first place"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"From the outset I have to say that it was my mistake in ordering this item from 'amazon.com.'. I thought it was an actual novel from the great movie \\"The Road from Perdition\\" I was to receive, which I truly believe to be one of the great movies of recent years. It was in fact, to my dismay, what they call a 'graphic novel'- in other words, a comic for the story.I have no doubt, that within that genre (graphic novel) it is a story of some value, but I was expecting otherwise and was duly disappointed. What more can I say?Perhaps 'amazon.com' need to clearly articulate a 'graphic novel' as opposed to the the old fashioned novel that I was expecting to receive.Peter Taylor"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Collins book","review":"I've been reading Collins for quite some time, both his comic book work and his novels, but I missed this when it first came out. I picked up the new edition just a few days ago, and read it today. First, the artwork is amazing. I don't think I'd seen Rayner's work before; it's very detailed and realistic, without sacrificing effective storytelling. The story, of course, is influenced by Lone Wolf and Cub, and touches on some of the same themes as that work. Well, if you like Collins you'll like this. If you like good crime fiction, you'll like this. If you like Lone Wolf and Cub, you'll like this. (I could go on, but you get the idea.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Gripping story!

And everything about this novel is graphic, this is definitely an R rated book with swearing and violence abounding. The story is a part coming of age, part Robin Hood and mostly The Godfather.

I was completely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok dvd","review":"The dvd has alot of famous poker players like johnny chan or Phil Ivey. They get into some stuff about poker strategy but all they really say is the importance of it instead about what it really is and they repeat some of the stuff they say, which is ok. They tell you to read books and they tell you when you should quit. The dvd is really about a poker players life instead of the strategy of the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great interview collection","review":"This is just a bunch of interviews with some noted poker pros.

I can honestly say the only things I learned from this video were the name of some poker players I had not heard of before, and their own stories of how they got started as poker players. You do not see a SINGLE playing card in this video. The only thing this video has going for it is the big name players, but that does not make up for the lack of information.If you are looking to improve your Texas Hold Em game, I recommend \\"Poker: More Secrets of No Limit Hold 'em\\" by Howard Lederer.

I still can't believe that Atlantic Records dropped them from their roster in the mid-90s. But they picked themselves back up and put their album on an independent label. They still sounded good on that album. And I liked when one of the singers mentions one of their past hits, Mamacita, in a song, proving that they remember their past as well as looking to their future. I wished this album could have been promoted more, but I'm sure that they were happy with how it came out. I like that Steve Russell produced most of this album and the members wrote the songs on here. They have proven time and time again that they are a fabulous vocal group!"},{"rating":"1","title":"From Troop To F-Troop ( F 4 Failure )","review":"Let's be clear, Troop was a very high powered group in the late eighties, early nineties. And I brought pretty much all the albums they put out. So seeing this, I expected more of the same, but better because as a group they sustained the longevity of their careers, boy was I wrong. I'm not saying that the average Troop fan will not find something on this cd they might find pleasing, I'm saying that if you expect that Troop sound from back in the day, you won't find it. I give myself the F for purchasing this Failed comeback album! Waste of studio time & money, they probably owe their label for this, groups like Boyz II Men & Jagged Edge can't take off then come back with a banging cd to keep us waiting for that next album!!!

The \\"bitchy\\" humor (oh so knowing, if you've spent your life under a rock) makes you wince, and the characters are totally cardboard.

It's upsetting then that it is actually very poorly written and unforgivably boring! The characters are less than one dimensional, if that's possible. And the plot twists make no sense at best, and at worst contradict previous events. For example, two men (Luke and Zeth) are shown on video naked together and exchanging I-Love-You's, and then later in the book, the same two characters have sex FOR THE FIRST TIME! Also, a character (Rocky) is referred to as being openly gay, and then later in the book denies sleeping with men, seemingly for no reason. The author also seems to be fascinated with the humor of urine, feces, and pain - but he can describe nothing with humor or grace. I identified with only one character, Cameron, in that I felt like a masochist because I forced myself to read the entire book.

Everybody sleeps with everyone else's love interest! Not for the sake of moving the story along but to fill time, in order to make this read last just a hair over 2 hours. Yes just a hair over 2 hours IF you don't toss it out the window in complete disgust.The ending well I won't get into to much; Lets just say the ending wasn't so much a surprise as it was a 'Huh?

Never mind the silly plot and the paper-thin characters -- I thought I would at least take away some funny lines. The only thing I got out of the book was some idea of London's social and physical geography -- where South London lies in relation to Fulham and Camden. (Sophie Kinsella does it so much better in Confessions of a Shopaholic).

Yet coming--at least in the U.S.--after a half-dozen similar novels, it seems boring and derivative. Oh, and predictable, too.BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY certainly is the best known of this genre of books. A couple of books by Isabell Wolff, such as MAKING MINTY MALONE and THE TRIALS OF TIFFANY TROTT, probably are better than BRIDGET JONES' DIARY. So AMANDA has stiff competition and, in comparison, she fails miserably.Having read all of these books and a couple of others, it is impossible not to wonder whether the women of Britain aren't far more self-absorbed, self-indulgent and shallow than their American counterparts. AMANDA'S WEDDING offers no new insights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to be Bridget Jones............","review":"This was a very disapointing novel. The jacket sounded promisising.

It's oftentimes laugh-out-loud hilarious and sweetly romantic to boot! I have read the book about five times already since getting it less than six months ago.

Her childhood next door neighbor Amanda is a girl who has it all and wants everyone to know it. While the book is slightly predictable, it will have you laughing along and rooting for Melanie all the way along. It is a great, fun summertime read for anyone who has ever been jealous of the girl next door or wondered why luck never seemed to visit them."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak characters = likable?","review":"seems that the only strength found in any of the characters is negative: Amanda gets what she wants by being snooty and bitchy, Fran gets what she wants by being bitter and bitchy, and Alex, Charlie, and even minor character Steve each get what they want by being drunk (and somehow that = cute). Mel, on the other hand, is not bitchy and so gets walked on more times than you can count, as do Angus and Fraser. The myriad other British-30-something-neurosis books are much more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Shallow","review":"I really thought this would be a lot better than it was. Once again, as with 99% of Bridget Jones clones, this book pales in comparison. The ending is sloppily tied together and completely unrealistic, and the characters completely flat. Does anyone really care about Melanie's roommate, or - for that matter - Amanda? If Melanie and Fran are too \\"lower class\\" for her, why would Amanda even bother and, not to spoil the \\"surprise\\" ending, but Amanda's sudden behavior toward Melanie at the wedding comes off as completely ridiculous. Overall - don't waste the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"This book is not worth the time and effort that it takes to read it, and I am a speed reader!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bridget Jones Wannabe","review":"I found this book to be poorly written and not at all clever. I expected to be an insider to the main character and read, as in Bridget Jone's Diary, about her inner most thoughts and emotions but instead got a very shallow portrayal of someone that I could not relate to. The plot is thin and uninteresting as are the characters. There are also holes in the motivation of the characters - if Melanie & Fran hate Amanda so much why do they bother to see her when she calls - why do they even care, let alone conspire to ruin her wedding. I am not at all impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucy's wacky adventures continue","review":"Bank secretary Lucy certainly has an interesting life: a love-hate relationship with her miserly boss, celebrities walk through her office on a regular basis, and, most importantly, Lucy has the unique talent to turn the most mundane of tasks into absolute hilarity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writing for military bound high school students","review":"I used Guide to Effective Military Writing in a class of high school seniors who were already signed up to enter the military after graduation. They had little motivation to study English or literature since they knew they were not going on to post secondary education, so I needed something to motivate them to finish their English credits for graduation and to do well. After talking to their recruiter, this is what I came up with. We didn't use all the chapters, but I consider the time we did spend with this book well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go West, Young Mice!","review":"A charming historical romp following the trail of Lewis & Clark & Sacagawea, as per the lives of two mice & their offspring.In THE GREAT CANNON BEACH MOUSE CAPER, we learn about the Museum Mice, Uncle Thomas' Mouse Trips International travel agency & how it works. We also meet three frisky little fellows, the Computer Mice who book the trip for Bert & Mavis, & then they're off to Oregon!Now Bert & Mavis are city mice, let loose on the West Coast, & when Bert is attacked by a huge Pacific Ocean seagull, their lives suddenly change.However, Angus, M.D., comes to the rescue & the couple decide to settle down & raise a family, & the life of a community begins.THE GREAT CANNON BEACH MOUSE CAPER is quite a thick read, with lots of details about setting up beach life on a new frontier, meeting humans, making discoveries, building sand castles, & taking flight on a kite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same old same old","review":"On the same wave length as the previous ones.

Perry, Della, Paul, even Hamilton and the irrascible Lt. Tragg (who gets billing but has not appeared in any of the 7th season) have become like family. Guessing who the murderer is becomes a pleasant game.

I am not purchasing seasons eight and nine. The stories in season seven, especially the second volume, are often too complicated, too histrionic, and too grim. No one in the cast except the Paul Drake character is having any fun. Some stories do not have the Della Street character which really hurts the overall feel of the shows. Raymond Burr is clearly not enjoying it and has lost the \\"spring in his step\\" and his voice. I understand we all get older! And I understand the \\"times they were a changin'\\" by season seven. Still, I'm going to continue enjoying seasons one through six which still had a sense of humor and stories that made sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent video quality","review":"This review is for the whole set through session 7 disk 1: I am rather amazed at how well these DVDs look on my 55 in Sony screen. With the exception of a very few scenes on disk one of season one, the video quality is much better than it was when broadcast. Contrast and grays are so good that I can almost forget I'm watching black and white TV! The sound is full - as in dynamic range, but mono of course.As for the content: You either like to watch these old shows or you don't. The formula from show to show is exactly the same and can be tiring after a couple hundred shows, but I like watching anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERRY MASON SEASON 7 VOLUME 2","review":"IT'S GREAT.....PERRY AT HIS FINEST ALONG WITH DELLA AND PAUL....REALLY JUST GOOD TV DRAMA....RAYMOND BURR AND CAST ARE GREAT....THANKS CBS !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"As with the rest of my reviews of the Perry Mason series, I really like this TV show. Raymond Burr is brilliant in his portrayal of the Stanley Earl Gardner lawyer hero. The entire cast is excellent. If you grew up watching Perry Mason and enjoyed it then, you'll love it now, too. At least I do. The only problem I have with this series is I can't stop watching the episodes and before I know it, I've gone through the entire season in just a couple of weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"good price","review":"This is okay but when modified with [...] using the opto plus mod! its a great pedal,with that mod I always have it on and never loose my original tone.

For me, the only problem is the time of the \\"sustainer effect\\".It is not so long as I thought. I though it would be like the piano's sustainer. But it's a good pedal effect. My guitar get a good sound with the \\"attack effect\\". Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Of The Worst Comrpession Pedals Out There","review":"The Boss CS-3 is one of the most noisy pedals I've ever heard. If you enjoy hissing, then this may be the pedal for you. No matter what knob you choose to turn it is noisy.If you want a real compression pedal, that has ZERO noise, then check out TC Electronic's Vintage Compression. You might have to shell out some extra cash, but there's NO substitute for a good compression and you might as well go with one of the best out there: TC Electronic.I've been generally happy with Boss products, but this pedal is something that just sounds awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Garbage","review":"I had this so called compression/sustain pedal for about a minute. Noticed I said for a minute. This pedal more or less is a volume pedal is my only interpretation of it. I sprung for the Janglebox instead. Pricey? Yes. Worth every penny? Yes. If you want the Holy Grail of compression/sustain pedals the Janglebox is where it's at and made in the good old U.S.A. too. I don't leave home without mine. Boss makes some nice pedals but should drop this joke of a compression/sustain pedal. Very disappointing to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"What have they done to the Queen?","review":"And what has the Queen done to herself?

Granted, she does sound a little better than she has lately -- not as much gravel and hoarseness -- maybe she really did finally give up them cigarettes -- but she's still a far cry far those wonderful mid-sixties and early seventies performances that earned her the title Queen of Soul. Now she's just an faded memory of what she once was and with no fire or excitement.Where's Ted White when you need him?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful and disappointing.","review":"Unfortunately, this CD is among Aretha's all-time worst albums. Shame on Arista Records' boss Clive Davis and the producers involved for trying to make Aretha Franklin sound like just another Hip-Hop artist--instead of giving her better material that would do an artist of Aretha's status justice!!! Only \\"The Woman\\" and \\"How Many Times\\" manage to NOT sound dated. Not surprisingly, this CD is now out-of-print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"Thanks to the lead single written by Ms. Hill, this cd got some attention.

Of course it's well done...it's Trent. OK, so I'm SLIGHTLY bias in my opinion of these tapes because Nine Inch Nails is my favorite band...but I HAVE shown this video to my friends, who love it also. If I could only have ONE Nine Inch Nails video (or video set) on a desert island, it would be this one...well...maybe it would be my tape with all the videos, concert footage, the Broken movie, and interviews that I made myself...but if it had to be a store-bought one...it would be this one.

As we all know Ms Tate and four others were murdered (no, butchered) here by Charlie Manson's followers way back on the night of August 8th 1969. The house aint there anymore though. Hmmmm where did Trent get the inspiration for March Of The Pigs? Probably from the word pig written in Sharon's Blood on the front door.Cool you think? Tell that to the relatives.This is tasteless garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing Dementia Destroys Decent Devices","review":"Sick! I was a mediocre Reznor fan until I saw this video.

The second tape includes concert footage and backstage happenings with Marilyn Manson, David Bowie and the Jim Rose Circus.

The video \\"Happiness In Slavery\\" stayed in my head for days after I ejected the tape and hid it..........but I went back for more. Trent and company despite all the talk about Trent IS NIN are a real team out there on the road. The concert scenes are exhausting to watch. They give it their all. I was moshing in my living room!

It is a double Cd with vol. 1 and vol. 2, while the US release is in three seperate CD issues. I looked up the track differences, and it there are 7 tracks on this issue not found on the 3 US volumes. This music itself on this issue is fantastic. Although I already have both the Plastikman cuts, the other stuff I had not heard before. Being a fan of Kenny Larkin and Ken Ishii (Utu), it is nice to hear material from them. Some of the standout stuff comes from Speedy J, especially the Patterns Remix track. very intense but sublime. I am pretty sure that this is not on any of the US issues, so if you want some more Plus 8 material, this is one place you can find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very funny and not very positive for our children.","review":"I was excited to pick up this book because the illustration is gorgeous and I usually like most of Julius Lester's books.

Columcille loved books so much that he secretly copied a volume of psalms from Rome against it's owner's wishes. The resulting and bitter fallout in 521 A.D. caused Columcille to deliberately leave Ireland in a tiny boat, vowing never to return.

This author is a Liberal who is attempting to blend Liberalism with Christianaity to create a New World. He, and the Left, are changing the message to suit their political agenda. American Christians aren't perfect (like Liberals are--just ask them) but if you ARE a Christian or are a wanna-be, you'll see right through this guy and his claims.

W.T.F.?Q: So why buy this set anyway? A: Because you need to get your hands on ALL reggae, good and bad. You'll have to look long and hard for these songs individually, so why not shell out the $25 or so and get 'em all neatly packaged w/ liner notes. If you're on a budget (like most of us), get something else, like the Instrumentals set or one of the Ska volumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"close but no cigar","review":"After having the market flooded with nearly four thousand box sets, how is one to choose?I went with this one thinking it was going to be nice and funky interpretations of American soul songs, but instead am left with three cds of bland covers. It's like listening to a Jamaican wedding band. The tracks are just straight covers with a little skanky upbeat thrown in for the \\"foreign spice\\".The only cd worth listening to is the second one, devoted to 'funk'. This is actually pretty enjoyable. Disc one (motown) and disc three (love songs) are so boring I couldn't keep my finger off the fast forward button on my remote control.If you're into funky interpretations of American soul or soulful reggae, stick to the SoulJazz label's 100% comps or the Studio One Soul collections.

Unfortunately, besides \\"butta love\\" with its clever lyrics and \\"too close\\" with its dance beat, this album is a goes down hill. The album as a whole has flat and unstimulating beats, hooks and lyrics. The focus is on sex.

The music and the beats are off the hook but there is too much perversion. I hope when Next come out with there next album (and I know there will be one because the guys are talented) I hope they clean it up.

It has lots of phrases, and the phrase book is small enough to carry around, and you can use the index to flip right to pages with sentences using the word you looked up. For actual learning i dont think it is that great though. The tapes only say each phrase twice, and not slowly enough. Also, this set is just words and phrases- there are no activites or anything to give you practice using the language.

So, guys being that penis is mentioned and the songs are sketchy your girlfriends and wive may not dig this CD but what the hell do they know, right?

This book taught me, through the example of Hazel Parcells, that we all have to take responsibility for our health. But the great thing is that we really can do it!

Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creature: One of the Best Albums Ever Made","review":"Creature is definitely a departure from Silver. It's a lot softer in places but it's still one rocking album. Hits like Leave It Alone, Resurrection, Tangerine, etc. makes this one of my favourite albums of all time. It takes you from a soft and quiet place in one second and then it sends you into a loud, powerful place the next second. David Usher's voice is truly amazing and he proves that he can sing mellower, softer tunes just as well as he can scream in the harder tracks. Overall, the band shows that it has evolved into one with a dynamic sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"No words can say how great this album is...","review":"I first heard of Moist last Christmas (or Hanukka, or whatever...). My friend taped me a mixed tape with 'Resurrection' on it. I fell in love with the song the first time I heard it, and I got 'Creature' right away. I absolutely admire the whole band (especially Dave...) and today, I'm one of their biggest fans. I also own 'Silver' and 'Little Songs', and I love them both, but 'Creature' is in my first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had prepared myself for disappointment","review":"I won free tickets to a Moist concert about 3 years ago and was very impressed by what I heard. I went out and bought Silver(which I guess is no longer available in the U.S.) and listened to it constantly. When Creature was released, I didn't buy it immediately because I didn't think I could enjoy it as much as Silver. Well, it has surpassed Silver and I have added it to my top CD's. When people ask who they sound like, I can not answer that because they have a sound of their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but not as good as silver","review":"I really enjoyed this album, but it didn't captivate me as much as did their first album \\"Silver,\\" which if I am not mistaken is not available in the US. I love David Ushers lyrics, he has the most amazing way with words, and strings them together in the most amazing ways. \\"The flowers that you gave me dyng slowly on the wall\\" Love it. He is also a very emotive singer, which is something that I very much like in a singer. He actually has a solo album out which is also phenonemal. I also like the arangements and the density of the sound. When these boys lay it on they lay it on thick. That said the are also capable of a very effictive sparseness."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just gotta say","review":"These Draka are really repulsive (tho' compulsive reading). So that must be the reason why I plowed through and read the whole series in a few weeks. Even though I felt like taking a shower after finishing each novel. Maybe it's also because I'm someone who has lived in South Africa (twice), both during and after apartheid, and I wondered how a talented writer like Mr. Stirling would handle apartheid and Afrikaaners run amuck. Well, I found out. Definitely not for the faint-hearted nor anyone who doesn't like reading about man's inhumanity to man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost touch with the former novels","review":"After loving the former Domination novels, I found this one disappointing, an obvious answer to the question \\"Just how would a Draka do in today's society?\\" While that question is good for discussion, it made a poor book. It read entirely too much like the script for Predator II and too little like Marching Through Georgia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food Network","review":"These are sturdy and very useful in the kitchen. I saw something like them being used by chefs on TV and am very happy with these tongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"The locking mechanism on this pair of tongs is very difficult to use compared to that of EKCO tongs. As a result I have barely used them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good-Looking Functional Tongs","review":"These are good-looking tongs safe for non-stick cookware. The silicone is a bit slippery, but the scalloped edges definitely help in terms of gripping food. I would not recommend tongs that are square or rectangular; the food slips right out from between the arms. I think these are pretty basic and do the job well. The stainless handles look good and are easy to clean. I like stainless kitchen accessories to match my other cookware. The 9 and 12 inch models are both good, but I prefer the 12 inch ones. The extra couple inches make the difference when grilling. Buy these; you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for Non-Stick","review":"When I bought a nonstick cookware set, I had to retire all my metal utensils, including a well-used set of tongs. I chose this brand of silicone paddles for the locking mechanism, which is secure & easy to use, and the 9.5\\" length, which gives me more control in manipulating food in large or small pots and pans.Alton Brown taught me how to use tongs as a substitute for a cooking spoon, spatula, pasta strainer and more. These do the trick & protect my nonstick finishes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't grasp anything with the silicone slippery things","review":"I hate these things. I bought two. Works great for something that weighs less than a fly but for steaks, chicken, chops, anything that has weight, you can't grip it. The silicone is slippery and the food slips out and splats back into the pan and splatters juices everywhere.I threw them away and bought two at Bed, Bath, and Beyond without the silicone, now I'm a happy camper."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"I love these tongs. They're great for everything you can imagine, and even stuff you can't. They are durable, lock well, and keep the heat away from my hands. Love em."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent pair of tongs","review":"The 12 inch is a really good size - for most tasks it's probably a bit too big, but every now and then I will need to pick up something big and heavy like a roasted chicken, and this can grip it with ease. I was worried that the silicone surface, while being nonstick friendly, would be slippery. But I've never felt like it was less grippy than standard metal tongs. Also very well designed is the lock mechanism, as the ring is easy to pull and push in on the fly.One thing to note is that it's easy to catch a finger or some skin on the hinge close to the butt end, which really hurts. But that's a near universal danger inherent to tongs, so still 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stubby Ends","review":"Very nice, they don't scratch my teflon pans! However, they are fat, so don't expect to have the dexterity of metal ones... had to use a spatula to lift the end of my pork chop to grip it with these tongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can see why this was the last season of Vega$","review":"I rented this from the public library and I am glad this was nothing I purchased. I enjoyed the first 2 seasons of Vega$, but the third season was boring and slow and Robert Urich/Dan Tanna had lost his sexy, even his body wasn't in good shape and the hair on his chest just laid there all dull. I can very well see why ABC cancelled this show after season 3. It was all but over."},{"rating":"2","title":"VEGA$$ Season 3 Volume 1","review":"The Third Season Volume 1 follows the exact same track as the all previous releases with only half a season and virtually no special features. You do get episodic promos and subtitles. Picture quality is clean and audio is clear.The first half of season 3 features the 2-part episode filmed in beautiful Hawaii where Tanna is kidnapped and put under a trance in order to murder Casino magnate Phillip Roth. And Tony Curtis makes a return as the Roth character in 'Deadly Blessings'.This episode also features the Nun that appeared in season 1. Of course this set is a bit pricey for only half a season and no specials, but I am just glad that it is finally released(so many other classic TV show DVD's are stuck at a couple seasons or less and no further releases)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is about real life.","review":"My late husband's family beginnings were in this place at this time.

Basically, the songs just don't captivate; they don't stay with you either musically or lyrically. The CD's first three tracks do little to whet the appetite for more. A couple of standoudts include \\"Home To Myself,\\" and \\"Through The Eyes of Grace,\\" the latter being a thoughtful examination of a long-since-faltered marriage.

Melissa Manchester is the one - I can't get over how good this collection is. Nearly all the material is self-written (and the few songs that aren't are tellingly inferior), and peerlessly beautiful. She covers a variety of styles - piano balladry not unlike Carole King (Just You and I), gospel (O Heaven), pop (You Should Hear How She Talks About You), soul (Lovers After All) and the lyrics (some supplied by Carole Bayer Sager, some Melissa Manchester herself) are uniformly heart-felt, direct, touching and honest. And all of this before you even consider her fantastic voice, which knocks all the competition into a cocked hat. I'd be surprised if anyone was disappointed with this fantastic CD.

The seller was BD MEDICAL SUPPLIES."},{"rating":"2","title":"I highly recommend this thermometer. It's extremely accurate ...","review":"I highly recommend this thermometer. It's extremely accurate (I compared it with two other thermometers) and simple to use. The memory feature is perfect for me, as I sometimes forget to record my data. So next time I turned the thermometer on, I was able to view my last results. It also came with great instructions and a graph so I'm able to chart my results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This thermometer is a few degrees off and useless.

I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"I'm a big fan of digital thermometers. This one is very easy to use. Just press the button and put it in your mouth, and when it has your temp. it beeps quickly. Then you can leave it on the nightstand until you are ready to mark your temperature chart. If you want to note your temp. right away, press the button and the screen lights up, so you can see the number.I also found the directions in the box to be a very helpful explaination of how to use the thermometer and how to use the temperature chart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine didn't work.","review":"My thermometer wouldn't come on once I received it. I took the battery out and could only get it to come on if the battery was placed just right. Once I got it to come on, it wouldn't work properly. It gave the finishing beep as soon as I turned it on. The F doesn't flash to indicate that its ready. It didn't beep as it took my temperture, and never beeped to indicate it was finished. If it gives a memory reading (rare), it is incorrect (106.4?). Quite disappointing to receive a dud and have to deal with returning it and getting a new one.If I get a replacement I hope it works better than this one.I did get a replacement, and it works perfectly. If yours seems to malfunction, definitely send it back for a new one!As for my new, fully functioning thermometer, it is easy to use, doesn't beep too loudly, and is accurate and reliable.

Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"stopped working within two weeks!","review":"As long as it was working, I liked this product fine but it stopped working within two weeks. Further, when I requested for a replacement, the company representative told me to return ship the product for them to ship me a new one. Hassle! Hassle! I instead bought a new one from local Ralphs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beeping annoying","review":"I dislike that it beeps upon turning it on, and beeps every few seconds while it is taking the temp, and then beeps multiple times to indicate it is done. All this beeping is annoying to me (such an annoying noise that early in the morning!)and to my husband who mistakes it for his alarm clock---it wakes him up and is thus disturbing his sleep. A quieter product would be more welcome to both of us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked TWICE","review":"Thermometer worked TWICE on two successive days. From that point the display only registered gibberish. Foolishly, I was very angry and frustrated and since the trash was being picked up that morning, I tossed the thermometer in with the garbage, so I have no recourse (but it felt good to put it where it really belonged). Given reviews of many other digital oral thermometers, I'm downright suspicious of these mass-produced, cheaply-made items (not limited to thermometers, of course - we're overrun with similar junk in this country). I'm going to try a couple of local drugstores to see if I can find a basic, traditional non-digital oral thermometer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Seller!","review":"I would make sure if you order this product that you do not order it through eSource Wellness. My thermometer was simply put in a thin oversized envelope with no padding or protection. When I opened the envelope, the box of the thermometer was destroyed, the plastic protective case was shattered and the thermometer itself was just loose in the envelope. The company's website was not working so via Amazon, I emailed them on two different occasions about my order. This was two weeks ago and I have yet to hear back from them.The thermometer itself is functioning but I'm suspicious about it's accuracy. Regardless of the time of day, the reading is always 98.2 or 98.3. I ordered this thermometer because the one I bought from Walmart (different brand) fluctuated so much even after consecutive readings."},{"rating":"2","title":"BD Basal Thermometer","review":"I ordered this thermometer after looking at other brands of basal thermometers.

I haven't checked it against my regular thermometer, so I am hoping that it is accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make sure you order the right thermometer for your needs","review":"Having 2 very different products on one page is very misleading-make sure you order the right thermometer! I read the reviews about backlighting and was very excited to order my thermometer only to realize the reviews about the backlit one are for the other thermometer-which was not visible on my Amazon app. So buyer beware, make sure you are getting what you want and don't order this via the Amazon app because the reviews are all mixed together for 2 products. The thermometer I got works fine, but the lack of the backlight is a huge bummer for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think it works","review":"This thermometer does not seem to measure temperature correctly. It never reads above 98.2 for me whether I take my temp at waking or after a high intensity workout. We thought my temperature might just be on the low end of normal, so my husband also tested it during mid morning hours after he was awake and active. It only read 98 degress for him. I don't trust that it's working and I'll be returning the unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best alarm ever","review":"I use to use the regular glass thermometer but i would just fall back to sleep. this one keeps beeping and actually makes you wake up instead of being late. I recomend it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't read termpature on screen","review":"I was using this thermometer to track my cycle temperature. I had to use it everyday at 5:45am. However, the screen was messed up and I had to tilt it in all different lights to read the temp. Needless to say - that wasn't easy to do at 5:45 in the morning. I threw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"seller delivered a different item","review":"The seller delivered a different item.the seller gave us a fever thermometer and when we contacted them they told us they will send us a label to return the item back.its been two months and we are yet to receive it.from the reviews i now see that this has happened many times.if the item is not in stock then why send us some other product???so now we are not able to return the item back and we are stuck with this item which we dont want.waste of money.if you are ordering this product to use immediately then please buy from some other seller because a lot of mixups are happening.so save your money and buy from some other seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Themometer","review":"The first themometer I received would not put out a digital display.

Just go to the drug store, it will be much faster and you will get what you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thermometer is out of stock!!!!","review":"I ordered this basal thermometer in late October and received a fever thermometer from them instead. I contacted them immediately & they said they would send out the correct one with a return label. I waited a week & nothing. I contacted them again & they said they were out of the basal thermometers so they just sent me a return label for the fever one. I returned it to them & received a full credit. Obviously this was a huge waste of my time & hopes, so why do they still have it listed for sale? Do they just send out the fever one hoping the customer won't notice??? Don't buy from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"My thermometer came with either a burnt out battery or doesn't work at all - I'll find out today when I try to replace the battery.

Do not buy, waist of your money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless as a Basal thermometer","review":"This is NOT a basal thermometer. It only reads to the tenth of a degree...my normal thermometer does that. Temping for fertility is only useful if you can get to the hundredth of a degree so that you can accurately gauge your shifts. Waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the basic Target brand","review":"This basal thermometer is easy to use and seems to be much more accurate than a Target brand I bought first. I like that it stores the previous temperature in case I don't write it down right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent!","review":"This is my first basal thermometer. I love how it beeps to let me know it's working and beeps faster to let you know when it's done. I use it every morning while i'm still half asleep so the beeping noise is great! Excellent product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beeping is terrible!","review":"Although yes, it does what it is supposed to do and takes your temperature, its continuous beeping every few seconds for over a minute is entirely unnecessary. It wakes my husband up and although he does not get angry and knows it is not my fault he does get annoyed at the product (I would find it annoying if the positions were reversed). I am going to look for another product that does not beep the entire time it is taking my temperature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken after 6 months of use","review":"Stopped working after a few months of use. I will not buy it again. It is also very loud and would wake my husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT waste your money","review":"I got a total of 3 yes only THREE tempatures out of this themometer before it stopped working and now I am not even sure those temps were correct!My husband and I are trying to concive so we started charting, this morning I woke up to take my 4th temp and sure enough this thermometer wasnt working I could only get it to recall the memory and not take a new temp, eventually it took a 'temp' but I am pretty sure my BBT was not 92.3 so I took the battery out and replaced it then tried again and all that did was clear the memory temp so I could only get blank lines. After 15 minutes of trying I gave up, after all I am sure the whole point of my waking BBT was out the window at that point anyway!If you are looking to use this for TTC or as BC I suggest either paying for a good one or going to the store and buying it that way you don't have to mess with filing a claim or shipping if it doesn't work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great but slightly loud","review":"I bought this product to assist me and my husband in trying to conceive. It was very accurate and I love the lighted display and memory features. The only negative about the product is the beeping which I feel is loud. My husband never complained but I did my best to cover the back of the thermometer to muffle the beeps. Overall, it is a great product for the price and we were able to conceive the first month using FAM and this thermometer. Now if only something could cure the \\"morning sickness\\" and I would be in business!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as described","review":"Worked just as described.

The recipes are well-tailored to be healthy and generally pretty convenient to make (with tips for using modern appliances and store-bought spice mixes for when you are in a rush). The glossary is extremely helpful and it is very well organized. I have no trouble finding the section to fit where my taste lie any given day (vegetable curries? dals? street food?). The only shortcoming is that the index does not include the Indian names for dishes, which made it a little difficult to track down specific recipes. Otherwise, though, it is an outstanding, comprehensive resource on Indian cuisine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy Indian","review":"I love this cookbook and am working my way through it, trying to make at least one new recipe a week. Although I am not Indian, an Indian friend of mine vouches for the authentic \\"taste\\" of the recipes. These aren't classic recipes, but more up to date for today's tastes and health awareness. The dishes incorporate the myriad spices that make Indian cuisine distinct, but are not loaded with ghee and other oil, although even so, I tend to cut the amount of oil suggested and just ignore the ghee. Although I have other Indian cookbooks, I use this as my bible for technique including spice preparation. I also like that she has some admittedly Americanized dishes so there is truly something for every palate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent recipes for vegans","review":"My husband and I recently became vegan for ethical reasons, and were faced with that difficult question: NOW what do we have for dinner? Then we found this book. Out of the 1000 recipes, about one-third are vegan, and all vegan recipes are clearly marked in the index for easy access. While some of the ingredients are hard to find, and some of the meals take a long time, this has been an excellent find for us. We've tried so many of the recipes, and they're fabulous. A must-have for any vegan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book with awesome recipes","review":"Neelam Batra's book is one of the greatest books out of all the cookbooks I've. It is not for beginners. I was born and brought up in India and I come from a family of excellent cooks. I am Chef myself. I've come across so-called Authentic recipes and you see half of them are not even spelt right. Writing and compiling 1000 recipes is not easy and that too doing everything right and great tasting. First of all, to come to this book, you need to know the basics of Indian cooking. You also need to know about Indian spices. If you want try cooking Indian food, try some simple books. You should graduate in your knowledge and skills to come to this book. It is also an excellent book for Indians to have it their collection because it has recipes from almost all regions of India. Hats off to her. I've recommended this book for our recipe collection at work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, there really are 1000 recipes","review":"Excellent, excellent cookbook. Every recipe I tried was delicious, and I really, really appreciated that there were many recipes for the spice blends rather than reliance on commercially prepared curry powders and masalas. The only thing that could have improved this would have been some pictures, but the book is already several inches thick as it is. A huge treasure trove of Indian cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cook book","review":"This book is very comprehensive and the recipes are excellent. I especially like the fact that modifications are presented for the american kitchen. She also gives variations for various recipes (for substitution, or quick version) which is helpful.This book is certainly not for a beginner cook. But if you know basic techniques and can follow recipes you will have great success at making excellent Indian food at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best Indian recipe book I own...","review":"I love this book- it's so much better than any Indian cookbook I own including Madhur Jaffrey, the Noon book, etc. I hate to say it but it's the only one that tastes better than my Indian grandma's cooking. Everything in it comes out tasty and quite authentic if you follow the recipe to the letter, which is very rare because Indian cooking is never done \\"by measurement\\". I also like that she includes recipes from all over India, rather than just the North Indian Mughlai style which everyone serves in restaurants that people think is the \\"real Indian food\\" from such a diverse country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!!!","review":"I originally got this book free as part of a promotion. I recently bought a copy for a friend who is just starting to learn to cook Indian food. I think it is very complete with recipes that are easy to follow. Once you have some key spices in your pantry, you don't usually have to buy a lot for any recipe. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting, dishonest, misguiding","review":"I bought this appalling piece of academic dishonesty misled by its title, which made me believe it would be a serious, scientific and educational material. What I saw instead, and there is no way I'll ever have those 2 hours of my life back, was an ugly (in every sense) show of religious proselytism, poorly trying to pass itself as science. I am perplexed at this man's nerve, misusing serious, respected scientists' names and twisting their words in such a shameless fashion. I didn't even try to get my money back : I just took some sturdy scissors to each disc and threw the pieces in the garbage, where they belong. I am usually against the destroying or burning of books and other intellectual works, but this is neither work nor intellectual, and it embraces and encourages ignorant arrogance in such a way that it would probably have benefitted from the flames. At least they might have crept some light into this obscurantist, self-important and tacky piece of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a Coffee mug that's not made in CHINA!","review":"I love this mug.

Whatever bible he used to write this stuff it isn't the real Bible. It might work at some preschool level. But it seems doubtful the Author actually researched the Scriptures as he claims to have done. And those 400 books on Warfare he's bought & read? Well, if he considers himself the best of them THAT SHOULD tell you something! that the 400 other books were as useless as his is.

PASS on this book & anything by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is 5 stars as high as I can go?","review":"This is very sound, practical, \\"liveable\\" teaching on the matter of spiritual warfare. Unfortunately, most of us from evangelical backgrounds get very limited teaching on the reality of the battle. Dr. Logan's book is particularly valuable in that it not only acquaints the reader with the concept of spiritual warfare, but gives practical, measurable steps to apply it to their daily walk. The \\"Higher Ground\\" segments between chapters are especially helpful in this regard. I'm ordinarily hesitant to recommend books too quickly, knowing that for most people it requires an investment of days or weeks to finish a book. Dr. Logan's book is a notable exception; this is worthwhile reading for any believer who's hungry to see genuine change and growth. This is life-changing material.

However, her unrelenting Marxist approach to American tribal life is very grinding and does not expand her field of inquiry beyond the simplistic \\"US bad, Indians good\\" model that does not adequately address the complexities of the historical relationship between the Choctaw and multiple colonial and post-colonial societies. One of my own works is cited in this book, inaccurately, in my opinion.But if Marxism is the reader's basis for political theory, it would be a good read and source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable quality in a junk ear clip","review":"I picked up this pair of Phillips ear clips, expecting slightly better quality than their lower lines of headphones/clips. I also thought the in-line volume control would be a positive thing. I was wrong. While the sound quality was decent, with somewhat good bass for clips, the overall quality of equipment was cheapo junk. The \\"in-line\\" volume control was shorting out, and slight movement of the cord near it caused sound to cut in and out. Not to mention I believe the ear clips may not fit most peoples ears. They were way off on mine, and I found it hard to get a good fit. Most other brands seemed to fit ok.These sound decent, but suffer from bad quality with cheap parts. I came to find Phillips doesn't even make these, some third party company \\"Gemini\\" does. YOu can do better elsewhere, I do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmm...really??

The songs here are in a word, beautiful. McLachlan's voice is the best, in tone and range, of any of the female singer/songwriter's out there today. Her music also has more depth and breadth than anyone else's. Every songwriter writes about relationships and lost loves, but no one does it with the poetry and soul wrenching that Sarah McLachlan does. \\"Building a Mystery\\" and \\"Angel\\" were the radio hits from Surfacing but I think \\"Sweet Surrender\\" might be the strongest track. I also love \\"Witness\\", \\"Do What You Have to Do\\" and the austere \\"I Love You\\". Coupled with Fumbling Toward Ecstasy, Surfacing is a singer and songwriter at the top of her talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah Continues to Shine","review":"Sarah McLachlin is one of the most talented young women writing music today. \\"Surfacing\\" has all the qualities that made \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\\" an international hit -- smart, introspective lyrics, beautiful instrumentation, and, of course, Sarah's strong, emotional voice. The songs are perhaps a little less structured, with less vocal harmonizing, but it fits the new subject matter -- less negativity towards relationships, and a more upbeat outlook. In comparison to other up-and-coming female vocalists (Paula Cole and Jewel come to mind), Sarah's voice is in a class by itself. Her emotion, depth, and range is unmatched -- where other singers have a weak, one-dimensional sound, Sarah's is multi-dimensional. Added to the fact that she is also a first-class songwriter, you have an unbeatable combination. With the success of such releases as \\"Building a Mystery\\" and \\"Sweet Surrender\\", Sarah is destined to achieve much-deserved fame and recognition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Moving","review":"\\"Surfacing\\" is my personal favorite album by Sarah McLachlan. Though entirely different from the previous album, \\"FTE\\", \\"Surfacing\\" explores several different moods and feelings than those in previous albums. In a day when bubble gum pop rules the airwaves, it's nice to relax and listen to a true artist who puts feelings into their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, but pales in comparison to FTE","review":"I must say when I first bought this album (it was my 1st Sarah album) I thought it was the greatest it could be. But now that I have heard older stuff, Surfacing has lost its luster. I think one of its biggest minuses is how over-commercialized it was/is. It is NOT pop, and cannot be sold as that. But, I can't give the music anything but a rating of excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating!!!","review":"The first time I heard \\"Buliding a Mystery\\", I fell in love with Sarah's voice. So when I bought this album, I knew that she won't fail me. And she definitely did not. The songs are deep and the melody's superb! \\"Angel\\" made me cry. This one's a prized catch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure dreck...","review":"I saw her perform on the Blockbuster Awards on FOX, and had to go puke in the middle of the performance. Just because you can play piano doesn't mean you have talent. She sounds like a cat that has just been hit by a car but is still alive dying a slow painful death. GAG! Stick with Tori Amos, this is pure DRECK, sorry folks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the package it comes in","review":"McLachlan's nice voice isn't enough to save it from it's seemingly obvious flaws, I'll keep it simple: Stupid, annoying lyrics; boring, popy music; uncreative; just another tradgic case of a talentless women with no talent trying to sing the blues...Don't buy this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck!","review":"Pure and simple, as bas as Lynyrd Skynyrd! (And that is bad!). Give me some real music like Tori!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's so wack it kept me awake","review":"so there i am listening to this woman singing after i heard how talented she was at writting and playing the piano and then i'm at song 9 and mentallt numb from boredom.she is wack and her music has no feeling what so ever.me shall nde ocello would take her to school.this disc is good for playing frisbe."},{"rating":"1","title":"All voice, little music","review":"Fumbling Toward Ecstasy was a good album featuring well written songs and poignant singing. The new material on this disk has greatly decreased the emphasis on the music and focused primarily on the artist's voice, which is not a very good trade-off. In particular, Adia is just an awful song - there is no tune or melody whatsoever - and it simply features McLachlan droning on endlessly and pointlessly. Unfortunately, Ms. McLachlan has let her success and acclaim get to her head and she now feels she is such a superior artiste that, by and large, she can dispense with quality songwriting and instead put out songs that essentially say \\"Look at me - I have such a great VOICE that I don't need to be interesting or creative and all shall still love and worship me.\\" In this case, success + ego = banal music."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is awesome. All of the songs on it are really good!","review":"This cd is great! The best songs on this cd are \\" I Love You\\", \\" Angel\\", and \\" Witness\\" but the whole cd is awesome. Sarah McLachlen has a beautful voice and gorgeous lyrics. This cd is a must-have:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"What can I say? This disc embodies an amazing talent - Sarah is a goddess. I love this CD and I'd tell anyone to get it. \\"I Love You\\" is simply it - its amazing. I love this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic CD","review":"This CD is gorgeous. The only negative is the 'enhanced CD'. I play CD's in my laptop at work and this one is a huge pain. It often crashes my machine and is difficult to get the songs to play. The CD is awesome, I just wish the 'enhanced' technology were less frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, yet not the best.","review":"Sarah, with all her talent and options, did extremely well on this album. However, it does not compare to Fumbling Towards Ecstacy. The songs, at many points, get too lyrical, too syrupy. While portraying a complete atmosphere and story, Surfacing lacks the definition of difference between tracks that Fumbling exhibits ALONG WITH a mastery of pulling all the selections into one complete package. I highly recommend this album, and all her others, but if you want to hear Sarah's best, I would suggest you get Fumbling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surfacing (McLachlan)","review":"This is a nicely arranged vocal album. Not your typical elevator music. Quite an enjoyable album by a superb vocalist and composer."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply amazing","review":"I don't even know what to say about this cd. I am a HUGE music fan - not artist fan. I like quality, not quantity. This music is simply amazing. I wish I had 1/2 the talent of the writer of this music (not sure who wrote these songs), and 1/2 the talent of Sarah. She has such an angelic voice, and sings from somewhere deep inside her that most artists have not even found yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"surfacing-sarah mclachlan","review":"This is an album which I had on tape. No more tape players in cars these days, so I replaced it with a cd. The service was very good, prompt, well packaged and in Australia within two weeks. A great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"too \\"breathy\\"","review":"God-awful CD from Sara. She sings like she is gasping for he last breath of air before being suffocated. This is a terrible D from a mediocre lounge singer. Terrible, don't waste your hard earned Money. In fact, if you received this as a gift, go trade it in for some real music, this is painful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SARH Mclachlan cd","review":"This was advertised with no box but when the print work and CD cames there was no try card. Price was right however."},{"rating":"1","title":"God awful","review":"Listening to this CD is worse than Chinese Water torcher! Come one people, you hand out 5 stars like candy! Sarah needs to hang it up, she has no talent what-so-ever. Listen to something real for a change. Something real is something other than this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Constantly In My CD-Player!","review":"My absolute favourite CD I own! The only song I had heard by Sarah McLachlan, before this album, was \\"I Will Remember You\\" and I liked that song. But last Christmas, one of my best friends bought me this album, and I listened to a couple songs every once in a while. But I had several major changes and tragic things happening in my life about a month later, and I started listening to the whole album. Sarah is ethreal, edgy, and everything no other singers will ever be able to duplicate. \\"Do What You Have To Do\\" is my favourite cut off her album, although, I love all the songs. If anyone asked me what CD they should get, I'd tell them \\"Surfacing\\" from Sarah McLachlan. And now I'm telling all of you. GO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still wondering what happened!","review":"\\"Surfacing\\" had me running back to my \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\\" cd in no time. I just never expected Sarah McLachlan to follow up FTE's sheer magic with Surfacing's sentimental AOR fodder. I really tried to like this album but most of it was just so boring. The only songs that are above average are \\"Angel\\", \\"Witness\\", and \\"Full of Grace\\". And FOG wasn't even a new song when it was included in the album. The other tracks have good melodies but trite and repetitive lyrics. Surfacing is good if you're looking for plain (and I mean _plain_) background music, but if you're the kind who likes to listen closely this cd may not be substantial enough. Heck, everyone should just get Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. (Ignore the fact that \\"towards\\" isn't even a word!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Humourless, banal","review":"Some of Sarah Mclachlan's melodies are pretty, and as a pianist she's competent, but her lyrics always make her albums disappointing she writes in the most horrible cliches, and is obviously unacquainted with such concepts as wit. \\"We are born innocent, believe me Adia, we are still innocent\\" - does anyone actually buy this pretentious, flossy-headed muck? Is it meant to mean something?On Building a Mystery, things get really portentious...voodoo dolls, vampires, and other assorted bits of juvenilia.Comparing Mclachlan to Joni Mitchell is a profound insult to the latter, who could never have made something as hackneyed, artistically lackadaisical and full of mind-numbing gibberish as Surfacing. An alternative way of scrambling your brain is to place your head in a food processor."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Time, Hands Down","review":"I am an eternal fan of Sarah, but this album epitomizes her musical tastes and talents. This is the only CD that I can claim to love every track. Building a Mystery's upbeat, passionate lyrics give way to equally intense, yet softer music all the way to the instrumental Last Dance. A must for anyone who has ever wanted to experience the full range of human emotions in little over an hour!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than 5 stars","review":"Sarah has the most beautiful voice I have ever heard, and it comes through like never before on this CD. It is a must-have CD because every song is excellent. The well-known songs like \\"Adia\\" and \\"Sweet Surrender\\" are are what attracted me to this CD, but additional songs like \\"I Love You\\" and \\"Angel\\" are incredible. They showcase the full range of Sarah's magnificent voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful CD...Full of reflection and introspective","review":"Sarah McClachlan, what a voice, what a songwriter, and what passion for music. This CD is one of her best, if not her best. From \\"Full of Grace\\", my personal favorite...to \\"Adia\\" and \\"Angel\\" each of these songs highlight not only her beautiful voice, but also her unique and excellent talent as a songwriter.The orchestration adds a very nice touch to some of the songs as well.In my opinion, I haven't heard such a great songwriter/singer since Carole King, Carly Simon and those talented ladies of the 1960's and 1970's.These are not \\"light feel happy\\" songs. These are songs that are of reflection, regret, and maybe forgiveness. Songs of life's journey is what they are. I am not usually this self-reflective or \\"deep\\" when it comes to reviews, however in this case its warranted because this is truely a unique and wonderful CD. A rare circumstance in the last 20 or so years. It is well worth purchasing. Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surfacing-Sarah McLachlan","review":"This is a great album. I'm glad that I bought this CD because it's really nice and relaxing to listen to. My favorite songs on this are: Sweet Surrender, Building A Mystery, Witness, and Adia.

I think that everyone should go out and buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than 'fumbling'","review":"i've been a sarah mclachlan fan for quite a long time now - i've got all of her albums. i know that 'fumbling towards ecstasy' is supposed to be the best of her albums - it's very good, but pretty samey. i bought 'surfacing' recently and i'm pretty sure it's the best of her albums. it has fast songs such as 'black and white' and slower ones like 'do what you have to do'. i fell in love with 'full of grace' the first time i heard it, and this is currently my most played album. if you get this album, you won't get tired of it. every song is different, every track unique. definately her best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a very haunting effort","review":"the one thing that attracts me to buy this is that i happened to know a few of the songs in this cd that i really like. okay, don't blame me that i'm new in appreciating sarah, but hey, it's a start. i must say that the songs in this cd is very, um... retospective and sad and haunting... i favourites includes (you should *know* these) adia, angel and building a mystery. but, i have to say the other lesser known ones are equally good, especially 'do what you have to do', 'sweet surrender' and the i think it's an instrumental piece, 'last dance'.so my verdict is, if you like sarah, you should like this cd. buy it buy it buy it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"Wonderful!

I have to tell you -- it is BEAUTIFUL. I especially love Angel... sooo soothing and peaceful. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal!!","review":"I've had this CD for a few months now, and I still can't get over it. Surfacing is INCREDIBLE. There is not a bad song on here. Every one of the numbers just grabs you from the first note. All the songs are original, and it seduces you right from Building a Mystery. She shows incredible talent and artistry throughout the whole album. Her unique, and extremely creative use of vocals and instrumentation is really amazing.If you like this CD, you may want to try Fumbling Towards Ecstacy, which is another Sarah McGlachlan masterpeice."},{"rating":"1","title":"She needs new material","review":"How long has Sarah been plugging these songs? She seriously needs some new material. Why purchase the album when practically every song is a single? As for the actual songs, all of them sound the same and are rather depressing. Not what I expected at all... I would rather get my teeth drilled then listen to the whole song. Every time I hear any song by her on the radio I cringe and Gag. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"My best friend was right about \\"Surfacing\\"","review":"My best friend made me sit down one night and listen to Sarah McLachan's \\"Surfacing\\". I'm glad that she did. \\"Surfacing\\" has a consistant type of sound but every song doesn't sound the same. You can tell by listening to the lyrics that every song was written by taking an overflow of a certain emotion and adding a mix of strings and rhythm instruments that sets the mood intended. If you just sit back, close your eyes and listen to the whole album, you can literally feel the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undescribable","review":"This has been one of the best C.D.s I have ever listened to in my life. Sarah really puts a lot of soul into her music. You can tell she was inspired when she sang this music. Angel is a song that is uncomparable to any I've heard. It really touches the heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely satisfying","review":"Those who rate this CD as a 3 or 4 are nuts! This CD was refreshing, with lyrics, vocals, and music to touch the heart and soul. I especially loved the track \\"Angel\\" and listen to it over and over again. Sarah McLachlan put blood, sweat, and tears into the creation of this CD, and you can tell. It is the most articulate, intelligent, and meaningful release I have listened to in years. I am a convert to Sarah McLachlan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah Surfaces","review":"After the success of her breakthrough 1993 album, \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy,\\" and the lengthy tour that followed it, Sarah McLachlan took a couple of years off from the music biz before resurfacing in a big, BIG way with 1997's \\"Surfacing,\\" which became her biggest-selling album to date. Sarah's masterful blending of pop, rock, and folk continues to work it's magic on \\"Surfacing,\\" on such Sarah classics as the soft rockers \\"Building A Mystery\\" and \\"Sweet Surrender,\\" and the absolutely gorgeous songs \\"Adia,\\" \\"Angel,\\" and \\"Full Of Grace.\\" And even though it wasn't released as a single, \\"Black & White,\\" the most rhythmic, atmospheric piece on the album, is my personal favorite from \\"Surfacing.\\" It's a tremendous song, the album's secret weapon. But ALL of the songs here are quite marvelous, and Sarah's heavenly voice is just as entrancing as ever. Although \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\\" still stands as my favorite album from Sarah, \\"Surfacing\\" is a sparkling beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic!!!!!!!","review":"The best of Sarah. the best of 1997. the best. the best. Now i buy all of her album. Its that great!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah rocks","review":"I love Sarah's music. The first time I listened to her was in the \\"City of angels\\" movie, with the song \\"angel\\". Then I saw one of her concerts on TV. I loved \\"Do what I have to do\\". My sister liked Sarah very much as well, so I bought this CD for her. I own Mirrorball.Recently, she lent me the \\"Surfacing\\" CD. I thought Sarah performed the songs more powerfuly in the concert, but I discovered 2 gems: \\"Last dance\\" and \\"Full of grace\\". I had heard this last one on the radio first, and inmediately loved it.The original versions of \\"Building a mystery\\", \\"Adia\\", \\"I love you\\" and \\"Do what I have to do\\" are great, and the enhaced portion is very good as well. It has an interview and some music videos, plus a quick revision of Sarah's previous albums.In all, this is a fantastic work. Totally worth the money. Buy it now, trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Service","review":"I received my CD in excellent condition.

Will purchase again other items."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for an Angel!","review":"My first experience with this album was on the airing of Buffy the Vampire Slayer's episode \\"Becoming\\", Part 2. Following the scene in which Buffy must slay her vampire lover, Angel, the haunting lyrics of \\"Full of Grace\\" began to play. The depth of pain and dispair portrayed in this song took my breath away. Unfamiliar with either the song or artist, I resolved to track it down on the net. \\"Surfacing\\" is worth all the trouble I took to locate it with such beautifully painted pictures as \\"Building a Mystery\\" and \\"Do What You Have to Do\\". A powerful, emotional experience which I enjoy reliving again and again. Sarah McLachlan is an artist for the ages. All ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"SARAH ROCKS THE WORLD ...","review":"I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM THE DAY IT CAME OUT ... NEED I SAY MORE ?? I ONLY BOUGHT IT BECAUSE I KNEW IT WOULD BE STUNNING ...

There is not a single song on this CD that doesn't leave you feeling truly inspired.

Thanks, AGAIN, Sarah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The mystery is where her talent went!","review":"This CD is at best poor, at least by the high standards that Mrs. Maclachlan has set in the past. There are only two songs on the whole CD that stay true to her roots of creative lyrics and beatiful music, Building a Mystery and Sweet Surrender. The rest of the songs range from poor to average. I will definantly be selling this one to the used CD store as soon as I can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Bland and Boring","review":"I only like 3 of the songs which are \\"Angel,\\" \\"Building a Mystery,\\" and \\"Adia.\\" The rest of this album is extremely bland.

The music didn't do much ;it was just very blase .The lyrics try but didn't succeed; and sarah was trying too hard to be profound ; it backfired. I don't recommend this c.d. buy a Celine Dion c.d. instead you'll be more fulfilled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtakingly Vulnerable","review":"I listened to this CD again today after not listening to it since I bought it in the late '90s. I couldn't just play it once -- I played it three times consecutively. I had forgotten just how it takes your breath away. This CD contains a few songs that were popular on the radio a while back, and those are timeless. But \\"I Love You\\", a hauntingly enchanting song, is one of my favorites. Sung almost entirely in a breathless whisper, it really touches the soul. Not only is Sarah's voice a wonder to listen to, but the words in each song touch a chord somewhere deep inside. She is a master poet, and this comes through in every one of her songs. Because I enjoyed this CD today so much, I ran out and bought one of her former albums. But \\"Surfacing\\" is definitely worth the price, considering the emotions that spill forth from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute perfection","review":"The first that I ever heard of Sarah Mclachlan was when a song of hers was played over the ending credits of the season 2 finale of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

I began searching for an album that had 'Full of Grace' which featured in buffy on it and here it is. I also heard 'Angel' in city of angels and that's such a beautiful song. She is so talented and i'm just glad she's doing something she's good at"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Fumbling Towards Ecstacy","review":"What can I say? Being a huge Sarah fan BEFORE this CD came out, I expected something similar to Fumbling Towards Ecstacy. But this CD finds me a little upset that Sarah has taken this road of pop stardom only to lose the most captivating parts of her music to pop tunes. I think it's kind of sad myself. You should listen to Fumbling Towards Ecstacy or any of her previous stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"too sweet for my tooth","review":"Thank God my sister bought this CD, or I would have been 14 dollars lighter. Sarah McLachlan has a beautiful voice, but her lyrics found me wanting (Why does it seem that lyrics are just an excuse to show off a woman's voice?). For example, \\"I have a smile stretched from ear to ear\\"? That sounds like the diary of a teenybopper. I bought \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\\" later on and found that it was much better than \\"Surfacing\\". Ah, well, it's bad but not as bad as Jewel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching, soulful collection that may be her best work","review":"I was a Sarah fan before this album, but when I heard her perform some of the SURFACING songs at Lilleth Fair, I knew I had to have it. The songs are so deep, which is not unusual for Sarah, but there is a certain relaxing calmness about this CD. What I like best is that each song holds a meaning for her, but also can be listened to and interpreted individually. Or, if you just like to listen to music without trying to find significance, this is a great piece of work for that. In a sentence, it is like beautiful poetry set to a musical background."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly a great record","review":"this CD was released in 1997 and appeared to come out of nowhere in a time when the teen pop craze was going on. It had sophisticated songwriting with great piano and guitar hooks and sarah scored some great hits from this record that were in heavy rotation in 1997 and 1998"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surfacing-Simply Put","review":"I have been a die-hard Sarah fan ever since I heard \\"Out of the Shadows\\" on the cd \\"Touch\\". My ultime favorite Sarah cd is and always will be \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstacy\\"; a cd full of so much depth it seems possible to drown in the mesmerizing voice singing the lyrics. But, like the fan I am, the minute \\"Surfacing\\" came out I was at Sam Goody with twenty dollars in my hand. The most influential tracks on the album are \\"Full of Grace\\" and \\"Adia\\", and while the rest of the cd makes it seem as though Sarah is finally happy, it did disapoint me a little. I hope her new cd draws more from older talent like \\"Possesion\\" and \\"Fear\\". I still loved it though, and Lilith '99 forever Stacy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting dark album","review":"I've been reading lots of the reviews and I find it interesting that so many people can disagree about which albums are McLachlan's best. I think this one is definitely one of the best - it's a great album for playing when you're down and want to wallow in it. It's great for playing in the background during creative endeavors such as painting or sewing. It's also the perfect accompaniment to a long hot bath. The songs are slower and more dark than her other albums', and her haunting voice sings them to perfection. \\"Do What You Have to Do,\\" \\"Full of Grace,\\" and \\"Angel\\" are all gorgeous and depressing. \\"Building a Mystery\\" was great until I heard it on the radio a thousand times, and now I'm kind of sick of it, but for the most part these songs are top-notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"No one is allowed to talk to me when I play this CD","review":"I Love this CD, all fans will get their money's worth. Every single song is worthy. I love that woman's voice and ability to put great instrumental to her lyrics. Sarah, realizes that you don't have to shout to get attention or sing about every life experience. This CD reflects my current life situation and is very touching to me. My 6 year boy loves her music too in fact when I sing the lyrics too loud he tells me to be quite so he can sing them too. It is a very nice place to go. Excellent, I've been listening to this CD continuously since I purchased it last year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every song is great!","review":"I originally purchased this cd for one or two songs that got radio play.

I know I'm pretty young to be into her music but, hey, I'm exposed to lots of stuff and I found her songs as real mood-boosters.

Keep up the good work, Sarah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great album,from a great artist.","review":"This album just gets better and better as u listen to it,the greatest song of all time,Adia,is on this CD and just for that song alone it's worth buying.But even all the other tracks seem absolutely brilliant,I rate this 6 stars out of 5 it's that damn good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep, Beautiful Music.....every song","review":"What lyrics she has! Every song is great, but none tops Full of Grace. So easy to find yourself in at least one of these songs. Sarah has a knack for putting into words, all your best and worst relationships.

My first Sarah album was not a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking...the best Sarah yet","review":"I have to admit that I had never heard of Sarah McLachlan before the Surfacing CD came out. I saw the Fumbling Toward Ecstasy CD at a friend's house and asked her how she liked it. She said that it was a great CD. I went to the store to buy it but saw that her Surfacing CD had been released just a week ago. I decided to buy it even though I had never heard any of the songs on it. I loved it and still do. I have now become a fan and went to her concert last year in Salt Lake City. If you are wanting to hear the best of Sarah, Surfacing is the CD to buy. Building a Mystery and I Love You are two of the best songs but they are all great. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have CD for ANY music lover.","review":"Surfacing is a CD that anyone who enjoys music will like. It is a CD that you will find yourself truly listening to, not just playing as background music. It will make you want to buy a better stereo so you can enjoy all the subtle nuances of Sarah's performance. Sarah McLachlan is one of the few performers today that can sing, not just merely carry a tune; therefore she does not have or need large amounts of sound processing. (ever wonder why some artists sound poor \\"unplugged\\" - well now you know) Sarah's performance is amazing, and will have you entranced from beginning to end. It WILL move you. Buy this CD, you won't regret it; regardless of your normal musical tastes, you find yourself enjoying this CD tremendously."},{"rating":"1","title":"edible pearls","review":"they are MUCH lighter in person almost like they had sat in the sun for along time,a dirty pale pink color.notat all like they looked on the website and so hard that I would be afraid of breaking a tooth on them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Videos Worth Watching!","review":"Fun to watch all the way through...Video List:1.)

This happens because an electrical spike can cause the motor direction to become reversed.

The unit comes with a 5 year warranty. I called the Roland / Boss warranty department for an RMA. Here comes the problem. The 5 year warranty is on parts only. You have to pay for labour at 40 dollars an hour plus shipping and handling both ways. So if they take 2 hours to fix the unit and add 20 dollars for shipping both ways, I would be paying 100 dollars under warranty to fix a unit that costs about that new.If you are contemplating buying a DD3, keep in mind that the supposed 5-year warranty only covers parts after the first 90 days and is in my opinion therefore worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does the job at a great price","review":"If you want simple delay and you don't need stereo outputs, this is the best pedal for your money--simple, solid, and virtually noiseless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure After Infrequent Use","review":"I bought this about two years ago and then put it away as I didn't have a use for it.

However, I was immediately surprised by Mandela's clear and concise style and his immense humanity. Mandela gives credit to those who deserve it and criticizes in a measured way those who opposed him. His exposition of what apartheid was and of the details of his struggle along with other black and white South Africans is, in many ways, heartwrenching, but--in part because one knows the outcome--one never loses hope.

If you want to learn more about the man Mandela from the point of view of the millions so called oppressed people in South Africa, then this is it. It gives a very subjective view of the situation as it was at that time in history, but describes the man Mandela as the world sees and expects to see him - the smiling saviour of the South African Black people. The fact that he wanted to achieve his goals with terrorism and crime and that people still suffer today, after the creation of the so called democratic South Africa, because of his legacy of violence is discussed nowhere in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I was rather disgusted with this book.

Even if he hasn't got a current book out at the time, there's always that overpowering name of his. I think a lot of readers get into a Saul book and expect to be completely floored, and if the book is good, they write a crappy review because it didn't blow their mind like a King epic.This was a good first book. The first half seemed as though Saul was a little slow finding the story, but the last half of this book was very good. Remember this is the guy who wrote Nathaniel, The Manhattan Hunt Club, and Presence, just to name a few great reads.Spooky children, a cave that is presumed to be the gate to hell, a haunting family curse, all the elements of a great Saul outing are in place.

To me it seemed as though Saul's deadline was up and he just wrapped it up. I've heard such great things about his writing that I decided to read another of his books....Punish The Sinners.....and wouldn't you know he did it again.

If I had, I might not have bothered to read any of his others. Suffer the Children is not a good book. The book's storyline centers around a legend about an old woman who slept and dreamed for two days and two nights. Her dreams told her who was going to die and how including deaths involved with a mysterious cave. Saul never really expands on the legend to help the reader to understand why the evil has returned to Port Arbello. He throws into the mix a Ouija Board and a portrait of a little girl, but once again, doesn't bother to connect it all up. My advice, try one of Saul's later books. Their much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror, Terribly Depressing","review":"This book was awful! The writing was very well done, but the plot was terrible. I really hated this book and it's the last one I read by John Saul. This one really did me in. It is about the occult and family curses and a Ouija board. It definitely made an impression on me. It's about the Conger family curse. Their youngest daughter, Sarah, was looked on as being mentally ill simply because she had been so traumatized she couldn't talk; when really, the older daughter, Elizabeth, was the one that belonged in the Looney bin. She killed three kids and her pet cat and played tea party with them and a skeleton in a cave shaft. Sarah saw everything she did but couldn't talk so tried in other ways to tell her parents what was going on but they didn't get it and blamed her for things. Sarah was institutionalized for 15 years!

However, his work sells like hotcakes and makes him a lot of money. This bad writer is the reincarnation of the first one I described.

My final word on this is, the book has plot holes so wide you could hide mack trucks in them.I couldn't identify with the characters either and I think that's an important element of any story.Saul I think you ran out of steam one quarter of the way into the book and rushed it off to meet your deadline.

I wasn't expecting something as perfectly manicured as what is shown in the picture but I definitely wasn't expecting the Hackjob that arrived on my doorstep. It looked like it someone had just lopped off about a foot in order for it to fit in the box... I just got it an hour ago and I'm seriously debating returning it because I don't know if I have it in my to make this look like anything other than a diseased, half-dead stick with some leaves glued on.The trunk is very straight which is nice, and even with the free shipping it still arrived with moist soil.

I would have liked some written instructions about the tree rather than a recommendation to call the seller. I was also not sure whether the tree was dormant and was perhaps supposed to look the way it does (in December.) I'm still hoping it may revive, so I'm hanging on to it.

First off when opening the box the pot was in pieces. I can understand that this happens, but the plant was in horrible condition. It looked like nothing in the picture. I understand that this was not the same tree but it was apparent that the grower just lopped off the top of the tree and grew it like a plant. It looks horrible. My roommate was against me displaying it in our living room because of the crappy look it has. I was so disapointed I am an avid collector of bonsai trees and it will take years for this bush to look like a tree again. I contacted lou who told me he was going to reship but that never happened.

This is a short, easy-to-read book. Included in its 32 pages are a glossary, a short list of relevant Web sites, and an index. A map of the caimans' range puts the subject in geographic perspective.The clear text delivers the facts effectively, and is well complemented by a rich assortment of crisp, full-color photographs. There are even a couple of photos of cute baby caimans. The text covers the basics: anatomy, how they hunt and eat, life cycle, and different species of caiman. Overall, an informative and visually enjoyable book for young readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"great photos and minimum text","review":"Extremely good reference book with lots of photos of well designed spaces.

Before buying, I checked several sites for the size, but nothing was listed anywhere (that should have been my clue). I need these for headaches and the back of my neck. Because they are so small, they do not stay cold, maybe 5 minutes on either side. I haven't used them warm, but I imagine the same would be true. I ordered 2, and by the time they added tax and shipping it was $38 for basically 2 worthless little beanbags. I bought one years ago that was twice as wide as these and was filled with cloves and spices. It was the best product I've ever used. Stayed cold for approx. 45 to 50 minutes. Have never been able to replace it with anything remotely close. But -- I'll keep trying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond a flat wall","review":"This is a fascinating book that brings to life the evidence that is not only clear but fairly undeniable. One only has to look at the prophecy in Ezekial 38 and 39 to see that God certainly uses the \\"weather\\" to shake things up and put an end to anti-semitic/anti-Israeli behavior. It is very easy for a third or fourth party to say to someone 'give your land up to your certain enemy', especially when the third party has no vested interest. The blessed hope in the Faith and in this book is that one doesn't have to be a certain type of scholar to comprehend basic truth. They must simply look beyond a flat wall and see a vision of detailed structure. This book makes that very easy to accomplish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye to Eye is Certainly an Eye Opener","review":"This book follows the history of Israel and the effects of this history on various nations and their leaders.

In fact, I suspect the author may have been paid by the word...Unfortunately, it is not very cohesive. He makes a good case that bad things happen in the world, and that Israel negotiates often with US involvement, but I do not think he ties the two together into any sort of causal relationship, which is what the book promises. Just because two phenomena occur does not mean they are related to each other. I was hoping it could clearly make such an argument, and wanted him to succeed, since I know people who recommended this book.

For me, this book is symbolic of this phenomenon.The logic behind this book is no different than that of reading tarrot cards or one's astrological sign. It's a way to figure out that something is what you want it to be.Read a book on the historical perspective on Christian Zionism and Pre-millennial dispensationalism before digging into this kind of thought.A readable alternative if you're intersted in End-time events or the connections of world events with religion, try \\"Rapture, Revelation, and the End Times\\" By Forbes and Kilde."},{"rating":"1","title":"a reader in NJ","review":"What a nut.The author apparently never studied logic or theology. If he studied logic, he would know what a post hoc fallacy is. He makes many of them. With the logic the author employs he can say that the Titanic was sunk because the people on board were evil. Then pull something else out of the air and attach devine intervention to it. This guy no doubt believes all that he wrote. What is frieghtening is that he may convince others that he is right.

Sometimes is fires continuously on semi-auto. Sometimes the range drops to under 10 feet. The clips are faulty and the gun is cheaply made.

The silencer was built wrong, but the company is sending me a brand new one, will update if that doesn't happen. Only fired once, no issues firing it, didn't seem too accurate but I have not adjusted the HOP Up yet or gotten the new 'silencer' (that is supposed to make it more accurate).

Once, I was shooting in automatic normally(this happened 3 weeks after I bought the gun).Later, when I was running out of ammo, I don't know how, the trigger of the gun went out flying but that wasn't the problem because if it would, I would just need to open the gun and put the trigger in it's place.

Cleaned the bb's but the trigger feels bad or broken and it still won't fire. The gun looks cool, but the laser scope is not very functional and more of a gimmick. Seems like the battery compartment was an afterthough because when removing the hand guard to get to the battery the battery or battey cord easily gets caught and you need to mess with it.

Lest that sound smarmy or banal-chummy, I hasten to add she is also an intelligent author.

The Reutbe sonata is a true revelation, that explores new horizons of expression. In many ways Reubke, Tausig and Burgmuller are the most dramatically painful composers that passed away unfairly early and who would have added the Romantic movement both new breadth and perspectives.Earnestly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally fresh and exciting everytime!","review":"I would bet anything that Faust were fans of Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica. The Faust Tapes is a less coherent, but equally engaging and more forboding mix of quirky grooves and jarring caustic ambience.

No argument from me. It's quite enjoyable, progressive and innovating to say the least.

I just had to get it! Not surprisingly, several of the tracks on here sound synthesized, as if someone performed a whole orchestra on an electronic piano. But, I need to give it credit-- for the most part, MOST of the tracks are actually played by a symphonic orchestra. There's even a literal *LIVE* track thrown in somewhere near the end of the album, complete with a real clapping audience! (I haven't listened to it in a while, but seeing this album actually get reviews pushed me to write one myself!)So, yes. The album pretty much sounds as it looks. It's an identity-confused mix of synthesized, studio-recorded, and live tracks.

However, the writing is poor and the author rushes through parts of the story that leaves the reader with more questions than answers. It is written by a professional journalist and not a novelist, so it reads like a newspaper article, which can be highly condensed for space. I would recommend the predator's ball. It is a much better account. And if you are interested in what Micheal Milken is up to these days check out The Milken Institute. The guy is still a billionaire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!

Now, in 2009, I finally picked up his book on the subject, and I found that it's every bit as fascinating, and every bit as relevant, as it was when the scandal first broke. This is the story of Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky and the other crooks who believed that \\"greed is good\\" and the SEC is for sissies. In the age of Madoff, mortgage-backed securities, and other financial frauds and schemes, the book is a good reminder that there's nothing new under the sun.I recommend this book for anyone interested in financial fraud. That really ought to be just about everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insider trading expose","review":"An expose of the 1980's insider trading scandals on Wall Street and how they came to be. The story is focused around the rise and fall of Michael Milken, Dennis Levine, Ivan Boesky and many others who have invented and popularized the concepts of junk bonds and leveraged buyouts (LBO). The schemes and transactions were extremely elaborate and complex, involving many people and touching virtually every investment house on Wall Street - so while it's easy to focus on the main perpetrators, it is the general pattern how this came to be that I found the most interesting.The book offers a lot of detail, names, and captures the spirit of the times. Given the complexity of all the transactions and the number of people involved, I'm sure many of the facts can and have been disputed, but nonetheless, this is a piece of Wall Street economic history everyone should be familiar with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"'Den of Thieves' was sewn together by James Stewart from numerous Wall Street Journal articles he wrote on the M&A; scandals during he 80s -- and it shows. The story is very difficult to follow, not only because the fraud was so complex, but also there were numerous players; Stewart doesn't do himself any favors by jumping around a lot. Still, it was very interesting and the second half of the book, marked by Boesky's surrender to federal agents in September 1986, is nothing short of riveting! If you enjoy Kurt Eichenwald ('Conspiracy of Fools') or Bethany McLean ('Smartest Guys in the Room') you will like 'Den of Thieves' -- although probably not as much.Next release I suggest Stewart lay out all the Drexel, Peabody, and Boesky deals in chronological order at the beginning. The cast of players at the front was helpful, but not enough for me to keep up with some of it. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overview of Wall Street and the big scandals","review":"Good overview of Wall Street and the big scandals.

Stewart creates a regaling story for the reader with a compelling narrative of the 1980's Wall Street era of greed and glory.Stewart takes the reader into the lives of the big players on the Wall Street court at the time: Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky, and Martin Siegel among many others. In great detail, Stewart provides the full story of the insider trading scandal that nearly destroyed Wall Street. Stewart also shows how these \\"players\\" created a series of security scams that made legitimate trading pale in comparison.Equally as intriguing is the story of the SEC detectives that brought the rampant illegal trading to a screeching halt. Not a detail is spared: The lawyers on both sides. The trials. Judge Kimba Wood! This is as close to the real thing as it gets. A great story from a masterful bard! I rate this book at five stars. Destined to be a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall great - could use more pictures though....","review":"I assume readers who read this book would typically read more than the pre-school picture books. But I think for this book, in particular, it could be more useful if the author added more pictures/photographs of the various characters introduced. Main characters (Milken, Siegel, Boesky, etc) were there. The book, however, introduces a new character almost every 2 pages; this makes it somewhat difficult to identify who's who after a while. More pictures would be nice.Overall, this is an excellent book with great details to how high finance and insider trading worked back in the 1980s. A definite must read for undergrad students who want to make it in the finacial industry -- the books that you read tell something about your character."},{"rating":"1","title":"lots of facts, little story","review":"James Stewart has done an excellent job of gathering information about the insider-trading scandal of the 1980s, so if you're looking for all the details of these events, you'll find them in this book, which is clearly-written and well-organized. What you won't find, though, is great storytelling. Stewart is content to recount one fact after another, rarely putting them in context or using them to build narrative suspense or to reveal character. As a result--and despite the inherent drama of the events it lists--the book is a rather dull read, especially for readers who have no familiarity with the world of high finance. If you want to read a masterpiece of writing about business, try David Halberstam's \\"The Reckoning.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"biased hatchet job","review":"DEN OF THIEVES is a biased hatchet job against financial genius Michael Milken--a man who was a powerful force for good in American business and is, at most, guilty of the moral equivalent of jaywalking.

It reads like a gripping tale of fiction, since most of the facts are invented, especially of Michael Milken. Stewart's naive understanding of high-yield debt financing and the very concept of leverage renders this book a mere gripe session for the author. His mathematics are innacurate and the emotionalism is copious.Although currently out of print, I suggest Daniel Fischel's \\"Payback: The Conspiracy to Destroy Michael Milken and his Financial Revolution.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Journalistic Self-Promotion---Revisited","review":"I read this book when it first came out in the early 90s, the summer before entering business school. At the time I thought, like many who had recommended the book, that it was a first rate piece of journalism based on sound, unbiased research.I have since learned that this book is nothing of the sort. In fact, it is a summary of one erroneous conclusion after another, based upon faulty, incorrect, hearsay 'evidence' and a wanton disregard for the truth. Moreover, I now believe that such poor authorship can mean only one thing--that Mr. Stewart was never out to reveal the truth, but instead, to make a name for himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful and biased","review":"\\"Den of Thieves\\" is an angry get-back at Michael Milken a man who redesigned business financing and got rid of a system on Wall Sreet that was ineffective and poorly thought out.

This book is a disgrace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb account","review":"The great writing skills of James B Stewart can be enjoyed in all of his books and certainly also in this one. He book reads almost like a thriller, but it is always clear that Stewarts has his facts right and well documented and got the criminals dead to rights.The book is structured as the first part being seen from the side of Boesky, Milken etc and the second part from the law enforcement, which is another feature that makes it very exiting to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"A superlative tale, all the more so because it is true.

It's a mirror image of the fictionalized tale \\"The Bombadiers\\", which came out a few years ago. It also reminds me of a joke that used to go around the circuit - it went something like, Whats the difference between Tasmania and Goldman, Sachs? The answer, One is a country that earns $2.0 billion a year and shares it with 25 million people.

Some of the sections seem rushed and unfinished. I also really couldn't clearly find a way to combine the info into a complete, cohesive approach.Based upon the lack of other books on this subject, I can see where she may have struggled to compile the info because these aren't easily understood subjects.

The album then continues with classic sounding songs with superb vocals and excellent guitar licks. Musicians include Diblo Dibala, Syren Mabenza, Lokossa, Zaiko Langa, et al. The album never tapers, instead it only gets better at the end... throw in a \\"Yesu Christu\\" (Kanda Bongo Man) and Ponce-Pilate (Tabu Ley) and you have one incredible all-encompasing album.

It provides a platform for me to ask myself who I am and what should I do.The express is straightforward. Delia Grinstead, main character, tried to figure out what her identity is. She tried to change her dress and her manner. What's more, she changed her role from a wife and a 3-child mother to a secretary working in another place. While reading the book, I asked myself, \\"Am I satisfied with present life?\\", \\"What can I do if I want to make life better?\\", \\"Do I need do the same as Delia did?\\" At the end of the novel, Delia found her identity, but I still cannot find mine.Nevertheless, the book let me think my situation further, and hopefully, I can find my identity at last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow but Good","review":"Anne Tyler picked a good plot, but I wish she could have moved it in a little faster pace, which I seem to gather other reviewers feel the same.Many of us have stated that we can relate to and sympathize with the main character Delia, but do we really respect her? Another difficult aspect of the book is that there were so many different characters that I started getting them all mixed up. Tyler need to make it more specific who the main characters are. I think it is neat how Tyler pattern her book after KING LEAR. However, I did not like the ending. I felt there needed to be more closure between Delia and Adrian, Delia and Joel and Noah, and a more definite outcome between Delia and Sam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking a Trip Through Time","review":"Delia Grinstead never had much experience in life. She went from \\"her father's house to her husband's house\\" (actually, the same house!), without pursuing an independant life; even her secreterial work was connected to her father's/husband's medical practice. Delia decides to live her life over again, first by pursuing a man who reminds her of her only teenage boyfriend, then by travelling to a town that at first glace seems to be preserved from the early twentieth century. As her personal life proceeds, so does the \\"age\\" of the town and her various attempts at change, moving forward from an idealic past to a flawed present and future. Delia is forced to take notice of the true nature of her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacked Something","review":"It has been difficult for me to even decide if I enjoyed Ladder of Years. Yes, I kept turning the pages to see what would happen next, but that was the only reason I kept turning the pages. I felt that the book lacked something that I still cannot put my finger on. It is not the best book I've ever read, but not the worst. I could not fully figure out what Delia's intentions were for leaving her family, so I was never able to figure out if I personally could excuse her actions. I feel that Ms. Tyler could have gave the main character more emotional depth and not kept the reader guessing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delia still needs to get a life!!!!","review":"Just finished this book and I just remembered why I usually don't read fiction. Delia, honey, everyone feels overlooked and unappreciated from time to time. Walk out for 18 months and then come back like nothing ever happened; ooooooooohh that'll show'em! Except for having the moxie to walk off the beach, Delia was about as interesting as paste. If Anne Tyler's objective was to get me to the end of the book she did the job. I kept reading hoping and praying Delia would \\"find herself\\" somehow. As an avid reader I don't require a neatly, summed up happy ending to any book; I just require an ending worth reading.

As a daughter there is no way I would have NOT put up a fight to get my mother back if she walked away like that. I had no sympathy or understanding for any of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delia's great adventure certainly doesn't teach her much.","review":"Delia leaves for almost a year and walks right back into the same crap. She is totally inconsiderate and mindless in her leaving of two families; first her husband and spoiled children, and secondly Joel and Noah who come to love and attach to her. I've read many of Anne Tyler's books and I'm starting to wonder why. Her female characters are always confused and weak. Somehow, I expect better of female characters. The only lesson Delia ultimately learned was how to become a better \\"doormat\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book/Great Read","review":"Boy, did this book generate a lot of discussion in my book club! I thought it was wonderfully humorous, like all of Ann Tyler's books, but absolutely sad at the same time. I think Delia just got fed up with being ignored and had sort of a minor breakdown. What mother hasn't fantasized about going off and teaching them all a lesson?! I think that at the end she did go back to them and that things would absolutely be different. I also loved her children and felt very sad for the father and son she had been caring for, but she belonged with her own family. She had helped them over a rough period in their lives and even though they had come to depend on her, they are going to be fine. I enjoyed this book so much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the WORST books I've ever read","review":"I really liked the premise of this book. Underappreciated housewife walks away from it all. But, it went no where from there. Delia, the wife and mother who walks away, was as hollow and unbelievable as any character I've ever read. Tyler failed to explore emotions of relief, guilt, doubt or any other feeling one might have in that situation. This 300+ page novel does nothing more than amble along a sleepy town where Delia goes about her new daily life without so much as a touch of introspection. The ending was terrible. I put down this book hating Delia, her family and quite frankly the author. This is my first Tyler book and would be my last but I already purchased A Patchwork Planet. That book couldn't be any worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"Another mid-life crisis goes wrong book. The plot is implausible, most of the characters are not fully developed, and you finish the book wishing for a better ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"When beginning Ladder of Years I was expecting an exciting and interesting story, but that was not what I ended up with. I really liked the beginning of the book but then there was no action. It seemed to drag on with little storyline. I was expecting that Delia would do something exciting or adventerous, but she never really did. I was disappointed with how little her character actually did while she was away. I don't think she was a changed person after leaving. I can relate to her actions and feelings but I don't think she accomplished anything while away. It was to easy for her to fit back into the same role as before. I would have liked to see the story end differently, perhaps more action from Sam. However I really did like the many metaphors throughout the story. I am able to appreciate the story for that but I did not find it to have enough action and to much detail that dragged on for to long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banal at best","review":"While the book was an easy read, I found Delia hard to like. Her character throughout the entire book was very self-absorbed. When her son came to visit her, she didn't act thrilled, she acted like it was just another day with him, and carrying on with life as usual.When she was with her husband she was the doormat wife, but she swung too far in the other direction when she left, not caring a smidgeon for the ones she left behind.When she returned for her daughter's wedding, she just walked in and took her place and life carried on as if she had not spent the last 18 months of her life away from her marriage and children. She just went ahead and made her family's favorite dishes.The ending just seemed thrown together, and left it vague which life she returned to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Female empowerment? I don't think so!","review":"Anne Tyler's Ladder of Years started out with good intentions. I feel that they were lost somewhere along the way. At the end, those intentions were totally out the window. I was given the impression that the character, Delia, was going to be a strong female role model. She was someone who left her unhappy life in pursuit of her own happiness. And I was proud of her when she did eventually leave, though I would have liked her to be more exciting about it! But my pride went away quickly when I realized how wishy-washy she turned out to be. The ending to the novel left a lot to be desired. Much as Jackie from WI stated in a previous post, the ending just left me kind of baffled. What I thought was going to be a good example of a strong female character just ended up being a good example of what a strong female character ISN'T."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wimpy Character","review":"At first I thought that I liked this book, but by the end I disliked the main character very much.

Nasty nasty woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delia inspired me to want to walk away.","review":"Delia Grinstead still has not found herself at forty, so in an effort to start from scratch,she leaves her husband and children without a word during a family vacation. She then, unknowingly, relocates and before she knows it her identity is Miss Grinstead in a small town called Bay Borough. The beginnging of the novel was very intriguing when she starts feeling invisible and meets Adrian Bly-Brice. As the novel progresses it seems to repeat itself, especially when she becomes a nanny to a man and his young boy. The ending also disheartened me because I had the feeling Delia was being thrown back to the life she had grown to hate. All in all a very well written novel that held my attention through the entire experience. I felt like I was Delia, I laughed and cried with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book with a few errors","review":"I am 16 years old and I have just finished reading the Ladder of Years and everyone's reviews. I was shocked that so many people were okay with the ending of that book. I thought that the book was great but the ending left me with an angry feeling as to why Delia would do what she did. It made me dislike her character and realize that all she will ever be is a doormat for her unappreciative family. She could have been happy with Joel and Noah who loved and would have treated her great as they did when she lived there. I was dissapointed in her character but thought that the rest of the book was great. Thankyou.

I've read five of her books, and liked Patchwork Planet best, but even that, sweet as it was...well, I do not think that Ann Tyler writes \\"beautifully.\\" She writes ploddingly. Yes, her writing leads you on. You keep hoping the next sentences will actually lead to something important in the plot or character development. Ho-hum. They don't.In reference to this book: what is the point of going from the archetype of MOM and WIFE to SECRETARY? Now, if I were writing this book I would have plunged Delia back into another life...made it more \\"Twilight Zone\\"-like. That would have added at least a soupcon of spice...as it is, \\"Ladder\\" is flat, unsalted, dietetic, in short, not tasty. All those who enjoy a taste-less book, raise your hands. Deafening silence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I got to the end of this book wondering why I had got there. It can't have been totally terrible or I would have given up before the end, but it left me with nothing much. The story is about a woman (who happens to be a wife and mother) who on impulse walks away from her life for a year or so and does something else. A \\"finding oneself\\" story? Maybe. A story of establishing that the grass is not really greener anywhere else? Maybe. It is slightly dull, probably by design, and I think one reason I kept reading was because there had to be more, right?.... So the denouement (a damp squib), coupled with a number of loose threads left untied, made me feel the whole experience was an unsatisfying one. Shame. \\"The Accidental Tourist\\" was an excellent book, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that strikes a chord...","review":"\\"Ladder of Years\\" is like a beautifully orchestrated symphony with Anne Tyler as the conductor. Every aspect of the novel is carefully thought out. The first sentence of the book will capture your attention, \\"Baltimore Woman Disappears During Family Vacation.\\" From this moment on, you will either want to encourage the \\"missing\\" woman, Delia, or you will want to berate her. Whatever your reaction, \\"Ladder of Years\\" will strike a chord.Anne Tyler plays with themes; they inundate the pages. You can read this book over and over again, with each reading, you will discover something new. The various patterns of fairy tales, of cats, and of Delia's self awareness all enrich the text.I encourage you to read this intricately fashioned novel. It will stimulate your mind and encourage you to feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"choices","review":"I believe this novel is expressive of the feelings many people go through, both male and female. It is the choices that we make each day that can enhance or tear apart our family bonds. This book has made me realize the value of commitment, work, and communication in \\"real-world\\" relationships. Walking away will not fix your problems, only prolong them. The love and support of family is one that no other relationship can overcome...Blood is thicker than water, and yet Delia still choose to leave. I hope that other readers are able to see the consequences of leaving children and a family that depend on you on more than a physical presence, but a emotional presence as well (even when emotions and appreciation are not expressed as you would like them to be). The effects the children will endure will last a lifetime for that short time Delia took for herself. The end of the novel seemed as though she was able to just \\"climb\\" back into her old lifestyle; it's just not that easy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong intentions, but weak in the end...","review":"I must admit I was definately disappointed with this book. My initial reaction was thinking that the book would be exciting and that she would be a strong woman, but I feel as though I was let down by the ending. The first page gives a missing woman discription which sparked my interest right away, but then as I read on there was no real missing woman at all. In fact she up and leaves everything to start a new life for herself. That idea sounded good until I realized she was still unhappy and falling back into a lot of the same patterns that she was so unhappy in at home. I really expected more out of this book. I read this for a class so I am not sure now what to think about Anne Tyler. I am debating trying to read another one of her books, hoping for a strong female character, and some action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Sorry, but I found this book a total waste of time.

It was just so unbelievable a woman would leave her children without any thought really - and to continue this \\"new\\" life without really taking time to search her soul. Instead she befriends even more boring people than herself.As far as the ending of the book goes - I couldn't have cared less what happened to her anyway!

After being convinced to read this book by the positive reviews, I expected it to have at least some literary promise. Instead, I find ridiculous dialogue, a protagonist who is totally unforgettable, and a potentially promising plot that wasn't fleshed out in an interesting way. Nothing this protagonist does or says rings true; she's schizoid and odd, but not in a compelling way. Only in an insipid way. And the episodes she encounters, (e.g. the bleeding cut to her head that necessitated a doctor visit, while chatting aimlessly with the mother of her babysitting charge) were totally uninteresting. I could handle all that, but the insult that added to this injury of a book is that the prose could have been written by a high school freshman. I would have liked Anita Shreve to have taken this story and done something marvelous with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ladder of Years - Review","review":"Ladder of Years focuses on the liberty progression of a sheltered wife and mother, Delia who ultimately ventures into a new world. Initially, I was intrigued by the character of Delia as she appeared to be a risk taker. She was willing to act as a stranger's wife and venture into a new world. However, this only appears to be an illusion considering that she is really only trying to be this type of person - it is all a facade! Her relationships with her family are primary examples of how she continues to keep her true self-bottled up inside. She never conveys her true feelings to anyone EVER!!! For instance, she mentions to her son after coming home from the shopping mall, \\"The funniest thing, Caroll\\", Her son continues to ignore her and she does nothing to defend herself. This indefensible behavior never ceases to exist. She settles for complancency, choosing not to change from her existing state! I guess she got stuck on the lower half of the ladder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I did think I would enjoy this book as Anne Tyler was recommended to me.

I could understand how the main character felt marginalized in her life, and to some extent how she could make the decisions she made, but she just seemed to lack depth. In a story that was mostly about stepping out of her life and creating a new one, this character seemed to shrink and lose depth when it seemed she should be growing. To me the main character was difficult to identify with, and I found her choices often disappointing. I've found Anne Tyler's other novels to have odd characters that were often nothing like me, but I could still identify with them on some level. There are many other Anne Tyler books that should be read before (or instead of) reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anachronistic Mess","review":"As standard chick-lit/beach read, one baby step above romance novels, this book is okay. But I spent most of the book trying to figure out when it was set. The descriptions of clothing ranged from 1960's to 1980's, but suddenly there was a desktop printer and CD's. Superficial complaint? Maybe, but over-long descriptions of clothing and decor are a classic element of the genre, and I couldn't get a clear mental picture at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat characters, implausible plot","review":"It just occurred to me that maybe Delia's family didn't care that she left because they didn't notice.

Adrian's mother-in-law breaking into their house during supper? The grandfather and his new wife... Binky. Becoming friends with Noah's mother. The romance of Mr. Lamb and Belle.

A occasional good turn of a phrase does not make a great author! Ladder of Years...this plot is weak, the characterizations shallow, the ending implausible, the dialogue tedious. I only finished reading it because it was an assignment for our book club. All this business about Tyler writing about a slice of life... it isn't a slice of anybody's life I could imagine.

The concept of a unfulfilled wife and mother deserting her grown family has promise- but Tyler's carelessly written novel finally leaves her readers unfulfilled. The book hurtles toward a totally unsatisfactory ending with the heroine Delia Grinstead reassuming her \\"rightful\\" position in the midst of her family with seamless integration. There is virtually no discussion of her departure nor any attempt to deal with the issues which caused her to behave so uncoventionally. If the characters in books were to have afterlives, one can imagine that Delia's life would remain unchanged, while the people whom she encountered and befriended during her hiatus would feel used and abandoned.

He claims she flipped out when he dumped her.Well, I met her co-star and friend Mark Goddard a few years ago, and, with some prodding, he flatly stated that Marta never dated Ward and that his opinion of the 'Boy Wonder' was low indeed.Ward also claims to have viewed a screen test of Lyle Waggoner audioning for BATMAN, and that Ward recognized LW from the Carol Burnett show. Only problem there is that Lyle had yet to join Korman, Burnett et al. at the time BATMAN was in preproduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This book was totally self-serving. Clearly Burt juiced up all the details in a vain effort to sell more books. Don't waste your time reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much for inspiration.","review":"I had a deep admiration for many of Mr. Ward's accomplishments prior to reading his autobiography. In a town where you are willing to sell your soul for a nickel just to get your infamous fifteen minutes of fame he managed to come up from under the shadow after failing to find another acting job. Instead of wallowing in self-pity like most young actors during his time he coped by re-inventing himself into an entrepreneur. This is the inspirational story I was hoping for. Instead all we got was sex, sex and nothing but sex. Lot of his stories seemed sadly exaggerated. As for the editor, Ross didn't bother gathering his friend's stories in any kind of chronilogical order. Often times I wondered what era this chapter took place: pre-Batman days, during or post-Batman? Unless you have a mind of hormonal adolescent, teenaged boy save your money for something worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self promoting tell nothing.","review":"Published by a company that Burt Ward owns (with good cause... no one in their right mind would touch this), Burt tells us how he was an honor role student, best chess player in his school, and speed reads 30,000 words a minute. He later describes how he was Bruce Lee's equal in the martial arts and how the nasty Batman producers kept him from playing the title role in The Graduate, leaving the role open for Dustin Hoffman. What he does not tell us is how such a great actor as he seems to feel that he is, spent the next thirty years making a living shaking hands at car lots.He does tell us that he got laid a lot. Not as much detail is spent discussing the un-named compainons though as tales as to how large his organ is, and how many orgasms he was able to bring them to on a regular basis.Funny thing about the book. He never discusses any friends. Upon reading the book it is apparent as to why. It is hard to imagine him having any."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Smut, Not Enough Substance","review":"I'm a big fan of private parts, but 300 pages of Burt Ward bragging about his and denigrating Adam West's is tedious (especially since a viewing of the show suggests that Frank Gorshin's Riddler could easily tower over both). Burt, put the ruler away and tell us about your life: what it was like to be the Boy Wonder, to work with some of the biggest stars on television, to rise to the stratosphere as a pop culture icon in the 1960's and then crash and burn in the 1970's. That story would be fascinating; sexcapades with starlets are just sleazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Moly, Somebody Put His Bat Back In The Cave!","review":"After reading the first few pages of this book, it seemed like it was going to be an inspirational story of Burt Ward's struggle to success in one of the most beloved TV comedies of all time. Instead, I was brought into a somewhat funny (if not exaggerated) tell-all. At times it was charming, funny, and clever (for example, the stories about his first wife, apperances at schools, and one heck of a chapter on Julie Newmar) ...but in other moments it would go into sleazy, trashy, and VERY over-exaggerated nonsense (referring to yourself as a mock 'Super Stud Porn King' leaves a bad taste in anyones mouth).Buy it if you are a die hard Batman fan, or if you didn't grow up on the show...but if your only memories are of good natured fun on a clever TV show...read Adam West's \\"Back To The Batcave\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs","review":"A shallow, self-promoting work. While Adam West discussed his Batman role with dignity in \\"Back to the Batcave,\\" it is a shame that Burt Ward did not do the same. Instead, he chose to harp on his putative accomplishments and sexual exploits, which left a foul taste in this reader's mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Piece of ... Batman!","review":"This is, without a doubt, the worst book that I have ever read.The one conclusion that I drew from the book was that, in real life, Robin is a ... loser. I would have thought that he had an interesting life. I was wrong. What is so sad is that he puffs up himself all through the book, but then he slams almost every person that he ever knew. I think the only exception to that is he speaks well of his kids and his current wife. Of course, he ought to speak well of her because she is his sugar daddy - without her money he would be a poor man, as he has no talent, no scruples and no life.Please, don't read this book.

This album needs 3 or 4 listens to truly appreciate how excellent the playing and compositions are. It is a master piece but as I said may take some getting used to. It will be well worthwhile however to persevere if you are not sure the first time as it gets better and better each listen.

Spiritualized put out a monumental record sporting collaborations with tens of musicians ranging from Dr. John (which plays the piano if I remenber well on one track) to the London Community gospel choir. Spiritualited formed from the ashes of Spacemen 3 and they kept the very same trademark sound: \\"hypnotic headphone symphonies\\" as someone called them which means basically that they're into neo-psychedelia. Someone pointed out that the record tends to get a bit monotonous but that's just because of its being psychedelic! How would you reach the entrancement otherwise ? ;-) Don't mind those fools and buy it! I guess it's a bit like taking drugs, only you don't have the unpleasant backwards (but they too are addictive...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Beautiful, amazing,and plenty of other adjectives","review":"Quite possibly the most moving album I have listened to for many years, I have no need to listen to anything else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Recording","review":"Although I'm a child of the 60's, stuck in the rut of rock & blues I found this CD to be a refreshing change.

While there are hardly any good songs on this ponderous mediocrity, the packaging and styling is superb. It is designed to look like a prescription drug package and is pretty creative. What bogles the mind are the plethora of British journalists who couldnt bring themselves to give this disposable junk less than 5 stars and perfect marks. Had they put the time used making interesting packaging into carving out a decent melody or two, this could have been a fantastic album, as the style is very ethereal and evocative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Boring Boring Sidney","review":"Bought this because I was a big fan of the first two albums, but I must say, I was pretty let down. Maybe its just me, but it seems less cohesive and well put together.

This is not science fiction, but I'm not sure if it's pure reality either - at least Spiritualized seems to float somewhere above the rest of us, whether that place be space or not. I listened this record two times through without getting much out of it, then the third time suddenly made my mind open. Since that, I've regularly put it in my cd player.The sound is quite massive, and in my book that is just positive. Also, I like albums that grow towards their end. Cool Waves and Cop Shoot Cop are the top of this record, the latter is just incredible. I don't know if it'sjazz or what, but it makes me see Visions. Ha."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpeice of a CD","review":"This one shows the rest of the business the way it should be done. Some folks are going to detest it because you can't jump up and down to it, and there are a few tracks that could maybe have been slimmed down a little, but overall a fantastic record full of pain, feeling, soul and hypnotic sounds. Amazing production too- if you think you don't notice stuff like that just listen to this with your eyes closed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious Album Fails to Live Up To Hype","review":"I bought this album because I enjoyed Lazer Guided Melodies and Pure Phase.

Maybe next time around Spiritualized will live up to the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"spiritual!!!!!!","review":"These guys were superquick delivers of some fine tunes from a musical genius,I will be floating in space when i listen to this record,cheers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend Your Money on a Worthier Contender","review":"As a long time Spiritualized fan, I can tell you your best bet is to move on and invest your money in a better album (and there are countless better albums than this sonic garbage). Aside from the many valid criticisms made of this album (style over substance, lack of decent melodies, over-production, etc) this album simply lacks the pioneering spirit of earlier recordings. I think many of the prior reviews confused excess with artistic and creative exploration. The two are not connected in any way as is apparent on this depressingly poor album. Although it has been mentioned by many others, I want to comment on the paucity of decent melodies on this album. With the exception of perhaps one or two songs, this album is terrible and relies entirely on over dramatization to create its effect. Avoid at all costs, even if youre a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the Reviews have good points","review":"Its strange how everyone feels one way or the other about this CD. I agree that it lacks a little in the melody department, but I think some of the reviews were a little too harsh. It is definitely an interesting artistic, personal statement of yearning for love in an age of machines and emotion-numbing drugs. I think it is best appreciated when high or in a contemplative, serene mood. Buy this album and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Album Overshadowed by Superior Offerings","review":"I thought this album was pretty good, but not nearly as good as some of the other albums released in 1997. Radioheads OK Computer, and The Verves Urban Hymns were better, although I have to admit that Spiritualized went out on an artistic limb to an extent not approached by other British artists. Ive always found them to be a good band, and look forward to their next release."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Response to the last Review","review":"The last reviewer felt that the abundance of instruments was the albums strength. Whatever Spiritualized hinted at with Pure Phase... has been thoroughly undermined with this pointless and excessively boring release. Playing every possible instrument/toy just to feel that you are experimenting in psychedelia is totally missing the point. The best psychedelia had tunes and creativity without going though one's kindergarten chest to try and break the Guiness Book of Records for most junk/toys/instruments featured on an album. The mark of a great album is listenability ; this unfortunately is harder to sit through than a 2 hour physics lecture"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Album a Depressing Decline from Lazer Guided Days","review":"I'm not one to go on and on about something when it can be said in a phrase. To put it simply, this album sucks. Never mind that there are more instruments and effects than you can shake a stick at; thats a minor complaint, and certainly not one of its main drawbacks. The most serious drawback is the absence of any decent melodies. All the reviews prior to this focus on the wrong things: production. What distinguished Lazer Guided Melodies from its peers was its beautiful, ethereal melodies. These, sadly, are entirely absent from Ladies and Gentlemen, a grating exercise in excess. The other complaint is the introduction of rambling gospel and harmonica segments. While these are nice when used sparsely, they tend to cheapen the music when used like window dressing. All in all this is a very poor album, with at most one or two good songs. Buy their first album or check out Spacemen 3, but avoid this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive","review":"The numerous negative reviews speak for themselves. This is a bad album and regression for an othewise talented musician."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon.com Critic Said it Best","review":"I was reading the critics opinions on this album, and one said, \\"Yet, the gap between ambition and result can be a wide one Occasionally, as on Think I'm In Love, the elements come together, but more often they add up to frustration. And a problem with the frequent use of drone and repetition - present, apparently, to create some sense of awe - is that the album ends up sounding, well droney and repetitive.\\" I couldn't have said it better myself. By no means the worst album out there, but a disappointment for those of us expecting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"If you want spacey, dreamy music, stick with My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, Ride, and other early 90's pillars of the shoe gazer movement.This album tries to incorporate that sound with trumpets, jazz, and gospel and the result does not work at all. Not a bad album, but not a good one either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Album Disappoints Pierce Fan","review":"I've been a fan of Pierce's since his Spacemen 3 days and this has to be his most mediocre output thus far. While it contains a few wonderful tunes, the majority of the album is mediocre and downright poor in some places. Given his work in the past, Pierce is capable of far better output than the work on this album. If you want to become acquainted with Spiritualized, skip this album and buy Lazer Guided Melodies. Then,at a later date, buy this album for the 2 or 3 wonderful songs on it. Otherwise, pass on to greener pastures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words cannot describe this...","review":"I first heard the song \\"Ladies and Gentlemen we are floating in space\\" in the movie Vanilla Sky (an awesome movie) and I just had to find out who the Artist was!

I am not a stranger to Ambient or Psychedelic music, but this is overhyped .... For years I have been listening to the worshipful prattle from the so-called \\"Drug Music\\" crew about the genius of Spiritualized. I merely nodded my head in apparent agreement - so as not to offend, and thereby cut off supplies of \\"off-brand\\" Pharmaceuticals.Well, a friend burned me a copy of this disc and handed it to me with all the gravity and reverence of a Moonie - saying that a thorough listen was necessary for my spiritual well-being. I tried - I really really tried, but this is by far thre most boring and pretentious slag I have ever forced myself to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"This album comes about as close to representing the feeling of floating in space as a punch in the arm. Annoying, overproduced garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype!","review":"This album is, simply put, awful. Everyone in the chatroom of a popular British music weekly magazine were drooling over this release back when it came out, so naturally, I went and purchased it. Being that at that time I was on painkillers for a dental procedure, it was interesting. But then reality kicked in several days later. I really and truly feel that they put bricks on random keys on the keyboard and leave them there for long periods of time while Jason Pierce lies around shooting up, mumbling random things.

It gave me some things to think about when I design my next house.The worst part, normal for architect designs, is that closets and bathrooms are small or few or both. No rooms have TV sets or any clutter. You couldn't live in the house as shown.But it is a feast of good and beautiful ideas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had read glowing reviews of this book and expected more than I got when I read it myself.

It works.The slight annoyance comes from trying to make things level. Since there is no basic \\"level\\" position, you have to nudge it carefully to get it right. And if your cameras buttons require much force, you may nudge it back off of level, when you start recording. But then you nudge it back.I still have standard tripods, and they are better on flat surfaces, but I use this more (and I have two now).In short, it works Ok in situations where you could use standard tripod, but it lets you get shots you could never get with a standard tripod. If I only carry one, this is the one I will take.And it's quite small, check the dimensions (less than 6\\"). I sometimes wish it could be bigger (when I'm trying to attach it to something, and it won't reach around).

The shaping ability of the legs is amazing, and even when you're not wrapping it around something, the ability to do small tweaks on the height of each leg is very helpful.

The tripod could be manipulated to hang off trees, on un-even boulders, or many other places, and the toughness and strength of the pad, and the many Rubber edges on it made is Stay fastened right where I wanted it. Again though, it was more for using the timer and taking photo's of myself and the person I was with. It's hard to find someone to hold your camera out there!

My Canon S3 is a bigger, but still not an SLR by any means, and it simply can't be used with this tripod. I did try this with a SLR model I borrowed with equally disappointing results.If you have a VERY small light camera with 3x zoom or less this may work.

My concerns were unfounded and the Gorillapod holds the camera securely and level without any problem...just make sure that 2 of the 3 legs are located under the more heavily weighted side of the camera.

I know from experience and have tested the stability of this tripod on many surfaces such as uneven grass and soil, wrapped around branches, bedposts and arm rests and even on the side view mirror of my car and the tripod never failed to hold its grip.

A very useful feature is its ability to detach the top from the rest of the unit. So if you don't want to keep screwing and unscrewing it every time you need to use it or not use it, you can simply detach the top, even put the camera and the tripod top in your camera case, then just slide it in when necessary. As for the entire tripod itself, attach it just about anywhere, compose your shot and let it do the rest.

This can hardly be considered a fault of the tripod; it is simply the physics of the weight of the camera and the lightness of the tripod, which is really its most attractive feature. The gorillapod does specify a maximum weight for the camera, but an overt warning against possible damage to camera through a fall is desirable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected!","review":"I thought the concept of a tiny flexible tripod that could easily be carried in a medium-sized purse was great. I had seen the larger ones in stores but hadn't examined them closely.I originally thought this was just made of stiff wire legs that were covered in plastic or rubber that was a bit overpriced for something that would break after being flexed too many times. I was wrong! The legs are fully articulated, so each \\"ball\\" is actually a ball joint. This not only makes it easy to move them to any position, such as curved around a post or railing, but also makes it easy to straighten the legs to store it away. Once you have the little mounting piece screwed into the base of your camera, it can easily be slid into the top of the tripod. A rotating ring can lock it in place to it doesn't accidently become unhooked, and a simple squeeze and slide disconnects it. Very handy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought for use while Kayaking","review":"I bought the Gorillapod so I could take videos while kayaking with my Canon PowerShot D10. The legs do a good job conforming to the lip of the kayak cockpit (though I am not sure what would happen if I used a skirt) and hold the camera steady, even when the camera sometimes gets whacked with my paddle stroke. My only complaint is that one of the feet sometimes comes off when I am adjusting it. It pops back on easily enough, but it is a bit disconcerting. Before I go on my next trip I will probably buy the next size up for my Canon PowerShot S2 IS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Pico Projector Tripod","review":"I bought this as a tripod for my pico projector and it works great. The tensioner on the mount could be better and I doubt it would function for a SLR, but a smartphone or point and shoot camera would be fine using this mount.Edit: I'm downgrading my rating to two stars.

The legs wouldn't even support the weight of my Panasonic point & shoot camera. It kept falling over. Then the \\"shoe\\" was so loose that my camera kept slipping off of it. One time it landed so hard on the concrete floor that I thought my camera was a goner. I bought this for photographing jewelry. It's totally useless.

The only drawback I can see from a design standpoint is the optional to press somethig and have the legs straighten out automatically for those \\"I need a straight shot in the next 5 seconds\\" pose. It does take a little fidgeting to make sure the camera is looking straight otherwise and not crooked since everything on here moves. But again... well thought out product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic breaks with just one use","review":"I had high hopes for this product. Unfortunately, the item broke after wrapping it around a post just once. The little cup joints break far too easily, rendering it useless as anything but a simple tabletop tripod.

I use it very often. Unlike big tripods that often take up a lot of space and are a hassle to carry, this little tripod can attach to the backs of chairs, sit on a car, wrap around a ledge, a fence, a door knob, a computer monitor, or a pole. I love to take this on vacation and not have the hassle of bringing a big tripod. For 80% of the photographs I could take, this will suffice just fine vs. a big tripod.

The fexibility of the legs enables you to do twist them as needed.Only thing you need to watch out for is: While it will hold your GoPro securely, if you are mounting it to a mobile platform like a pickup truck or motorcycle, the bouncing/shaking of the camera as you ride on uneven terrain will be magnified by the flexibility of the mount...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for lighter weight cameras","review":"I gave this to several people for Christmas 2006.

Plus, it looks cute.The only thing I'm not so happy about is the little ring that is supposed to lock the release button -- it seems really loose, and like it could just accidentally be twisted to unlock. I am a bit worried that somehow this could lead to a camera dropping and getting damaged. I even considered returning the Gorillapod for that reason, but then decided that the resistance in the release button itself should be enough to make my camera safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks OK","review":"This is a little smaller than I had envisioned.

It's small so it won't fit around most tree trunks, but it easily fits around tree limbs and most other railings and polls. This tripod was essential to some of my favorite pictures from my honeymoon. I set this up all over the Missouri and the Bowfin while I was at Pearl Harbor and with the camera on self timer, took some really cool shots. The clip-on/clip-out camera mount also made things really easy to set up. I leave the mount on my camera all the time because it's so small and unobtrusive and then clip it into the tripod when I need to.

Perhaps it was one of those \\"things\\" that stayed associated with pep rallies and bell bottoms. I was all grown up now, and I surely believed my taste in music had changed.Then I heard about this new CD a couple of years ago, and my curiosity got the best of me. How glad I am!For Carly's music honors the standards she sings, much as an adept remake of a classic silent movie honors the genius of the original creators. You don't remake old films in B&W, nor do you rely on old technology and style when singing songs as great as these. She has preserved the sexiness and genuine allure of songs in bringing them forward by many decades.Like most reviewers, I agree that her \\"Spring will be a little late this year\\" duet excelled.

It brightens most every mood with its musical -- and star-quality -- fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and relaxing","review":"This is a nice piece of work, but not one of my favorites from Carly. The best track is her only original track on the album, the title track. Her own original work is so outstanding, I can't figure out why she sings covers. But I like the album and play it quite a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clearly Black And White","review":"A nice touch, an almost cultish approach to set the mood. Carly gives a genuine tribute to an era gone by of smoke filled night clubs and black limos cruising the night. Two very haunting tracks on this disc, \\"You Won't Forget Me\\" and Sinatra's \\"I'm A Fool To Want You\\" will have you coming back for more. Leaning more to the pop direction is \\"Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye\\", this could have, and should have been a top ten hit for Carly. The one song I could do without though is the duet with John Travolta called \\"Two Sleepy People\\", it seeme lost and somehow found it's way on to this disc. Nice photos of Carly are included in the booklet done in Film Noir style, all black and white. I once saw Carly in Manhattan, I was waiting for a traffic light and she walked right in front of my car, I was frozen for the moment, couldn't even bring myself to say hello, she is truly beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"original y esquisito!!","review":"musica distinta a lo acostumbrado, muy subterraneo y detallista en los sonidos que desean uno persiba!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good travel book","review":"It gives a good view of the city, pointing out places of interest and things to do while in NOLA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where y'at?","review":"While I found the write-up about the history of buildings and places in and around New Orleans pleasant and informative, I thought the list of places to stay, visit, and dine was woefully lacking.I have lived in New Orleans for eleven years.

American Art Collector is an excellent, beautiful, timely, and intelligent periodical; it's of interest to collectors, artists(such as myself), and those who appreciate art in its many genres. Articles are well-written and depictions are excellent. I highly recommend it for all art lovers. Having it on my sofa table and reaching for it at leisure is one of life's little pleasures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art collector","review":"I ordered a subscription to Art Collector because I'd seen the mag in galleries and wanted to use it as a gallery and artist reference guide. However, Art Colllecter magazine covers a very limited scope of catagories of art. I was looking for info on modern, contemporary and new artists and galleries - although the mag is beautiful, the art that's covered is beautiful but it's info and news is limited to nautical, midwestern and realistic themes. I had hoped to see more progressive work included in the publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Art Magazine on the market","review":"This magazine is the best on the market.

Combined with typical Boss bullet-proof construction and reliability, I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to add crystal-clear chorus to any setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boss is \\"Boss\\"","review":"OK... I am a pro musician & rely on gear that will stand the tests of the road. I was using an old Ibenez Chorus Pedal (one of the first to hit the market) of which I did not use much basically due to it's used for certain songs. I upgraded from using 2 separate pedal boards to a single unit & decided to buy the Boss CH-1 Super Chorus to add to the collection. After my first gig I removed the Ibenez Chorus Pedal because of the tonal superiority of the Boss unit. I am certain there are units that may boast of being better but, I have found through my 40+ years of playing that more money is not always better.Great tones! Easy operation! And it is the best bet for the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Chorus pedal","review":"I ordered this pedal because I already had the Boss DS2.

This Haggadah, which sold out of its first printing of 15,000 copies, in just a few weeks, offers more of a narrative story for the Passover seder (more of a story than the rabbinical commentary format that is found in more traditional haggadot). It also offers the family gender neutral language, does not refer to the Hebrews as a \\"chosen people\\", has the story of the four children instead of the four sons, and includes new traditions, such as \\"Miriam's cup.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Intifada?","review":"I was as intrigued and inspired by this Haggadah as any reviewer. I was taken aback and jolted out of my spiritual reverie when during the seder we read a passage that lamented Pharoah not responding to the Jewish 'intifada'. So, the authors compared the defiance of 450 years of Jewish slavery to the Palestinian uprising of our time. In using the word, 'Intifada' the authors had to intend for the audience to draw parallels between both uprisings, thus making a bold political statement that alienated myself and others at the table. I wouldn't recommend this Hagaddah unless one has strong leftist tendencies vis a vis Israeli politics and can stomach that kind of comparison being made during one's Passover seder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money...","review":"The spoken word portion (\\"affirmations\\") is uninspiring and sounds tedious and boring. Annoying even. Listen instead to recorded crickets, rain or a spring pond with frogs if you want to be lulled to sleep. No \\"story,\\" narrative in the affirmations. The entertainment or enlightenment quotient value of this tape is very low. A guided meditation such as those by Emmett Miller much to be preferred.

I think this book is the best bio of Kerouac on the market today. Written by someone who was granted a rare interview with Kerouac near the end of his life, Chartiers also spends time with Allen Ginsberg and some of Kerouac's other associates and friends. It is well-researched but doesn't read as a biography, but a narrative, a story of his life, and what motivated him. He was battered by his struggle to get published and when he found fame, he was somewhat bothered by it. It is a fascinating book and a must-read for all Kerouac fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good!","review":"I got this for my husband for Christmas. He'd mentioned liking the song \\"Big Bad Wolf\\" but it ended up being harder rock than the version he heard on the radio. He still liked it though.

The hard plastic handle pushes into your arm quite a bit for a number of the exercises. This resulted in noticeable bruises on my forearm after using this.The other problem is that this band is a little short for me. You're not supposed to stretch it beyond 3x its unstretched length. I'm 6' tall and to do several of the exercises in the pamphlet, I would need to stretch it 4x or longer. This is probably a better length for someone that's around 5'7\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong advertising","review":"Looking through previous customer reviews, I realised that most of them faced the same problem I did, that is, the TNT Cables that were advertised on Amazon were for 3 x R4 (40 pound) cables, but the set that is sold by Amazon contains 3 x R3 cables (30pound), 2 x handles, 1 x door attachment, 1 x poster (of exercises) and no instructional DVD.I returned the item, and Amazon customer service was top notch (as usual).

I thought I would try these out for extra resistance for my p90x workout and boy do these things hurt when you use them. They do have pretty good resistance but they hurt my hands so bad because they rub hard against your hands to the point it left rub marks and the cheap plastic handles are so uncomfortable. I immediately boxed them up and shipped them back after using them 1 time. I have been using the GoFit bands for the last 6 months and they have been great but they only go up to 30lbs resistance and that's why I was shopping around for more resistance.

If IRON GIRL is any indication of the quality of Ellen Hart's books, I will be reading them all, in short order. THE IRON GIRL was a cleverly plotted mystery (kudos to Hart for making the central crime, which occurred years before and off-stage so fascinating), but it was also much more. Hart fills her mystery with twists and turns just like others in her genre, but she also fills her mystery with intensely likable, all-too-human characters, a generous dose of pathos, and lots of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good rarities, but missing some stuff","review":"uhm... how about \\"This Screaming, This Crying...\\"?

The first track and one more are decent feel good music, but if you are expecting the slow-burn promise on the label to be fulfilled, i don't see it happening. this guy's voice is fine on the first 3 or 4 tracks, but then he picks up this cheesy, whiny, country drawl that made me hit the stop button immediately. sorry, but listen before you buy, or be prepared to give this one to your 50 year old parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic mix of roots country-reggae, folk","review":"Don't miss this eclectic album from Jeb Loy Nichols.It's an eclectic mix of styles, ranging from soul grooves, to country/folk to a touch of reggae.

That one is truly worth 4-5 stars but to me almost all the other tracks are real shallow in comparison (1-2 others I can listen without getting the chills).

I checked that I had enough clearance around the processor socket, then installed the new cooler in about ten minutes. The steps for the socket 478 installation were: remove old fan and heat sink, replace the old thermal grease, slip two clip supports into the socket frame, put the new heat sink and fan in place and tighten two bolts. Then plug the fan controller intro the motherboard and the fan motor. That was all (the other socket types looked a little more complicated).

Neighbors and friends killing one another in a senseless war that left thousands of women, children, and men dead. The three months of Immaculee living in that small bathroom with seven other women, never a moments privacy, never having a shower or having enough food, blows me away. I can not even imagine the strength it took to like through that not only physically but mentally as well.A powerful book that ripped at my heart. Immaculee is an amazing and strong woman. Her faith made me feel lacking as she at times prayed for hours on end. I read through this book feeling incredibly pained for a country I knew little about, and a great sense of appreciation for the story that I just had the privilege of reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left to tell:discovering God/the Rwandan Holocaust","review":"This is truly a book that cannot be put down!

The story is a testament to Immaculee's experiences in surviving the attempted genocide in Rwanda a few years back. However, what I got out of this is proof that faith in action (especially when that faith is challenged) produces results. Immaculee could have died any number of times, and yet, through her faith, she survived. I am not a strict doctrine-based follower of any religion, but I am certainly spiritual, and her faith is truly inspirational on every level.Immaculee makes it very clear that trusting God is what carried her through...even though she was tempted with negative thoughts she calls the devil, even though she wanted to give up the mental and emotional torture of her situation, she persevered and was left to tell.Thank you, Immaculee, for sharing your story with us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best written book I've ever read","review":"It's hard to believe a story so horrific could be so inspiring.

This woman's simply written story of her encounter with unspeakable evil moved me. She was transported through this holocaust by her faith -- deep, unshakable, and unabashed. She is not preachy. Her words are a heartfelt outpouring of her perseverence through unremitting danger and her astounding Catholic faith. I'll never forget this book as its simplicity has made by Catholic faith stronger. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rwanda Remembered","review":"\\"Left to Tell\\" brings to life the horrors of the Rwandan genocide in 1994. My readers' group was so moved and intrigued by the horrors the author endured that they have selected Ilibagiza'a sequel for the next meeting.

But her story has gone a long way towards helping me see the devastating effects of civil war in her country.I am just beginning to learn what has happened in Rwanda, and stories like Immaculee's in turns horrify me, and give me hope. If someone who has experienced what she has can find room in her heart to forgive her aggressors and move on, then I can overcome some of the petty angers and trials I experience in my own life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much, much more than a religious statement.","review":"I got this book as a present and, given the subtitle (\\"discovering God\\") would never have purchased or read it. However, out of courtesy to the gift-giver I did start - and read on and on, to the end.This is a compelling statement about human behavior and the horrible events in Rwanda. It took me way beyond the NY Times and TV journalism. I probably have never read anything like it; she knew the killers, \\"up close and personal!\\"I gladly allow her the religious interpretations - which she certainly deserves - but focused my attention on the events and the full gamut of her complicated responses.I strongly recommend this book, especially for young people who need to see another side of so-called \\"humanity,\\" beyond the headlines and snapshots from afar."},{"rating":"1","title":"How The Human Heart Prevails","review":"Left To Tell is a magnificent story of the human heart's struggle to overcome horrific suffering; to forgive those at the root cause of our suffering; and in the midst of it all, find the love, peace, and protection of God who truly holds us close with each step we take. I could not put this book down and literally finished it in two days. At this time in our world when there is so much suffering and many ask, And where is God, Immaculee's struggle, though deeply heart-wrenching, teaches us to never give up and to always rely on God's help. No one will walk away from reading this story unchanged - it will transform your heart from the inside out. I give it 20 Stars!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Left to Tell","review":"This book helped me to strenghten my belief in God. To have a stronger faith and hope.

Young woman is hunted down like an animal. She is given shelter in the small bathroom of a minister (who is of the tribe that is trying to kill her) along with several other women for several months. Each time when she is about to be discovered or killed she prays to God and something happens to prevent harm coming to her. She is able to escape and goes through a number of events that could only be guided by God and ends up in USA.

A must read for anyone searching for a deeper relationship and faith walk with Almighty God.As a Christian, I often think about how my faith in the LORD would hold up in the most adverse circumstances. Immaculee's faith in God transcended her severe circumstances and she moved in the realm of hope and the supernatural. How many of us can come to this place in our faith? Can we let God arise in us and transcend our circumstances? How can we encourage others as Immaculee does and help them through difficult circumstances? There are many questions that come up when reading about Immaculee's plight of her family and country. I pray we all seek God for those answers.I want to thank Immaculee for persevering in writing this book which encourages and is a benefit to people of all nations.

God Bless you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"This book is a true eye opener to the Rwandan Holocaust. I was ashamed that the United States stood by as these killings went on and did nothing to help stop the murdering of innocent men, women and children.

A must read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Left to Tell: A Brilliant Audio Experience","review":"This is one of the best listening experiences that I have ever had!! This audiobookkept me transfixed.

However, Immaculee's story reminds us that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Regardless of one's religious affiliation, the basic theme of her story is that with absolute faith in a higher power, one can overcome any adversity. Unlike another reviewer, I did not find her relationship with God annoying. Only faith would enable someone to overcome the terrors she experienced and the strength to eventually forgive those that subjected her to them. A must read for anyone struggling with faith and its place in their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"FULL OF EMOTIONS","review":"MY HEART IS SO FULL WITH EMOTIONS IT IS HARD TO FIND THE WORDS TO EXPRESS MYSELF..THIS BOOK TOUCHED MY HEART AND GAVE ME PEACE.THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO SAY...

Alas, it was not to be; however, Immaculee' survival was truly amazing. The hardship of living with 6 \\"strangers\\" for three months and not being able to talk to them (except minimally) is almost overwhelming. The fact that they survived in a space smaller than most closets is an absolute miracle. I highly recommend this book to anyone able to read reality. Immaculee's total dedication to God and her survival \\"plan\\" (to learn English while she was waiting for rescue) was inspiring. To know she not only survived, but is thriving, is a wonderful bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left To Tell","review":"I could not put this book down. It may be the saddest, most compelling book I've read to date. Imaculee's strength & resilience to the genocide is inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left to Tell is eye opening and soul searching","review":"It would have been easy for the author to allow her personal experiences during the Rwandan holocaust to leave her a bitter, angry person bent on revenge. Instead, the author chooses to use the experiences to strengthen her faith and learn to forgive, and above all else the book teaches a tremendous lesson about those attributes. My one warning is that there are some graphic details of violence included. I felt they were absolutely necessary for the reader to understand just how horrific the Rwandan holocaust was, and felt they were never portrayed in a gratuitous fashion. I readily recommend this book for all mature readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!!","review":"Left to Tell is an amazing story of a woman's courage and spirituality.

I dare you to read this book then try to complain about anything in your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting","review":"How can a book about the Rwandan holocaust be uplifting? Well, it is, thanks to this author and her incredible attitude. She overcomes unbelievable heartbreak and hardship, but still looks upward. I loved this book. My entire book club loved this book and couldn't stop talking about it. I gave it as a gift to my mother-in-law, who raved about it. It makes you feel good about the world, yourself, God. It is a quick, easy read, but also riveting and hopeful. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Moving Account","review":"This story broadened my understanding of what happened in Rwanda. I can't believe this was going on and I had so liitle idea. Immaculee is a survivor! Not just for physically surviving, but for being able to rebuild her life after such devastating loss. She describes her utter dependence on God to stay alive and to live with the aftermath. Compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blown Away","review":"I could not put this book down! A story of such amazing courage in the face of something the average person could never even dream was a possibility. Immaculee shames us all by her incredible spirit.

Thank you Immaculee for sharing such a personal and traumatic event with us and showing us the true meaning of forgiveness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anything is possible...","review":"It is unbelievable that people could kill so many people in such a gruesome fashion.

I read it in two days. It is a lesson to all of us.

I have heard of the Lost Boys of Sudan and researched a bit into that topic. I came upon this book as well and feel it is a very good autobiography to read. The topic is, of course, harsh so it was hard to read about such autrocities. However, the positive outlook the author presents strengthens any reader in any situation. This story is one of hope, and that, I believe, is needed for any living being."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left To Tell","review":"Oh my, what a marvelous read.

Imaculee Ilibagiza not only survived the terrible genocide in Rwanda, she did not let what she experienced turn her bitter and hateful. This book is a shining testament to the best of the human spirit. That she survived is a miracle in itself, however the bigger miracle is that she has found a way to forgive those who hunted her and her family.

None of these has come close to Shaum's Outline of Spanish Vocabulary.The book is divided into chapters that provide vocabulary for everyday usage, as well as in what appropriate context to use each word.If you are serious about learning Spanish, and are highly self-motivated, this book will put you well on your way to mastering this lovely language.

It is a great book. Tons of vocab and very helpful. I like the way it is chaptered, and each chapter is basically a review of any and all words associated with the subject. The chapter for example, at the hotel, uses tons of hotel vocab in a format of you fill in the correct word: after you've learned it. It's a great way to teach yourself, and my private Spanish tutor uses it too!

Yes, you will be entertained, in that Ms Clark, as usual, keeps a lively plot and has interesting, if somewhat cartoonish, characters in each story. All romance is P.G. and except for some P.G. 13-style action in story number two, is actually not a bad book to read to more sophisticated children -- children who are at the upper limit of being read to.

No description of this collection anywhere, not even the CD insert, mentions this fact. The versions are not as we remember them from \\"the good ol' days\\"!

First, the stickers can be confusing to someone who actually wants to learn to read music. Some stickers are numbers rather than the actual note names. This makes the transition from numbers to note names difficult for us. Also, the songs are mainly older classic show tunes and swing. While they are great songs, not many younger people (under 50) have heard them or are familiar with them. In the user's mind, there is no awareness of how the song is supposed to sound, so it is difficult to know when a mistake is made or to mentally anticipate upcoming notes. Normally, I love Reader's Digest books. Unfortunately, I felt that this book was not up to their typical standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"You got to be kidding me...","review":"My wife picked up this book to learn the piano. The white key stickers went on with out a hitch. The black keys..... Well, once applied, the information cannot be seen.

So far, nothing... :( Off to the Reader's Digest site to leave a comment there.....As far as the song selection, pretty weak as others have mentioned. As far as the trouble learning the numbers and letters, well, that will have to wait until she can actually use the thing!!!!Anyone have a solution to the problem?"},{"rating":"2","title":"iit's OK","review":"it proved to be what it said it would be.

I was hoping greatly to enjoy this book, but it is rambling and unorganized. A chapter may have a topic, but ten different other things are discussed within it. Bill really let us down here. Occasionally, it is humorous. That's the best I can say. It does not deliver what it promises; it's often actually boring. I'm sure it would not have been published anywhere without Cosby's name on it. Bill, I love you, but you need honest editors to help you with your books. This is like a very long freewriting exercise about the problems of growing older. I'm sure Bill can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really all that funny","review":"OK, so I like Cosby, always have, but I did not find much in this little book that made me laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I bought these cranes based on the reviews they got but I am very disappointed.

I can't tell you the story line as there wasn't one. I can't even acuse this as being nothing but PWOP because there wasn't even any P. This author needs a serious reality check. Bad bad bad book.

Too much gore and not enough romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down until I was finished. I liked how she portrayed the vampires (it was a different angle than most). I just loved the book. I would recommend it to anyone. The only thing that upsets me is that this book is only one in a trilogy. I think she should write more books with vampires than just three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much.","review":"This was good for a little while, but it quickly turned into one of those \\"let's throw everything plus the kitchen sink in here\\" stories. I was good with it when it was just murdering vampires tied into a hot and heavy love story, but then we have tie-ins to Jack the Ripper and the Civil War and by the time we got to the reincarnation I was done with it. I actually gave it up about 75% of the way through, pretty much unheard of with me. And have I mentioned that these vampires follow almost NONE of the rules that vampires normally follow? Not even with variations. This led to them being pretty much untouchable, and I think that what makes vampire books work is that humans have some way of being safe from them. It's no good if the monster doesn't have a fatal flaw. So to sum it up, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed with this book.","review":"I'm not impressed with this book by Ms. Drake. It wasn't worth the money I paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Vampire Novel with some history!","review":"I tip my hat to Ms. Drake for including some interesting myths and historical tidbits on Vampires. I actually found in a great addition to the book. I can't stand vampire novels where someone announces that they are a vampire and everyone just believes. The history, research, and healthy skepticism were needed to make the characters believable. That being said I think there were a lot of details that were never explained.

Perhaps my expectations were high, having heard him speak, but the inspiration and knowledge I was hoping to glean from his book were severely lacking.

There are better books if you are looking for any inspiration or personal growth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chris's account is self-serving","review":"By coincidence, I read the Velvet Doublet by James Street, just days before I unpacked the Log of Christopher Columbus. The two books cover virtually the same material from two distinctly different points of view. The detail and expanded coverage of the former (from the point of view of the Pinta/Nina sailors and captains) was highly instructional for reading and evaluating Chris' alleged version of the same events. For the price of the log, (expensive because it is out of print), the James Street book is reasonable, much more entertaining, highly constructive, and causes the reader to question the self-serving entries and omissions in 'the log'. If you are going to read a copy of a lost copy of a translation twice removed, why not just go to the well-written historical novel, which is much more readable?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you think it is","review":"After reading this book, I went back to read the amazon reviews, and was rather confused. This book has a very narrow focus, and is not targeted at the typical person reading about design. Other reviews seem to suggest that this is a good book for people interested in design, but to put a different angle on it, it reads much more like a theoretical dissertation than a book on design.Unless that is what you are looking for, pass on this book. Unfortunately, I was forced to give this two stars due to the way it is presented on Amazon. If you are interested in highly abstract (as in analysis, not art) and theoretical design, then ignore my rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Form described","review":"Arriving at a suitable form for a design problem is a challenge even for design professionals.

Amazon was very nice and didn't make me return the broken bowls, but still, not very efficient."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's unintentionally funny","review":"This may very well be the worst book I've ever seen. It's obvious the author wants to be Tom Clancy, but there's no chance of that. Mr. Keating is simply a bad writer. His plotting is ludicrous, his characters two-dimensional, and his dialog stilted.He understands nothing of the technology that he incompetently attempts to weave through his poor excuse for a story. For example, at one point he has two F-16 fighters pursuing a business jet. Broad daylight, clear visibility. And yet, under ideal conditions, the two F-16's between them are incapable of shooting down the business jet with either their missiles or their guns! Give me a break.I see this book has several five star reviews, which I can only assume were written by the author himself or his friends. What it really deserves is zero stars, but Amazon doesn't offer that option."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAAAAAAAAAAAD!!!!!","review":"Bought a copy based on a recommendation from another site about author'sso called \\"prescient foreknowledge' of events leading up to OKC bombing.

After the first few pages I knew this onewas headed for the garbage dump, but kept reading because of possible insights Imight gain from the authors 'prescient foreknowledge\\". After another 60 pages ofreading I started thinking how the author got \\"Tom Mcvay\\" to be a character in thestory. The date of the OKC bombing is April 1995. The publishing date for the bookis 1996. I guess it doesn't take a genius reader to realize that names and states ina story can easily be modified before publication in the digital age.

Mr. Keating's novel doesn't seem so much like fiction any more. I read this book in 1996 met the author and had my book inscribed. I have been waiting for a sequelever since.

Make that every American should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"These reviews are bogus.","review":"Did the author make up these bogus five star reviews? It sure looks like it.The only interesting thing about this book is that there is a character named Tom McVey who bombs a building in OKC, etc. with paralells to the actual bombing. This manuscript was written in 1991, but I'm not sure if this part was in it. If it was, makes we wonder how Keating knew of this.

I love elephants and am empathetic to and horrified by their plight. I thought Watership Down was a Great Book in all the many ways it could be. But this one . . . it just bogged me down. The name scheme was silly, the elephants' thought processes were way too anthropomorphic, there was no climax and no ending.

It should have made me cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do hindleggers feel emotions?","review":"<<If humans feel emotions she would say that this one feels amusement.>> This, from Mud's last vision, rang deep bells in me, broadening rapidly into the kind of longer questions that are poised here and there, ready to resound across lots of places and times like infrasonic rumbles.I think this is wonderful writing.Sometimes I would say, I'm reading a book about memory, and sometimes Do animals have culture?I'm looking forward to when a little time passes, so I can reread this treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, TEDIOUSLY written, DISAPPOINTING","review":"What a FANTASIC idea!! Too bad the author made it most difficult to read. She-this, She-that, names of the elephants became so hard to keep track of that by the middle of the book, you just don't care anymore. It really was disappointing, because, it was a wonderful pretext, could have been exciting, instead it just got more boring and boring as it went on. 3/4ths of the way through I just couldn't take it any longer and put it down, never to be finished. (and that's something I NEVER do). It would have been great, had the author not made the \\"characters\\" so idiotically named and therefore impossible to follow. I would really have liked to love this book, but, alas, impossible. (Despite the other glowing reviews seen here. Methinks they may be \\"homers\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I honestly don't know how this book can have so many positive reviews. I found this book absolutely tedious and boring. The characters were developed badly, the plot didn't seem to ever really appear and the ridiculous naming of them all was just distracting and made it too hard to work out who was who.

I'm about a third of the way through the book and think it is time for me to find something to read that touches me.

Barbara Gowdy's fascination with and deep knowledge of these mysterious creatures -- and believe me, this book will not make you proud of being Homo sapiens -- is evident and impressive. Okay, so I'm the sort of person who supports the World Wildlife Fund and surreptitiously votes for the Green Party, but even if you aren't, the story of Mud will make you think very seriously about what politicians call \\"environmental issues.\\" You probably think you would never cry over a book about elephants, but I did and you will.

My only real problem with it was the ending, because I'm a sucker for happy endings. When a book ends sad or tragically, I end up never wanting to read it again--which is a waste of money for me. I read this book in two days straight and then returned it in exchange for another, having been dissappointed with it. I would much rather recommend \\"Silverhair\\", \\"Longtusk\\" and \\"Icebones\\" by Stephen Baxer (mammoth trilogy) than the White Bone to anyone who is into elephants or furry literature in general. They are just as detailed and engrossing, and what's more, they have *happy* endings! :) (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Boring Bone","review":"This is one of the most slow moving and boring books I have ever read! I love animals, especially elephants but could not even FINISH this one!! I was thoroughly disappointed in this story. The eternal and endless search for the white bone went on...and on...and on...and on...and on...and...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"Wow. There's my one-word disciption of this book. I think that the author had obiously done a lot of research and worked very hard to make the book seem realistic. When you first begin the book and are thrust into the world of elephants it is a little confusing, but by the end, you know exactly how they feel. Well, I know it's all fiction, but to me it seemed very real. This is the type of book that really makes you think, if you don't like books like that, then I would not recommend it to you. It got a little boring when the elephants were traveling through the desert, but besides that I am glad I read this book and am recommending it to everyone I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard on me.","review":"I wish I hadn't read this book. It is well written and wonderfully imaginative in its portrayal of what elephants might be behind their deep eyes but If I had known how terribly sad and pointlessly and realistically tragic it was I never would have taken the journey. I am sad enough for real elephants.. I do what I can for them.. I don't need to mourn the deaths of what came to be friends as bitterly as I did. Tall time's death was particularly savagely written and jarring and I resent the way it made me feel. Sadly, I will not trust this author again. In my opinion it was a very bleak and pointless story and I would be very cautious about who I recommended it to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"This story is told from the eyes of the elephants, and includes a diverse society that is deeply rooted in myth and almost religious belief in things to come. The story is beautifully told, and at some points is incredibly emotional. My only complaint with this rich story was that the ending is somewhat ambiguous, but its still beautifully crafted and well worth the read. I you have a taste for mythology, you'll enjoy this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The inner life of elephants comes alive","review":"It is so marvelous to discover the culture that Barbara Gowdy imagines of elephants.

But in only the third case does the investigator (the protagonist) make any headway; in the other two, everything is revealed in an unnecessary confession."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read if you have conservative values","review":"The book was just ~OK~ and it kept me somewhat interested. The writing was well-done, but the plot was weak and the details were vague. As a conservative Christian, however, I felt that the author used her book to trash conservative values. She didn't outright attack them, but she sure made it clear that her character was a liberal democrat, and anything else is just not worth her time. Subjects such as nude art and abortion are covered. \\"The embryo that was killed (aborted) was only a potential person, not a real one.\\" I'm not here to debate, just warn people that have similar values as me.If the book had been better I might have been able to overlook the jabs, but as it stands, I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electric Mainline to Your Soul","review":"This is my favorite Spiritualized album. It is so soothing and inspiring at the same time: half the songs are ultra chill and the others are more rock-pop-blues (seriously, turn up the volume and rock!). Some of the songs are loud and vibrationy, all 'shoegaze' as they call that sound...if you like My Bloody Valentine, you probably will like Spiritualized. I lost this album once, and I missed the album awfully the whole time. It's good for your aura :) Astral medication. Slightly addicting."},{"rating":"2","title":"My least favorite Spz album well not counting the new one","review":"This album reminds me of White Light White Heat the cover is similar but the music is all over the place as well.You get the soft weepy ballads coupled with loud abrassive rockers.

The Healers does what only history can do - it tells the truth about beauty. In this case, it strips the profession of its aura, letting the reader see some of the dirty laundry (George Washington's physicians, for example), as well as its heroes (or heroines as the case may be for medical education reformers). It certainly helps to put managed care, technology, money and the profession in perspective. It's a timeless treasure in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, Ruby Lavendar ROCKS!","review":"Love, Ruby Lavendar is an excellent book to read. It has some funny parts and sad parts. For example toward the end of the book one of Ruby's chickens follows her to the school house and wrecks the auditions for the town play. When her chicken does this, it freaks out Melba Jane (one of the characters) and she bumps a ladder with blue paint at the top making it fall. right on her head. Her hair is blue so they have to cut it all off. Also one of the sad parts is Ruby's grandmother leaves for Hawaii and after she leaves Ruby is left alone with her mom who is gone most of the time. Also after Melba gets her hair cut off she gets really mad and throws a rock through the chicken house window and kills two un-born chicks, but one survives. Personaly I think Ruby is the best characer in the book. Also her grandma (miss Eula) is one of the amazing characers. The book has a special that you will love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book, Just Aching to be a Movie!","review":"As I've been known to repeat on occasion, a really good book is good for every age reader, and this is one. I recommend this for a read-aloud for families to enjoy together, and for classrooms, as well. I won't summarize, because you can read the summary anywhere, but I must tell you I was so deeply touched by this book, I had to run right out the next day to find someone to loan it to. Ms. Wiles writes in such a unique and uniquely Southern voice, but about universal truths appealing to everyone.

Though later songs from the early to mid 70's are missing, to these ears they weren't as stunning as those collected here. I think Levi Stubbs was best on the melodramatic material presented on this collection-when he gets subtle, it isn't as effective. My personal favorites are \\"Bernadette,\\" \\"Reach Out I'll Be There\\" and \\"Ask The Lonely.\\" (which should have been a bigger hit than it was) \\"Ask The Lonely\\" is a masterpiece that to my ears doesn't get the credit it deserves.

The reason people think think that Pyle sucks it the common first timer experience. People believe the specs thinking it is the RMS, not the Max wattage. there fore they dive the amp too hard trying to get 2000 watts out of a 75watt system. Then it will overheat like any brand amp Sony, Pioneer, and Kenwood. Another note: give enough head room for the amp so it doesn't distort. I'm powering 4 Sony GTX 6 1/2 component speakers whose rms it 60 watts. 15 watts of headroom keeps the amp running well w/o heating up. great amp for your money.

There are some better pedals out there (I prefer my Big Muff) but all of them cost more. And honestly, most of them require you to have a good handle on what you want. Whereas this?

I wanted some creamy overdrive and increased sustain for my Strat. It's a good pedal, but it does require a little finesse. If you turn everything up to \\"11,\\" it sounds pretty bad--harsh and abrasive. By backing off the output (\\"volume\\" knob) from the guitar, you can get some good rock tones, at a variety of distortion levels. Want it a little grungier? Turn up the distortion. A little edgier? Turn up the tone control, to increase the treble. Use the volume knob to control your levels into your amp or mixer. Simple. Just don't max out the guitar output going into the unit, and you'll have tons of tonal colors to play with. I'm running the pedal as a DI box, straight into the mixer, with some outboard compression from a rack mounted unit. Makes some very sweet sounds. Very easy for recording.

I was barely in my teens when I read Mysteries. Chabon was barely in his twenties. After reading the short stories, it was hard to believe that this man has a wife, and children, especially.

Chabon's effort is certainly in the former category, and after the first two stories I felt the way I do whenever I encounter someone truly great--I'm [mad] that I'm not him. Some have charged the writing here is forced and too \\"literary,\\" but there is a rolling charm that type of style often produces. The subject matter is emotionally charged, and the sometimes jarring storytelling elevates these stories beyond melodrama and into the realm of insight.After sampling the self-indulgent, immature (but often entertaining) offerings of other young Americans (Eggars, Sedaris, Foster Wallace) recently, Chabon's mostly successful attempts to wrap his voice around more adult themes is rewarding.Sure, you might need a dictionary, but grab a pencil, too--there are scores of headshaking insights and descriptions to note in this ambitious collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"english libtretto of russian opera","review":"I had ordered this item believing it to be bilingual english-russian, and in fact it is a performers' translation for performing the opera in English.Nevertheless I am glad to have as it greatly enhances my appreciation of the Russian CDs I have.

The address says Florida but the company (did some research) is in California. They came in a tiny plastic bag in a tiny fabric pouch.My earrings are symmetrical in every way and the stones are well set. They don't reflect the light as much as I'd want but they do not look cheap and the stones are not discolored.The only real drawback to these is the catch/clasp which is just held in place by a notch type of catch. It would be very easy to lose these and wouldn't take a lot of force to dislodge one. I'd say, if you plan on wearing them casually you'll most likely lose one.

Each piece reflects the different nature sounds, often echoing back the tones of each sound vignette. We bought this CD just to have Wind's performances. Macheis Wind is an artist and activist, and an award winning child advocate who has created a great body of music and song for use in guidance and prevention therapy. His nonprofit organization is Guitar Tree - you can read about the website at www.guitartree.org. By good chance we watched him perform at the 2005 New Jersey Festival of Ballooning, and were so taken by his personality and artistic abilities that we started hunting for recordings. This \\"Nature Sampler\\" CD was a happy find. It is a set of soothing, harmonious, and at times thrilling, musical vignettes punctuated by precious natural sounds which most of us never hear first-hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"National Folk Festival, Bangor, Maine","review":"Just came back from the National Folk Festival where I heard this group 2x!

I expect that statistics courses at Stanford Business School (where the author used to teach), like everywhere else, teach that correlation is not causality. This book, however, is a collection of correlations presented as having causal relationships. But wait - it gets worse. The gross selection bias throughout the book guarantees that the companies identified as \\"great\\" appear to be, while the so-called comparision companies give the illusion of a control group. Don't be fooled. This is pseudo-science couched in management-speak. Once you've seen through this silliness, you're left with little more than conventional wisdom about good management (do what you're passionate about, get the right people on board) that, while possibly true, is unsubstantiated by any of the \\"data\\" presented in the text.Managers, don't waste your valuable time. Don't waste your money. Don't reward authors who think you're stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read for Success in Business","review":"This is a great read for success in business tips. It sounds like the author has really done his homework in noting the differences between successful business and unsucessful ones. This makes for a great guide to getting ahead in the financial world.

It also allows you to look at many things in the business world that you might think are the reasons but just are not true. The best part is that it tells you that much of what takes you to great are many basic principals that have been around for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"One of the best books on management today. The results of the research truly suggests that humility is one key attribute of successful leaders today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to Great is... Great!","review":"I read this book years ago, actually wrote an Executive Summary of it, and I still find it is helpful in my business life.The main concept I want to mention in this review is Collins' comment that you have to let go of what made you good if you want to be great. Yikes. Most of us have fear around that, especially in this economy. But, for those of us who DO want to be great - in whatever way - it's a super support to have Collins' book as a guide.Oh, I just read a new book, actually comes out on July 8 but is available on Amazon already,What's Your Body Telling You? Listening To Your Body's Signals to Stop Anxiety, Erase Self-Doubt and Achieve True Wellness. Steve is a buddy of mine, in fact I helped in the early stages of this book.

Likewise for people and companies that make up America.

Collins' useful book on leadership and management. Never cease to be good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously overrated padded book","review":"I got this book based on the rating and general popularity, but I was saddened to see it for what it really was, a padded out essay. The author repeats the whole \\"good to great\\" mantra in different ways over and over and over again to take up space, the few stories would make for a good essay length paper, but to fill a book he has to hammer the same point over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Levle 5 Book","review":"One of the best business books I've \\"read\\".

The book left me wanting to know more about Fannie Mae and Circuit City, but otherwise a timeless work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Got this book for a Business Strategy class, but read it in a few days. It was a very interesting book and had a lot of insight into what companies need to make the transition from Good to Great. It is very interesting considering the current state of some of the companies selected in the book that did well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the Book, Not the Audio CD!","review":"Love this book. Its message is fairly straightforward and makes sense. Many have said that it's perhaps too simplistic, but if it were so easy to implement these strategies, more companies would be best in class.My only complaint, the author is absolutely annoying on the Audio CD. Great exaggeration, overemphasis on every topic. He sounds like a bad actor who is trying too hard. The unfortunate part is that the author is narrating the Audio CD, not someone else. He comes across a bit to self-absorbed and proud of himself, as if he discovered the Holy Grail. There is nothing wrong with being passionate about your work, but this guy needs to relax.He also needs a speech coach. Since when is Nazi pronounced \\"nasi\\"? Buy the book and be forewarned that the Audio Book will have you hating this guy by the end and you'll forget his message."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Bad to Worse","review":"If I were giving out stars for book titles I'd give this five - it's perfect. The content however is far less than that. The \\"research\\" is at best questionable and further, there is nothing new here. If you are among the many looking to move from good to great (and aren't we all) and hope to find the answers in this book you will be disappointed. Pop management books are easy to find and even easier to sell - do your research, there are better resources out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the right way to correlate cause and effect","review":"This is one of those books that make a lot of success and I don't understand wy. As Daniel Kahneman points in his book \\"Thinking fast and slow\\", the right way to test cause and effect here would be to have a group of companies applying some practices while a control group does it differently. Based on those results you can get a clearer understanding of what has more chance of helping you / your company."},{"rating":"2","title":"got for school","review":"I got this book for a college class on the Kindle...then I realized referencing is a bit difficult w/o page numbers.

It was a great first read! Collins lets the data speak for itself and finds that leadership matters, and innovation is essential. I grew up thinking CEO's needed to be bombastic and celebrities in order to be successful. Little did I know that the most successful CEO's were keeping a low profile and returning the most money to their stockholders.In an era of corporate failure - this book points out what did work in the last twenty years. The data and conclusions that Collins draws about Level 5 leaders is excellent. This is a very solid work and is entertaining as well.Joseph Dworak"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good to great to horrible","review":"Fannie Mae was featured in the book Good To Great about 4 years ago.

We all agreed it was not good - it was great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading for New business owners","review":"I know a few business owners who desperately need this book. Collins points out what should be common sense but isn't: the key to corporate success is discipline. A company needs to take control of itself, its employees, and its resources and get everything moving in the same direction. Collins and his team engaged in an incredible amount of research, and manage to lay out the results in clear and concise dialogue. Instead of being full of catch phrases and feel good mantras like so many other so-called success books, Good to Great actually provides real information and practically step by step instructions on getting your company on track in a positive way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Valuable Information","review":"Jim takes a very rigorous approach to determine what sets apart the really great companies from the \\"good\\" ones.

The principle of looking for the right people to put on the bus and to put the right people in the right seats is horrible. This philosophy lends itself to homogenizing the workforce, and only looking for people who \\"look like us and think like us\\" This does not allow for individual peersonalities which brings fresh approaces to problem. This it the perfect formula for an autocratic control-freak of a CEO. I know the book also says that people in companies can argue and heatedly exchange ideas, but with the \\"get on the bus\\" theory, there is no way that alternate ideas would be tolerated for very long. This is the kind of thinking that has gotten us into iraq.Buy as many of these books as you can afford and burn every one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed at all","review":"Too general and stereotypical of large structures.

They dont want to !! Its alot cheaper to just edge out your competition (if you even have to), than to start a price war, or any other kind of war. Also, most companies are clueless, since they cant tell the difference between an investment, and a cost. They would rather not invest in their people because, they either might take the jobs of the one who taught them, or go somewhere else, and get paid a higher salary, from a company that didnt have to invest in them, so then that other company can then steal what they didnt have to invest in. Lets face it, the company with the lowest cost wins. That one statement explains everything else. There will never be greatness as long as this is true.

I found this book fascinating. I do not have much business experience, but I assume that the studies and conclusions that Collins presents would be very good-to-know for anyone with a serious career or anyone interested in company success and business leadership.Some points from this book that I thought were interesting:- Getting the right people in the company is extremely important and should be done first. (Getting the right people should be done before deciding the what and how)- Great business leaders are humble. (They look out the window with success and into a mirror with failure.)- Consistancy in the core values of the company are crucial. (New regimes and technologies are not as important as the momentum that core values build.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Great...","review":"I really enjoy Jim's work and generally hold his thoughts and theories in high regard. This book will provide any reader with valuable advice that can be used to drive their business forward. That being said, I offer the following caution...leadership is contextual. In my bookLeadership Matters...The CEO Survival Manual: WHAT IT TAKES TO REACH THE C-SUITE AND STAY THEREI spend a decent amount of time discussing why one size fits all management recommendations can constitute extremely dangerous thinking. Categorizing certain \\"types\\" of leaders as effective and other \\"types\\" of leaders as ineffective is not only dangerous, but it is flat out wrong. Over the course of my career I have witnessed virtually every \\"type\\" of leader both succeed and fail. It is not the style of your leadership that matters, but rather the key issue is can you contextually, environmentally or situationally adapt your leadership skills to needs and demands of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking book","review":"Very thought-provoking book, lots of research and analysis done to write this book.

I will say though that his reading -the audio version is read by Jim Collins- has a bombastic tone, and it feels like he is making a 'hard sell' on the methodological rigor of his work and the subsequent ideas. I'm surprised I'm not seeing other reviewers note this. I find myself cringing at his rhetoric and having to force myself to be open minded to his ideas because I feel he is trying to shove them down my throat. By the 4th CD you get over it, and really appreciate some of the stronger points he makes. The concept of a Level 5 leader is great, although I sense a lot of us buy into this concept out of simple admiration for leaders with those characteristics. He leaves plenty of food for thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"quick service, good product","review":"a great book to make you consider how you are managing, how you want to shape your team and transition from a good team to a great team."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Business Owners and Future Businiess owner.","review":"As a small business owner this is a great book to read. This book gave me a great insight as to what is need to become successful and also what is need in order to become an overall great company. Jim Collins goes in to a good detail description of what make a great leader. For me this gave me a good sense of what kind of a leader I need to be with the people that work for me. Even thought this book state a lot of very basic concepts they serve as a very good reminder and makes to that the read gets the point by repetition of what is need to become a great company. Overall, I would recommend it even if your not a business owner. It will open up a whole new way of thinking and will open up the curiosity to find out how to go from Good to Great."},{"rating":"2","title":"History has proven Collins correct","review":"Few authors have the ability to bridge the gap between the theoretical and the practical. Collins' writing translates real-world learning into leadership behaviors. His anecdotes are incredibly telling, such as the executive elevators at Bank of America and the profligate use of corporate jets at Bethlehem steel. His conclusion are contrarian, putting the lie to common management myths such as charisma, bravado, technological risk-taking, and daring strategic thrusts.In 2001 his conclusions were already being proved out by the dot com bust. Three years and dozens of corporate scandles later, time has proved his conclusion more correct than ever. At the end of the day clear thinking, character, and constancy are far more powerful than flamboyance, flash, and financial legerdemain.This book will challenge you to think and act differently as a leader. Isn't that what a good book does?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Master the basics","review":"solid people and solid actions are what make the corporate world great..

Check out this quote from the book: \\"Fannie Mae grasped the subtle denominator of profit per mortgage *risk level*, not per mortgage (which would be the \\"obvious\\" choice). It's a brilliant insight. The real driver in Fannie Mae's economics is the ability to understand risk of default in a package of mortgages better than anyone else. Then it makes money selling insurance and managing the spread on that risk. Simple, insightful, unobvious--and right.\\"Oh except that it wasn't right. It was dead wrong. Fannie's \\"brilliant insight\\" represents the rampant irresponsibility that caused the financial crisis and literally broke the entire economy.So much for \\"good\\" to \\"great\\".

You can have great managers with great ideas, but the companies that stand tall are those that had CEO's who were not afraid to get into execution. They were not afraid to get their hands dirty. They were not afraid to get into the realm of systems, processes and implementation. So if you want the summarized version, it goes pretty much like this: \\"Great companies are those in which the leaders are able to transcend the curse of competence, think differently about the role of technology, and create a culture of discipline.\\" Now get the book. A must read for anyone who aspires to be a leader or for any leader who wishes to do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great \\"Reading\\"","review":"Excellent Book, and the full length CD set (12 hrs) was better than the hard bound version.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves gaps and is contradicting","review":"I had to read this book for my university and write an essay on it. If I were to write an essay on this book it would sound too offensive and degrading to Jim Collins. I think this book is absolute crap. So many Americans are in love with it though. I have made notes on nearly every page where he contradicts himself over and over just to make one company sound better than another. Anyone could write this book and abuse data the way Collins does.

In very easy to read language, Collins distills the half dozen traits that a few select companies share. What makes the book work in terms of its lessons being convincing is the empirical approach that Collins took. He didn't just choose one trait from company A and another from company B. He used an objective system to find eleven companies that by objective standards have outperformed their industries and the market as a whole and then found their common themes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take with a grain (or more) of salt","review":"I found it to be like most business success books - some interesting concepts but relies on catch phrases and fortune cookie twists on common factors needed for success.

I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aspire To Greatness","review":"Why settle for \\"good enough\\" if there is a potential to be \\"great\\"? I thoroughly enjoyed this book by Jim Collins because it clearly states a research objective, shows how the data was gathered and draws thoughtful conclusions. But, Good To Great ultimately challenges you -- the reader -- to draw conclusions of your own based on the overall information.I especially enjoyed the \\"First Who, Then What\\" concept where companies are encouraged to \\"Put your best people on your biggest opportunities, not your biggest problems.\\" As a business owner, this book challenged me to look back over my own career.By JoAnna Carey, Author of Rat Race Relaxer: Your Potential & The Maze of Life"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book about Business Ever","review":"Jim Collins' two books, Built to Last and Good to Great, provide the clearest and most profound analysis of business success. If you never read any other books about business in your life read these two. They are life transforming. I buy these books and give them away as presents. You could wish for no better gift if you are interested in business and what defines success. The new updated chapter on Built to Flip in Built to Last is priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT mindset is always GOOD","review":"My pleasure reading consists of business related books, and my library is full of great books, ok books, and not so great books. Good to Great is a great book. I've read the reviews on this book, good and bad, and my grading of a book is based on how much it informs me, gives me insight, motivates me, moves my own perceived reality, and presents ideas and innovation to conduct business differently. With this grading, I give Good to Great a 5. Yes, there are chapters and sections that have greater impact for me than others. Interestingly enough, I picked up on different things the second time I read it (about 4 years apart). Assuredly everyone reading can take away great nuggets that will help them in their business. No question, everything you read ought to be filtered through the lens of questionable source, however don't loose the fact that this book does present specific areas to concentrate on (at least consider) to achieve a great and enduring company."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate WOW!","review":"Jim Collins makes a beeline straight for the heartbeat of GREATness in any organization. After conducting a 5 year detailed study of leading organizations, he masterfully writes the results of each. He unveils the top 11 companies and their unanimously shared traits.

This book will adorn the top shelf of your library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great At All","review":"This book continues to be published and sold, yet after reading it I cannot imagine why? A sizable portion of the companies that Collins claims have made the move to being Great are now on the ash heap of life; Circuit City, Fannie Mae which gave us the housing disaster we are now living through. He proclaims how great a company Walgreens is and while they made a move to become the McDonalds of the neighborhood pharmacy world; it is chain that provides NO CUSTOMER SERVICE, I know because I travel coast to coast and unfortunately have to rely on them from time to time. If Collins who claims to be such a student of business were truly so, he would write a sequel where he revisits the companies he claims in this book are so great and set the record straing. This is the rare case where I have read a book that has such little value.

The answer; no one really knows. It's all random.Business books are nothing but fads and fashion. Read, borrow a couple of ideas, then throw them in the trash when you are done. G2G became required reading where I work and in my view has nearly destroyed the company. It was, and still is, considered the Gospel of business. Prior to G2G we grew from zero to $120M in 10 years. In the 7 years after G2G we are down to $60M. (Still profitable, thankfully, but boring.)

That's it! That's all! Nothing more. That's what makes a great company?

My boss gave me a copy and told me I should read it with an open mind; that I should know what corporate executives mean when they natter on about hedgehogs and being on or off the bus. I'm no big fan of managing by the latest trendy fad and I assumed this book would fall into that category.In spite of my prejudice, I enjoyed this book. I didn't see any flaw in the methodology and I like the idea of collecting the data and following it where it leads. The bottom line, in my mind, is that leaders who believe in something bigger than themselves (a religious or quasi-religious concept) can enable and lead organizations to greatness. As an additional plus, it looks like Jim Collins \`ate his own dog food'; he used the lessons learned to lead the research and writing team with great result.

It is filled with good, practical advice that can be applied to almost any organization. It's also a very easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatness indeed","review":"Originally I purchased this book because I had to read it for my Entrepreneurship class. This book is extremely well researched and the findings are resoundingly true. If you are a CEO, buy this book. If you are starting a company and want greatness, buy this book. I don't have my own company or even hopes of starting one soon, but when I do, I know exactly how I can make it great. This book takes you step by step on the path to greatness. The only downfall is that it gets a little redundant, and the last chapter didn't make a whole lot of sense because I haven't read Jim Collins other book \\"Built to Last.\\" But, indeed a great book whether or not you do have a company. The principles can apply to any organization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Common Sense.","review":"As Mark Twain said \\"There are lies, dam lies and statics\\". Jim Collins missed the point at what makes a great company, Common Sense. He lost me at his Hedgehog concept and show his Stanford biases.

Great for those in a group.","review":"Good to Great is informed by significant research and data. Its premise is that through leadership, good organizations can become great organizations. Through Good to Great Collins distinguishes six key competencies that lead to business success: Level 5 Leadership, First Who Then What, Confront the Brutal Facts, Hedgehog Concept, Culture of Discipline, and the Flywheel. The substantive data, gathered from CEO surveys, stock indexes, and other statistics, support the six competency claims and lay the foundation of Collins' leadership philosophy. I highly recommend Good to Great. It is a book geared towards business people in organizations and not necessarily a leadership \\"how to\\" book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not just the concepts, but the way they are expressed...","review":"Chances are you have already read this book because every where you go, you will find business people referring to concepts like the 'hedgehog' or 'getting the right people on the bus'.Whether you consider the ideas unique or not, the way they are expressed has resonated with so many people that they have become part of the language when business people communicate.Great books (for me) don't just inform, but they stimulate thinking and action - they create excitement in the possibilities of what my business can do. This is a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even great for High School Coach","review":"As a High School coach I am always reading books about success and what goes on behind the scenes to cause it.

That is something many schools could learn from today.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book (but not SO great)","review":"I loved the hedgehog concept and for that this book receives 4 stars. Simply put: the hedgehog concept is an understanding of what people can be the best at. While the fox knows a lot of things, the hedgehog knows one BIG thing - and therefore the hedgehog always wins!In addition, the concept of the bus is a nice idea: first who then what, place the right people in the right seat...drive!But...I decided to read this book simply because of the publicity that it received and therefore it was impossible to ignore it.

Among the 11 \\"great\\" companies in the book, two no longer exist: Circuit City (bankrupt and liquidated in 2009) and Gillette (swallowed by P&G in 2005, now defunct as a company). Another, Fannie Mae, doesn't deserve to exist, and books are being written on what a failure it was. Maybe P&G took over Gillette because Gillette was great, but the fact remains that Gillette is dead, and survival should be a quality of greatness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Personally, I think this is a horrible book. The companies he picks are terrible and his only focus is on financial return to stockholders, nothing about how the companies are when it comes to corporate responsibility. Even that being said, many of the companies he picks have ended up not doing so well or have even gone out of business. If you think the only thing that makes a company good is its ability to provide a high stock price for its investors, even if only for a short period of time, then you might enjoy this book. However; if you think a company has a responsibility to be a good citizen in the communities they do business and have an obligation to treat their employees and customers with respect then you will probably think this book is trash as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read but good","review":"Hard to read,little dry but good information.

Congratulations to the author and the research team and many thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hedgehog Always Wins","review":"Jim Collins is one of those exciting authors who can put their energy on page in a way that you feel it. When you put a Collins book down, you are ready to take on the world. It is even better than listening to music to get psyched up, because his energy is coupled with wisdom and strategies.Collins is an artist. He draws up systems with which to conceptualize business principles. The systems are simple, profound, and sexy. I think of him along the lines of Stephen Covey and Thomas Friedman--the subjects are different, but the ability to systemize complex ideas and make them visual and workable are similiar.I keep this book within easy reach, and I often flip through it just for fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Be Great or Not To Be Great, That Is The Question","review":"For years, building a great company has been considered as a fuzzy art, which not many can master, not even learn. In Good to Great, Jim Collins has shed the light of empirical evidence into the area especially reserved for superhuman CEO and larger-than-life myths. Unlike many other books, all conclusions in Good to Great are derived from pure statistical facts. The book carries not only numbers and digits behind great success but also a strong encouraging voice defying mediocrity. Good to Great is well written and applicable to everyone. For those who strive to perfection, reading this is definitely a must. Yet, even for those who reckon greatness as a distant luxury, Good to Great is a harmless trial. If it cannot shake one out of apathy, it will at least bring attention to that very hidden corner of capability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uri Gofman reviews Good to Great","review":"an excellent book with great examples of successful corporate behavior. a must read for any entrepreneur or corporate manager."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for business, great for personal achievement","review":"This book came highly recommended by my mother, who has no experience in corporate America and only limited interest in what makes corporates great. The main appeal was the lesson's applicability to personal life achievement. I find that she was right, and I do work for a corporation! Reading this book as taught me important lessons for what to look for in a company, and for what types of universal truths apply to making a person (not just a company) move from the comfort of mediocrity to true greatness. By the way, I was a little leery when I first started reading it, that it would be dry and full of numbers like earnings reports and ROI, etc. To my surprise and pleasure, the book reads much easier then I thought and it's been very enjoyable. I can highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim Collins knows his stuff","review":"Jim Collins is part of a rare breed of researchers--those who can approach a question with a completely open mind, and suspend judgment until ALL the facts are in. In his work, there is no hint of the all-too-common 'force-fitting' of facts into existing \\"boxes\\" (pre-conceived notions).If you are interested in what makes a successful business different from the 94% of startups that fail in their first 5 years...then this is the book for you.Highly recommended. Once you read this, you'll want to pick up Collins' equally enlightening follow-up work: \\"Built to Last\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book on business for me","review":"I bought this book at the recommendation of a colleague.It did not let me down. For me it provides a guideline to follow when I will start my own business.When one reads this book, one should keep in mind that the companies being reviewed and praised are subject to changing management, so not all companies might still be great.

Unfortunately, as other reviewers have pointed out, all the companies held out by the author as being the kind with enduring success have pretty much all underperformed the market since the publication of the book. This is a result of flawed statistics, too short of an analysis period, and generally silly conclusions.

Providing a look into very unlikely factors that contribute to great companies, Jim Collins has written a masterpiece worth any reader's time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hedgehog Outsmarts the Fox","review":"I have read few things that have stuck with me so long as Jim Collin's Hedgehog Concept. The Hedgehog Concept is a central theme in understanding what can propel a company from good to great. It also highlights the importance of knowing your business and your customer, rather than flailing about trying to 'reinvent' every time there is a shift in the market or a dip in profitability, which is excellent advice for business leaders operating within our current economy.This book provides insights to leadership, change, and a broad view across industries and traits and behaviors that successful companies and their leadership share in common. Lots of wisdom here on how to lead, not be distracted by ego, and to identify your company's Hedgehog Concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Works and What Doesn't","review":"What impressed me most about this book was the extent to which the author assured the reader about the depth of research and hard data used to draw the conclusions. While it is normal for human perspective to enter our opinions, I am convinced that the best efforts were made to be objective. One of the comments that really jumped out at me involves motivation: \\"Under the right conditions, problems of alignment, commitment, motivation, and change largely melt away.\\" The idea here is that if we have the \\"right\\" folks on the Team, we don't have to motivate them. I enjoyed the discussion of the Hardiness Factor and Stockdale Paradox along with the Hedgehog Concept. It was also surprising to hear about some \\"expected\\" findings that, in fact, were not the case. All in all, this was well worth my time to read and I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"based on five-years of research","review":"This is a outstanding read.

Jim Collins does a great job of sharing the results of his research and data in an easy to understand and beneficial way.

These principles can easily be applied to your personal life as well as your business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discipline and Patience","review":"In this book, Jim Collins makes a case for working with discipline and patience to achieve something that you are passionate about. He points out that becoming great takes time and you have to work on it with a clear sense of your destiny, with the right people, and with conviction. I like the fact that Jim uses examples of companies that have not been extensively written about in other business books. In other words, the stories used in the book are fresh, not recyled.The ideas are very appealing but as Jim admits himself, very difficult to implement in practice. Don't expect to apply these ideas and see a turnaround anytime soon! But at little over two hunderd pages, this book is well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star because I cannot give it ZERO","review":"I cannot believe anybody in their right mind is still buying this book. Collins' analysis was flawed from the outset when it was published in 2001 and 11 years later it has proven to be a failure. Four of his so called \\"GREAT\\" companies are Fannie Mae (mortgage scandal), Circuit City (declared bankruptcy), Wells Fargo ($25B bailout) and Gillette (bought by Proctor & Gamble). See a pattern? Great, huh?So much for Good to Great. Didn't anybody learn from his \\"Built to Last\\" book when most of the companies touted in that book did NOT last? Wake up people. Jim Collins' goal was to put YOUR money in HIS pocket. He feels GREAT about that.You better hope Jim Collins never puts a company you work for in one of his books. If he does, start looking for another job quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Book was good, was recomended to me in a lecture.Present some ideas that you did not see in other about bussiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"What makes a good leader or a good product, great.

If not, then you should read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh - and I've only begun","review":"I have only begun to read this book as it is required for a class I am taking and I cannot stand it. The magazine-like writing style could be tolerated, but this man's self-aggrandizement is sickening. It boggles my mind that this book sold so many copies. His \\"data\\" is weak (to put it mildly), even though he has some sound ideas in the book, but they are NOTHING new, they are not \\"his ideas,\\" but a re-branding of other's ideas to make them his own. I will finish the book as it is required for the class and re-review to see if I feel any differently about it at that time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Yet another engagingly well written, but essentially useless, book on how to run a great company. Collins presents a number of case studies purporting to show what he says are the keys to running a great company. Problem is, they're also characteristics of many failed companies. And his insights aren't terribly deep, either: Hire good people. Know your market.The secret, if there is one, to running a great company isn't going to be found in a book; if it was, the business schools wouldn't be full of MBA candidates. There is no secret. It's a matter of knowledge, experience, vision, and perhaps a certain amount of good fortune, none of which are cheap or easy to acquire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Business Book, Awful statistics,","review":"This was one of the worst business books I've ever read becuase it passes off ungodly bad statistics as academic research. The entire book is based on false assumptions and classic statistical errors, such as Correlation does NOT equal Causation and survivorship bias.PLEASE do not buy this book, it offers you nothing and will fill your head with hatred for the author who claims to know what he's doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for anyone aspiring to sucess","review":"I first heard about the book when I was reading an article detailing a Microsoft executive's visit to China. The book was recommended to those aspiring college students eagerly seeking secrets to success. I would be lying if I said this book is a cure-all.But it definitely provides a insightful look into several key questions concerning the achievement of greatness by a company. Whereaz this book treat the readers mainly as the top management, it is a good read to anyone who is interested getting to know more about the experiments, successful or failed, that have been carried out that trace back to decades. The book is an eye opener to me and I believe it would be for you too. It is exemplary of what a business book should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close to Good, Far from Great","review":"It was an easy read, but you can only take little from this book. I know a lot of people put a lot of stock in this book and attempt to model organizations after this teaching, so I decided to read it. I was let down quite a bit. Most of the highlights were obvious(i.e. surround yourself with good people, grow a company slowly), and a lot of them I didn't agree with. I felt like most of the time they would have an idea and mold their research findings to support their preconceived notions. As I read the book I kept shaking my head and thinking that their findings could be the result of other factors that weren't touched on. This book was not worth the read. They obviousely had business ideas and principles, then set out to find research that would support it, and discard any that wouldn't support it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Business Book","review":"Good to Great is definitely a book that can be recommended to anyone. The concepts and ideas are easy to grasp and applicable to a wide variety of situations faced in our every day professional and personal lives. Some of the concepts are even humorous, but they challenge your mind by being surprising and refreshing at the same time. You might not agree with all of the concepts, but you will definitely get a chance to look at things from a different and renewed perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I borrowed this from my public library thinking I'd take a look even though I'd read so much about it already including the Executive Summary! (I noticed upon returning the book that our library director immediately checked it out.) This book is well worth the complete read and referring back to; I copied at least a half dozen pages for future reference. Each chapter ends with its summary points and I really enjoyed the vignettes throughout. There are pages of real life business experiences that prove the good to great theory; this engaging consolidation of 5 years of research holds many lessons for those willing to learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Data-mining Project","review":"I gained little from reading this book. The data mining exercise that Jim Collins put his team through yielded few surprising results, and whatever useful lessons that can be drawn from the exercise can be summarised in 10 pages. But Collins had to write a book about it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"Collins and his team, by their own admission, picked a handful of companies that fit into their very specific criteria, then lo-and-behold those companies all had the same characteristics?!?!?The nature of the study even admits that most of the time, someone on the inside of a company cannot see the bigger picture going on - the very same bigger picture that you need to see in order to achieve Good To Great success. Collins then concedes that the only way you can tell you're on the right track is when it's all said and done.Don't waste your money on this.The lessons of this book can fairly be summarized in about 2 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not Great","review":"This book has one flaw, the author's definition of \\"Great\\" is not what many people would think is \\"Great\\". For example, companies like Cisco, Intel, Microsoft, and GE does not qualify as being \\"Great\\" in the author's opinion. If you can agree with that, then this book is GREAT!, but if you think the author is little flawed in leaving out the most profitable and fastest growing companies from his list of \\"Great\\" companies, then this book is merely Good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"Common sense approaches to thinking about businesses. Collins takes a very defined and clinical approach to his evaluations.

It is thoroughly useless because its method for analysis is 100% unreproducible and thus 100% unscientific - it's entirely subjective.How is anyone supposed to believe that \\"Early in transition, Philip Morris saw that it could become simply the best tobacco company in the world.\\"?? Is there proof of this? More importantly, how does one see when one can become simply the best company in the world?? How does one know if he or she is a \\"fox\\" or a \\"hedgehog\\"?This book is packed with sweeping statements of zero use to anyone with a brain.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encouraging and a little scary","review":"Written in 2001, Good to Great is a little out of date with case studies on Fannie Mae and Circuit City. I hope they are planning a second edition sometime soon. The book is encouraging in that it makes success seem much more attainable and almost inevitable with the right foundation. However, it also places so much importance on the people involved that it makes hiring seem like the single most critical and difficult task of running and growing a company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"As you read the book, you realize (again!)how simple you can turn trully important things when you master something, as Collins does in this easy reading book.

As good as GSHF was, this is the other end of the spectrum. I would have liked to give it a half-star, or none, but that wasn't an option. How something this bad got released is beyond comprehension......unless the band is under contract to \\"X\\" number of albums. That could explain this. The only thing more worthless than A Worm's Life would be any one of the millions of AOL CD's that show up in my mailbox. At least I don't have to pay for them!

Needless to say, the CTD CD to buy is still GSHF."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully dull.","review":"The Ghosts that haunt me is one of my favorite CD's, the creative blending of musical styles and humorous lyrics make it a rare album. I'm not sure if the lyrics are any good on Worm because the music is so godawfully tedious that this is one of the most disappointing albums I've ever come across. There is a book by Mark Helprin where a thief steals several very expensive paintings from a museum and then breaks back in to returns them because they have no color and look like they are made of mud. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"PPPPPPPlease!","review":"I bought this CD when it came out, all this years it stayed like one of my favorits.

It may be my favorite CTD effort, as it conbines their great tune-making ability and whimsical lyrics with some great guitar licks and high energy. Different from the kind of energy displayed on Give Yourself a Hand, which seems more frenetic at times, this album is a great mix of their musical styles, with the guitar as the focal instrument.It never fails to please each and every time I listen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"GLAD I DIDN'T BUY IT","review":"I borrowed this disc from the library. This is a HORRIBLE CD. I love the CTD but these tunes made me cringe! Like the difference between margarine and butter. I recommend give it a pass. Margarine is bad for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brad Roberts should stick to what he does best","review":"This is the first CTD album produced by band members. It shows. The melodies and words that made the first two albums worth repeated listening are hidden behind a needless attempt to add 'edge', 'a raw sound', or 'energy'. I've heard Roberts discuss (after the first albums) how his live shows had a harder edge, and it seems that he felt that this would translate well into this album. My advice: let a professional who understands the nature of studio recording produce the work, and save the 'edge' for the concerts, where energy counts for much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I ordered the cd 'A Worm's Life' a few weeks ago. I read the information on shipping costs and Amazon policies and found answers to all my questions. The shipping time was 8-12 weeks which seemed long but since I live in Finland I understood it might take a while. However, I was pleasently surprised to see the cd on my doorstep after only a week! The disappointment was to find a wrong cd inside the covers. The case cover was in fact 'A Worm's Life' but the cd inside was the older album of the same band. The worst thing is I sent the cd on to my father as a Father's Day present and I can only imagine the disappointment on his face when he opened the case and found the old cd, which he already had, in it. How can I get the right cd instead?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"Writing as a big fan of previous release, God Shuffled his feet, this is a big let down. It's an even greater disappointment, considering that I waited 8 years from its release date to finally sample its fruit.

Mind you, I'm as pretentious as the next guy, but there are some things I can't even pretend to get. Shout out to Robert Schumann though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fanatics Unite!","review":"Some music fans (note: the word \\"fan\\" is derived from \\"fanatic.\\"), will go to great lengths in denial defending their Gods.

It really is an insult to anyone who bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I gave it a chance","review":"I bought this album the very day it came out and , I must admit, I thought it was sorta bad. But being such an avid Dummies fan I kept listening to it trying to learn the songs. Now I put the CD in maybe once a week and listen. It is a very good CD once you learn the songs, esp. My Own Sunrise, My Enimies, and Good behind Ugly. Although I can't recommend this one to new Dummies fans, I very much enjoy the more \\"grown-up\\" sound and still find myself humming the songs when Im away from my CD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Investment","review":"I never could get into this CD, I suppose I'll trade it in or give it to someone else.

The AM reception was OK except there was a constant buzzing sound which varied depending on the direction my head was turned. Wearing it felt like my ears were in a vice grip. I tried with 2 sets of fresh batteries in case that was the problem. The battery section was almost impossible to open. I also agree with a previous reviewer about the on/off switch. Interestingly enough, some other switches were recessed which would avoid the problem of accidentally having it turn on.

Instead the author comes across as a pretentious and bitter employee with a condescending, \\"holier than thou\\" attitude toward other crew members and passengers who didn't meet up to her \\"superior\\" standards. She categorizes fellow flight attendants, passengers and crew into neat little cylinders of critical judgement, headed up by titles such as the disillusioned ones, the lazy ones, the zealous ones, the subservient ones, and the tacky tarts.

Turns out I like them a lot and wonder why it had to end. I am a lover of horror, sci-fi, fantasy horror, murder, and mystery. This rolls all that into one series, maybe not so much the sci-fi, but the rest of it. The actors are believable and the story lines are pretty interesting. This is a lower budget series not quite as well done as Angel, but maybe along the lines of Buffy. Great price to go with good entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Issues","review":"I'll keep to the technical side. The show is as it is, others have written well about it already.Unfortunately, this can't be said about this DVD set. First, the DVD set only has 9 out of 10 Episodes of Season 2. The first Episode (\\"DOA\\") is missing.Worse, the format is horribly broken. The Show is 16:9 - but the data on the DVD is 4:3 with black bars on top and bottom. That looks ok on a 4::3 screen, but horrible on a 16:9 - you get a huge black frame all round the film. And even if you have a player that can enhance this, the black bars are part of the signal - which means you loose resolution - and thus, quality, on the actual content.Overall one of the worst DVD sets for TV shows I've seen. Avoid buying it, demand the Publisher to publish a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 DVDs: Last episode of Disc 2 doesn't work. Disc 3 doesn't even register as a DVD.

I personally liked it, Kirsten Dunst happens to be one of my favorite actresses. It challenges the audience, it asks questions, and doesn't really care if you've understood or not.

The story is intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking, not mass-consumption","review":"This movie is an experience, not a story-- I love how the feeling of despair and resignation are so perfectly expressed.

I'm disappointed with myself that I sat all the way through thinking somehow, at some point, the movie would redeem itself. Never did, not for one moment.

This is the most boring and depressing movie I think I've ever seen - it has absolutely no artistic, entertainment, or even educational value whatsoever.Kirsten plays a very depressed woman - and she plays it well. Being around depressed people is truly depressing - choosing to watch them for entertainment value is insane and not in the least entertaining or rewarding.

The second half involves panicky characters trying to cope with the potential of the world coming to an end. The movie is disturbingly slow and the characters are such terrible, terrible people. This movie was made by someone with no understanding of physics (if a planet comes anywhere near our planet, especially if that planet is larger, the rise in tides would cause tsunamis that would wipe us all out way before such a planet could hit us); it is a truly artistic endeavor.I'm actually offended that I was made to believe this would be an \\"incredible\\" and \\"beautiful\\" film.

However, the acting was done very well especially by Charlotte Gainsbourg. Honestly the ridiculous wedding antics shouldn't have happened. It made no sense to me why they would show a girl who could presumably see the future, be so cruel to a man who really loved her.

This movie is heavy handed, screams \\"Hey, look at my cool symbolism!\\" to a nauseating degree, and frankly, I wss confused when they kept pronouncing Justine (Jus-teen) as Justin (Juh-stin). Through most of the first part, I thought Justine was a transsexual. It would have made the movie way more interesting if that had turned out to be true.

Melancholy is like depression, in that its a kind of sadness, except it's a sadness that doesn't hurt. It's a sadness that hugs you like a blanket.This film is about a character whose depression is physically crippling her, which I didn't realize could/does happen, but the learning of that is the only thing this film offers. It does not relate to the viewer the feelings that the lead character feels, it just shows how everything & everyone around her is let down by her condition.I wanted melancholy. I didn't get it. If you're a survivor of this disease or know someone who has/had it, then maybe this film will be either a stunning memory revisited or a way to bond with your loved one(s).The acting was good, cinematography was appropriately gloomy.

Not disappointed, to say the least...Kirsten Dunst proves to be one of the more talented young actresses in film. While I typically am not a Keifer Sutherland fan, his performance is very impressive/memorable. The movie seems a little sluggish out of the gate, but at some point it occurs to you that you're completely engulfed in this dark, fairly heavy story.

The audience and the characters are in the same position in Melancholia.Now imagine you are very rich and having that same wedding in your own mansion with expansive well manicured grounds. Horses in the modern stables. Two or three 4x4s and a butler plus assorted servants to help with the reception. Are the proceedings normal or are they normal plus?Undercurrents do eventually surface. The two sisters who centre the story are a clash of types. The creative and the stoic. The father is a s...bag. You may disagree. This is a live action story with the drama both extreme AND non-existent. Isn't that how middle-class problems are dealt with? Some other place, not in conversation and never admitted.Looming doom.

This movie gives you something to chew on long after it is over. We start with a wedding; a beginning so to speak. Yet underneath the beauty, opulence, and hope, there is ugliness, bitterness and deep despair. The bride is \\"off\\"; her family alternates between cold and inappropriate. The groom becomes increasingly marginalized. Like a moon slowly approaching its fullness, Justine's world and her sanity seems to unravel. Her depression is unexplained and seems incongruent with her life. Sister Claire is ever present, holding the seams together as best she can.In the second half of the movie it is Claire whose world falls apart, figuratively and in reality. Justine emerges from her purgatory and calmly faces impending and certain doom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facing mortality...","review":"\\"Melancholia\\" (2011) is directed and written by Lars von Trier (Anti-Christ, Dancer in the Dark, Dogville). The movie is set in a timeless future on a wealthy estate during a wedding party just before the Earth is about to collide with the rogue planet called Melancholia. The film opens with a long slow motion sequence that depicts the \\"Dance of Death\\" of the two planets, and the principle characters in the film. The movie is then divided in two parts based on each of the two sisters: Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), as they deal with their difficulties and realizations about themselves, the people around them, and their bleak future. The film is a memorable and striking commentary about disenchantment with one's life, and facing one's imminent mortality.The blu-ray has numerous special features, including the making of the film, about the special effects, and visual style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Row, Row, Row Your Boat....Life Is But A Dream...","review":"And like a dream, infuriating and surreal, this movie is one to love or hate, and perhaps both. I was committed to stick with it, although it didn't become much more coherent once the symphonic 10 minute slow-mo introduction was over. There were lots of subtly surreal moments, as well as those designed to overtly push our buttons, but in the end it is all clearly a meditation on death (perhaps through the lens of \\"clinical depression\\", but not limited by it). And the protagonist (Dunst), who was most effected by Melancholia (the approaching rogue planet), was the one most ready for (a good) death. The corollary is that the ones most in denial were the least accepting. Nothing revelatory here, but the fact it was even looked at may be.This is a slick movie with high production value, great cast, and artful pretensions, but it surely isn't ordinary Hollywood. It is also one whose metaphors will stick with me for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"unusual & Romantic~","review":"Melacholia is the best movie I have seen in awhile. Fresh & disturbing at the same time...how do people deal with an ending? The people you expect to be strong may not be & those that seem flawed might end up being the strongest. I think this movie deals with what we expect to happen & what will actually happen~ isn't that what life is all about? The sisters have a close connection; very lovely in this way.

I love this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly depressing and very slow at getting to the literal end","review":"I didn't care for this movie at all. This isn't even a sad but cathartic movie... It was just horribly depressing. Like Titanic, you know what's going to happen, but it happens soooooo slowly! It's not worth the ride, especially if the ride makes you feel like there's no hope and you might as well end it all.Would not recommend this to anyone.Now I need to go watch something happy and joyful just to wash this sludge off of me...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressed beware!!!","review":"I do not mind post apocalyptic tales, but there are few words for this. While it might be a cinematic wonder, it leaves no hope for humanity. A film should take you away from reality, yet inspire hope. I was anticipating an ending, but not the despair of Justine and the cloaked despair of her sister.If you have ever been treated for or think you had the slightest bit of depression, DO NOT SEE THIS FILM. Even those with perfect mental health will have to fight to maintain a sense that there is some hope for the survival of humankind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"The trailer made this movie look appealing.... big name stars and a fantastical sci-fi plot.

A total waste of time, I would have been much happier watching a documentary or political debate.... 'nuff said!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, boring and confusing","review":"We almost turned it off during the introduction as it was long, drawn out and pointless.

Don't watch it and save yourself the agony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious, boring, awful, caca!","review":"Do not waste your time on this boring, self-indulgent crap! The script is rediculous, the characters are unrealistic outside of an asylem (though we're meant to accept them as \\"real\\") and everyone feels so sorry for themselves you'll want to kill yourself after the first half hour, a which point you'll probably turn it off like I did just to save your own life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried too hard to be art...","review":"...from the very beginning.

The rest of the movie plays out in regular time, but is just as slow and tedious.This is just about the worst movie you can imagine.

I was wrong. Some beautiful images but the plot, such as it was, was asinine; the characters were wooden, even though many of them are excellent actors; and von Trier's passion for extended cuts made the film seem to take forever. Oh and then the physics (or lack of it). A rogue planet is approaching the Earth? From where? Perhaps von Trier read an article one day about the risk of an asteroid hitting the Earth and confused \\"planet\\" with \\"asteroid\\" but the image is that of a planet. Why is Hollywood so lazy when it comes to getting physics right? Rockets that make right angle turns, guns that go whoosh in a vacuum and now a planet that approaches the Earth without anybody noticing and without any gravitational effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Had to stop watching halfway through.

Both my wife and I got so motion sick that we started fast forwarding through the movie because we were close to throwing up.

This film is a train wreck from the begining to the end. I have read the many reviews and though I would give it a try, but boy was I diaapointed. Don't waste any time on this one, even if you're locked in a middle seat on a plane in economy class at 40,000 feet.

Totally depressing, nuts and depraved.","review":"We strongly suggest you do not watch this awful movie. We made the mistake of doing so last night.Worst movie with the most depressing feeling after.It's about a super rich family (mansion with own private 18 hole golf course and lake and horses) who are unbelievably nuts, dysfunctional and awful to each other. A planet called \\"Melancholia\\" comes in and smashes into the earth and kills everyone. The whole movie is filmed on the estate."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressive","review":"This movie is awful.

That said, it's probably one of the most pretentious films ever made. In the end, I found it very distasteful -- the perfect atheistic counterpart to Terrence Malick's TREE OF LIFE (which I loved). My favorite thing about MELANCHOLIA: Kirsten Dunst's nude planet-bathing. I found a lot about this film to be straight up dorky, and I'd like to add a note to any aspiring filmmakers: slapping Wagner's beautiful music into your film doesn't (by default) create high art.

The art of this film is about the equivelent of someone rubbing crap on a canvas. I saw no beauty in this film. Non existant script. No point. No satements of any kind, political or spirtual. A repeating score of five notes that sounds extremly dated. Paying to see this film was nothing short of theft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Recommend This","review":"There was nothing that drew me into this movie. I wanted to find some aspect that was worth saying something positive about, but I saw none. Don't watch this for any reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"no use","review":"Zero stars; negative-five stars. I like art movies with a strong signature - other things don't interest me much. But this one, like all too many of them, is nothing but a frontal attack on vitality and beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innovative Art.","review":"This gorgeous film has nothing to do whatsoever with the explosion of the planet. That is purely symbolic. It is a film solely about the massive depression and isloation of a family, and it focuses purely on two siblings, and how they are dealing with familial dysfunction, and their own mental self-destruction. The cinematography here is outstanding, the \\"choreography\\", if you will, pure genius, and the acting/direction of the highest quality. Not a film made to please the \\"masses\\". It's not Spielberg or Howard. This film, like Bergman's, deals with the complexity of feelings and the interaction of its characters. It is by far the best performance ever by Dunst, and where has the brillant Charlotte Gainsbourg been all my life (what a \\"face\\" packed with character). The demise of the planet is merely a set-technique to add drama and a background to a fascinating saga of psychological character. A fabulous movie, with great depth, emotion, and artistic innovation."},{"rating":"2","title":"First: This is an Art film. If you don't like Art Films - you won't like this film.","review":"I thought this film was amazing. Beautiful to look at and full of metaphors, symbolism & concepts to think about. This is the kind of thing Lars is best at. He takes his time when telling a story - so the pace here is slower than that of a regular movie. All of the important stuff has been accurately covered by other reviewers here... not much to say that they haven't. If you like Lars past work and enjoy Art House fare... you're gonna' love this. (I bought it because I felt it was such a strong work)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Masterpiece from Lars von Trier","review":"This is one of the best films of 2011, deeply philosophical and more than slightly pessimistic about human nature. It is not for everybody, but if you like films that challenge your preconceptions, then this film is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"Melancholia is a metaphysical film in the sense that it asks about the limits of existence. The film is an absolute masterpiece. It is clearly the best movie made in 2011 but, predictably, it has not received much press. Anyone should watch this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Boring, absurd script plot points that make no sense for the characters, as established (i.e. Kiefer Sutherland's demise, Groom's departure, etc.) Nice cinematography and fine performance by Charlotte Gainsbourg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...theres two hours of my life I will never get back...","review":"I don't know....maybe I just don't get it. The entire 1st half of the movie titled Justine... seriously? WTF I had to force myself to watch this to the end just on the hope that it might go somewhere. Nope never went anywhere. What the hell does the fist half have to do with the second half?? Do not watch this movie, you will be wasting your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow","review":"It just seems more happened off camera for the story than was revealed in the actual screen part of the story. It's like walking into a movie half way through it and trying to figure out who is who and what is what. And, what you can figure out isn't very interesting anyways. And what is with the mumbling of the lines? Very hard to hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic Portrayal of the Characters","review":"In a science fiction movie, I can forgive unrealistic portrayal of the science, but not the fiction. A writer or director can make his characters do or say anything. I couldn't enjoy this movie, not because it was depressing or because the science was implausible but because people just don't act the way these characters acted or if they do cannot possibly be as successful as these characters are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Depressing","review":"I had high hopes for this film from its reviews. After about twenty minutes in I started asking my friends if we could leave. This movie was painfully slow and tedious. True, the visuals were outstanding, but that can't make up for everything else. Yes the cast was wonderful as well, but the story itself was mediocre at best. All the characters were incredibly difficult to relate to and they all seemed to have mental issues which made them even more difficult to like. I feel like they could have just kept the first and last ten minutes of the movie (these were the best parts/visuals) and ditched the rest of the film. I have no problem with \\"indie\\" type films, but this one just didn't impress me. I didn't go in looking for an action movie but I went in looking for a movie with a clear direction. For me, this film was just too all over the place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!!!!","review":"Wow what can one say about this flick. Lots of great actors and actresses. Keifer Sutherland played an excellent part. He couldn't even take the movie and had to kill himself. Poor editing, crappy story line and probably the worst movie of its time. The only reason I gave it one star was for how hard we laughed making jokes during the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This is not an exciting end of the world flick. Melancholia is just depressing and odd. Two sisters deal with the end of the world in their own weird ways. The first half of the movie just makes you not like the sister that is featured. She seems very selfish and I don't think she even knows the world is ending at that point! The second half is more like I expected with a young mother trying to deal with the first weird sister, her husband and her son who thinks the whole end of the world is a science lesson from school. There are probably supposed to be \\"lessons\\" from the behavior of the horses, etc. but Melancholia is not well enough directed for any sense of things to come through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever....","review":"....with the most unlikeable characters you've ever seen. Tiresome, dull, insipid, whiny characters that make one want to slap them & yell \\"Get over it!\\" Don't bother with this movie - it's a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duck!!!!","review":"A fashion shoot masquerading as philosophy . . . buy Vogue instead, cheaper & more to think about. If you must, watch the first 10 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"great acting, cinematography, concept.....but a weak script","review":"The concept of this movie was a good one. The cinematography was absolutely fantastic. the acting was actually quite superb. the script is what just actually was terrible. so in other words this movie is basically a polished turd. its really sad because it really had serious potential and could have been absolutely great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disfunction Junction, What's Your Malfunction?","review":"I'm predisposed to like a Lars von Trier movie. He is one of the most challenging directors working today and I like a challenging movie. But, while I can appreciate what von Trier attempted with \\"Melancholia\\", for me, it didn't succeed. I can empathize with the extreme, debilitating depression portrayed. I recognize the metaphor of Melancholia destroying the world. I can recognize the good performances portraying severely damaged (but still not very interesting) people. The special effects are breathtaking without being oversold. There are a number of stunningly beautiful shots. A story, however, needs to be about something important and this attempt to reveal something important by focusing on the excruciatingly trivial, sadly, fails. It left me wanting to watch another movie about people I could care about facing the situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are You Kidding?","review":"Could this be any more boring, self-indulgent, or just plain time-wasting? This is not a movie; it's not a story; it's not much of anything really. There are no actual characters, just pretty people posturing and posing and pouting for the camera. Don't bother. It gets no stars from me but that wasn't an option so I gave it the one. Btw, I detest Transformers and its ilk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Most long, drawn out convoluted movie ever. Didn't help that the movie kept starting and stopping. Finally just gave up after one hour. Don't waste your time unless you want to get depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful mess of a movie.","review":"I only made it partially through this movie. A stellar cast could not make this movie work. There is a huge difference between being depressed & being a jerk. You can be depressed without being a jerk. Kirsten Dunst's character is a jerk, who happens to be depressed. I just wasn't buying the whole \\"I'm depressed, my life is terrible, I make bad choices\\" thing. The plot was painfully slow. Whatever the movie was trying to achieve, I freely admit that I didn't get it. Hated this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I need Prozac, STAT!","review":"This movie is so depressing, so plodding and so boring, I am still amazed I stayed through the whole thing. I love Kirsten Dunst and Alexander Skaarsgard, but they were virtually unlikeable in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie","review":"This was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. The plot was ridiculous and the entire movie dragged on and on. I've read other reviews from people who suffer from depression and they seem to have related to it. I have never suffered depression so I cannot relate to this movie at all nor do I see the point of it. Slow, boring, depressing, dark with not much of a plot. I gather we're supposed to feel for Justine but her actions are so selfish and destructive that it's difficult to understand her. I wish I hadn't wasted my time but I'm glad I didn't have to pay for this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visually interesting, but ultimately disappointing","review":"I enjoy unconventional films that take risks & give this film some credit for that. There are some creative & beautiful scenes that are done with subtlety, rather than blockbuster effects. But I found this film slow & meandering. Unlike Bergman, who illuminated his often depressing subjects with real insights & depth, I thought the subject of melancholia or depression was only presented in superficial bits & pieces. Not a terrible film & I can understand why some people enjoyed it, but I think the premise had great potential that was not realized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying very hard to imitate art","review":"This looks like it could have had potential. A movie is supposed to mean something in more than one way unless it is just fun and entertaining, which this is not. This movie is the creation of an obviously self-important narcissist who expected the world to admire his beauty as he. Don't waste your time unless you want to take a stab at a stab at cinema. Or unless you are a psych student looking for term paper material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I have seen in a long time","review":"Art house crap!

But, alas, the only thing I did enjoy was the first surrealist 10 or so minutes, which were visually stunning. After that, I was just waiting for all the annoying characters to be eliminated (although the Justine character (Kristin Dunst) is somewhat redeemed of her irritating melancholy at the end of the movie). There are 3 basically 3 parts to the movie - The Wedding, The sister of the Bride and The End. As, I have said, the 3rd part was eagerly anticipated after sitting for over 2 hours watching this dysfunctional family await the inevitable.

One shot has the female lead (Dunst) relieving herself on a golf course, couldn't tell if it was 1 or 2.... It was extremely boring overall. Spoiler: just skip to the last 15 minutes & you get the whole Science Fiction part in a nutshell. Seemed to me each character had some sort of mental disorder.

What I think others and myself appreciate about this film is it's documentary-like commentary on the state of a human condition that no one wants to talk about. Others have wrote that this is a film about loss, destruction, and internal and external implosion. I agree. What I appreciate about this film is its ability to take human emotion and not exploit it and pigeonhole it's multiplicity as this \\"look-at-me\\" destructo-force. Most loss, destruction, etc. is silent, subtle, and incremental, making it thus the more heartbreaking. It's not a rational movie, it's not a movie about reason- but something more humane- struggle and pain. A thoughtful rendition of such concepts. The absurdity of the movie is the heart of the movie! Marks for creativity and challenging the status quo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Melancholia","review":"Among the worst movies I have ever seen in my life.

This coma inducing, navel gazing cinematic torture session has only a strong cast to save it from being a total travesty.Kirsten Dunst is fantastic as the deranged bride at the end of the world. Charlotte Gainsbourg also registers strongly as her sister. John Hurt turns up looking like an alcoholic Baron Munchausen, Charlotte Rampling is the harridan from Hell mother of the bride (makes you pine for Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS) and von Trier perennial Udo Kier provides a comic relief of sorts.Von Trier seems to be getting worse as a filmmaker and his usual nihilistic attitudes abound. Women are usually whores, loonies or nutbusters (or a combination there of) and the men are aggressive abusers or doormats.Apparently making movies helps von Trier deal with his depression, this seems like a very elaborate and expensive way of doing it.And it's the audience who really suffers here.Ugh!

THe movie gives the message that this life on planet earth is all there is, and this simply is not the truth.. The movie is SAD because it gives the message that life on this fallen planet is all there is. This is one of the biggest lies humans believe. THe truth is that there is God creator and God is spirit who is personal and created us in his image, male and female. When we die and leave our physical bodies, our souls and spirits don't just rest. Our lives are not meaningless. If they were, there would be no morale. We exist because of something greater than ourselves. We don't exist to exist. That is impossible. THis movie's message was incorrect with a great error in its worldview."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty pictures with little substance.","review":"While comprised of sometimes striking cinematography, on the whole Melancholia lacks both artistic merit and entertainment value. After patiently waiting through an attempt to build a sense of despondence and dysfunction in its remote cast of caricatures, the movie simply flat-lines. There is little development in plot, dialogue, circumstance, theme, or humanity. In the end, and this is little spoiler as we see it happen in the beginning, the planet, absurdly named \\"Melancholia,\\" appears in a completely unrelated \\"deus ex machina\\" moment. Unfortunately, there is no appreciable predicament from which the characters are rescued. There is no problem solved or subtle nuance revealed. A bored girl is simply snuffed out next to her somewhat placated relatives. The only useful element brought by the appearance of the planet is, thankfully, the end of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and awful.","review":"What was the point of this movie?

I tried really hard to like this movie and was extremely confused by the good reviews it received. This movie literally made time move slow and was painful to watch.

It is not sci-fi; the end of the world by planetary colision is only a device to give some finality to a mentaly ill cast. What little humanity any of the charicters had in the begining of the film they through away at first chance. This is a 'Nausea' of a film missing the final chapter. At least Sartre, after stripping any of his readers of any joy, enexplicitialy, said, \\"and he was 'somehow' happy, this film is a sick snuff film of the soul.This is beyond 'don't waist your time'; this is an invitation to athiests to believe in a hell for people who make a movie this vile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prentitious, long and dull","review":"This is another pretentious claptrap that uses CGI for some fancy animation about death (ENTER THE VOID, PAN'S LABYRINTH) for 10 minutes, then it's 2 hours of boring, rich white folk's problems shot on a handheld camera. I'm sure Lars von Trie thought he was satirizing the Bourgeoisie, but he really romanticizes it. I've seen more interesting things come out of my dog's ass.

This is an absolutely amazing piece of work. Kirsten Dunst is sublime.

I don't smoke pot either but there I was chowing down on a pan of brownies while watching this. When he talked about MY upcoming colonoscopy (a week from Monday) I began to wonder - was Kevin Nealon been stalking me? What am I going to do? Now hear me out, I'm not the paranoid type, but that's neither here nor there.

It's not just the writing thats terrible and unfunny, but also his incredibly bad delivery. He's awkward (in a bad way) and uneasy throughout the special and lacks any of the character traits he expresses in his acting. This is not so much a stand up special as it is a list of talking points which Kevin fails to develop into humor. Watching the first five minutes it became clear to me that Kevin Nealon only got a special because of his work on Weeds, he has no place in stand-up. I beg everyone who enjoys Kevin's work on SNL and Weeds on avoid this special!! It will seriously erode any respect and admiration you have for the man. It's clear after watching this that Kevin Nealon is not so much a funny person as he is a funny actor. Stick to acting, Kevin, please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review by student Philip Holtzlander","review":"If I had to put this story on a scale of 1 to 10, I would have to say it's a high 8.

With this approval, for many patients electro-convulsive therapy will no longer be the most aggressive way to treat their chronic disease. Max Fink's book is very helpful in explaining and comforting a patient that is fearful of ECT. There is a terrible stigma associated with shock therapy. If it works, the relapse rate is high.

I am glad to hear more of his music this year but it is not enough. He is so talented that it blows me away that the radio DJs are not \\"overplaying\\" his songs (like so many undertalented artisits).

Flood-get a grip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I DON'T UNDERSTAND...","review":"This album was one of my favorites, I think the objections to its mastering: too much bass etc. are totally trivial; that's why the equalization settings have been placed on your audio equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Titanic\\" of Erasure albums","review":"Being a long-time fan of Erasure, I'm surpised and shocked to find such a misfire amongst their rather accomplished catalogue. The recording is muffled, the melodies go nowhere, and Erasure seems to be lost adrift at sea. So bad that no one would release it in the USA for good reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"How dissappointing. Their last album was the pinnacle of their career in my opinion, and then this.....Bland, limp and terribly mixed. It's as if they recorded it on a boom box in their bedroom. There are a few catchy hooks, spread throughout, but I stretched so hard to find melody and feeling in this, and it didn't work. I'm going to allow them another chance though. 15 years of consistent energy, melody, and magic.....this will be their \\"miss\\". Go back to the studio boys, and do what you know best! Fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Briefly...","review":"This is a little different from what we die-hard fans are used to:There are some *acoustic* guitars.Some of the beats are kind of trippy.But aside from that...it's great music, and it gets me daydreaming like it used to when I first heard Erasure...14 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cowboy-Less Loveboat","review":"Of course I love this CD, but Freedom, Here In My Heart, and Catch 22 are the only 'Cowboy-ful\\" tunes on the CD. I own the entire Erasure collection and feel Cowboy is the best accomplishment by this amazing duo. It's a masterpiece! On the other end, Loveboat is a great CD, but the songs evaporate after a listen, while Cowboy stayed in your head and heart for hours upon hours. I wish I could have given it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that?","review":"I'm a big fan of erasure but when I popped in this CD I was totally amazed at how bad it was. I wasn't even sure if Andy was singing in one of the songs....some songs just seem like they are thrown together without regard to them sounding good at all. Some people like it, some hate it, I just don't see how anyone can really say this is a good CD. I dont really care if they try to make a statement or a new sound, if it sounds bad it sounds bad,,,but then it's all up to personal opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISSAPOINTMENT","review":"I have followed and have been a fan of erasure since wonderland. Before that of depeche mode and yazoo. I have waited in anticipation for each of the erasure releases, but this is by far the worst of the batch. The sound quality for one is terrible, you can't even hear the lyrics. It's an album full of ambient mumblings put to incoherent music. Save your money and buy the Freedom single, it's the only thing that I can listen to on the entire album. That and the packaging are the only redeeming qualities of this bomb. What a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh God! I'm so SORRY!","review":"Help! Can it be a mistake? I checked the name at least three times on the album to make sure it was \\"Erasure\\" and not a ripoff like \\"Eraysure.\\" Alas, it is Erasure and I've been betrayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst album in duo history","review":"El album mas desastrozo en toda la carrera del grupo. Sinceramemte no puedo creer que sea tan flojo este trabajo, despues de 3 a?os de inactividad. Creo que deja muy mal parado al grupo y empa?a de manera significativa toda la trayectoria lograda hasta Cowboy. Un consejo... bajen desde mp3 algunos temas y luego resuelvanse a comprarlo o no."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Aboard!","review":"\\"Loveboat\\" is the followup to Erasure's 1997 \\"Cowboy,\\" a release that can only be described as average, at best. This record doesn't equal the heights of their self titled 1995 release or \\"I Say I Say I Say,\\" but it's still a welcome return to form. The first thing I noticed is the use of the acoustic guitar, which can be heard on the single, \\"Freedom\\" and the goregous \\"Love is the Rage.\\" Elsewhere, it's business as usual. \\"Here in My Heart\\" is classic Erasure: catchy chorus and a hook strong enough to grab Jaws. \\"Crying in the Rain\\" is also another infectious stomper, with its thick bassline and bleeping synths. As of this writing, this album has yet to be released domestically, indicating the possible demise of Erasure's career in the US. But if you can get your hands on this import, it's worth it. \\"Loveboat\\" is a decent album that should please many fans of this long-enduring duo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad Music","review":"I have heard every Erasure release to date. I was thoroughly disappointed in this release. The songs have great potential, but with the muffled singing and over the top bass, I could not get any feeling from the songs. Surprised, I must admit. I sincerely hope this is not the beginning of the end?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trailer for Carnies","review":"Length:: 1:10 MinsI thought you might like to see the trailer for Carnies.Carnies"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfriendly, but good for advanced practice","review":"Cons:1) Definitely not for beginners, it presuposes a more than basic understanding of German grammar and vocabulary.2) Extremely brief explantions before the execises. If you are a beginner, you'd better look for a frendlier book; if you are intermediate, they can only serve as a reminder of what you already know.3) Rustic, typewriter style. Accents and umlaugs are handwritten, letters have varying darkness and thickness, no images or visual aids whatsoever.4) Keys at the end of the book are compressed, apparently to save space, making it more laborious to verify some of them.Pros:1) Plenty of exercises.I'd only recommend it to german speakers who stopped practicing for a long period of time and now want to recover vocabulary by doing plenty of written exercises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful despite Appearance","review":"When I received this book, or booklet, I was somewhat disappointed. The typeface and layout look like a highschool handout from 1965. But the content and organization are excellent. Mysteries of German (some of them anyway) are explained for the first time. Also ways of organizing German vocabulary into thoughtful and somewhat predictible groups are included. So, once you get over the initial shock of the format, this book provides a lot of valuable content."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to waste time, this is the way to go.","review":"I as at a friend of mine's house when her kids popped this little number in the VCR. Not long after, they were bounding around while I sat helplessly. Roger G. seemed to show how to dance with an oragutan, and the dancing kids showed only an obvious fraudelent enthusiasm. It was not fun at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mix of Science Fiction and Mystery","review":"As a graduate of UW-P I was first interested in All The Gold of Ophir because it was written by an Electrical Engineering Professor at UW-P. After I read it I made a trip back to my Alma Mater so that I could get my copy signed and meet the author. I consider myself am avid Science Fiction fan, I have over 1000 books from the Masters of Science Fiction, Heinlein, Asimov, E.E. 'Doc' Smith, etc. I would say that David Drury's contribution is as good or better than 80% of my collection. If it weren't, I wouldn't have purchased his second book and made a second trip back to UW-P for a signing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho. HUM.","review":"I HAVE all of these!! Why the heck do they keep making these \\"Collectors Editions\\" with the same darn episodes!! I want to see season 4 and UP episodes. I agree with other comments about that. WHY NOT MAKE SEASONS!!

STUPID shows have seasons, why can't an entertaining Icon like THIS one have seasons?!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy book","review":"The only piece of info I trust in this book was actually on the book jacket: Beinhart is a novelist. Listen, the WMD \\"case\\" was trumped up...we all know that now. But this book is no more than a thinly disguised rant about Bush and Cheney, how Bush stole the election, blah blah blah. Of course it's \\"balanced\\" with helpful facts about how Clinton personally ushered the economy into its white hot expansion in the late 1990's. What a load of hogwash. This book is itself one garguantuan Fog Fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looooved it!!","review":"I really didn't knew how much difference could it make to my hair.. but it really does.. i normally use the hair dryer and then the flat iron... all that normally took me around 20 min, not it just takes me half of that.LOOOOVE IT!.. i definitely recommend this product!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top notch!","review":"I love Elizabeth George. I love how she weaves the stories and history of her characters and her eye for detail. The language is effortless and there's always that little clue that I always miss, and at the conclusion makes total sense.In Missing Joseph I thought I had the murderer pinned down. Several times, infact. I was wrong.Chilling page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying Book","review":"If you enjoy previous Elizabeth George books you will enjoy this book also. It is a bit slow moving at times, but the storyline is interesting and the conclusion satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and engrossing","review":"This is an excellent, deeply atmospheric novel. The supporting characters are developed in a great deal of detail and they are given the chance to reveal themselves slowly and to help the reader sink into the story, which has many layers and is closely tied to a physical sense to place.This is fundamentally a novel about love and parenthood. The Deborah and Simon story blends very successfully with the murder investigation here, and this is also a fairly deep study of the dynamics of sex and love. It wil stay with you for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Who? Why?","review":"This is the third George \\"mystery\\" I have read following Deception on His Mind and A Great Deliverance. While I find George to be a talented writer, I almost didn't finish this book. At first I felt drawn into the story, but by the end I didn't care. It wasn't just the length, although it was certainly too long, but the boredom on my part. The mystery wasn't a \\"who done it\\" but rather a \\"why did she do it.\\" (This is the same type of effect used in A Great Deliverance.) Havers remains nebulous, Linley is a bore, and let's not even mention Lady Helen--please. The victim never quite becomes three dimensional. I know at the beginning there would be something about adoption given the St. James's problems so that wasn't even a suprise. I will not read any further George mysteries. While the individual parts are interesting, the whole is disappointing and not worth the effort to read it. This is sad because I've also been turned off on Martha Grimes as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK? Does Havers EVER Get a Life?","review":"I started reading this series on my mother's recommendation... she told me that the mysteries were very romantic and that there was a very interesting woman character (Havers) and an English lord who develop a wonderful relationship....NOT! Come on, Mom! Havers is the most abused heroine I've ever encountered. How many times has George described her with a bovine adjective? I keep reading these books waiting for Havers to \\"Get a Life\\" but I am not sure that she will ever be so generously rewarded. Meantime, I have to wade through every PC topic known to mankind... incest, abortion, child abuse, teen sex... whatever sells."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great George Book","review":"From its poetic beginning to its haunting completion, this is a stunning work. George, in her early works, has a way of building scenes that almost makes the characters secondary. The opening scene in the art museum really is as good as anything she's ever written; both Deborah St. James and Robin Sage are linked, more than anything, by that opening setting.The story unfolds masterfully from there. The characters are intriguing without being one-dimensional, and the mystery is pretty complex -- so much so that I nearly gave up in the middle because I thought I had figured it out and could jump to the end. Continuing to read, however, I learned how wrong I was in my early conclusions and how well George tied everything together so the ending is both shocking and foretold."},{"rating":"1","title":"ENGLAND in the 1950's","review":"Something I didn't see mentioned before buying this book is that it's about ENGLAND in the 1950's. If that's what you're looking for, I'd give it four stars. But since that's not mentioned anywhere I only give it two."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL MEMENTO","review":"I bought this CD to try and recapture the magic of the Vegas show, which I saw twice in one week. But when listening to the CD on its own I realized how extraordinary beautiful the music is , even without a show to accompany it. I would classify it as the most outstanding Cirque du Soleil soundtrack you can buy right now. Very well produced and beautifully performed, this CD will be played for a very long time in my humble abode. PS -Make an effort to see \\"Ka\\" and \\"O\\" at least once in your life... the best two shows in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong and refresh music","review":"I own several Cirque Du Soleil's CDs, this comes to my 2nd favorite. My all time favor of Cirque Du Soleil is Varekai because of its story line, the composition of the music, needless to say, the Fire Within on Bravo TV.KA is good as well, but I just don't like that last few pieces, specifically, my ears just don't do well with that female singer's voice. Nothing against her personally, just don't feel right to hear her voice.The choir is great, music is great, if you can listen with good sound system, you should be able to feel the battle field.It has the 5-star potential if they have different female singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smarmy seller with a smart mouth","review":"Yes, I should have looked more carefully at the product details - oh sure - it's only the liner notes, not the CD at all. Wha...? So, in answer to my asking for a refund, the seller writes: \\"You should learn to read before ordering.\\" What happened to - if not the customer is right - at least, the costumer is not an idiot for imagining that a used cd might be had for 7 bucks?This happened in 2009, but somehow, I'm still insulted. Be careful what you order from this seller, who seems to depend on the very carelessness for which I was berated.If there were such a thing as zero stars, or dwarf stars, that is what I would click."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's about the Effects, NOT the Performances","review":"I have seen 3 other Cirque's, Mystere (fantastic), O (great) and the one in Orlando (Okay). This one was a total disappointment. It was all about smoke, grunts, lights and the stage. In fact, the stage was the star of the show.There were NO breathtaking acts like the other shows. The music was canned, not live. The only \\"performances\\" were a baton twirler (very lame .. better ones at high school football games), two guys who ran on the outsides of two rotating wire cages (okay but not really Wow!), and an aerial act that was so so.At $150 per ticket I feel totally ripped off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels like you are there again","review":"Probably would have to have seen the production to appreciate the music.

The music is fantastic, it was like seeing the show all over again. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Immensely enjoyable soundtrack!","review":"I loved the show when I first watched it, and the soundtrack was a huge part of the experience. If you've already seen the show, you already know what you're getting on this CD. If not, expect a mix of dramatic music that sounds like it could have come from numerous cultures (just as the characters from the show). If you're ever in Vegas, the show is a must see (especially for the final battle). The only reason I knocked off one star was because the CD would not play in iTunes and that I had to use other software to listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!","review":"Only by listening to the CD, I'm already captivated.Can't wait for the chance to go Vegas to attend the show....!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too old to help","review":"I bought this book because I found that Gann maintained the author's name on his list of books to read. However, I did not find any useful information from a trading perspective. He does a decent job in covering directional astrology though, which is the title of the book after all.

Not only that, but a single screw mounts each end of the bar and ours was very wobbly. I couldn't live with it and we've replaced it with Moen (all metal)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice but didn't last long","review":"I bought this item a year ago and installed when we remodeled our bathroom. It looks great and has worked great until about a month ago when the bar attachment came apart which quickly led to the entire bar falling off the wall.

As such, its hard to classify. Maybe that's why these outstanding tracks from the late sixties remained in a can until 1999. Thankfully they were eventually released.Had \\"Search For The Inner Self\\" been release at the time, it would've been a monster hit. It features harps, strings and a killer bassline. Think Motown's tight musicianship, Lou Rawls' mellow tenor and Burt Bacharach's songwriting.[DW]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"And waste of money if you buy this. There are no brilliant ideas in this book and it's poor written and non-intuitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way different from Plum","review":"Love the Stephanie Plum series, but this was terrible. I usually stick with the worst books no matter what, but I gave up on this one after stomaching 2/3rds of it. She had something, a glimmer of setting, character...but it was cheesy, patronizing, insipid, ridiculous, cliche...icky boring mess. The daffy but determined heroine, the strong, manly man...and in two days of cliches, they realize they love each other. Ugh. This is a book for a thirteen year old girl, except for the abundant soft porn sex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manhunt","review":"I am a serious fan of Janet Evanovich and have been for many years. I know that most of her books have the same formula but it works for me. When I want to read for entertainment (which is most of the time) I know that I will enjoy anything that she has written. I love her characters, I love the situations and I love her sense of humor. I wish I could really talk like that,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Book I Downloaded!","review":"This book by Janet Evanovich is not what I downloaded.

I immedietely fell in love with all the characters and was rooting for them from the beginning. That and being set in Alaska made it the more interresting.

I am wondering how good the series are...Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, light hearted read","review":"I liked this quick, light hearted read.

Manhunt wasn't even funny. It was poorly written and had nothing to recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disappointing","review":"so glad she went on to the Plum series, which I absolutely love. Manhunt is certainly superfluff, boring, silly silly silly. did not like it at all. Back to Plum PLEASE! This book being 'reissued' is no favor to Evanovich lovers. A real letdown. I guess she had to start somewhere and she has indeed honed her skills to 5 stars with her later books."},{"rating":"1","title":"a yawn","review":"My review may be unfair since I quit reading at page 70 when I admitted to myself that I was bored out of my mind and couldn't find any enthusiasm to go further.

The Kindle is quite capable of handling photos, so why were they left out?? The photos and maps play an important part in the story and I was very disappointed to see that they were missing. Otherwise, in the first two chapters that I've read, the story is very good and one that is of great interest. I'm guessing that when I'm done I'll be very pleased with the book, but I would send a word of caution to those considering buying the Kindle version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Book","review":"You have listed the wrong book.

Happy reading!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good indulgent fun","review":"In the mood for something quick, fun and incredibly indulgent? \\"Manhunt\\" has a simple plot with characters the reader can easily care about. Short and a page-turner, \\"Manhunt\\" embodies the trashy romance novel to a T in every positive way. For those who hate wading through the first 50 pages to get to the meat of a book, \\"Manhunt\\" takes no time drawing the reader into the story.

As a good change of pace the story line wasn't overwhelmed by sex scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute story","review":"This book it different from her Stephanie Plum series. It is a story about a woman uprooting herself to start a new life in Alaska, with the main goal of finding a husband. Haven't we all thought of doing something similar at one point or another? Good characters, the story moves along well. I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Simple, Yet Interesting Kundalini Introduction","review":"Originally, I enjoyed doing this DVD at night because it truly left me relaxed and was simple, but worked the body and nervous system. I think Gurutej Kaur has a marvelous way of describing how the chakras relate to our practical existence. It was this \\"tune up\\" which made me investigate kundalini yoga because I could directly observe how this type of yoga altered my entire disposition. This is a great introduction to this esoteric body/mind technology. The only reason I am knocking one star off of its rating is that I wish Gurutej Kaur would have created a true kundalini kriya or set without long breaks where she explains each exercize. She could have easily described each exercise's benefits over a workout sequence like Ravi Singh does and created a tighter set. Despite this fact, it is still a good addition to a kundalini DVD library."},{"rating":"1","title":"PATHETICALLY BORING!!","review":"This book is so boring. It has no plot whatsoever and it is a waste of time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly horrible!","review":"This book turned out to be completely diferent then I expected. It starts off with a good story line and then the book takes a turn for the worst. Don't get me wrong, I read this entire book in one sitting, but only in hopes that the story would do another about face and actually turn back into the story I had hoped it would be. The ending was not predictable at all, and for the first time I find that this quality takes away from the book. Despite the unpicturesque turn of events, the book basically just ends. If you like books that focus more on the shallow, slutty aspects of teenage discovery then this is the book for you. If not this book would be a waste of time and valueble book shelf space."},{"rating":"1","title":"typical beach read","review":"This book was exactly what I thought it would be. An easy & predictable read. It was very forgettable to be honest, but I read it in 3 days. I contemplated not finishing it but I decided to. It was so predictable, I could have told you the ending by the end of the 3rd chapter. I found the main character to be annoying. I also felt that the author tried to develop each of the characters but didn't succeed in doing so. Instead you ended up with a little bit of information about a whole bunch of characters instead of a lot of information on a few characters. It was really, really easy to read too which came in handy to get it over with quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME, yet abrupt","review":"This book was a good book, and keeps me reading. Every time I read this book, I find more things. Unfortunatly, there doesn't seem to be enough information about what goes on AFTER Colleen gets her parents. The stories ends rather abruptly, leaving you hanging. Either Ms. Clark has to write a sequel or the book should be extened to add more information about the events that occur AFTER the current ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Story!","review":"I have to be totally honest..I was roaming around in the young adult section at my local library and saw this short thick book and looked at the cover and thought, \\"Oh hey, maybe this will be good.\\" This book was completely AMAZING! I really wished that my local library had more of her books because I would check them out! I finished this story in less then 24 hours and I could not put this book down. I usually like stories about teenaged girls that are in high school and are preppy, rich, pretty, etc. This book is not something I'm used to and I love it and I'm happy that I read it because now I am out of my shell of those stereotypical books that I used to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"backpack","review":"The quality is not so good.

First, the front latch broke, which made it hard to close to enable play. Then the rear left hinge broke, making the unit unusable. Interior inspection revealed that both parts were built without much fatigue resistance, making them subject to mechanical failure. The Sony optics and electronics continued to work, but the mechanical case parts were poorly designed. Additionally, the picture is small and grainy, really only suitable for a young child. The max battery life was a bit under 2 hrs and the unit was unable to play when charging. No vehicle adapter was included.

I inmediately made a search in the amazon review and it turns out to be an old equipment, maybe refurnished, maybe not, but it definitely had a problem with the battery. Thanks to the Amazon reviews I found out that there was a recall back in 2006 or 2008, I used this argument with the store and fortunately they game me the money back so my daughter could pick something else.The product is small, portable, if you want to use it whit the plug, go ahead but kids want to carry it around...and it is not possible because the batteries won't charge."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your money","review":"I bought one of these for my son and to date it has not worked at all.

Then the player stops reading the DVDs and freezes constantly. All in all, it was about a week of using it and I still hear my son ask me for this broken player. We sent it back for a refund and are looking for a replacement that is more reliable.

What I recieved was a book with graphic violence for example instead of eating sheep this wolf is eating the nieghbors and finally the little boy himself. The wolf is shown picking his teeth while a pile of bones and clothing lay on the floor beside him. This book is also sexually explicit because it depicts the boy naked from behind with a penis hanging between his legs. Because of the content of the book the message of honesty was lost. Instead of a lesson in honesty my daughter recieved a lesson in sexuality and violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it.","review":"Didn't like this book as much as the story I remember as a child.

I had to make up an ending once I started to read the end of it to her that it all was a joke because she was scared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the original story!!","review":"We decided to get this book thinking what a good lesson it would tell our 5 year old son. We were hoping it was the Aesop fable retelling with more pictures. We were very disappointed to find instead a totally different plot not suitable for a bedtime story since the wolf eats the people! First he eats the adults who scold the boy for lying then he eats the boy! The pictures leave no way to tell this story differently since they show left behind articles from those who were eaten. This book is better suited for an older reader or an adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Commercial Policy","review":"I need a copy of this story for my 4 year old daughter to stress the fact that she shouldn't cry unless something is truly wrong.

The biggest difference between the two is that the protagonist of this book, John Lawrence, is a fatally flawed idealist, whereas the fictional Flashman is a cad, coward, opportunist, and pragmatist of the first order. It is worth noting that the Flashman character lives well into his nineties, while Lawrence dies young."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is a truly miserable book. Although it is supposed to take place during the Revolutionary War, the characters talk like they're from southern California or New York's Upper West Side. And all this new age verbiage about the characters understanding their feelings. I half expected that some of Mr. Lussier's characters would be taking time out from the Revolution to make a cell call to their analysts. I see that some of the reviewers have criticised this book because of its bad history. I'm no historian but it sure didn't seem right to me. And as literature it's boring, pretentious and just plain bad. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Mine is For Sale","review":"I found this book incredibly silly and, contrary to what other reviewers have stated, not at all well written. In fact, I found its style sophmoric at best. I am interested in American history and would have really liked this book if it had measured up to its reviews. Alas, to my mind, this feel way short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh-Uh","review":"A reading of \\"Last Refuge...\\"(brought about by its engaging title and concept) makes you wish that (a) the parenthesis had never been invented), (b) the founding fathers were still around to wash out Mr. Lussier's mouth with soap, and (c) I'd spent my $... on video movies. History has been my bag for over 50 years, and I can tell you with some authority, this ain't it! Unlike many other fables told to you by your elders, the accepted stories of our founders are pretty close to the truth. They were heros. But they did some foolish things, too. After all, it was the first time they or anyone else had tried to invent a working democracy. They left a lot of deserving folks behind (females, slaves, veterans, etc.), but they also left behind written guides as to how all of these citizens could catch up. This paper work still works! Pretty good for a bunch of guys who were gambling everything they had."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Laurens, not John Lawrence!","review":"Paul Lussier's main character, John Lawrence, hates his father Henry, longs for true love, and finds solace in a pet turtle named Apollo. In a fit of rage, Henry strangles Apollo and throws her against the wall, shattering her shell. A isconsolate John takes the shell shards and fashions a necklace that he wears for the remainder of his life. You learn these facts in the book's first fifty pages and, believe me, that's as good as it gets.If you're interested in a book on the Revolution that won't waste your time, read Gregory D. Massey's John Laurens and the American Revolution, a wonderful biography of the historical figure on whom John Lawrence is \\"loosely\\" based. John Laurens and his father Henry's loving yet conflicted relationship and their efforts to grapple with the dichotomy between a struggle for liberty and their own ownership of slaves forms one of the most moving stories of the Revolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!!!!!!!","review":"LAST REFUGE OF SCOUNDRALS by Paul Lussier is a historical novel of the best sort, filled with plenty of historical facts and details that bring the characters and the times alive. The author's keen eye for detail maks the 1700s a living, breathing place where we meet our \\"founding fathers\\" and the anonymous masses who really won the American Revolution. This is history at its most human level - with each character painted in brilliant colors, yet each so real you can smell their sweat. Here we see the founding fathers (or were they?) warts and all, politicians who make you want to shout, laugh and tear your hair - just like the ones we read about in today's newspapers. There is a truth here that shines far brighter than the lessons I remember from my American history classes. And the pages of this book turn much faster. Paul Lussier asks us to really question authority and to dust of the facts we accept as reality to see what they actually look like."},{"rating":"2","title":"FICTION TRUER THAN FACT","review":"I loved this book because it captures what I've always felt about history -- that you can't write accurate history simply by hewing to facts. Whose facts are they? Which facts are you leaving out? How could, for example, any \\"historical\\" recreation of the Vietnam War ever accurately and faithfully capture the surreal nature of that war? This author seems to understand that the story of the American Revolution is more than the sum of the facts; it's a story that can only be faithfully captured in fiction form. The reader/reviewer from NC who insulted the people who've liked this book because he thinks they don't know the difference between fact and fiction misses the point altogether: sometimes fiction is truer than fact. That, it seems to me, is the author's ultimate point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated. These reviews are pandering and perhaps paid for.","review":"I do not take exception to this novel because I am an amateur historian. I take exception to this because it is just plain bad. It's overwrought, patronizingly and painfully sentimental, and poorly written. I don't know how old the author is, but it's like he is getting out all his high school angst with high school prose. It is not so much an engaging story as it is a forced-emotion, poorly-manipulating movie of the week (or should I say \\"movie of the weak\\"?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is a truly miserable book.

It was neither a good nor entertaining read. The style is amateurish and the \\"historical\\" workings are grossly inaccurate. It really is a forgettable book. But I started thinking about this book a couple of weeks ago, after 9/11. The more I think of this, the angrier I get at Paul Lussier the hack writer. Not so much for \\"the writer thinks it's clever\\" sort of writing, but for propagating lies about the very foundation of our nation. I do not advocate censorship, but I do believe that \\"entertainers\\" like Mr. Lussier owes it to the public and posterity to at least portray things accurately. But Mr. Lussier has as much regard for truth as he does for well-written narrative, which is to say none at all. This book, by presenting its fiction as Truth, does everyone a disservice and is insulting to the very core of our nation's beliefs. Paul Lussier should be ashamed of himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT CLEVER, NOT ACCURATE, NOT INTERESTING, NOT GOOD","review":"This is supposed to be some sort of tome for the moronic masses, as if the National Enquirer wrote history texts. But it's just horribly and painfully written. The first line itself is straight out of every junior high \\"deep\\" short story ever written. It's just painful to get through. Really poorly written. As Sainfeld said \\"not that there's anything wrong with that\\", but the author just has to be gay, since he wants to spread the word that the real people behind the Revolution were all gay/crossdressers/repressed homosexuals/latent homosexuals/unadmistted homosexuals/closeted homosexuals.

Do them !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tipping Sacred Cows","review":"At last: the revisionists and dissenters have a storyteller. The Revolution was really just a change of management, and the Founding Fathers co-opted the rebellion against British rule from the real revolutionaries--the rabble and rank-&-file who stuck their necks out first. Lussier gives voices, faces and names to the disenfranchised, who got the War of Independence rolling only to find their movement usurped, and their hard-won liberty put in the hands of a home-grown ruling class."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magical Journey","review":"This book makes the Revolutionary War a personal journey of an assortment of unique and beautifully drawn characters. It is refreshingly irreverent and constantly surprises. I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 If By Book","review":"P. Lussier's book on the american revolution is the first and only book to connect our modern psychology to the intimacies of our past. No other approach to history so connects us (from the first page on) to the very real concerns and motivations of our ancestors as familiar human beings with economic, intellectual, egoistic, and emotional drives. Lussier spans the ages with a tart style that makes real the people and human events of our history and convinces the normally disenfranchised reader that our revolution came from a variety of familiar impulses at once hilarious and desparate,frail and noble. Please read this engaging book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and terrific!","review":"This is a delightful book. It seems obvious that our long-accepted version of the Revolution is open to some serious questioning. Read this book, and give thought to the possibility that the Founding Fathers were less than we have always been told. Mr. Lussier has written a wonderful fiction, but it is even more captivating when one considers that much research seems to have gone into it. Read it and think!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A People's Narrative","review":"This is one of the most important books I have ever read! Not only is it engaging and entertaining to the point where I called in sick to work so I could finish reading it, but it also puts in print what many already knoew. Our Founding \\"Fathers\\" cared virtually not at all about anyone or anything other than themselves and their ability to make a buck. They have been diefied in the history books in the mosy revisionist manipulative way and thank God someone writes about it in a way I found terrific.

I ordered two 55 pound dumbbells. One of them weighs 50 pounds and the other weighs 52 pounds. I already have 50 pound dumbbells, I don't need another set of 50 pound dumbbells.

Now, if they had taken that much time and effort on correcting problems with the sound, then the shorts would be perfect. Railroadin' has a distinct hiss in the sound track and can make understanding the actors words difficult to understand. There are many ways sound can be improved and hiss reduced or eliminated and that has been done on other sound tracks, but it appears as if nothing was done to this short.

I started the book on a fun ride but by the time I was through reading I was left feeling sympathy towards many of the characters. All the characters stayed with me long after I finished the book.

Add to this the fact that Daniel and his best friend Tim just dont quite fit in. An accident, amnesia, bullies, girlfriends and a prom are all just some of the aspects of this book.

After all, it showed up as something recommended based on other books I had purchased and indicated that I owned. However, I got through this book and felt like a bit of my life had been taken away. It is completely unrealistic, which is fine in certain genres, but not when trying to communicate a story about a boy in Mississippi. The thing that bothered me most honestly was the author's note at the end. He talks about his inspiration for the story. I wont spoil it for you if you intend to read it but I was flabbergasted at how ridiculous it was considering that it had little to do with the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story, well told","review":"The characters are more compelling than I've found in a long time. The book has classic themes as well as fantastic ones. It is capable of making the reader laugh aloud and also at times, come close to tears. It is an interestnig exploration of prejudice, the dangerous path that innocent lies can lead us down, and the effects of living with guilt, shame, and self-doubt.

I think a 6 or 7 year old would think this game is way too easy.And I hope that nobody buys this game to teach their kids responsibility!

Sproul uncovers the character of God in a way that leaves you thinking, \\"I read the Bible, why didn't I realize this?\\" Sproul's knowledge and lucid writing style make this book a great read. I can't recommend it enough. Sproul doesn't add anything to already revealed in the Bible attributes of God; Sproul merely points you to these attributes, which is what I really like about him. Some theologians have to invent or do linguistic gymnastics in an attempt to prove their point. What does Sproul do? He simply goes to the Bible.What also helps make this book is that Sproul is a philosopher, so you get chapters in this book over the problem of evil and the freedom of the will.

I TEACH paper piecing classes.This book is poorly written and the instructions are very difficult to understand. I feel like I'm simply having to look at the picture of the quilt to figure out how to construct it. The illustrations get an F. They use poorly contrasting fabrics so you can't tell what they're even trying to show.I spent the extra money for the foundation papers and they couldn't even do that right....I wound up having to redraw several templates.

Only 2 playable charachters,no undead, no demons, music isn't quite as good, and the bosses seem dumbed down and more bland than any of the other previous Tenchu games. I don't understand why everyone keeps saying the game is harder. I actually found it even easier than Wrath of Heaven. But if your dumb enough to try to block in a boss battle that would make sense because of the boss block counter move system in this one.

You may wonder why I even bother to review this album when my feelings are so overwhelmingly negative- well, I have to listen to it all day at work- so I'm entitled to this little tirade. For those of you who disagree with me and say you just want to hear something mellow and soothing- let me recommend Miles Davis's KIND OF BLUE- you'll get the feeling your after but performed with infinitely more soul and talent.There's alot of great 'relaxing' music out there but Kenny G. is just sterile pap."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cut below elevator music","review":"Amazing that anyone thinks this is good considering what else is out there for sax players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz died down until this guy came along","review":"Let me tell you guys something about this album: I don't know why so many of you guys hate Kenny G, not to mention C��line Dion, Andrea Bocelli, or Phil Collins so damned much. This album contains many of the sax maestro's biggest hits (and several unnecessities, of course), not to mention three unreleased tracks, so fans of this guy have no reason for saying this stinks. Ex-disciples, of course, know that there's more out there than him."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH?","review":"...Perhaps the problem here is that the title is misleading. It should be Greatest Hit.

I would be scared to go into an elevator or a dentist's office again."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Friends And My Enemies","review":"I have to say that this is pretty funny. An artist with no talent gets a greatest hits collection. What can I say, that's how music is today. I would like to comment on two reviews I saw earlier. They uneased me. First, a gentleman said that Kenny G was the greatest instrumentalist. Let's forget jazz for one moment. Are you saying that Kenny G is better than Beethoven, Bach, Schoenberg, Bartok, or Stravinsky? Is he also better than John Coltrane, Dizzy Gillespie, Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis, Mike Oldfield? Face it, he's no better than all the thousands of faceless studio musicians. The Other review was from a girl who could not believe that an album could be based around a saxophone. I guess she was pretty young, and so, maybe one day she will realize the beauty of instrumental music. Anyway, don't buy this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excuse Me?","review":"More than with any other artist, there are so many reviewers saying \\"If you don't like it, don't say anything (and don't give it a bad rating)\\". I feel that if you don't want bad ratings, then do not release poor music. With the Amazon reviews, people have every right to an opinion and this holds true whether or not they like the music. Since his music does not change much, neither will his reviews. As such, for this greatest hits album, I present you with exerpts of other reviews: \\"one trick pony\\", \\"boring\\", \\"this is not jazz\\", \\"repetitive\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"How boring can you get?","review":"Kenny G is not a jazz artist, period. He's not a very good sax player, period. And this is some of the most annoying music available. Kenny G plays pretty music for pretty people who know nothing about music. Why it sells is a mystery. A complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It makes me vomit.","review":"The sloppy, sappy, squelching of his soprano in combination with drum machines, over dubbing and reverb, accentuates this non-talent. What is amazing is that in this greatest hits collection all the songs have the same emoted feelings. There is no variance. There is no change of pace. Why would you want to buy 60+ minutes of the same.If you want smooth, lyrical jazz try Stan Getz, you'll be amazed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute unmusical mush","review":"...And yet another bile vomitous release from the G-Man (as brainless endearing fans call him).

It's not even remotely related to real jazz. What this actually is is dull, lukewarm adult-contemporary pop/soft rock that has turned doctors' office waiting rooms all over the country into torture chambers. I haven't bought any of kenny g's cds but I unfortunately know his music from being forced to listen to it in doctors/dentist's offices and in riding other peoples cars and hearing it on their tape or cd player. The biggest hits of Kenny G's career are the first three selections on this cd: \\"songbird\\", \\"silhuette\\", and \\"forever in love\\", but when I hear them I can't remember which is which even though I've heard them hundreds of times because all his music sounds the same. If you're a jazz fan DON'T BUY THIS CD! Get Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, George Shearing, or Stan Kenton. These artists make real jazz."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Song Remains The Same","review":"I'm sorry, I do not understand all of the people who come to the defense of this man. He has not changed his tune much in the past fifteen years and is smug because CD buyers continue to support him. He is nowhere in the league of the true jazz artists. This is good is you like background music to weddings or need this kind of music to unwind after a long day at work. This is not my preference and it is my right to rate this CD with its single star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honest review","review":"Kenny G plays smooth stuff. Personally, my 1st CD I listened to of him was pretty good, the song Going Home impressed me. But then once I listened to more I wasn't sure if all 8 (or 9) of his songs were part of Going Home. Kenny G has average talent, if you really want a really true saxophone virtuoso, buy John Coltrane, he is the master of the jazz saxophone (w/ Charlie Parker). Kenny G IS Jazz, but he is very much more modern jazz. Listen to the Rippingtons or other groups as such, they don't improvise as much as traditional jazz. So just know Kenny G is not PURE Jazz, but he is part of it. My own personal opinion on Kenny G: His smoothness all sounds the same. Some people say he is a master at the soprano saxophone. I will admit, he is not bad, but like many say, his tuning is off and he definately is not what you call a sax master. John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, Sonny Stitt.... those are the jazz masters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Gift Package!?!","review":"Why would you do this to your friends...or even your enemies? Buy them Chia pets instead. Their hair is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jazz Muzack","review":"To me, Kenny G is to jazz as Puff Daddy is to hip-hop. They both make mokeries of the music they are performing. Kenny G's songs are all the same old boring mush. His solos are slow and lack excitement and the music that accompanies his playing is about as interesting as a blank TV screen. If anyone would take the time to listen to saxophone greats such as John Coltrane and \\"Cannonball\\" Adderly, they'd become easily bored by Kenny's (lack of) talent. This is not jazz at all. Jazz is Miles Davis, Count Basie, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, and Dizzy Gillepse. They elevated jazz music just like The Roots and A Tribe Called Quest have elevated hip-hop. Do not support Kenny G who does not elevate or stay true to the artform of jazz. Spend you money on a true jazz great instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't need to buy this...just go to any dentist's office","review":"This stuff puts me to sleep. There's no change of pace. And as for the Kenny G fan who says all his fans have good taste in music while Spice Girl fans don't...at least the Spice Girls knew when to quit - one year of fame and they split up. Meanwhile we have to hear Kenny G endlessly recycle his smash hit \\"songbird\\" over and over and over again every time we get a cavity filled or a root canal or braces tightened. And this is not jazz either, it's adult contemporary pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Jazz","review":"This is the worst music I have ever heard in my life. Just because you are holding a saxaphone does not make it jazz.

Kenny G's fingers on the sax are pure magic. Anyone who doesn't appreciate his music obviously doesn't know how much work is put into creating such great songs as \\"Forever in Love\\", \\"The Moment\\", and \\"Songbird.\\" The guy is a musical genius. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who appreciates good, easy listening music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godawful - gives muzak a bad name","review":"How much do I hate Kenny G? Let me count the ways...Whenever I am subject to this man's music, I become really irritated. Thank goodness for noisy industrial music, bands like Einsterzende Neubauten or The Ex, which help me cleanse my ears of KG's noise pollution. It amazes me that with all of the wide variety of music out there, so many, nevertheless, turn to this. What sheep some people are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jazz ?","review":"Something that really pisses me off is that everybody who give 5-stars to Kenny G. say he is the greatest jazz musician.You make two mistakes: first Kenny G himself says he doesn't play jazz and he has very limited musical skills.I bet you are not even musicians , so how can you evaluate his skills? Personally I spend 5 hours (often more) everyday listening to true jazz masters (John Coltrane , Wes Mongomery , Kenny Burell , Grant Green , Charlie Christian , Django Reinhardt , ... ) and trying to imitate their sound and style , so I know what I am talking about a little bit more than a bunch of lame-ass housewives who listen to \\"jazz\\" once a week when they are sitting in their tub with their latest gardener (or plumber or whatsoever).Sad but true."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMBBBBBBB","review":"I HAD to give this movie 1 star cause that was as low as it could go! plain and simple i've never heard music this repetitive and boring!

I think many people who arent into Kenny G's music pretty much think the same thing.it isnt that we dont want to accept Kenny G, but just the fact that his music is kind of a headache after listening to it for awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great item, too long to ship","review":"This item is in perfect condition as described, but it took way too long to ship the item.

I find the opposite to be true. Being subjected to that insipid drivel on the radio is a stress contributer, not a reliever.Mr. G's music (if you wish to call it that) is nothing more than scales, arpeggios, and various other \\"warm-up riffs\\" on the saxophone set to tacky, new-age pop type backgrounds and is completely devoid of any artistic substance whatsoever.A sad comment on the sorry state of popular music today is the fact that a no-talent charlatan like Kenny G. can get rich off of so many herd mentality people.I used to play the clarinet and saxophone when I was younger. It sure is tempting to get a hold of a horn, find a recording studio and set some scales and arpeggios to those same types of cheesy arrangements Mr. G. uses. It's a good bet that I'd make a few bucks. Hey, if Kenny G-scale can do it, then so can we."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called \\"Kenny G's Greatest S_hits","review":"Listen at your own risk.

Also, if you listen to the sound clips, most of the titles are indistinguishable. I have heard most of this music on light rock radio and I give it the lowest possible rating, especially for its negative impact on the world of jazz. More power to him if he can make a multi-million dollar career out of re-recording Songbird over and over again. However, shame on you if you support that career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swing It, Kenny! Go, Kenny, Go!","review":"If you've heard one of his songs, you've heard them all.

With this release, Ken Griffey Jr remains Seattle's favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, great CD","review":"C'mon, it seams that all the negative reviewers are music experts or even succesful musicians.

I just want to get up and bust a move to some of AMERICA'S greatest JAZZY Big Band classics. Damn, it's hard to keep one's foot from moving to the tunes that made America Famous. In the background there's a heavy drum beat indicating the Disco update. But, darn it, SING, SING, SING just makes me want to DANCE, DANCE, DANCE!

One of the best recordings in this genre of music, this is a must have for any rock collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like ORIGINAL- Mostly instrumentals","review":"This is not the Snap you remember- Nothing like the style of -I got the Power.

Chua is way before her time.Contrary to what you may think upon reading the title, this book is not anti-free market or anti-globalization. It is a reality check. In numerous areas of the world, ethnic minorities hold disproportionate economic power. This creates resentment(envy really) among the majority group. Add democracy to the mix, and you can imagine what kinds of lunatics can be elected. For obscure reasons, this situation is virtually ignored until yet another vicious bloodbath manifests. And even then, people fail to understand what has really happened. Regardless, the problem is not going to go away by itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and Explanatory","review":"It explains why things are the way they are throughout the world.

It's not the west fault most of the world is backwards and stupid--that's how it was when westerners found those places.The world has been fighting for thousands of years--long before capitalism and democracy.

It is not redistributive policies that have enabled western free market/democratic nations to thrive (redistribution was non-existant to minimal for much of the U.S./European histories), thus placating minorities.

My daughter has had this case for several years now, and it has held up to the rigors of being stuffed inside lockers, transported from/to school band concerts and an occassional (or more frequently) drop on the floor. The flute is fully protected. Also, the shoulder strap comes in handy when you need to lug books and your flute through the hallways.

So, get some good headphones, and get the Boostaroo to power them. The headphone amplifier inside the iPod is not capable of powering large headphones. The Boostaroo is not only capable of powering large headphones, but it will also make them sound better. The lower bass is much better defined. The high frequencies are cleaner, with more sparkle. And, the volume setting on the iPod can be decreased, thus extending the life of the Litium Ion battery.Get a Boostaroo, it's only like $30 with shipping.

However, there is some noticeable distortion introduced at medium to high volume levels. I also had to purchase a separate volume control since neither the audio source (PS3) nor the headphones feature a volume control.Pluses:-amplifies volume (duh)Minuses:-introduces some audio distortion at medium to high volume levels-no volume controlI'm probably gonna end up returning the Boostaroo and picking up one of those cmoy amps off e-bay instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Compatible with adapters.","review":"Do not use this device if you use a 3.5mm to 2.5mm adapter.

The Logitech speakers,which are now only $90 plus shipping on Amazon,become amazingly,unbelievably powerful when the signal is boosted with a Boosteroo.This really helps when using an mp3 with low output(keep mp3 volume down to save battery,hearing and also avoid being arrested).After 2 years i have now encountered the \\"bad wire\\" problem others have noted,but I will still buy another one.This time I'll take care to keep the cord from being moved around all the time,maybe by taping it to the side of the the unit and adding a short extension."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad connection","review":"I bought one a few months ago. I loved it as first, but soon a loose connection caused the sound from one speaker to cut out. By fiddling with the cord I could sometimes get it to reconnect, and once again I'd have stereo sound. But this was touch and go. I took the cord apart (as the loose connection seemed to be in the cord and near the base of the unit). I did find a damaged wire but still (for some unknown reason) I can't get the red wire to send a signal. Now I think the loose connection is in the circuit board. It was good while it lasted but seems to be poorly made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"For the money, I can't complain. It certainly boosted the output the way I expected it to.

It's quite impractical for me to tote speakers wherever I go. More convenient to bring around headphones. I gave Boostaroo a try to see if it's better than the typical \\"headphone jack y-splitter\\" thingy that I used to have. Boostaroo works like a charm! No loss of quality or volume at all across the 3 audio output (which was a problem with the y-splitter I used to use). Only one thing I have against it: it's size--it's quite a biggie. I know they had the dimensions of it in the specs.

I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good CD","review":"~I will admit, I bought this CD and was hoping for something closer to Dreamland. Well, Dreamland this isn't. It's a very different CD, although it is recognizably Robert Miles. It's good, don't get me wrong. D prefered Dreamland, this CD was at least almost as good. Kudos to RM for daring to be different!"},{"rating":"1","title":"From flame to fizzle","review":"Well, I got this CD the first time when I was in Jebal Ali and was really excited then I listened to it. I was kinda disappointed. I was expecting some of the same as \\"Dreamland\\". I understood his message in his songs but I wanted the beats from his first. I think Mr. Miles should stick to the Dreamland style."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have...","review":"\\"23am\\" is a splendid product of Robert Miles' continuing growth as an artist. Comparing tracks from \\"Dreamland\\" to \\"23am\\" reveals new depth and appeal. Though it is among my favorite CDs, \\"Dreamland's\\" tracks tend to share the same fundamental sound throughout the album. Robert Miles introduces greater variety in \\"23am\\", providing each track with it's own distinct character. The true value of this album is found by sitting back at the end of a long day, closing your eyes, and savoring it's entire length. Robert Miles' new sound is beautiful, yet unobtrusive. It fuels the imagination, and sets the mind at ease."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Miles second album, Strong Message, Great Music","review":"Robert Miles first CD \\"Dreamland\\", and hit single \\"Children\\" both possessed awesome dream style techno, and definately brought his past trance roots out for show-and-tell, but his new album \\"23am\\" brings more than just great new music in his style. He brings a powerful message: \\"...there are masses of people out there that are strenuously fighting to better this world, now devestated by man.\\" as quoted from the liner notes. If you liked dreamland, especially the track \\"Fable\\", I think you will love this album, and hopefully we can all learn something from his travels and message."},{"rating":"2","title":"For anyone who enjoys Robert Miles","review":"If you've heard Robert Miles and don't have this CD, GET IT! It may be sklightly different then Dreamland if that's all you've heard, but hey the same guy made it so it's not as bad as some people may believe. If you've just heard Organik, then 23am is even better for you if you've just heard Dreamland. This ties the two CDs together so almost any Robert Miles (Cocina) fan will enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"23 AM - Time to dance!","review":"After the success of \\"Dreamland\\", Robert Miles was big but this album didn't work out as well as his debut, but it's still a pretty good album even if it isn't as artistic and unique as \\"Dreamland\\".The best song is probably \\"Freedom\\" which remind me of his best moments, a great dream-dance song with nice melody. \\"Textures\\" is simular but with heavier drums in the backround. \\"Maresias\\" is another great song with paino sound and saxophone(?).\\"23 AM\\" is pleasant and it will grove on, the songs are beautiful and well made, a deja vu feeling though. If you liked his previous album, you like this too but there is nothing revolutionary about 23 AM either, just a hell of a dance record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like I was hoping for","review":"After \\"Dreamland\\", Robert Miles gave me an overwhelming disappointment with \\"23AM\\". Far too whiny for me. I'm seriously considering selling the album at a local CD exchange, if they will take it. Not a good experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah, his time is over","review":"I don't know what everyone's on but this album doesn't come close to dreamland. Strange vocals and beats that are rather boring and nothing like his previous album, sounds like jazz or something. Miles time is over. I had kinda expected this from Miles after seeing him at a concert some years ago where he was literally BOOed off the stage for such a horrible performance. I would not recommend this CD to anyone. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE HIGHER YOU CLIMB..","review":"..and we all know the ending to that little saying.23am doesn't exist (I know, it doesn't take a genius), and neither should this album.A hotch potch of music made on the back of an album that had a couple of good tunes, but not enough to constitute the comissioning of a further LP.If you want to waste your money, buy another Breville Sandwich Toaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as great as Dreamland, but still good.","review":"This second offering by Robert Miles is another advent into techno. It's more of a trip into the land of funky dreams than Dreamland. While the CD is still greatly enjoyable, Dreamland is definately the better of the two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good follow up to Dreamland","review":"I just got 23AM today in the mail, I enjoy it, well put together but not as good as Dreamland, of course I dont think R.

I played my previous set for 3 years... the coating wears off if you play for a few months, but only where your fingers most make contact. It's actually quite revealing of one's playing patterns, and the erosion of the black coating, at least to me, is a pleasant kind of patina. They stay in tune extremely well too-- I can leave my bass in its case for a week and find it's still completely in tune. I actually have no reason to try any other kind of string, I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing strings!","review":"These strings are some of the greatest round wound strings I've ever tried.

I bought the book expecting to read more from the slaves perspectives, even the \\"Black Frontier\\" section is not convincing in my opinion, especially given the primary sources available. Even though the book lacked black perspectives, I continued reading the material and found it very difficult to do so, largely due to the writer's style.

I based my purchasing decision on the great reviews here, but should have paid more attention to the one negative. Yes, it does a good job sucking up water, but it'll be completely saturated in just a few seconds, and then you're ringing the heck out of it to get the water out of it. Another couple of seconds, and it's completely soaked again, and you're ringing the heck out of it again. A real pain to be constantly ringing it out just to use it for another couple of seconds. And if you don't ring it out, it'll just streak and leave large amounts of water behind. I suppose if I had 5 or 10 of them I wouldn't be complaining, but I had money to buy 5 or 10 of these at $12 a pop, I wouldn't be washing my car myself.

Big disappointment...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I'm glad bought this exact item through my local auto store on sale for $2.98.

Mine is now in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read some positive reviews before I purchased this drying towel, they must have tested another product.

I bought this Absorber chamois probably 15 years ago and it dries as good today as the day I bought it. I think the trick to a long life is after using it, I dampen it a little bit before I put it back in the tube to keep it from drying out. Forget the Shamwow. I'd highly recommend the Absorber.

He actually stole it from me. now I have to buy one for myself.And this towel is really a must for people with little babies...My son (when not in diaper even for one minute) will find an opportunity to pee on the floor or carpet. and this towel absorbs every little drop and leaves the carpet very dry. Absolutely a MUST item to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy one now!!!","review":"I was referred to this product by a guy that details cars. I just bought a new BLACK car and as we know streaks and marks stand out on black. Not to worry anymore! I used this product right after purchase (be sure to soak it in warm water as instructed before use for a few minutes and wring it out good) and it worked much better than any chamois that I have ever used. Super absorbent and no streaks! Just wring it out as it absorbs and you will have your car sqeeky clean and streak free in no time. If it is dirty afterwards ,,,, again wash it out in warm water ,,, wring it out and store it in the container while damp. Will last a long time. Machine washable if needed .....and at this great price maybe you want a couple of them. I'm gonna buy a second one because I am SO impressed. Buy one now,,,,, you will NOT regret it.

This works very well. If you wring it out (edges too) it doesn't streak, leave water behind, and works about as well as a natural chamois. It will also last for years if left damp and stored in the plastic container, (nope don't dry it). Then why use a natural chamois? Well for me there is something about the shine left behind with a natural chamois. I'm 69 years old and have used those since a teenager. Now that maybe just a memory lane thing since this works just fine. If you don't want to dry, and as I do stretch and soften a natural chamois after use, then get this. It works very well, plus I have never found anything synthetic, that works as well. (Believe me I've tried a lot different ones too. Haaa) I do recommend it.

Many As Seen on TV products are complete garbage but I've used this for years and it appears to be only getting better with age. Easy to throw in the wash whenever it gets dirty and then it goes right back to work. The fact that you can stop using towels to dry your vehicles is another environmental benefit. To dry it just wring it out and put it back in the case.

I used it a week ago and followed the packaging \\"May be stored damp in tube -- so it's always ready to use (won't rot when kept wet in tube).\\" and when I removed it from the tube it had dark spots of mold and mildew across it. Ew, life smells funky.I thought, \\"No problem. I'll throw it in the washing machine.\\" It washed, but the spots did not come out. I thought, \\"No problem. I'll soak it with a little bleach.\\" It bleached, but the spots did not come out.I'm typing this with the smell of bleach still fresh and I'm thinking, \\"Really?

I thought it was very easy to understand, and I liked the way the material is presented: Using the Alice program (included on a CD-ROM with the book), each chapter walks you through each new topic in a few different 'lab exercises'. You are then able to apply what you have learned to 'project questions' at the end of each chapter. The only problem would be that if you are not part of a class when you are going through this book, questions would remain unanswered as there are no solutions in the back of the book (such as all odd-numbered questions, etc.). I believe it would be difficult for some to use this book as a stand-alone learning tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaches you programming concepts","review":"This is a pretty good book and it explains the concepts of computer programming very well.

Also, needless to say, Crawford's voice is technically perfect and Sample's keyboards soulful as ever. But, apart from a few songs like \\"sea line woman\\" or \\"last night at danceland\\" the end result is somehow deficient in terms of inspiration. Generally, I'm afraid, the album sounds a little contrived, reminding me of \\"Morph the Cat\\" by Donald Fagen, in the sense that it tries to hard and ultimately fails to recreate the magic of the early albums. I find the Crusaders' albums lovely not for their musical virtuosity but, rather, for their unbeatable charm, a quality that seems to be lacking here. Who knows, maybe it's that the plasticized 00's fail to provide the right mood.P.s.

This one is sturdy. Also, for my teen nephew who I also bought a set for, the thermal blanket and gloves, flares, trouble light, etc. give me some peace of mind if he goes out without gloves on and just a hoodie in zero degree weather (getting old, yep, I wear my gloves!

With the return to console gaming on the Wii, many gamers are eager for looking for new ways to get their fix of action packed excitement. But, for Wii owners, they might feel the need of something else. This Widescreen 7\\" game screen, works nicely for Gamecube gamers, who can also get their fix of Gamecube madness on the Wii, but it doesn't add up very well on anything else. Although it might be good if you're in a mobile home, but you unfortunately can't see very well on where you're aiming in games like The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and Metroid Prime 3: Corruption. I really suggest you wait for either a bigger game screen, or just don't buy it at all.

Waited for the paperback of 1634 and what a downer. This rag joins the ranks of two books I quit in the middle in the last ten years. The other was Robert Jordan's \\"Crossroads of Twilight\\" adding the 1632 series to the heap of my worst literary disapointments.The things that made 1632 such a great opener for the series were all missing and replaced with really dull dialogue about stuff nobody outside a university history dept even cares about.Should have busted Galileo out of house arrest in the first 3 chapters and moved on to good stuff, leaving the hippies and venetian stooges behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner","review":"Eric Flint has created an amazing alternate-history with his Ring of Fire stories, and this is another worthy entrant.

What I loved about this series was what the tech of the future could do in the past. I loved the use of vehicles and weapons in the first 2 books. But other than the mention of radio and some future drugs and such, nothing was interesting to me.I want action and always got what I wanted from Eric Flint, maybe he should rethink his paring with Andrew Dennis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Job!","review":"It's an interesting and entertaining romp, with fun characters and good action.If there's a problem, it's the same one I have with the whole series: the downtime characters are too 21st-century. And they have too much of a tendency to read a Grantville history book, or talk to a Grantviller, slap their foreheads and proclaim: \\"How could I have been so blind!\\" as they abandon or modify their beliefs. It's the same fault that L. Neil Smith's work has, although not to the same annoying degree.People in the past were _different_. By our standards, they were mostly villains and thugs, and they really _believed_ in the things that made them burn witches and heretics."},{"rating":"1","title":"an affair to forget","review":"the third novel in the series it is by far the least cohesive and boring of the three.

A pass if you were going to purchase the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah: Boring and plodding","review":"THis book is a poor addition to the series. It is dull and most of it is spent on pointless exposition. The characters are not nearly as interesting as in the other books, or even other Flint series. Sharon getting involved with some old Spanish guy months after her husband bought the farm is a stupid plot point. Especially since the guy is about 40 years older than her and from a country technically at war with hers.Waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This series is really tanking","review":"The first two were good, after about 1/3 of the way in on this book I gave up and started skimming, then I just quit it entirely.As far as this series goes - I am out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book if you love political history","review":"I loved 1632 -- an interesting premise, good characters, lots of action and excellent plot. I also enjoyed 1633 but the focus of the series began to shift in this book from a quick-paced storyline to political discourse. In 1634, there is precious little plot and too much politics. I am a historian by profession, but not a political historian ... and this bored me to death. I gave up part-way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay but not terrific","review":"I like the 1632 series. But as other reviewers have said, this is one of the weaker books of the series. It's still fun, but politics are taking priority over battles.

Dry political, religious, and economic dialogues about philosophies and strategies of the period caused by the influence of Grantville, replace action and adventure. Absent from most of the book are the themes of 20th Century technology overcoming the 17th century villains. Sorry Mr. Flint. You had a great thing going, but you sure drifted away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Where do I start? This is really hard for me because I like Eric Flint He is one of my favorite authors, but this book really misses the mark. I found the book to be very boring and tedious, it's filled with pages of useless dialogue. Usually I stay up late into the night reading his books, with this I found it difficult to pick up and continue to read. With sadness I finally gave up at around page 450, it just became too tedious to read. In his afterword he comments that he enjoys collaborating because it helps prevent the series from sliding into a rut. Well he doesn't have to worry about it with this book because this missed the rut and fell off the cliff."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book too Far","review":"I started out with great hopes for this book, got to page 200 and nothing had happened. And it's not as if it's a thousand pages. The plot was based around a diplomatic mission, but they hadn't even been any diplomacy to speak of, let alone any technology transfer or fighting, and if we are honest that's what we're here for.All there was were various explanations, mostly of theology, but some of the diplomatic situation. I have read nonfiction books about early modern diplomacy that were less boring. I haven't finished it I doubt I ever will. Why on earth does everything have to be a series, when people seem to run out of ideas quite early on? Better to move on to something different where the ideas are fresh. Bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE HAVE ALL THE WOMEN GONE?","review":"One of the more interesting things in the original book of the series, 1632, was the strength and intelligence shown by the female characters. Women often have little more than supporting roles in Fantasy Fiction unless, of course, the author is female. (Lackey, McCaffrey and Norton, et al.) Unfortunately, that trend did not hold true for this book and, to a lesser degree, the second in the series, 1633.The other thing that distinguishes this book from its parent is the sheer volume of details, subplots and historical lessons sandwiched into the plot. If you were attracted to the series because of its subject and balanced characterizations you would do well to stop after the first novel. If you are interested in the minutiae of historical interpretation without the taint of scholasticism, read on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quick Companion","review":"This small book is a good quick companion to the debate. It doesnt cite verses as often as someone like Henry Morris, but it is Biblically sound. Being so small, it gets right to the point about science and logical dillemas. Let's hope it will lead you into further investigation with the topics aroused in this book, but it is a great start. If you could hand out any small piece of literature that an evolutionist might read, this would be a good choice.But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander.

The dubbed version is fine, even though i find the main voice actor that dubbs Miaka's voice a bit annoying and wished someone else was cast. Anyways, check this series out. This box sets contains the first half of the first and only season.However, like many reviews have stated, the box set is poorly conceived.

It's somewhat similar to the detective stories of Death Note or Conan but in a way different, because the main char actually has a special power that grant him his wish of changing the world.

First, whenever I turned it on there was always a hissing background sound, like when you tune in an empty frequency on the radio or TV. The only way to get rid of the noise was to turn up the volume to medium level. Not good if you like falling asleep to music.Second, CD player stopped working properly after only a few weeks of light use. Third, unit emits a bright blue light that will keep you awake if you are a light sleeper.Finally, buttons are not user-friendly, and that includes the remote. Hard to use and rather unintuitive.

Sometimes it would freeze the ipod and I would have to let the ipod's battery drain before the ipod would come back on.Worst, I moved it from one outlet to another. After that, the power would never come back on, no matter what outlet I tried. It would only show this symbol on its display screen: \\":\\" or \\"--:--\\". It was receiving power because the ipod would charge, but it wouldn't do anything more than that. It didn't matter what button I pushed. The radio, CD, ipod, and clock would not work at all.

The screw was part of the holder for the weights on the side (which is still in tact). The pole wobbles as you step, no matter how tight the screws are (there are 8 total, 4 at each direction on the base and 4 at each direction in the middle holding the poles together). The pulley system under the steps, slips regularly if you don't have a consistent stepping motion. And last but not least the wire for the step counter was exposed because there was no way to hide it with the way the designed it, so it was easily pulled out of the back by a child.

I\\"m returning this.","review":"After a very shallow description of the types of resorts, and a plea for developers to be more sensitive to the natural environment, the book glosses over the huge planning phase and goes into how to turn a profit once the doors are open. All of the steps in between are dismissed with the understanding that you'll hire various teams of professionals to handle them. But THAT's what I wanted to know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Nonfiction Attempt Ever","review":"This may well be the most badly-written book I've ever read. I understand the writer is an experienced fiction writer; I hope that her fiction is better than her attempt at nonfiction. I consider my purchase of this book as this money wasted, and I don't believe I will be able to finish it. The only thing that makes me give this book one star is that it does have some references that I might check out as readable on their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up half way through","review":"I have recently read several biographies of famous/infamous British women, from Nell Gwynn to Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. Due to my great interest in the Regency period, I ordered \\"My Lady Scandalous\\". I'm sorry to say I cannot recommend this book.There was much more content about Grace Dalrymple's family and the Regency period than there ever was about Grace, and the information was very helter-skelter. The book seemed to be mostly \\"sidebar\\" articles about topics the author had researched, like condoms, hot air balloons, and so forth.I took it along on a trip and left it behind, unfinished. I hope the author is blessed with a better editor, in future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading!","review":"Excellent biography of a fascinating life that was interwoven with historical events and well known persons of the time period. Written in an easy to follow style, full of information and details of a time gone by. I had a difficult time putting the book down and in the end was sad to see Mrs. Elliott's story end. She truly lived a remarkable life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good subject spoiled by messy layout","review":"I was looking forward to reading about this intriguing courtesan. However, my first impression on opening the book was of a mish mash of different information blocks inserted among the main text. I found this so offputting. To concentrate I found I had to read the book twice - once to navigate through the blocks (and sometimes whole pages) to concentrate solely on the text then secondly to read the information blocks - some of which I found were totally unnecessary and in my opinion only there to pad out the book! The flippant way it is written does not appeal either. The information was at times suspect too. For instance,I know that the family details of one of the main subjects - that of George James,Earl Cholmondeley was totally wrong. She has researched the wrong family. In 1791,Earl Cholmondeley married Georgiana Charlotte Bertie, younger daughter of 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven,his only wife, not three as suggested here. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Writing","review":"This book has little to do with the woman in the title. The writing style reminds me of sixties free flow writing that people did after they were stoned. The author dashes off on one tangent after another that is difficult to follow and you forget what the chapter was supposed to be about to begin with. Not even worth checking out of the library much less owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tabloid reading in hardcover","review":"Gossipy, slangy, and chatty would best describe Jo Manning's style and content. Personally, I find it hard to take a biography seriously when the writer refers to a historical figure (Queen Charlotte, wife of George III) as a \\"real bow-wow\\". Ms. Manning finds time and space to speculate on the Camilla/Charles relationship, though how this is pertinent to the life or times of Grace Dalrymple Elliot is beyond me. She also speculates on Prince Harry's following in the footsteps of his sexually promiscuous ancestor, George IV. This is not what I am looking for in a biography. This is more what I would expect from Jerry Springer . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grace Dalrymple? Who?","review":"I have to agree with the few reviewers who found this book too gossipy and unfocused. I have nothing against a chatty writing style, but this book takes it too far. After reading the first chapter, I found myself wondering what the heck it had to do with the subject of Grace Dalrymple. The author meanders away on side tangents to such an extent that there's really very little of Grace present in the book (and too much talk of other famous women like Cleopatra and Princess Di). I understand the limited research material on Grace, but that's a rather poor excuse. Great biographies have been written on less than well documented subjects before, but this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON\\"T BUY THS","review":"I thought this would be a good video for intermediate.

The version of quark, strangeness and charm is a slower version much like the one found on the business trip live cd. Why they decided to rerecord it slower and more raggae-ish is beyond me. The original version is far superior. The EP also carries 2 versions of Uncle Sam's on Mars. Again, both inferior to the original. Problem with these mixes is the vocal track is buried and the remixes are both unremarkable. At least they should of added the original version for people to compare and enjoy the social satire of the lyrics. The other track on this EP is Black Sun. It starts out promising enough but goes on and on leading to nowhere. Even the artwork on the cover does not do anything. Skip this EP.

This soundtrack stands so well on it's own as a separate album. Definitely not a soundtrack to a movie where you need to see the movie before you can own the album. A previous review said that the action pieces \\"fall flat\\" and \\"border on the repetitive.\\" I suppose that is an opinion to which he is entitled, but let me say it is a fact that they do not! Between \\"Vikings Attack,\\" \\"Ghosts Fight Begins,\\" \\"Quick Kills,\\" and \\"Gunnars Fury,\\" there are a lot of unique and exciting action pieces to be had, each with different themes and backgrounds, just like the battle scenes of a movie change their themes and backgrounds.Step outside the box of the usual sour-lemon critique, and I think you will find that all twenty-three tracks on the album are classically inspired gems, each one standing tall and delivering it's title successfully through music."},{"rating":"2","title":"No jet lag from the UK to Australia?","review":"I chewed these tablets every two hours or so from the UK to Australia and they certainly helped make the journey less of a problem.

Long an admirer of the artist, I rushed out and purchased the disc. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations.While some of the selections are enjoyable (\\"Strive\\", \\"Remember\\", and \\"Joy\\"), the remakes of songs associated with others sadly fall short. Disco versions of standards like \\"I'll Be There\\", \\"You're the First, The Last, My Everything\\", \\"I Say a Little Prayer,\\" and an embarrassingly awful \\"I Will Always Love You\\" makes one wonder who guided this mess. \\"Oh, Happy Day\\" will have church choirs cringing.Even her classic \\"Survive\\" gets a rotten treatment here.A \\"diva\\" can make a misstep every now and then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Primitive","review":"Caught by the hype about the book, I started with great enthusiasm. After 100 pages I was still waiting for something worthy to follow, after 300 pages I began to suspect that I'm just wasting my time.. All problems, be it religious, political, human are approached at a high-school level, as if the author himself spent all his life in Gravesend . Most characters are depicted rather superficially. Feels like a book written by a bright college boy who shows promise but too young to take seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Tragic","review":"The Christmas Pagent scene is a real classic.

No way to summarize or speak of it (let alone make a movie, 'Simon Birch' ... ugh!). Just read it. The characters are unparalleled and you really feel every emotion they do.Not one of my more eloquent reviews. But trust me. Totally worth the read"},{"rating":"1","title":"YAAAAAAAAAAAAAWN","review":"I forced myself to read every page of this book because so many people raved about it, and I had loved \\"Cider House Rules\\" when I read it years earlier. There were some good moments in the earlier pages, paricularly the hilarious Christmas pageant. After that, it degenerated into a muddled mess that bored me to the point that I wanted to throw it against the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profoundly boring","review":"I had to literally FORCE MYSELF TO FINISH THIS BOOK!

This was a huge was of my time.No more John Irving for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the hype all about???","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of two people who's opinions I respect. One of them claims that \\"Owen Meany\\" is his favorite book of all time and the second person said she just read it for a second time because it's such a \\"feel good\\" book. Clearly I've missed something. I found this book to be rambling, irritating, and a confusing jumble of Irving's opinions on politics and faith thrown into one story. I just don't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"favorite book","review":"This book is an absolute masterpiece, displaying John Irving's genius as a storyteller. The story is moving and interesting, and the buildup and climax of the book at the end is absolutely perfect.

Boy, was I in for a dissapiontment! I struggled through the book. The dialogue and the story lacks all the tender warmth and compassion I feel the author must have felt when writing such excellent books as \\"Garp\\" and \\"Cider House Rules\\". \\"Owen Meany\\" is't a bad book, but from a writer like John Irving your standards get pretty high."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I'm the only one who didn't like this book.","review":"I read this book because I was aware of its imense popularity, yet I was extemely disappointed. In my opinion, the book quickly denegrated into an annoying lecture of the authors religious (protestant) and political (liberal) views. The characters are enjoyable but it was hard for me to stick with the story through all of the authors religious and political references that were not relevant to the inspiring story of the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a WOW!! book","review":"I can't even begin to describe how awesome this book was, nor how to describe the story of Owen Meany and his childhood friend Johnny Wheelright. There are so many incredibly funny and touching moments, you will laugh out loud at Owen's antics (LOL, the doctor's volkswagon). Other reviewers have mentioned a similarity to Dickens, and I noticed that as well. Wonderfully drawn, quirky characters who in the end all serve a purpose to telling the story, culminating in the final heartbreaking ending as Owen realizes the destiny he was born to. And do have the tissue box ready for the last 50 or so pages, you will need it.Highly highly recommended, and you will be thinking about Owen long after you have finished the last pages, and the impact he can have on your life as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, but long and wandering","review":"Marvelous story-telling. Hilarious set-piece episodes that could easily stand alone (I'm thinking of the side-splittingly-funny Christmas pageant, in particular). Amid all the rollicking entertainment, there are powerful messages on literature, love, history, and God scattered throughout the book.Now: why only 4 stars?Nobody ever accused John Irving of being concise - and he's not. Owen Meany is loooong, and there were many places I wished for an editor with a lawn mower to cut the weeds from this otherwise wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irving's style one of the best","review":"John Irving is one of my favorite authors, especially because I think his style is rather unique. He has a penchant for detailing things that aren't necessarily important ... at first. Later in the book, however, you get the sense of why Irving repeats so many things that seem trivial in the beginning. \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\" has its slow spots, like every book, but in general, the story develops into a masterpiece. Also, there are very few stories out there that you know what will happen at the end ... but what keeps you on edge is just how it will actually end."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate giving 5 stars, but had to...","review":"I'm trying to be picky about giving 5 stars to any book that I've read and reviewed. But to NOT give the highest rating to this book, I feel, would be a crime.I've read a lot of novels where character development made me get so close, that I had to back off before the ending so I wouldn't become too involved (and find myself yelling, or crying, or generally making a fool of myself wherever I was when I finished the book). But never, have I had to back off multiple times. THAT'S how powerful this character is...this Owen Meaney; this instrument of God; this friend I miss now that I've finished the novel.A+ rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irvings most powerful book","review":"This book has everything that makes John Irving's novels great but probably isn't the best of his novels to read first. It has a little less of the thick, complex characterization and oddballs than some of his other books, but of all his books, I do consider this the best yet. The opening chapter, The Foul Ball, is so well written that it is humbling just to read it, which is true of much of John Irving's writing. There's a forshadowing throughout the entire book, of Owen's entire life and existence tied to a single, impending event at the end of the book, that is awesome. It is that element of the book, that really distiguishes it, in my mind, apart from his other novels. The imagery is fascinating to read. I remember finishing this book, closing it, and just saying \\"Wow.\\" It was the most powerful ending of any of his books, which says a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute,","review":"Heartlessness masked by a style overflowing with feeling.

It is full of obscenity, and inappropriate sexual commentary involving teenagers ... and it has no redeeming literary value ... unless you are the most extreme left-wing liberal, who hates Christians, and Republicans like Ronald Reagan ...The book's primary theme seems to be to mock Christians and Republicans, and is only \\"humourous\\" in a perverse way ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring book","review":"my son had 2 read this 4 school i think it was very boring and all over the place u cant make heads or tails where their going in this book also if schools have to seperate church & school this should not have to be read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Basis of Simon Birch","review":"I didn't realize this was the basis for the movie Simon Birch until I started reading it. I loved the movie so continued reading even though I already knew the basis of the story.The story was obviously edited for the movie version as the book would be too long. At times I thought there was a lot of detail that could have been left out and I skimmed it. I like the story in general, it was just a long read at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"INTO PARADISE MAY THE ANGELS LEAD YOU","review":"My old high school English teacher would've loved this book. He would've gleefully rubbed his hands together as we'd discuss the *Symbolism* of the book, the fatalistic comparison of Owen's childhood participation in Christmas plays and his friendship with the narrator, etc., etc. As his student of many long years ago, I can smile and appreciate these things, but I can also appreciate Irving's marvelous story-telling. I have images from his WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP that I'll never forget; this book adds more to my mental treasury.I'm not generous with my ratings of *10*. A book or movie has to be close to perfect. This book is. Irving is a master!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing piece of fiction","review":"I just finished this book last night and I cannot believe how moved I am. I was frantically turning pages at the end to see how this book would conclude, yet when I reached the ending I was disappointed my time with Owen Meaney was over. Updike has performed us all a service by introducing us to the characters in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Boston Marathon of all Books","review":"Boy, I wanted to like this book because I'd heard so many great things about it. I will probably be flamed for the rest of my life, but I had to use superhuman willpower to get through this book. It's taken nearly six months to push through this long-winded tome. I read voraciously and I simply could not get interested in this book until, quite literally, the last 20 pages, with the last five being riveting. That's one heck of a price to pay for the first 600 pages.To John Irving I respectfully award the \\"Get Over Yourself\\" award for his endless diatribes and digressions; to the character of Owen Meany I say, \\"All right already, we get the picture, just go and do something,\\" and last but certainly not least to John Wheelwright, the narrator, \\"It's a great big world out there, even in Toronto. DO something! Get a life.\\" And to Irving's editor, \\"You're paid to edit material, regardless of the author's name. So edit!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning and Extraordinary","review":"I have read far too many books in my life; when I finished this one, I was disappointed that it took me this long to find it. Having a somewhat jaded attitude, this is the first book where I felt intensely for the main characters. I may even give it out as a gift during the holidays. BUY, BEG, BORROW, OR STEAL - JUST READ THIS BOOK! I dare anyone to give me a better book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was so good it ruined me for all other books.","review":"This is without a doubt the most well-written, yet entertaining book I have ever read. I couldn't read another book for months because none could compare to the emotional experience that is Owen Meany. If you need a little faith, this book delivers. If you need a laugh, this book delivers. If you need a cry, THIS BOOK DELIVERS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It moved me - I did not want it to end.","review":"This book is one of my all-time favorites. At the conclusion, all I could think was...this would be a terrific movie. I haven't been to see \\"Simon Birch\\" yet, but I understand it does not capture the true essence of the book it was based on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best piece of fiction I have ever read!","review":"With OWEN MEANY, Irving has captured the essence of what it means to be alive and to be a friend. As a high school literature teacher, I wish I could require every senior to read this work. To read about John and Owen means to read about ALL of our lives. I believe there is a little Owen and a little John in each one of us. OWEN MEANY is a novel that will make readers laugh out loud, cry and really think about the issues that Owen and John confront together throughout their young adult lives. If there was ever a book that should be read by all, it is this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're over 50, Owen Meany will make you cry","review":"A Prayer for Owen Meany has been reviewed as a funny/ entertaining story. It is surely entertaining, but I found it heart wrenching. Owen and his best friend John, are characters so well drawn that you become part of their extended family. You cheer at Owen's triumphs, feel the injustice of what he suffers, and come to love him for the unique person he is. You must ultimately empathize with John, when as adults he and Owen spend Owen's last days remembering and talking about their past. Throughout the entire book, John's heartache is palpable. Ostensibly set in the 1980s, the real story flashes back to the late 50s and the Vietnam War period; those who were soldiers, peace agitators, or somewhere in between will recognize the feelings and some of the experiences of Johnny and Owen. Owen's immense spirituality and pragmatism are the crown jewels around which this story is crafted. I loved it, and it made me cry! Thank you John Irving."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my most favorite books","review":"I first read A Prayer for Owen Meany five years ago for an English class. It was the first Irving book I'd ever read and I was hooked. Since then, I've read most of his other books, and while I enjoyed most of then, Owen Meany is still the best. I reread it again and finished it last night and was pleased to discover that it was just as good as I remembered it. Irving is a gifted writer and this book is his best written. This will continue to be in my top five list of the best books ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is spectacular.","review":"I read this book once a year: enough said. Irving's characters and portrayals are spectacular, and I never tire of the interplay between Owen, Johnny, and the other characters. Recommended highly. One of my three favourite books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like everyone else...the best","review":"This is the only book I have read that had this effect on me: After reading PRAYER FOR OWN MEANY I would, on occasion (usually before I drift off to sleep) wonder how Owen is doing (even though I know what happened to him in the book) and hope he's doing OK. As a character, Owen does that to you. What a wonderful book. For a different book written by Irving--try WATER METHOD MAN, if available. Really, really funny, especially if you've ever been a grad student."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good - but the ending could have been better","review":"The first half of this book was really good. I laughed, I cried, it was better than cats. Although I recognize the evils of the Reagan administration as much as the next guy, I don't need political diatribes sprinkled throughout the narrative. These made the book seem to drag on. The ending seemed to be thrown together and not satisfying. I've heard complaints of endings in other Irving novels - maybe he just needs a good closer - put that coffee down, John!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I will be haunted by this kid for a long time.","review":"I think that we have all known a kid like Owen, someone it would be easy to dislike or pigeon-hole but someone whose force of personality and single-mindedness overcomes all. Owen is in your face in big bold type. I can hear that voice echoing through John's big house in New Hampshire and feel his grandmother cringe even while something smiles inside her."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my better summer assignments","review":"A Prayer for Owen Meany was a great book. To a student,reading an assigned book can be an arduous task. For me, this book was a little adventure. Irving's placement of themes and symbols created a perfect balance, where everything came together. I enjoyed Irving's use of certain techniques. I felt they enhanced the emotion in the novel. The story was humorous and heartwarming. The message affected me personally. This was definately a smart choice, and a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rewarding!","review":"I read Owen Meany over 2 years ago, and it still touches me. John Irving has created a cast of characters who come to life in an extraordinary way. Never before had I laughed out loud while reading a novel. I got some mighty strange looks on the plane from fellow passengers who could not keep up with my chuckles and weeping. I can still hear Owen's voice and it makes me smile. READ THIS BOOK, IT IS EXCELLENT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book where you can discover yourslef","review":"Owen Meany is one of the best develped characters I have ever come across in either a book or in person. In fact his character is so overwhelming that we could only wish that a person such as Owen Meany could acctualy exist. He touches a part of us that we never knew was there. A discovered a new sense of mysticalism, life and love. It's so hard to find such a book that can change ones life forever, especially in the novels of today. I must give Mr. John Irving a lot of credit for being so creative and imaginative. Is is truely a geneous."},{"rating":"2","title":"heartbreaking","review":"The tale of Owen and John brings to our dark, narrow field of vision a sweet glimmer of transcendence, of an eternity that is perhaps incomprehensible but ultimately caring. This is a marvelous and painful rumination on fate, certainly one of the most powerful stories I've ever read. The final page will leave you in tears, wishing for Owen's bright return to a disordered earth. Lovely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it and weep.","review":"'A Prayer for Owen Meany' has what must surely be considered one of the best opening paragraphs in English literature. And from then on - to possibly one of the most moving (and truest) of endings - it does not cease to involve and captivate the reader. Irving interweaves a strange, enthralling story, political allegory and mystical symbolism with considerable technical skill which never falters. The characterisation is a triumph. No-one who meets Owen will ever forget him - nor should they. Read it for the plot. Read it for the artistry. Read it for the underlying metaphor. But for God's sake, read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST book!","review":"This is truely one of the best book that I have ever read. I have to read this book for my English course and I thought it was so thick at first. However, after the first chapter, I can't put it down! I was paralyzed after reading the last page, this is the first time that I am so touched by a novel!! Excellent!! A must-read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY","review":"Think of all the books you've ever read. Remember your favorites? Read a Prayer for Owen Meany and you will add it to your list of favorites. I've recently read it for the third time, and I will read it again someday!A Prayer for Owen Meany is that rare novel that ellicits a sense of loss when you have finished the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked it at first","review":"I really liked the book at first, because Owen was such an interesting character and I just wanted to know more and more about him, but as the book progressed, I lost interest in Owen and the book.This is my first experience with Irving, although I certainly won't make it my last, since he is such an accomplished writer.The religious and political aspects of the book actually made me feel bored and uneasy at different points in the book. I felt that there was no true plot to the book and the ending was very strange."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Prayer for Owen Meany","review":"I found the novel very interesting. I think that the story is something that we all can relate to in some way. The novel is mainly based on trying to find religion and trying to find where you one belongs... Even John Irving has found religion through writing this novel... Overall I found this novel heartbreaking..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't recommend it...","review":"I heard several people rave about this book, so I bought it. After reading it, I can't understand why people find it so wonderful. The first few chapters were pretty good, but after John and Owen become teenagers everything goes downhill pretty fast. After this point I did _not_ find Owen to be a likeable character -- in fact he irritated me. And the thing about his immaculate conception? After reading about \\"his dream\\" and the gravestone for chapters and chapters I found his death to be hilarious. Or maybe it was supposed to be? Was this whole book supposed to be ridiculous?"},{"rating":"2","title":"my prayers were answered","review":"This book was awesome and it was a very simple transaction with almost no effort required on my part.the book was in great condition and I would recommend this book to any serious readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"I good book, that I liked a lot","review":"I liked the characters in this book a lot. They developed into mature pesons during my reading, and they humored me in a good feeling way. I tried to tread one of Irwing books when I was young, but could not stand it. Now I am older and realy enjoyd this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"One of those rare books. I hated to put it down, and when I did, found my mind wandering back to John and Owen, wondering just where it was they were taking me. How refreshing to totally and completely lose myself in the story!! This book is sticking with me, even days after finishing it. I admit to an immense sadness when the last page was in sight, a feeling reserved for the few of many pages turned. It's an emotional investment you don't even realize you're making. I laughed, gasped, held my breath...you name it; It also gave me \\"the shivers!\\". ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than Scarlet","review":"I've just finished Owen Meany and have been mourning the end of the book at the office all day...This is a great and easy read. Please dive in. Many of the previous reviews have touched on Irving's allusions to Hawthorne's THE SCARLET LETTER which is certainly accurate. But this book is NOT about Hester Prynn. It's about FAITH. Regardless of your religion of choice or lack thereof, Irving builds on questions of faith and doubt throughout the novel which are essential for anyone struggling to understanding LIFE. God? Fate? Motivation? Chance? Divine Plan? Christianity aside, Irving weaves a wonderful modern myth which is difficult to put down. One more thing, my use of capital letters had nothing to do with Owen. Really. I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Armadillo","review":"It's the armadillo, man. The armadillo was cool. The armadillo was real; that chapter was lived, my guess is by Irving himself. The character John didn't know what to value, but Owen Meany knew. The best leaders lead by example. They don't tell people how to be, they just know how they themselves need to be. Sometimes all we can do is watch them in awe, as we continue our lives following. Everyone CAN'T be a leader. That was the miracle of Owen Meany."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time consuming...","review":"Once again, John Irving drags 300 pages worth of story out to a 700 page reading hell rife with barely related tangents and pet peeves. As with all of his other novels (with the exception of The World According to Garp - great as both movie and book) it made a much better movie than a novel thanks to treatment by good screenwriters who know how to separate the wheat from the chaff. How this man ever got to be such a popular novelist with such poor editing skills I will never know. I actually got to the point of simply not being able to take it anymore within a hundred pages of the end and tossed this book into the recycling bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got sick of the capital type of Owen's speech","review":"Eh, this book didn't catch me as well as THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP DID. I got sick of the capital type of Owen's speech, it was painful to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I had the choice of a Galaxy of Stars.","review":"This by far the most moving and most enjoyable book I have read in a very long while. Mr. Irving's writing is superb and unique. I truly didn't want it to end, and when it did I couldn't imagine reading another book ever again. Owen Meany and his friend John were just that spectacular."},{"rating":"1","title":"So overrated I can't believe it","review":"I heard this book was \\"life-changing\\" and the only thing life-changing about it is that it is so long & tedious to get through, I now have less life to live! This book should have been edited down to half the length. The writing isn't even that compelling, although there are the occasional laugh-out-loud passages, but boring and pedantic for the greater part. The characters are two dimensional and very predictable, which significantly weakens the plot.I didn't mind the political thread running through, but again, where was the editor? Everything about the book was too repetitive and heavy handed. I just cannot imagine how this book could be so popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly boring","review":"This was the assigned book for my book club. I was so entirely bored and unengaged with the characters that I could not get more than a third of the way through the book. Painfully SLOW. I simply didn't care what happened to any of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must have read the wrong book!","review":"I don't get it! While this book was easy to read, it was so boring to read that I grew angrier with each page instead of interested! On and on about the same things. The characters were flat -- neither likable nor unlikable -- more like background at a dull party."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really true to the hype","review":"A Prayer for Owen Meany is really too worked-up. Lots of details were provided, yet they didn't leave as much room for interpretation as one would think. After guessing the conclusion of the book a quarter of the way through, I continued reading to see how Irving would surprise me. Yet, there were no surprises and I felt as if I had wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible book","review":"It's not really a matter of opinion. This book just plain stinks. What amazes me, looking at these reviews, is that so many people like it. I can't contest an honest emotional response. However, if such mediocre writing is praised so highly and almost universally then today's culture is more stratified than I feared. I now see that books like this are a dangerous blight that threatens quality writing. Avoid like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely amazing","review":"There are not enough words to justly describe this novel. It's amazing! However, it is not until the end, that you witness the true greatness of John Irving's talent in creating the character who really is too good to be true. This novel is guaranteed to pull at your heartstrings causing you to shed a tear. Each character is wonderfully portrayed with their own personality, enabling you to become attached to even the most briefly mentioned character, successfully exposing you to the feelings and emotions that are evident. As a result, you too become affected by the experiences of the main characters, such as Owen, Johnny, Dan and so on. John Irving's amazing style makes you believe that this is a non-fiction novel, but then you realise that there can never be anyone quite like Owen, he is a true individual, something that could only have been created by a superior being.I recommend this novel to everyone, but you must be prepared to be moved by this life-changing novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've ever read.","review":"I was already an Irving fan when I read Owen Meany, from reading Garp and Cider House Rules. But although certain themes resonate through all Irving's novels (New England, boarding schools, sexual tension, death), I was completely unprepared for the effect Owen Meany would have on me. Irving's storytelling and style of writing captivated me; I was moved to tears by the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I'm missing something","review":"I was surprised, but I didn't enjoy this book at all. I felt like I was being hit over the head with symbolism (hands being cut off, etc) and never understood many of the relationships (how did Owen and John become friends? how did Hester and Owen hit it off somehow?) Between this and Cider House Rules, I felt like the same characters were hitting me over the head: the weak father figures, the sexually ambivalent males, the strong-willed but sexually predatory and tormented women (either that or they were dumb-mute type women). I won't be reading any more Irving. Seemed to me the man needs therapy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't expect to like it, but it became one of my favorite books...","review":"When a friend recommended this book to me, I regarded it with skepticism. I had never been a fan of this kind of work before, but John Irving's style and exceptional skill with character development sucked me in, and before I knew it, I was laughing and crying right alongside the characters.The main character begins by telling about his life and his childhood, and his best friend Owen Meany... the book follows their lives while they grow up together, and eventually Owen Meany's \\"prophecy\\" comes true, but in a way that neither of them ever expected. This description doesn't come close to really relating how moving this story is, though.If you love mysteries... read this book.If you love stories with a spiritual bent (think Dean Koontz)... read this book.If you are a fan of Hemmingway or Kerouac... read this book.Irving ties together elements from all, and with enough skill that it WORKS.This is a joyful read; I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read this book every year in the fall.","review":"This is a very sad tale. I always find something to laugh about, with John or Owen. After reading the first page I feel the same way John does. My life in this world, comes from life shared will good fiends. Like John and Owen. The good, bad ugly, and the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Pleasing.","review":"I read this book as part of a book club that my friends and I just started. I was reluctant to read the book- especially when I saw that it was over 600 pages long. Now that I have read it, I'm so glad that I did. It is like no book that I have ever read before. There is so much symbolism in every chapter. You need to read each page carefully as every word counts. The last 100 pages were the best and they just flew by. Once I got to that point, I couldn't put the book down. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that likes a good novel. You may even, like my friends and I did, learn a little bit about American History."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Best","review":"Everyone who knows Irving's work knows what a fan of Dickens he is; this book is the proof. If you like the novel, I highly recommend reading it and \\"Great Expectations\\" back to back. It's a great juxtaposition and adds the pleasure of both novels"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Faith Builder","review":"This book was one of the most exciting reads I have ever had. Irving is a master at weaving plot lines and then tying them all up in just a few pages. The final scene brought real tears to my eyes--a man who rarely cries. I'm glad for the reissue of what should become another great American classic"},{"rating":"2","title":"My All time favourite book","review":"This is my very first review but I couldn't go past this without putting down my views.A Prayer for Owen Meany is my favourite book ever. I read it for the first time when i was 15 years old and have since reread it a couple of times.It's not a short book but the second time I read it, I did it cover to cover without a break!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best old book i've read in a long time","review":"Owen Meany is the most wonderful character I have encountered since Susie Salmon in the The Lovely Bones. Absolutely memorable and with a strength belied by his small stature. I read it once, then reread it immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare Work.....","review":"A rare work, John Irving's story will stick with you and Owen Meany will become a part of your internal world. The novel does become frustrating when Irving repeatedly stops the story to pontificate on the Reagan administration and \\"the trouble with Americans\\". But the readers who weather these sections will be rewarded, as the story progresses and comes together. Owen Meany's journey is challenging to both religious and secular audiences. The friendship between Owen and the narrator is one that you feel in your chest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pulitzer Prize Worthy Novel","review":"I'm going to start this review with a rather dramatic, though absolutely true statement: I literally felt my heart twisting while reading this novel. (Why? Because Irving is a master at pulling at the heartstrings, but in the most INTELLIGENT of fasions.) Of Irving's pre-1990 work, this is his best novel, with \\"The World According to Garp\\" running a distant second, and \\"The Cider House Rules\\" and the lesser-known \\"Water Method Man\\" tying for third place. Irving was one of my favorite novelists of the 1980's, and this book was one of the oh, say, top five books I read during that decade (and I read about 500 books a decade). Since my tastes seem to change over time, I have not read any of Irvings's work in about a dozen years. Nonetheless, I implore you not to miss this book, for you'd be missing a unique literary epiphany."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Prayer for this book to end.","review":"While I appreciate the carnival atmosphere that John Irving loves to portray in his storytelling, it wasn't enough to save Owen Meany for me. After all the hype surrounding this story, I was expecting something a little more entertaining and a little less preachy. Throughout the book I felt as if Irving were trying to convince the reader to believe in a story that wasn't believable. And with over six hundred pages to convince me, the only thing I began to believe was that the book was not worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-woven tale that never stops","review":"Overall great book. One of those books that comes together in the end...and what an ending! Irving's foreshadows have you racing through the final pages but frighten you enough to not want to know how it ends. I just finished it and all I can say is \\"wow\\"! Great read, but very sad. I now understand why all my friends said it is a \\"must read\\". I will never forget Owen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living the Book","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I read it every couple of years and each year I find myself reading the pageant scene outloud to myself. I can feel myself in the middle of the action. You will be pulled in all different emotional directions with Owen Meany and you'll never want it to end. This is a character that will stay with you for a long, long time. A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it just me?????","review":"I don't understand all the hype surrounding this novel. I read the book on the high recommendation of my mother, whose taste almost always comports with mine. It was a chore to get through the whole thing. I felt like, knowing from the first chapters that Owen is special and believes he is the instrument of God, it took entirely too long to tell the whole story. I couldn't sympathize with any of the characters, and I found the grown up John to be a complete bore and a dolt. The length and slow pace of the story frustrated me. Maybe one has to be an Irving fan to enjoy Owen Meany; I admit that I am not -- I did not like A Widow for One Year, though I rate it higher than Owen Meany (at least 3 stars). In all, Owen Meany, for me, fell far below the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read four times....","review":"This is my favorite book ever, and I've read it at least four times. Everytime I get something new and profound out of it, and keep on waiting for John Irving to write anything even close.... I have started his newest book, Until I Find You, but my bar is set high for this author. Though the parts that are set in Canada as Johnny is an adult move slowly, Owen is a dynamic character, and you will find yourself flipping the pages as fast as you can to get back to his character. This is a must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"I loked the book for the most part. It got really slow on the middle so i skipped to the last chapter and hadnt missed a thing. It was recommended to me by a friend. I dont think I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY IT","review":"It's literally a 10 page PREVIEW of the book. Biggest waste of my life. Lesson learned: read the description before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very slow prayer","review":"I expected to love A Prayer for Owen Meany. The World According to Garp and Hotel New Hampshire were both terrific books. My book club members recommended it highly. But I didn't love it. The book reads very slowly. It's like wading through quicksand except you don't sink; you just fall asleep while reading. The premise is interesting but it is nowhere near the \\"classic\\" I expected. The book simply isn't what I expected. There are no great epiphanies, no wonderful moments. The reader just slogs through as the book moves ever so slowly to the expected climax."},{"rating":"2","title":"good so far","review":"I havn't finished this book, and Im not sure when Im going to either. Considering it's a good 615 pages long! But the reading is not hard at all, making the intimidation go away. The beginning seems slow but it's only to introduce to you John's situation and how he got to where he is now. The characters all have something unique in them in a way that you can relate to John. His family is some what weird. Has a strict grandmother, has cousins that you get excited to see, but once you get to see them you want to go home. Alot of things like this make it easy to read and understand. There are no hard words and the authur doesn't go on for 15 minutes just describing a small event. But he gives enough to make you think and sometimes get a chuckle at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in a repetitive story","review":"Friends at work raved about this book. Having read other books by John Irving (Hotel New Hampshire, World According to Garp) and enjoying other books these friends had recommended, I thought it might be interesting. Irving's style wasn't exactly what I normally read, but the books of his I'd read so far certainly had interesting stories.Unfortunately, A Prayer for Owen Meany struck me as repetitive. The same plot points were repeated several times. There were a few sections that were interesting and/or funny. I kept reading, hoping that the story would pick up, or, at least, stop repeating, but it never happened. I kept going, based on the recommendations. After reading about half of the book, I just had to stop. I decided I'd rather spend what little time I have to read recreationally reading a more interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring book....","review":"If you like Irving's books, please read The World According to Garp or Cider House Rules. Owen Meany is not worth your time. It's tedious. I know that some people have called this a challenging read. It's only challenging because it bores the reader to tears. Skip A Prayer for Owen Meany. John Irving has definitely written better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"reasons","review":"I gave A Prayer for Owen Meany 1 star so that you'd read my review. There are so many 5 star ones that you tend to skip over them because they all say the same thing. Something different stands out, for instance; TYPING IN CAPS. hence, my rating. I loved the book and couldn't put it down. Truly thought provoking, but also hysterical and fun to read. Owen is a spiritual figure, but human enough to be a little more believable. Read it. It's sparked many discussions in my group of friends, who've all recently had the privelege of being forced to read it for class. You'll find yourself relating it to everything that happens and wondering what the purposes of your actions are. This wondering will help you to realize and give you more direction in the cloudier areas of your life. I hope you'll enjoy it in the way I did. 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another run on the Irving Merry-Go-Round","review":"With all the showering praise being heaped on Owen Meany I thought I'd write a negative review. I thought I would point out some of the deficiencies in the characters, plot, or writing. I thought I could rant on Irving's x-rated soap opera and denigrate his pandering to the lowest common demonator. I thought there must be something wrong with the book - after all, no book is perfect.Or is it? I can't think of anything I'd have him change, other than perhaps add a few scenes to extend its length so I could enjoy it longer. Who am I kidding? I can't write a bad review of Owen Meany. It's one of the best novels I've ever read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irving's Worst Novel: Read Eveything Else but This","review":"This novel is tedious, redundant, and utterly boring. Irving is one of my favorite writers of all time: Cider House Rules is by far his best with interesting characters and profound social commentary. Hotel New Hampshire and World According to Garp are incredible. A Widow for One Year is astoundingly well done and very entertaining. This one blows!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was B-O-R-I-N-G!","review":"This novel was lifeless. It just dragged on and on, and took me forever to get through it. I do not recommend this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"god help me","review":"I have not finished this book yet as I have been struggling to get through each page (I am on page 195). I have never not finished a book but I am tempted to put this piece... down every second I am reading it. This is so horribly boring. I HATE OWEN MEANY!!!! I can only hope that as the book goes on he suffers a horrible fate! Now that's a prayer for ya!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The blurb on the back of this book said \\"one of Irving's most comical novels\\" or something very much to that effect. I hope this is not so. I had never read Irving and hoped to find something with the quirky characters I've seen in the Garp movie. No luck. The book has an awkward sense of time, moving back and forth much too often. As an aspiring writer, I find it incredibly in need of editing also. It meanders so much, almost like a King novel. What should take one page to describe often takes 2 or 3. If I submitted something like this, do you think it would have been accepted? The first 600 pages of this book is merely a set-up for the last 10. Skip the 500 pages in the middle, as I did. This would have worked much better as a 30 page short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with the hype????","review":"After reading and falling in love with Garp, I couldn't wait to dive into this Irving masterpiece, so loved by so many people. Let me tell you, this was the most drawn out book i have ever read. I was extremely perturbed with all his political and religious diatribe. Although I consider myself an avid reader, I have never had a harder time getting through a book. What a let-down. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"One giggle for Owen Meany","review":"I am taking the time to write this review because there are not enough negative reviews here. Readers, don't waste your time reading this book. I am loosing my faith in humanity to see this many readers who think highly (or deeply) of this superficial story. I decided to read this novel before any of the recent warnings were posted. As Dylan says...\\"it's alright,(John)...you just sort of wasted my precious time\\". Next time Mr. Irving wants to be clever maybe he could just cut out about one million words, and not cash in so blatantly on people who want to be obsessed with wallowing in the angst of the times, over and over and over, without getting anywhere. If a novel isn't great literature then it should be a mystery or a romance or a comedy. What was this? The pathetic narrator never had a prayer, never got one, and certainly didn't have a good one for Owen Meany, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Prayer for Owen Meany","review":"My one star rating is not about the book, it's concerning the publisher. I won't rate the book until I finish reading it. After reading 370 pages, the next pages were 179-242(pages I had read previously). Then the page number is 435 ending with page 617. If the book had just a few pages missing, no worries. But after reading 370 pages, 63 pages missing is just not acceptable. I went to a book store to see if they could help me, but was told Amazon would be my only solution. What a hassle?? This is when internet shopping is complicated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Owen is Interesting. John is a Looser","review":"Book starts great. By the time you get to the middle, it gets boring. Who cares what goes on in Toronto!!!!All questions are answered in last chapter. Even with that it's anticlimactic. Not sure I'd recommend it. Definately not one of John Irving's better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God it's over....","review":"Okay...what is the big attraction to this book? I have read 130 pages and I can't take it anymore. I read rave reviews about how great this novel was, but I just cannot for the life of me get interested in it at all. It is too jumpy and it's not even about Owen...maybe it gets better later, but I have no desire to keep reading on to find out. I rarely put a book down mid-way through, but I look for things to do other than pick it up and continue. And I LOVE to read! So I guess it's on to something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent novel","review":"The book, A Prayer for Owen Meany, is a great book. It is a book enjoyable for people of any age. A Prayer for Owen Meany is a lot like the movie, Simon Birch, so if you liked Simon Birch you will most likely like A Prayer for Owen Meany. In A Prayer for Owen Meany, the main character, Owen Meany, has a disease causing him not to grow and develop like most other children his age. Even with this problem Owen is still a loveable character. He has so much hope, but yet he is so unfortunate. Owen's parents mine a granite quarry. It is a pretty dirty job. Owen's parents are not really involved in Owen's life much. His best friend, John, is a great friend to him. They always play together. John's mother treats Owen as if he were her own. This story is touching, funny, and heartbreaking all at the same time. Read it to find out about Owen Meany, and the life he leads."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Prayer for Owen Meany","review":"I thought the writing was great, but for some reason the story just didn't catch with me. There was a couple spots I thought it could have ended, and it would have been fine with me, but it kept going on and on. I did see the movie Simon Birch and I liked it a little better than the book. However, the movie only touched on a few spots of the book. Most people I've talked to liked this book (and love John Irving), So I guess I'm just the odd man out this time. I am planning on reading some of his other books, someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"People gets so caught up in a few dirty jokes that they completely miss the point of the novel.1.There are a few jokes about religion but the whole idea of the novel is that there is a God who loves us and has plans for each of us. The main character doesn't fear death because Christ will save him for crying out loud!2.Yes, there might be some anti-Republicanism in there (Democrats can have opinions too you know) but the author seems to mock people who complain about the Republicans too much.It's in honors English becasue it requires a little thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Two Cents.","review":"I'm not a prolific reviewer and am late to reading books, but this novel was hard to put down. Many reviewers give a synopsis so I will spare you this. What do I like about this book? The characters. And as I read more and more Irving books it is evident that he is very good at creating relatable, but quirky, characters. At times he may be too verbose, but it is not as noticeable as other authors, and that says something about this skill. His writing, even when discovering tragedy, is warm. One criticism: he is too liberal with the parenthetical statements and semicolons. Vonnegut was a friend of his, but I bet Mr. Irving got more than a few razzings from Kurt about the semicolons. Anyway, I appreciate his humor. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The second best book that I have ever read","review":"I've read quite a few books in my day. This one currently ranks #2. Sitting atop the heap at the time of this review is...drum roll... Rabbit, Run by John Updike. The others in my top five (in no particular order) are The Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follet, A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole, and The Shipping News by E. Anne Proulx."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book ive ever read","review":"I just read A Prayer for Owen Meany, the second time in the 2 weeks since i recieved the book....i just keep reading the ending over and over again and nearly cry each time. i guess because im a lazy high school student i havent read very much worthwhile liturature, but reading this book has given me the drive to read more...to learn more. I was at my job 2 weeks ago, and a customer came in at started a conversation with me...he asked me if i had ever read A prayer for owen meany, or anything by John Irving...i said no, and i had never heard of John Irving before. He said \\"oh my gosh you really gotta read this book, its just really really great\\" so...i said i'd pick it up...but..i forgot. a week later the same guy came in and asked me if i got the book yet, and i hadnt....the next day...he came in again...and gave me a copy, to keep. Thats how important it is to read this book. It changed my life"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite possibly Irving's best book","review":"There is no such thing as a perfect book, but John Ieving's A Prayer for Owen Meany comes very, very close. Featuring a literate story, characters that come to life in the heart and mind, and an ending that is both joyful and heartbreaking A Prayer for Owen Meany is required reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Owen Meany: A Dramatic Tale of a Second Prince of Peace","review":"I enjoyed John Irving's novel for the most part. Some parts of the story seemed unbelievable, but, on the whole, it was a touching book. One thing that really stood out for me was the religious references throughout the story. I found this aspect of the book very thought-provoking. For example, Owen Meany's idea that Jesus Christ was \\"used\\" is a whole new idea about the Easter story for me. Also, the very idea that Owen Meany was a \\"virgin birth\\", a second Christ child, is particularly intriguing to me. One aspect of the book that I have mixed feelings about is the way the book was written. It jumped all over time, sometimes before finishing an important part. For example, we were told about Owen Meany's funeral before we were told about his death. At times this technique was frustrating, but I think mostly it added dramatic effect. Overall, I thought this was a pretty good book. I thought it was well-written and very creative. Four stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardcover????","review":"When I order a hardcover book, I expect to get a full size book, not a paperback with a hardcover. I read this book years ago and just wanted a copy of it for my collection. Very dissapointed! I have never seen a hardcover paper back before so I didn't know to beware. I may stop ordering from Amazon because of the poor descriptions of their merchandise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"This was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life and I would never read it again even if the fate of earth depended on it. The only positive comment I have on this book is the ending; the book is so long and unnecessarily detailed that just knowing you're nearing the end is the only pleasure I can see that the reader could get out of this book. The characters, setting, and overall plot are unoriginal in the sense that they all seem to reflect upon much of the author's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Irving and the complainer's novel","review":"Irving's A Prayer For Owen Meany is all about a rambling, disgusted god who condemns the world and cannot tell man what is right. The new gospel's salvation is not based on loving your neighbor as you would love yourself, but instead focuses on venting the anger of mankind towards the current system by criticizing every thing it does without having the power to solve those problems. Basically, if a god condemns all the institutions of man, the victims of the world (who in the end extends to everyone in death) are assured that all of their problems originate from the current system and regime. Everyone eventually will be defeated by life, and it feels good to go kicking and screaming in protest like Owen instead of being silent like the Christ of the Bible. In short, it is a \\"feel good\\" novel, perhaps explaining why A Prayer for Owen Meany was #1 International Best Seller. Anybody who reads this book is a chronic complainer with nothing to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Prayer for Owen Meany","review":"i had order A Prayer for Owen Meany from the seller. to date i have not receive my product or answer to my 2 emails.i would sugget to future buyers from this seller to be aware.i am totally disappointed with the service from the seller. i can not rate this seller at all.-Vanita Patel"},{"rating":"2","title":"I know there are already 500 reviews saying this but...","review":"John Irving achieves something completely unique. He creates a real person, a life, someone to be cherished. This is the most incredible book I have ever read, and I am sure will ever read. Magnificent."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Glad I Didn't See Simon Birch First","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book about a small boy (up to young man) with a very high-pitched voice who believes he was put on this earth to do good (he just doesn't know exactly what). That's Owen Meany.The story is narrated by Owen's best friend. The setting switches between past and present and holds several mysteries that are all solved by the end of the book.The story is sweet and maintains interest throughout. There is some political rambling about the Viet Nam \\"conflict,\\" but I actually learned something from that, too.After reading the book, I watched \\"Simon Birch\\" as I was told that the movie was \\"inspired by\\" the book. The movie leaves out several interesting characters (most obvious is the omission of the narrator's punk rock cousin) and changes several important details. I am happy that I read the book first, because I truly enjoyed reading it, and if I had seen the movie first, I would not have read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Compares!!!!","review":"A Prayer for Owen Meany is one of the best books I have ever laid my hands on. I usually hate reading books for school, but this is the only exception. I have never enjoyed a book in my life until I saw this. Irving effectively weaves several topics ranging from childhood games to religion into one master plot. Every sentence is written with its own uniqness and in a way that doesn't confuse a reader. If you have to read just one book.... read this one!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just count the number of reviews of this book!!","review":"Amazon.com was closing in on 700 published reviews of this book when I started typing mine, so you can imagine the kind of response this novel has garnered from the public!I hope you can get through this book in one sitting, because if you can't you will suffer the same fate that befell my friend Kristen and myself. When we had to put the book down, unfinished, we couldn't stand being in a different room from it.At once comic, tragic, spiritual, and downright eccentric, APFOM will ensconce John Irving in the upper pantheon of great contributors to 20th century literature. There's not much else to say here that hasn't been said a couple of hundred times already on this website. This book is a treasure, and all who read it will be rewarded by its enriching, graceful, yet odd story."},{"rating":"2","title":"If stuck on an island with one book...","review":"I read a book a day during the rainy season while I was in the Peace Corps (you RPCVs know what I'm talking about) and without a moments hesitation, I can say that of the two hundred or so paperbacks in the Peace Corps office (I read them all), this book was the best. I have since given it as a gift to many of my friends (makes gift-giving easy). As proof of the quality of this book, let me point out that someone has rated this book as a 10 every few days since amazon.com came on-line. I think other people are just as compelled as I am to testify to the power and pleasure of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure genius","review":"This is undoubtedly the best book I have ever read. The plot is so complicated and intriguing that when you reach the end, and you finally see how John Irving ties together all of the intricate details, you are left dumbstruck. Despite the many carefully crafted foreshadowing clues, it's impossible to figure this one out until the end. If you've loved other books by Irving, you'll find the same quirky characters, rich symbolism, and literary craft.Un..forget..able!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've fallen in love with this book!","review":"Not having read John Irving before, I had to become accustomed to his style of writing. Irving simultaneously develops his characters and moves the plot at just the right pace to let the reader fall head over heels into the story. Upon finishing the book last night, I literally cried because Owen Meany, Johnny Wheelwright and the minor characters in whose lives I had become involved (and almost intertwined!) were no longer there. As a person who has struggled with many aspects of faith and religion, I grew to love Owen Meany and feel him as a friend guiding me to ask questions about myself. This novel is one for believers, non-believers, and anyone who has ever wondered about God or miracles. Owen Meany has been my miracle for the past 600 pages, and I only hope that other readers will take the time to experience such a wonderful masterpiece. John Irving is a genius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is always close to me","review":"When I was a freshman in high school, my friend threw her tattered hard cover copy of \\"A Prayer\\" in front of me and told me she would give me a week to finish it. She couldn't bear to be away from it for any longer than that. After reading it, I understand why.10 years later, I am the same way. For a book to change your life SO MUCH at such a young age and continues to draw you in time after time truly must be an amazing piece of literature. I have passed one of my copies on to 15 different people, who in turn buy two copies- one to keep for themselves, and another to loan out to people.If you are a skeptic on life, love and the world in general, A Prayer For Owen Meany draws you in to assure you that you are not alone in your thoughts, then magnificently shows you how to change your outlook. It is a book of epic proportions, but flies by, resulting in the desire to read it again and again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"an absolute classic","review":"I cannot recommend a book with more enthusiasm. After reading the novel multiple times, I am still entertained. Any words of excitement will not give the book justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever!","review":"After reading this book I wanted very much to meet the man Owen Meany.

I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Prayer for Owen Meany","review":"The book didn't keep my interest, boring and redundant and the characters kept moving back to the original scene, so never felt like the story was going anywhere. I didn't even finish the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable","review":"Set in the fictional town of Gravesend, New Hampshire in the 1950's and 60's, John Wheelwright narrates this coming of age story of himself and his best friend, Owen Meany, . Owen is small in stature, but is a larger than life character who speaks in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS. I only read it recently, and have to agree with those who have said that it is one of the greatest novels of the 20th century. Whether you like literary fiction or just want to read a really good book, Owen Meany is a character you will NEVER forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review for Owen Meany","review":"Owen Meany starts off as a good humorous read without neccessity for deep thought and insight and makes a enjoyable start. However, the reason I did not give it a full five stars was because as the book continues near to the end, the humor wanes into an increasingly serious tone of voice as the characters undergo maturity. The focus of Owen Meany is strong throughout the book, except for occasional lapses in time to which, as of this day, I still haven't fully understood why the author would diverge to the present day to explain a story about his past.The narrator, of course, goes through some complex changes as well as the other key characters, however everyone else, as expected, seem rather flat overall. Despite a somewhat lack-luster ending, the book does do a good job of closing all it's seams and leaving no \\"cliff-hangers\\" for the reader. Overall, a good book, with some great reads at the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book of all times","review":"I have read many, many books, and I have never found one that I like better than Owen Meany. I have read it over and over, and I still end with the same question in mind: Did Irving know the ending when he started the book? The most minor things in the story make the ending happen when they all come together. When you first read it, how could you know that the pracice of that basketball shot could mean so much? I am sorry to hear that Irving is going to re-write his current book. I can hardly wait for every one he writes, but Owen is a the top of the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed out loud one minute, cried the next","review":"What a roller coaster! I literally laughed out loud while reading Owen Meany. By the end, I was crying. Owen Meany is one of the best characters in all of literary history. His straight-forward approach to life was refreshing and John Irving developed him to the point that made me care about Owen and what his future held out for him. The story had many twists and turns that were surprising yet somehow made sense. The symolism was rich throughout - Owen's metaphoric comparisons to Christ made the book almost haunting. His wisdom made it appealing. I would recommend this book to anyone who has the patience to read over 600 pages. This is John Irving's best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This has to be one of the best books I have ever read (and I am an avid reader.) I recently saw the movie - \\"Simon Birch\\" - and while this movie was great - it could only portray a portion of Owen/Simon's life. The book is a great continuation of Owen (Simon's) life and I highly reccomend reading it if you enjoyed the movie.John Irving has the best character developement of any author I have ever read and I was sad to end the book and leave Owen's life. The book was great. It made me laugh and cry. Like I said before, it is one of the best books written."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant novel","review":"I reluctantly began reading this novel at the insistence of my wife, who had heard good things about it, but had not read it herself. To put it simply, I could not put it down. Such a brilliant novel about a simple boy who changed the world. I cannot express the profound effect this novel had on me, for I will never forget Owen Meany."},{"rating":"2","title":"Though a slow starter, an intense, memorable read.","review":"I still have visions of Owen, even though I read this book about six years ago; touching and cruel, powerful and mild"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow read","review":"This is one of those books that drones on and on and on....I am 2/3 of the way through it and am now just scanning the pages to get to the end. How any author can fill a book with useless information is beyond me. Reminds me of The Girl With the Pearl Earring-everyone RAVES about how fabulous the book is, but it's just 600 pages of sheer boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surrealism in print","review":"John Irving's surreal novel trips the dark fantastic in a way that leaves the reader feeling haunted by a cloud of despair. Readers are encouraged to have a heavy dose of hilarity handy before attempting this deep dive into depression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind-Numbing Pabulum","review":"If you're a religious wackaloon, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, don't bother. Don't get me wrong, the writing in this novel is perhaps Irving's best ever...it's just the premise behind this story that makes it a 1 star read. Even if you're intellectually undeveloped enough to believe in God, you must ask yourself why an omnipotent being would go to such great lengths to accomplish, in Owen Meany, what he could easily do himself simply by waving his magic wand (or whatever it is the Christian God uses to perform miracles)? Then again, I guess it's no surprise that in a nation full of brain-dead Bible thumpers who consider absurd myths like Noah's ark and Jonah and the whale as actual occurrences, this novel not only seems plausible, but inspiring. To those of us who have learned to think critically, however, this book is 600 pages of mind-numbing pabulum."},{"rating":"1","title":"I surrender!","review":"This was one of the most tedious books I have ever read (more accurately, tried to read). I generally read books to the end, even if I don't like them. A Prayer for Owen Meany beat me, though. I gave up after 2 weeks of trying and not getting even half way through. I went to Wikipedia for the summary and am very glad I didn't spend another 2 weeks slogging through this morass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"I am dumbfounded by the homage paid to this thing.After the set-up, one can just proceed to the lastfew pages for the martyrdom scene. You know it'scoming, you know where it's gonna be, and sure enough ... Irving tells you who the good guys are, who the bad guys are. Yea, yea, root for Owen. Watch him rout the unbelieving dolts in his path. This is a rousing testimony to faith? To achieve faith one has to be bowled over by a miracle? Or shabbily tricked into a miracle, like the \\"evil\\" Reverend Merrill? This is a very transparentmanipulation. When you preach to the choir, youdon't have to try very hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly terribly written and even worse story line","review":"This book is not at all what I expected from John Irving. Not only is the story weak, it is truly insipid and carries on and on with vulgar and unrelated information for pages and pages. The book focuses on this supposedly faithful Owen Meany, who is a complete hipocrite, and works completely against the them of faith that is supposed to be put forth. I truly have never found a more mediocre and badly written story with as irritating a character as Owen Meany and his rediculuously pathetic friend who narrates the story. How John Irving of all people manages to come up with the out there story line is incomprehensible - it seems as if he couldn't decide what type of story he wanted to write. The only thing that is more amazing than that an excellent writer could write such basic level trash is that people could actually enjoy it. Save yourself and read one of his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"Did not hold my interest. Very drawn out without enough of a plot or story.Prefer action to this. Some parts were ineresting, although found that skipping parts to look for the story wasn't much better so quit reading altogether. Some friends have felt the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap knock off of \\"The Tin Drum\\"","review":"Every major element of Grass's \\"The Tin Drum\\" is stolen and made sappy: main character with stunted growth and unusual voice who works with stonecutting. Irving would probably call it an homage, but I call it cheap, thinly veiled plagiarism."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my top ten favorite books of all time","review":"\\"Owen Meaney\\" is one of my top ten favorite books of all time. I read this book when it was first published way back when and loved it. I have subsequently re-read it another couple of times. I liked it better even than \\"Garp\\". I have a hankering to read it again now that I've just seen the \\"Simon Birch\\" movie. I didn't expect to like the movie considering how much I've enjoyed the book but it wasn't too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hard to read...deep meaning and slow","review":"Owen was a likable enough character, but John ny left a lot to be desired...seemed he could never form any decent relationship with anyone other than his small friend Owen...Book jumps around a lot and has lots of religious meaning and dialogue. Last 100 pages were actually worth reading but the first 520 were hard to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one??","review":"I must be the only one who was annoyed by Owen's introversionand monomania. Although well written, Irving's constant ravings onpolitical and religious views became tiresome., and the \\"mood\\" of the book was bizzare and depressing. People's whose lives are changed by this book need a better focus on how they are leading their lives. Fate is not real, and especially should not be something to live by. Things happen for a reason, we make them happen through individual effort, and decisions we make everyday. The book's theme that we do things to accomplish a greater purpose or meaning is misleading. The things we do everyday are the greater purpose. Quit searching for life changing ideas and live for the present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Pigswill","review":"For my A.P. English class, we were presented with this book and an alternative choice. Heeding the advice of my good friend, I selected this one. I will never forgive him for this. The book was painfully tedious, and I regret wasting two precious weeks of my summer reading it. There is no interesting premise, and the notion of this peculiar child as a Christ figure was extremely far-fetched. His death comes as nothing more than a great relief that the book must, it simply must, be reaching its long-awaited conclusion. The great speeches, entirely in capitals, makes one feel as though the book is screaming at you, and no one wants to be screamed at. Additionally, the vignettes concerning the Reagan Administration were mindless drivel, not because of Irving's politics but because of their poor inter-weaving into the body as a whole. It has been a few years since I suffered through this, and in retrospect I feel that my time, and not Owen Meany, was the martyr here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Single best fiction I have ever read. Life-changing.","review":"Within the first two pages of reading, you are totallyemersed into the life and characters of Owen Meaney.Like many of Irvings characters, they tend to leap rightout from the page and take you with them.Owen Meany, like many of us, is a character that can not fita standard definition. His physical, as well as hisemotional make-up are the hooks by which all othercharacters and situations hang.Meaney is a story, it is a journey, it is a spiritualexperience that will touch anyone who reads it. It is aroller-coaster ride of fun, while pulling you intosurprising turns with an unexpected ending. There are noholes in this story--it is beautifully tied together."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST IRVING","review":"INSPIRED is the word...this novel is so heart-wrenchingly REAL to you it just breaks your heart, and the vivid characters become your friends, people you know and really, really love. The creation of Owen Meany is one of Irving's best; he is so richly imagined you can hear him speak, see him walk and watch him grow. The twists and turns of what essentially is a mystery are enormously enjoyable, and, in the end, cathartic. This is truly one of those books you finish and cry a little bit, sorry that the profound experience it gave you is over."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed and cried throughout the book","review":"I have read this book at least 5 times in the past 10 years. I had to purchase another one because the first book started losing pages from being read so much. I won't even loan this book to anyone for fear they will forget to return it. Need I say more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic John Irving","review":"He never fails to entertain in a thoughtful way! This was a quick easy read, entertaining to the last page!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book","review":"I read constantly and obsessively, and this is my favorite book of all time. My son is even named Owen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me not only speechless, but sobbing","review":"I wasn't sure I was going to get through this at first. The chapters are insanely long and fairly daunting to get through. Having said that, the entire book is absolutely worth reading. The sheer amount of detail is staggering, which can be a pro or a con depending on your reading preference. Fans of this book and any type of rock music should look up the song Goodbye Sky Harbor by Jimmy Eat World. It is heavily based on the book. That song paired with this book have left me feeling emotionally refreshed and stable for the first time in a while. Would recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"jaimelire","review":"I bought this book for its 4.5 stars.....After 15% into the reading and not liking the unfolding of it all, I went back to read the reviews...I am among those who are not taken by the story, the personages and the slow motion of it all. Could not go any further into the reading. Deleted ."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the first page on, you won't be able to put this down","review":"WOW! I cannot remember the last time that I was so engulfed by a book. The characters became more than words in a fictional book. The story, the characters, the emotions - EVERYTHING - are so well developed that I never wanted the book to end. It is fiction, which I usually don't enjoy, but the story is full of historic information, literature references, religious demands - all of which evoke thoughts and emotions within the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book","review":"My sister and I often trade our opinions about books, agreeing on many and disagreeing on a few. A Prayer for Owen Meany, however is just \\"The Book.\\" We share this book carefully with friends, as we know anyone who doesn't adore it will lose some of our esteem in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Look at One of God's Messengers","review":"I don't believe there is any chance of me meeting another human like Owen Meany. I'm sure that if I hadn't read this novel, I would have never known a person like Owen. I'm certainly glad I had the chance. At the completion of this book, I had a wonderful feeling of accomplishment, partly because \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\" is rather long, and partly because it has such a lasting effect. This is an intricate story full of comedy, tragedy, symbolism, and \\"higher\\" power. It's not everyday that I get the opportunity to see the tale of a messenger of God. I gained an honest oultook on many subjects of life and the world by reading this book. The powerful meanings, images, and general feeeling of this story radiate throughout it. I would definately recommend \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\" to anyone wishing to enhance their personal library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The book has its enjoyable moments, and Irving is sometimes very funny in relaying anecdotes and scenes. As a complete novel, however, he misses by a wide margin. One particularly annoying device is Irving's repeated and ham-handed fore-shadowing: \\"As you shall see...\\" and \\"As it all became clear to me later...\\" I'm surprised his editor wasn't able to guide him away, as those points seemed more appropriate for a high school creative writing assignment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, beautiful edition!","review":"I had bought this book for friends of mine as a wedding gift and was not disappointed! With pain in my heart/hands I had to give the book away as intended - the book is one of my all-time favourites and the introduction by John Irving himself made it even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't finish reading it.","review":"I found the parts about his friendship with Owen Meany were good, but it just didn't capture my interest that much. To be frank, I thought the use of language to be crude. I just don't care for that and found it particularly unnecessary in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"People have been recommending this book to me forever...","review":"... so I finally got a copy, ready to enjoy it. Halfway through, still waiting for anything interesting to happen, I gave up. Clearly John Irving is just not for me.For the record, I've never managed to finish \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" either."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Irving's Masterpiece","review":"This was the first novel from John Irving that I've read on the advice of my CFO (The World According to Garp was my second and I am on The Cider House Rules) and since then I have become Irving's number one fan. The book was so well written and the plot was so intricately done that even though the end was predicable it did not take anything away from the novel-if anything, it made you want to read on to find out how everything unfolds. If I could, I would give it more than five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorite Books","review":"If you've seen the movie it's reminiscent of the feel of the book. I really liked the book and will probably read it again one day, something I NEVER do normally! This is a book that I won't trade or give to a friend. I loved the two main characters' friendship and I like that the book delved more deeply into their relationship and their lives than the movie did. Great book - I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spin on how you view the world","review":"I read it 'cuz co-founder of the pop band Barenaked Ladies said it was his favorite book and I like it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a good novel - a great novel!","review":"The Modern Library recently released the top 100 works of fiction in the English language of the 20th century. Well, one of those works will have to be removed because 'A Prayer for Owen Meany' is not only one of the best novels of the 1990s, but, easily is and will be one of the top 100 of this century. John Irving has created perhaps the greatest character in modern literature - Owen Meany. The metaphorical mix of religion and childhood is simply astounding. An absolute 'must read'!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Sticking It Out","review":"This book is a little long, but I was amazed by how much changed in the last 100 pages. My expectations and assumptions were blown away as the book became even more bizarre in the end than I had expected. At least five strangers stopped me when they saw me reading it and said that it was a \\"good book,\\" but only one of them had actually stuck it out to the end. I recommend that you try."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only every person saw purpose in their every action!","review":"This novel is a human lesson on how to perceive life. If every human being took time to think that every single act they commit or word that they speak has a purpose and a consequence, how much better off would society be? While the story seemed to drag a bit as we reached the climactic ending (a climax which was such despite the fact that the reader knows it is coming), Irving threw in enough surprises, interspersed with a touch of humor, to keep you interested. The story-telling here is exceptional!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BOOK","review":"WITHOUT EQUIVOCATION, THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. AN AMAZING EXPLORATION OF LOVE,FAITH, FRIENDSHIP AND BELIEF.YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK BEFORE YOU DIE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, the 5 star reviews are all true!!!!","review":"I bought this book from Amazon.com on the strength of the reviews. To sum up, they are all true. This is a moving, funny, sad, complex and ultimately entertaining book. Read it and laugh and read it and weep. But you must read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Damn Good Book!","review":"I was required to read this novel for an english class concerning American fiction after WWII. After making my way through the usual suspects, such as Salinger, Pynchon and Delillo, I came to Irving's novel. I had never previously had any interest in reading his work and was curious as to why it was included. I started reading Owen Meany around noon on a Sunday and finished around six AM the next morning. What can I say? It is one of the two or three best books I have ever read. I whole-heartedly agree with everyone's praise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Complex, Brilliant, Masterful Work","review":"I classify my reading life into categories of before and after--before reading Owen Meany and after reading it. I qualify my deepest friendships by asking people to read this book. Those who \\"don't get what the big deal is\\" are relegated to the back of the address book!! I was riveted the first time I read it, and have read it four or five times since then, digging into subtleties such as Irving's references to armlessness throughout the book and laughing hysterically each time I come to the part about the maid dying. The end of the book haunts me still. Irving is one of my favorite authors, and this book is, without exception, the best I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful-- 5 Stars","review":"John Irving is one of the great fictional storytellers of our time and A Prayer For Owen Meany ranks as one of his finest, like Cider House Rules, In Our Time, and The World According To Garp. This is a long story which begins with two young boys in a small New Hampshire town. Epic in length and scope and a great story with characters you will always remember. I first read this story over fifteen years ago and I never forgot Owen and Johnny. The story is transformational, humorous, emotional and told in John's great style. Not a story to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Owen Meany should be required reading!","review":"At the venerable age of 78 I had only ever read one John Irving book. It was The World According to Garp & I sort of struggled through it & never felt I needed to read another. I am & always have been a voracious reader. Reading is to me akin to breathing, a very important part of living. A daughter of a friend suggested on Facebook that considering the political climate in the country today we should read A Prayer for Owen Meany. So I did. I am so glad that I did. Owen Meany is a jewel of a book. It is unforgetable! I felt utter dismay as I got near the last pages as I didn't want it to end. The ending literally blew my mind. It was horrifying yet it was perfect. I will say it again. Everybody should read this magnificient book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Prayer for Owen Meany","review":"I bought this book because I noticed it was on the recommended reading list of several schools (high school and universities) in my area. I figured it would be a light summer read.Well...I think it was one of the best..if not the best..book I have ever read. I laughed, I cried, and when it was over I passed it on to 3 people. Now I'm desperately waiting for them to finish it so I can have someone to talk to and discuss everything about the book.It was very thought provoking. I don't want to give any of it away to someone who hasn't read it....just do it now! : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite work of fiction.","review":"Slow at the start, it's worth it for the payoff. Manipulative, yes, but very enjoyable manipulation. If you loved Simon Birch, it's only because you didn't read this book first; it dwarfs the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Worth Reading","review":"No library is complete without this book - I mean that. I'm an avid reader with many favorites, but I have to say that \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\" is one of my all-time favorites. It's so different from any other literature that it really speaks to readers in a way vastly different from anything else.This book is worth reading over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal Book","review":"Owen Meany by John Irving is in my belief, one of the greatest books of our time. Irving has a way in this book through means of his characters, setting, and plot to pull you into Gravesend, NH.Owen Meany, John Wheelright, and other characters in the book pull on your heart, and make you think a little more with your mind than you are used to. But they do not just make you think of small or great things...they make you think of life.As you are pulled through time in NH with John, Owen, and others...it is time that binds these characters...from the 40s into the late 80s. It is the times around them, and the time that develops these characters that make them, and this book great."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Book!!!","review":"I recently read this and all I can say is WOW!!!Owen is unlike the other boys. And he knows why. His parents informed him when he was younger. He's the secondChristchild.I'd definitely recommend this book:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A prayer for Owen Meany","review":"I read A prayer for Owen Meany for an English class. At first, I was intimidated by the book's length because I didn't have much time to read it. I decided I'd give it a try. The book started off very slowly, giving boring background information. I was bored and thought about choosing a different book, but I thought it would probably get better as the novel progressed, and it did. Once the story really started taking shape, I was intrigued. A prayer for Owen Meany is the story of two boys growing up together. John Irving did a great job making believable and lovable characters. once I got to know each character, i couldn't stop reading. After the first chapter, I absolutely loved the book. Irving did an excellent job of making both a great plot and wonderful characters. Although the book does not have a captivating beginning, I loved it and feel it is definitely worth reading."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],x={key:0},N={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(C,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-b66ea8a7"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/61.md","filePath":"people/61.md"}'),R={name:"people/61.md"},L=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{G as __pageData,L as default};
