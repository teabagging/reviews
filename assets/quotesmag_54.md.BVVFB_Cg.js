This is a story has love and adventure and the consequences of a lifetime. When a young bat is sucked into the underworld he has to make decisions of who and who not to trust. He is faced with grueling tasks and long journeys so he can escape with his life. The characters a so exiting Griffin, a young bat that is not very brave and thinks way to much. Luna, is brave, daring, strong, and does not think at all before she plunges into any wild ideas she comes up with. Shade is Griffins father who is like Luna a lot but he is very famous and is known all over the forest. This is a book that will really keep you on the edge of your set.

I want to say that to truly enjoy \\"Firewing\\" you should first read the book \\"Sliverwing\\", and the book \\"Sunwing\\" as these are a continuing saga, about Shade, and his friends and foes, in a sruggle for survival in the world of bats. These books will endear Shade to the reader, and I would compare the stories to that of \\"Watership Down\\". These books will make you laugh, cheer, and cry.

Furthermore, the ending was so horrible, I feel like it ruined the endings provided by the previous two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but weakest in series","review":"To be honest, this is the only book so far in this series I have not really enjoyed. Maybe it is a little too dark, or maybe it was just the story, but either way, of the four books in this series, this is the only one I am not likely to read again. Shade, our hero from the first two books, has now grown and become a father himself. After an earthquake, his son Griffin is drawn into an underground world through a fissure that has opened up. Shade realizes that the legends say, if a living being enters the underworld realm of the dead and does not escape quickly, its life will be lost. Shade is frantically searching for his son and soon realizes an old enemy is also in the underworld.Oppel again uses mythology and legends and weaves a story of bats around them. It does fit with the other books in the series, I just happened to not enjoy it as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little under expectations","review":"I enjoyed Kenneth Oppel's previous two books in this series: \\"Silverwing\\" and \\"Sunwing\\". They were thrilling adventures about bats, to cut it short. When I picked up \\"Firewing\\", I had expectations that it was going to be just as great (or better) than \\"Silverwing\\" and \\"Sunwing\\". For me, I was disappointed.The plot is catching - the main bat, Shade, has a son, Griffin, who has burrowed himself into the Underworld. Throughout the book, the excitement gets better as the Underworld bats seek for the life that Griffin has. However, at the end, I was majorly disappointed.I'm not going to give the ending away since readers still want to find out for themselves.

This heater is a lifesaver out there. Its a little big and a little noisy (though, I've yet to see a ceramic space heater that wasn't a little noisy) but heats like a champ. It can be 30 degrees outside and this will have it a 350 sq ft room up to the 60s in only a few hours. If I know its going to be a super cold night then I'll run it on a timer for a few hours prior to going to bed and turn it on an hour or so before I want to go spend time out there and its warm and comfy. The high settings is great at bringing the temp up and the low is good at quietly maintaining that comfort zone. Just one note, this heater (like most) is 1500 watts on the high setting which is around 12.5 amps meaning if it isn't on a dedicated circuit you won't be able to run much else on the same circuit before you hit the typical 15 amp circuit load."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as effective as desired","review":"This product does not provide as much heat as I thought it would.

However, it would run for hours in our [albeit drafty] 12 x 10 ft. living room and never achieved a temperature above 62 degrees, even with the central heat system set at 60.We also regretted its lack of an automatic shut-off feature.

Ugh, this is just a \\"run-of-the-mill\\" pop-rock album. You may as well go buy from masters of that genre like AC/DC or Metallica (fine bands, but by no means Therion). No evidence that this is at all like their previous offerings based on Symphonic Metal - just a basic, pedestrian pop-rock meh. As I said, other bands pull off the Pop-Metal genre far better than this attempt by Therion. Hopefully they will return to being the Symphonic Metal powerhouse they used to be (a la: Deggial, Lemuria, Secret of the Runes, Sirius B, Theli, Vovin - GK simply does NOT fit in with those works)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Therion is Always Supreme","review":"I've just finished listening to this album.

But at the same time, as I was trying to get used to their new incarnation, I kept in mind that unlike a number of other long-time bands (*cough*metallica*cough*), they have a history of aging like fine wine and only growing more complex, more refined with the passage of time......so by the time I put on the second CD, my faith rewarded me and indeed, it grew on me from the very first listen!

This is why not: first, as I have already said, it leaves this horrible bubbling (from my personal experience at least).

They're OK, but just not as good as the jumbo raisins I get locally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than typical raisins","review":"Wow -- I didn't think there was much difference between brands of raisins, but these are really good. Nice and plump and not all dried out and stuck together like raisins typically are. My family really noticed a difference. Nice bonus that they are organic. My only complaint might be that the zipper on these large bags sometimes doesn't hold out."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST EVER, PERIOD!","review":"Really, just listen to this piece of 'heaven', indeed!!!Now Jai is in Germany and goes by his name Jason Rowe,also good music but never as marvelous as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the highlights of its decade","review":"Listening to \\"heaven\\" is like wandering into a black and white cafe with an excellent stage act. Neo-noirjazzpop sung by a handsome dark angel as though his (after)life depended on it. Original songs like \\"I Believe\\", \\"Wishing The Rain Away\\", and \\"Heaven\\" are atmospheric and haunting and the cover of \\"Cry Me A River\\" probably made Julie London envious. J.J. Cale's \\"Magnolia\\" is given a languid yet sweat soaked arrangement that is Weller-worthy.Jason (Jai) Rowe has a new album out, released in Germany in February 2007 and set for US release sometime in the fall. In the meantime, snag a copy of \\"Heaven\\" before they are all gone. Buy two, a friend will probably want one after they hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent voice!","review":"When I heard \\"Heaven\\" on the radio, I was determined to rush out and buy the cd no matter how much it was. (It's a shame that you can't hear a sample cut of that song, it rocks!) I was a little disappointed at first with the lack of variety in the songs, but if you give the album time, it definitely grows on you!This guy has an awesome voice, and although it seems like nobody has ever heard of him, everyone seems to like his music. Give it a chance, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD!","review":"And I truly mean Awe-some. In fact I'm listening to it RIGHT NOW!. Jai's soulful voice is so soothing and it is perfect music on a rainy day like today. First time I heard \\"I Believe\\" I was blown away by it. I highly recommend this CD even if you don't like soul like me. Jai is much different and will change your mind about it. If you like Jai's voice I recommend Mono \\"Formica Blues\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm definatly in \\"Heavn\\" when I listen to this CD!","review":"Oh my gosh, anyone and everyone should by this wonderful, unique CD. Jai has an awesome voice, and there are five SUPER GOOD songs, and the rest are pretty good too. I get chills when I listen to \\"I Need Love\\" & \\"Cry Me A River.\\" Good background, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasently surprised","review":"unfortunately, i haven't much time to write an in-depth review of this album. however, i thought it was a shame that it hadn't been review yet. i had no idea who this artist was until i ventured over to the \\"secretly canadian\\" website and listened to one of the samples from there. i purchased the album the next day. this is a great double-album that i have basically been listening to non-stop for the past week. a fantastic lo-fi album with an accessible, warm 70's vibe throughout. recomended to any fan of the singer/sonwriter genre.

Unfortunately though I was really disappointed. A good biography has the ability to make you feel like you knew the person, and have some insights about their life. I didn't feel that way at all after reading this book. It certainly covers the basics, and gave an accurate timeline. But, it does not have the personal anecdotes, and first-person accounts that are really engaging. I felt like I learned more about Fermi as a person from Rhodes' \\"The Making of the Atomic Bomb\\" than I did from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd doom","review":"I am a huge fan of them, in truth my favorite band of all time.

I'll update if something changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, Short Album","review":"This album is worth the mere 10 dollars that it costs. Although the versions of Halloween and Warehouse are better on \\"Live at Luther College\\" and Recently is better on \\"Remember Two Things\\", this is a great album for someone who wants to have recordings of All Along the Watchtower and Recently without spending 30 dollars on two CDs.This album is a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DMB Fan","review":"I do own all of the DMB music CD's (i just preordered Everyday a minute ago) and i have yet to be disappointed by any of their CD's, Recently included. It's an awesome CD that covers everything DMB does, and does so well at that. It's not as long as the double CD sets, so it's great for short car trips and for those of us that have bills to pay. If you like DMB, or just want to try them out before you commit, get it, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"i thought i 'd try this","review":"some one recommended this. i could not even get through the whole cd ..it is awful"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST $10 YOU wILL EVER SPEND!!!","review":"This CD is DMBs greatest. The version of \\"Halloween\\" is billions of times better than the one on BTCS. It shows that DM is not a pansy soft-rocker like some think. \\"Dancing Nancies\\" is a very good song, with powerful lyrics and addictive meoldies. Ada note to everyone: The version of \\"All Along The Watchtower is NOT ONLY better than the version on \\"Live @ Red Rocks\\" AND Jimmi Hendrix's cover, it is better than THE ORIGINAL by Bob Dylan.

Although this is one of their earlier CDs, it is no means worse than the more recent ones. This is another awesome recording from the most musically talented band out there today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just an Example of How Powerful DMB is Live!","review":"For those who are unfortunate enough to have never seen DMB live, this CD is a must. Provides a true feeling of how versatile this exciting band is in concert. With the mellow sounds of Dancing Nancies and Warehouse, to the upbeat sounds in Recently, to the hard sounds in Watchtower and Halloween, this CD shows the creativity that the band members possess. Whether it be Carter's drums in Halloween, Leroi's sax in Watchtower, Boyd's violin in Dancing Nancies, Stefan's bass in every song, or just the pure and electrifying talent of Dave, this EP release gives is perfect example of how tight this band can play. WARNING: If you try and sing along with Dave on Halloween, you may do permanent damage to your vocal cords! YEAH DAVE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it was so incredible","review":"I thought that \\"Recently\\" is one of the best cds DMB has ever done.\\"All Along the Watchtower\\" is so great.It is just done so well and since that cd was DMB's first cd overall, I think it was just really, really done so professionally.Go out and buy it.It's really worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DMB Live Rules","review":"For those of you have not seen DMB live, it is necessary for appreciating their music fully. This CD offers the listener an opportunity to hear a live recording of the band, and, coupled with Red Rocks, i believe is one of the most important recordings you can own as a true fan of the Dave Matthews Band."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am yet to hear better versions of these five songs.","review":"When I heard each track I got the chills..

I love the versions of all 5 songs on this release. It is obvious that even back in the early 90's these guys were phenomenal. Live performances are the only way to capture the essence of this talented group of musicians. I highly reccomend \\"Recently\\" to anyone who enjoys the band's live material over studio material.Peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!","review":"....I have never been so mesmerized by a single track as I have been with The Dave Mathew Band's Version of the classic \\"ALONG THE WATCHTOWER!\\" The engergy, force and imagination that went into this live recording has left me at a total lose for words. As a proud Virginian I am glad that I claim The Dave Mathew's Band my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave takes \\"Watchtower\\" to another level","review":"Though almost every track on this CD is good (the exception being \\"Halloween\\", which remained weak even on \\"Before These Crowded Streets\\"), it's really Dave's cover of Dylan's \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" that is the most impressive aspect of this live acoustic recording. It's amazing how so many others have improved on Dylan's song, this being not just the most RECENT (!), but also the best I've heard so far. I also agree with other reviewers who mention that other DMB versions are better than those appearing here (e.g. \\"Dancing Nancies\\", \\"Warehouse\\"), but these versions are still great, especially if you prefer a more stripped-down sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not completely worth the price","review":"This is a GOOD cd but for 5 songs 10 bucks is too much,maybe 5 bucks, nut anyway most of the songs are good except recently (you can find a better version on remember 2 things) and warehouse its just dumb but watchtower is amazing and halloween is the best get this if your a fan or want a little taste of matthews"},{"rating":"1","title":"lp damaged","review":"lp arrived damaged and wry and the pick up needle is going up and down...its a long time that item arrived but i was so furious i couldnt even argue"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incomplete brilliance","review":"Another bona fide early masterwork from these educated indie superheroes plays out more like a glorified EP with a hefty amount of appetizing filler, but the emphasis is most definitely on the glorified."},{"rating":"2","title":"magical territories","review":"hmmmm beauty, magic, scenic, hopefull, challenging, and musical.

Tortoise has crafted a true gem. We can only hope that music will follow the cues Tortoise has provided. The brilliance of Djed is life changing. A visual musical journey that causes the imagination to tingle.This album has totally changed how I think about music and has broadened my horizons. Millions Now Living is a perfect soundtrack for modern times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"Just listened to this CD on a road trip and gotta say it's pretty dull, nothing really grabbed me about it and the idea that \\"Djed\\" is a life-changing track is laughable. Tedious, yes, life-changing, no. This isn't to say Tortoise is a bad band - their debut CD is actually pretty decent, as is TNT. But it's best to skip this one. Have never understood why it's so highly praised as one of their best ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitious, monotonous, studio noodeling.","review":"It's too bad Amazon only accepts unopened CD returns. This is the type of \\"music\\" that may be fun to play (after huffing gasoline), but who wants to listen to it? It's unimaginative, over worked, pretentious, and well... just plain stupid. Tortoise, did you listen to this after you left the studio? Were you embarrassed?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for all ears, but a delight for those who like this sort of thing.","review":"Personally, I found this to be a well-recorded and enjoyable foray into an oddball genre.

This book was well written with tons of plot twists and turns. This does not surprise me because Mallette has proven herself over and over. This story written about the Honeywell at times made me feel like I was there being prostituted by Queen Esther. What a wonderful ending indeed. The only thing that bothered me was how evil Queen Esther was how could someone who is a mother be so ruthless and uncaring to her own child. Not that it is unbelievable because I have read in newspapers where some mothers sell their children for crack. This was a fast paced mystery that I was dying to get my hands on it was also well worth the wait. Gloria keep penning them novels for your #1 FAN. I love your work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This book was interesting because of the subject matter that it dealt with, which I thought to be quite interesting to read about. The relationship between the two main characters was interesting as well. The art of manipulation was well defined in this book. I think this book illustrated the characters very well and that is essential in any book that I read. I thought this book was fantastic with a superb ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not All That Impressive","review":"I was really turned off by the author's book, \\"Shades of Jade,\\" because it was written so poorly -- so elementary. I decided that I didn't want to read any other books by her. The media turned the notch up on this book and so did the reviewers. I don't agree with any of them. As a biased reader, I have nothing to lose by telling the truth. This book wasn't all that. It was a story that is as old as the profession itself. It really wasn't told that much differently than the Billie Holiday story. Don't believe all the hype on this one! A 2.5 stars if that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb.","review":"What would happen if your mother forced you to prostitute yourself to the landlord to pay the rent? What happens when your mother starts running the hottest brothel in the city? What happens when you mother turns around and sleeps with your fiancee who doesn't know you prostitute? What happens when you find out that your mother biggest customer your fiancee's father? Well, I summed up the whole book for you. If you just feel, after reading my review that you want to read it anyway, get it from the public library. Maybe I am just not a Mallette fan, but when you are in several book clubs and have to read others selections, this is the type of garbage that you read. Skip it if you have a choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed & Disgusted","review":"As an avid reader of a variety of books, both fiction & nonfiction, Christian and not, I was very disappointed with The Honey Well. While I thought that the story line had a great deal of potential, the seedy, graphic and vulgar language with unnecessary cursing, was distasteful. The only reference to Christianity the book makes is the fact that a pastor frequented the Honey Well and attempted to condemn the ladies upon learning that his son was engaged to the owner's daughter. Rather than show the characters being ministered to, encouraged or supported in the midst of their dilemmas, the book declined to new levels of deceit. While I encourage anyone in their gift, this was one piece of Christian fiction that I was not impressed with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me so mad!","review":"Oh this was a very good book, it was so hard to put down. The characters are believable the mother is who made me so mad while reading. I couldn't believe the things she was putting her daughter through.

Who would? When first asked to do the unthinkable, at age sixteen, Arnell should of ran away from home. She would have been better off. The ending did not far well with me though. I wanted to know more about why Esther turned out the way she was. I know good and well it wasn't only because of a predator uncle. There had to be a lot more to it. But I doubt if we'll ever see a sequal for this. That's not Gloria Mallete's style."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"This is a good book.

Definately happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Alaskan Mystery","review":"I loved this book, both because it has some wonderful characters and because of its setting in Alaska (well, also because it's a lot of fun). The main character is just great. She's quirky, funny, smart, and reminds you of some of your own relatives or friends. She's a real person, not some super-cop or master armchair sleuth, and you really get to care about what happens to her. There are some other great characters too, like the mysterious P.I. and the State Trooper. I also loved the way the author set the novel in Valdez, Alaska. If you've ever been there it brings back the feel of the place to you, and if you haven't been there yet it makes you want to go. This is also a great book if you like to go boating/fishing, since a lot of the action takes place on or around small boats."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best of THE REAL MCCOY","review":"this album is most definately worth buying, it cost me approx 30 to have imported and is worth every penny, it contains all the hits and a few album tracks from both albums, another night, love and devotion, run away to one more time, it really great having all their hits on one fantastic album, sadly there is a downside to this album as there are no new tracks - this for me was truely gutting but never the less get it bought anyway, a travesty that this only was released in japan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just none's opinion","review":"This video is NOT an instructional video, if you have any fly fishing experience.

Who needs to actually time travel when you can musically travel back in time with just one album? When I look at the calendar while listening to this album, all I can see is 1966. Oh yes, let's avoid the 21st Century as long as we can. Maybe if we listen to this album repeatedly, the future will pass us by and we can drive around in our Microbus to our heart's content.DMB sound like the inept inbred child of Kathie Lee Gifford and Regis Philben let loose in an orchestra pit at a Jimmy Buffet concert. Put shortly, it sounds like a bad reading of 60s jam band culture futilely snazzed up for a 90s audience. If you have to listen to music like this, at least listen to a band who do it right, i.e. Allman Brothers, the Dead, Phish, or Moe."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ULTIMATE LIVE CD","review":"This was my first Dave Mattews CD, and after hearing it I was convinced to buy every other. Dave Matthews Band can be compared to the likes of Phish and Grateful Dead in typical jam band fashion, such as songs like #36, and the intro's to many songs. All at the same time the cd also carries the ballads that the band is so good at, like Satelite and my personal favorite, Lover Lay Down."},{"rating":"2","title":"nothin but love for this cd","review":"Dave Matthews and all the rest whip it up on this cd to the max.

I have every released DMB cd along with some live concerts. The Quality of this recording is great witch is a big deal for live concerts.

The songs are a little long but that is what a Jam Band is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant Overall Performance","review":"Live at Red Rocks is probably the DMBs strongest release. All I can say is that I would give anything to have been there to experience this show first hand. It has all of their best earlier songs, and each one is a strong performance. This CD leaves no weak links; there is no song one is inclined to skip. The musicality and energy of it, combined with feature performances by each band members make Live at Red Rocks the most important CD to your \\"Dave\\" collection; if you are only going to get one, this one is the one you can play over and over again. I especially like this CDs version of Seek Up, Tripping Billies, and Drive in Drive out (the drums are incredible)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I <3 DMB","review":"I think the Dave Matthews Band is the best and I love this live CD.

They sound good in the studio, but better live. I've been to three concerts and will continue to attend their concerts whenever I can.

It includes some of their older songs for you TRUE DMB lovers! But the CD's play a lot of music from Crash. Dave plays a solo version of Typical Situation, which is OUTSTANDING! After hearing a group of rowdy college guys shout out \\"Watchtower,\\" the well known Bob Dylan song starts to play with a DMB twist. My personal favorites on the CD are Two Step, Recently, Warehouse, #36, Typical Situation, and All Along the Watchtower."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"i have bought the live at red rocks cd and i think it is the best one i have......if u play track number 5 on the 2nd cd(#36)you will hear why carter beauford is one of the best drummers.these cd is worth buying it is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best DMB Live CD","review":"The best DMB live CD. \\"Seek Up\\", \\"Typical Situation\\", \\"Two Step\\", \\"Ants\\" and many more are great.

DMB has that rare ability to jam with some coherance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it!","review":"You. Must. Buy. This. CD. It's just like being at a live Dave concert, except in the privacy of your own living room. Not to mention it is one of his best concert sets ever. You'll hear songs that you won't find on any album (Seek up, #36)....And believe me, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like a real show","review":"I love the songs that never end. I got hooked during the 1st song and never turned back. 36 is the greatest jam ever. Seek up just makes you feel great. And the BOWA is an awesome version of an awesome song. There is a good comment for every other song too, but I can't put them in less than the alotted 1000 words."},{"rating":"2","title":"A collection of Dave's best before \\"Crowded Streets\\"","review":"This cd is very, very good. The reason I love it so much is that they take some songs from earlier albums, like Rhyme & Reason, Ants Marching, Drive in Drive out (my favorite song). They take these songs, make them longer, and improve them overall in a more laidback setting. Don't feel like you shouldn't get this cd just because you have the studio albums. Much different and even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent piece of equipment.","review":"I record (and sometimes perform) ambient/electronic music. Electric guitar, no synthesizers. I was searching for a reverb unit, but most effects boxes for reverb are limited and expensive. For the price, this thing is amazing. Many different reverb and delay settings as well as built in modulation effects. Easy to use, easy to program and durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT order from UniqueSquared...","review":"Ordered this processor and tried it out. Many of the effects were great, but I needed more adjustability for tremolo and so decided to go a different route and return the unit.Most items purchased on Amazon.com can be returned for a full refund, including shipping. UniqueSquared will charge you shipping and a substantial restocking fee-- read the fine-print before you order with them.Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"+Thirty Years Of Waiting","review":"I picked this album off the shelf in a record store in Memphis in 1971 because of it's cover. I took it home and fell in love. I played it for all my friends, and they loved it, too.The acoustic guitar, and Rupert Hine's vocals grabed me, and wouldn't let go. This album should be known world wide as a classic, but because it had no \\"hit\\" in the top 40 on radio stations not many people know about it. I tried for years to figure out how to get it released on C.D. I finally gave up. In 2000 I discoved it was available as an import. I had it within a few days. It was like finding an old friend. I made a back up copy in hopes of never being without it again. Someone stole all my C.D.'s including Pick Up A Bone. Now it's out of print, and I'm on the hunt again. Rupert, I sure wish you would return to this formula, and make some more music I can't live without. But thanks for the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many problems to overlook","review":"Sometimes with new technology, you overlook some little problems. This unit has too many to deal with. No chase record, the YES function is something you pay for. Can't use many characters to title something. Very slow to start up and load. Not consistant in playing disks. On occasion the unit will completely freeze up and stop working. You have to unplug it to get it going again. And....where the heck is the \\"MENU\\" button?? I just hated the Sony unit I have, and I loved a Pioneer unit I also have. But, I wanted the hard drive and the Philips was in stock. Oh Lord, what was I thinking? Stay away from this unit. Clunky and disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unit will often freeze up and require reboot.","review":"This appears to be a common problem with this unit. It is very annoying! DVD will continue to play, but no buttons will work (including power button), so I have to unplug and reboot. Remote is absolutely horrible! I would highly suggest you stay away from this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check with your cable provider first!","review":"There is a pretty glaring error with this product that makes it nearly useless for a lot of people: it doesn't work with some cable providers. I have cable from Charter Communications. My TV has to stay on channel 4, while I control the cable channels through the cable box. But the Philips DVD Recorder doesn't know about the cable channels; it only knows about channel 4 on the TV. That means you can't use the VCR codes to schedule recordings. You also can't record something if you're not already watching it. The whole purpose of the DVD Recorder is negated.The one positive I can offer is that Electronics Expo didn't give me any hassle in returning it, so I only ended up having to pay for the shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much less than desired","review":"You can't copy DVDs to the harddrive. There is no \\"Menu\\" button on the remote to go directly to DVD menus when playing. There is no TV guide listings as another poster has wrongfully posted. You can supply VCR+ input codes to record TV programs, but they are always off by 1 hour, and I don't receive any publications which have VCR+ codes so I have to get online to retrieve them. All menus for this hardware and channel changing is sluggish with annoying delays. I am returning this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible hardware, worse customer service","review":"I have owned this product (regrettably) for almost a year. I've finally given up getting Philips to assist with a Warranty repair...To begin with, no foresight was given to the overall user experience. For example, when you initially turn on the device, wait about 10 seconds for it to fire up, then push the DVD button on the remote, the unit simply ignores your request and goes straight to the tuner. Menus are slow, response time is worse. Not only that, but the build quality is sub-par. The DVD tray on my unit constantly locks up and won't open. That's what I contacted Philips about. After waiting on hold for 15 minutes, I was told to fax them my receipt and someone would contact me. Still waiting to hear from them...Don't buy this product. Philips just doesn't care about its customer base and simply shoots for market share at any price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for me","review":"I have owned mine for about a year and a half. I have had no major problems with the unit itself (I did perform the update offered at Philips' site a while ago).My biggest complaint is the remote. Without the remote you cannot play DVDs. (I moved across country and the remote was packed separately from the unit. I could not play movies until I found the remote.My other complaint about the remote it there is no MENU button on it. You cannot jump back to the menu when you like during the playback of a DVD. I have to skip through the video to the end and let it go back or turn it off and then back on.One last issue I have once in awhile is if I leave the unit on for days on end, it will freeze during layback forcing me to shut the unit off by unplugging it (won't respond to anything else) and then replugging it in and re-powering. Once finished, it works well again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philips DVDR3455H - Junk","review":"I bought this DVR a couple years ago.It has been problematic the whole time.It takes forever for the unit to come on. You turn it on and then watch the pretty \\"Philips\\" screen for 15 - 30 seconds before it finally comes up and is usable.The unit I have frequently quits responding to the remote and will not turn off. I finally plugged it into a switched outlet so I could turn it off (count to 5) and then back on.The DVD player/recorder tray wouldn't always open so I could get the DVD out and finally it just quite working all together. It wouldn't play or record a DVD.Today the power went out and the stupid thing just reboots over and over. I think maybe the hard drive has completely failed.Other than all of that - it had a good picture and was relatively easy to learn how to use.I'm not going to replace this unit with another Philips DVR. I'm going to look for something more reliable that works reliably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with Philips DVR","review":"The DVR is exactly what I wanted. The product is easy to use and it does have the capability to time record. The instruction booklet was very helpful. If you follow the directions in the booklet, you will have no problems. I will never go back to a VCR!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A not easily accessible, but profound music","review":"I had te get accustomed to this higly concentrated, not easily accessible music. Needed a break after three numbers. I got not clear who was responsible for that reaction: The compositions of Kurt Weill, the way these three musicians made a performance out of the Weill scores (all three famous for their almost philosophical, well-considered music-making), I myself or a combination of these factors. Anyway: advise can be not to listen to all of the music consecutively.Kikuchi plays here even more contemplative than on other recordings, like Hollow-Out (with Elvin Jones) or You And The Night And The Music with Helen Merrill.The overall impression, however, is one of great quality and thoroughness.If you like the music of Weill and are positively familiar with the three performers: don't hesitate and try a confrontation. It might certainly be rewarding."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Very First Devotional Bible","review":"Excellent, Excellent Book!!! I've bought a copy for my son, nephew and God-daughter.

And I proved myself right. I love her mama's music (Karen) and like another reviewer said, if you have heard Kierra on her mother's album's, you know that her voice has grown from a little girl to a young woman. Her runs are ridiculous (unbelievable-this is a good thing) and her musicianship is notable. She takes gospel music, no. Music (period) to a whole new level with her youthful flavor, the creativity in her singing style, and her ability to take musical risks that seem to be paying off already!!! I'm so excited (not only about this single) but the impending release of her first album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"John Ford said...","review":"...this was his worst film. I have to agree with him. Widmark gives his usual bland performance and James Stewart is obviously uncomfortable in the role of a shady lawman. Ironically, there is some truth behind the plot.

Going from Messiah to pariah he takes it on the chin and even the surprise ending doesn't even seem to phase him. He's always got an ace in the hole somewhere and you love him every minute for it. Entertaining story of settlers who return to a US army fort in hopes of regaining their stolen loved ones. Oh, but what a dose of reality it gives them and us too. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Trek hater and one parrot","review":"These people do not love Star Trek. They just like the first two seasons of the original series. Especially Altman is the kind of critic Woody Allen had in mind in his descend to Hell. He diminishes some of the best Trek episodes, particularly in New Generation and Voyager, trying at the same time to make himself \\"look\\" good by using words like \\"adroitness\\", or inventing ones like \\"technobabble\\". What a load of CRAP! Gross reads Altman's review FIRST and then he adds a star in his rating. Altman really has a personality problem. If you love star trek, it's better to rate it yourself.

I've never really liked Dave Matthews. I like about two songs. That's it. Sampling this didn't help draw me in any more, that's for sure. It's not any worse than his other stuff though.However, I just needed to say this: What in the bloody heck were they THINKING with that album cover? I mean, honestly, album covers are supposed to help entice people to buy the album. If I were on the fence about the album, seeing that cover would put me in the \\"don't buy\\" state of mind. Obviously diehards are going to buy the album no matter what, but I guess DMB doesn't give a crap about bringing anyone else in if they're going to put out something with that poor of an album cover.

Some of their best songs are featured here. How would I describe the band, and keep it short and sweet? I would call them a fusion of rock, ska, pop, world beat and jazz all rolled into one. Two of my favorite cuts here are \\"Ants Marching,\\" a great, up-tempo number, and \\"Sattelite,\\" which is introspective and melodious. Not only is this a great band, technically, but David Matthews' songs are pure poetry. These aren't typical of the songs you usually hear on the radio. Matthews has a lot to say, and it isn't only about love lost and found. Great album....."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Back This CD Up","review":"With several songs not found on any other albums and not heard at to many shows this album has made me realize how great the Matthews Band is.Every song on this track has so much thought which makes it the best of all times.If there ever was an album that you thought you could relate to, check out this disk and if you want to tell me if you dont think song 9 I'LL BACK YOU UP is one of the most beautiful songs ever to be heard.

I've been contemplating buying it for awhile, but was hesitant because I thought it was the same old songs on a different CD. I was so wrong! It's got hand-to-find tracks like 'One Sweet World,' and a big fave of mine, 'Christmas Song.' Some of the songs, however, sound a bit different, like the nearly two-minute intro to 'Ants Marching,' but none of the differences detract from the quality of the CD itself. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No one Jams like DMB Jams","review":"This is a great CD - full of early DMB stuff. For me, the real jewel is track 9, Seek Up.

I was also looking forward to the flashcard application for my Palm. But the CD menu listed a different filename for the database file than what was on the CD, and when I installed the flashcard application, it crashed my Palm. My emails to Sybex have gone unanswered, and there is no errata on their website. The copy of Oracle that I have (8i, which is supposedly the same as the book references) does not match some of the sample screens and exercises.

I was able to wash away the pooled glue but it took a lot of time. I then left the unit to dry for a few weeks. When I started using it, however, the weight of the laptop caused yet more glue to ooze out of the stand's innards, which led to new rounds of washing and drying.

I was very disappointed, and I am planning on sending the book back to Amazon. This is a first for me because I generally love children's books. The illustrations in this book were beautiful, but the story was just not told in a very interesting way. It was very long and yet did not explain a lot of things and left loose ends. It was also very gory -- Saint George hacks off various parts of the dragon and the pictures show the dragon fighting with a hacked off leg.

Initially, my 5 year old son was nervous with the graphic pictures of a chopped off tale and blood dripping from it. Then, when we read the story, he studied the illustrations, he was terrified! This from a child that loves dinosaurs. I am glad we did not purchase it and had only checked it out at the library first. The general story is good, and what talent the artist has it is just too graphic for little people."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I was eager to read this book to my sons based on the great reviews it got from others. I was very disappointed when I got it, though. It is not well written so it didn't hold their attention. It is gory so it's not for little ones. Worst of all, it has inappropriate pictures (which I did not let my boys see) of unclothed fairies-these do not belong in a children's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This George NOT as brave as the Saint","review":"Undeniabley beautiful and I fully understand it is an adaptation of a story by Edward Spencer, but honestly people, the title of this book should not carry the name of \\"Saint George\\". There is a reason he is called a \\"Saint\\". History has held many courageous men that slayed beasts and saved princesses, but they weren't called \\"Saints\\". Saint George was viewed by the early Church as a saint for a reason. Search for it, and you will find the full story. This book merely embellishes one small part of the story. There is no need to reference any \\"Fairy Queen\\" in a story about Saint George, because there are enough fantastic events in the life of this saint that it doesn't require any pretend figures. Maybe someday an author of children's books will hold the courage of Saint George to tell the true story."},{"rating":"1","title":"INAPPROPRIATE for children...DO NOT buy this book!","review":"Beware!

The knight, the princess, and other characters conform to accepted and commonly perceived appearances of persons in European fairytales.The theme of perseverance is easily recognizable with its simple text.Children should read this book because it provides the legend that is the basis for many other literary works. Students should be able to draw comparisons between this story and other adaptations, be they printed or in other forms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely book for the grammar stage","review":"Here's what I LOVE about this book: the illustrations! Wow! Artist Trina Schart Hyman does a fantastic job. I want to touch the dents in George's shield and Lady Una's gowns are to die for. The writing is well-paced and puts the story into terms a child will understand well. However, there is a too much passive voice and use of \\"had\\" for my taste. But I know from personal experience that it is difficult to retell an old story without a bit of both.My grammar-stage son...well, his comment was, \\"Awww...I wanted the dragon to win!\\" He's a big softie when it comes to critters. I think most kids will relate to the citizen's fearful reluctance to approach the dragon, even when dead: \\"'Those claws might scratch my son, or tear his tender hand.'\\"Great way to introduce an old story to a young audience. Fantastic illustrations. Four stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very old favorite...","review":"When I was 7, my family moved to Georgia (I'm an Air Force brat); our library in Georgia had a copy of Saint George and the Dragon. Until we moved when I was 10, I checked this book out repeatedly, read it repeatedly, traced the illustrations repeatedly, and fell asleep with it, only to check it out again on our next trip to the library. I am now 14, and about to get this book for my 5 (almost 6) year old brother. Raised on Narnia, Middle Earth, and Fairy Land, I am a firm believer in dragons, unicorns, faery, gnomes, and an even firmer believer in their place in childrens books. This is a beautiful, beautiful book, the kind of book every child deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introduction to literature for young readers","review":"My four year old son picked this out and he and I both love it. The prose is a pleasure to read aloud. The writing is very detailed, and this is echoed in the wonderful illustrations.

As a mom who has spent many hours reading aloud, I can't speak highly enough of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Step Short of Wretched","review":"This is a very poor translation. It emulates King James/Shakespearian English, which is bad enough, but quite simply, some of the translations are flat-out absurd. A good example is Mary 19:7, which says that before John the Baptist, no one had the name John. That is just plain silly, and I had to check several other translations to find the real meaning (\\"there was no one like John before him.\\")I am not Islamic, but am curious and open-minded, so I read this. It was difficult to follow and, as demonstrated above, frequently (and extremely) misleading. The best translations I have found have been on-line. I do not recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Translation of the Koran into English","review":"The Pickthall translation was about the only translation of the Koran you could find in English for a long time. I think more are available now. There is a helpful introduction which goes into some of the history of Mohamed and Islam. The book was translated with reverence and reads well. You get the flavor of the religion from it. Reading it did not convert me to Islam, but it helped me to understand people who choose this path and to understand what Mohamed did for that part of the world. I think it is good to get some understanding for all the key religions that humans live at this time and this book is helpful in this regard."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting, a good translation","review":"As i know its one of the best translation for the Koran in English, knowing Islam by the Koran not by the people."},{"rating":"2","title":"The good die young.","review":"First the singer out of Mike and The Mechanics then Scatman (or it might have been the other way round).

Nebuchadnezzar was an extraordinary man, 100% evil and look at what God did to Him...similar with what He did with me.I just re-read this timeless book for about the third time...I also have used it in sermons, Sunday School and Bible study for teaching.The real strength of the book describes each of the disciples, their nature and how Jesus taught them Submission, Restraint, Humility, Love, Compassion & Courage.MacArthur's abilities are clearly brought to light in this book and this book will, I am sure, become a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great refresher course on the lives of the apostles","review":"I consider myself to be pretty well versed in the Bible and yet found this compilation of information fascinating and informative.

They werer business men, tax collectors, fisherman who were at the top of the food chain as they owned boats, made a lucrataive living. My study group all but starting spending five minutes on a chapter. Waht a waste of my time. Shame on you for writing such a poor book. Now if you want to just pick facts to support a position and not look for the truth, then go for it.

It has proved enlightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could only stomach the first half","review":"The first half of the book was somewhat interesting because there is more information available on the primary 4 disciples. But after that, with MacArthur's typical development of a theology from one or two words, the supposition was just outright fabrication to fit his opinion. I should have expected this from him, as it is totally in line with his edited bible which I own and use but critically discount as lacking logic. The speculation that was written as fact was laughable at time to downright absurd at other times. Really, if there is not enough information to go on, just admit it and move on. Maybe change the title to Four Ordinary Men and leave it at that, or stay broad about what they did overall instead of trying to write about each one individually.

Buy this book and either Alex's or \\"Your First Quilt Book (Or So It Should Be).\\" The two compliment each other well. Prior to starting this journey, I could barely reattach a shirt button (heck, I still don't know how to use a sewing machine ~ that's next). Thanks to the above mentioned books, I completed a beautiful lap quilt for my mother in 6 weeks, BY HAND!!! (Mind you, if you don't have children and have your evenings free, you'll be able to finish even sooner. :oD) My mom couldn't believe it and kept turning the quilt over and over, looking for a label. :o)Anyway, the book is straight forward and even a bit funny, which helps.

You'll go CRAZY!! :oD"},{"rating":"1","title":"For Hand Quilters not Machine Quilters","review":"If you machine piece and machine quilt I do not recommend this book. The author is so biased toward hand quilting and feels machine quilting is so much more difficult that she gives very little instruction, information or advice in this area. If you plan to only do hand sewing and hand piecing it is informative. There is very little information on strip piecing or rotary cutting, rather it mostly contains information on making templates. I found it unhelpful as I primarily do machine sewing and machine quilting of my quilts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the most complete reference....","review":"As a skilled beginner (5 completed quilts), I wanted a good book on the fundamentals of quilting so that I could refer to it when I got stuck on a current project or pattern. Although this book has good information on fabric selection, I did not find it to be a good, complete beginners book. One of the most popular methods of quiltmaking is rotary cutting your pieces...not using many small, time-consuming templates. This book only gives instructions for using templates. Also, this book emphasizes hand-piecing (with some info on machine piecing) and hand-quilting (with very limited info on machine quilting). Although I admire those who sew quilts entirely by hand, these are not simple, easy, fast methods for a beginner. I will be looking for another reference book to use- one with lots of different methods explained, lots of color photos (few in this book), and lots of examples of finished patterns and quilts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Help","review":"Being a first-time quilter with a lot ambition, I bought this book to help me along. Great book for novices. I recommend you buy this one and \\"Hand Quilting With Alex Anderson: Six Projects for Hand Quilters\\". The Idiots Guide tells you everything you need to know before, during, and after. Hand Quilting tells you exactly what you need and how to cut the fabric for individual projects. The step-by-step individual instructions helped me make sense of what The idiot's Guide was saying. They complement each other perfectly and make that first scary quilt much easier to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Kindle subscribers","review":"This book is formatted in two sections, one for instructions with pictures referred to by color (Kindle is only in black and white making these references useless) and a second section for reference.

Two or three of the bulbs burned out withing two days and Santa will climb up and down but not without being nudged every single time. Santa gets to the top and stalls, then when nudged he climbs back down and stalls. I got tired of having to nudge it over and over and finally packed it away. It's too late to return it or I would.

Closest thing taste-wise to a saltine I've found since going GF (and I've tried others, with great disappointment).

They do not look like each other at all. The photograph looks black and the glove itself is a much lighter brown. The buckles on the product itself look like they need to be closed or secured, except they are non-functional so they just flop around uselessly. After I opened the box I compared it to the photo on the website. The buckles are completely different.Considering the price, I was not looking for real leather or amazing crafstsmanship, but I do expect it to look something like the photo.

The two approach electronic composition from a unique perspective (and that's saying a lot...considering how many electronic artists out there do not!). Even the rhythms used in the music are obtuse and peculiar (the duo refers to this as \\"click & cut rhythms\\"). Monkey With a Gun is a heady and unexpected experience...as Davis and Jones combine spooky ambient sounds with samples and obtuse technology. The overall effect is quite dream-like and foreign. There are few familiar sounds and ideas to latch onto...and therein lies the beauty of these modern compositions. This lengthy disc (clocking in at 68:59) is mentally challenging...and highly entertaining. We can't describe tunes like \\"Charisma,\\" \\"Copper Glow,\\" and \\"Afraid to Change\\"...but we know when something pushes our buttons the right way. Excellent stuff.

The characters conflict with-not one another-but themselves! Dimitri, the male protagonist, swings between being macho and self sure, to a crying, sensitive, wonderful guy. The author needs to pick a personality type, and stick with it, and the same it true for almost every other character.I also thought this book very reduntant and repetitive, and I found myself skimming many times. There were long, drawn out descriptions of characters, and the overall writing style was very amatuer.And, upon closer inspection, the reader of this review will find the above two written by none other than the author herself.In future books, we, being my book group, hope Ms. Malemes will put a little more effort into her books, and perhaps read a few guides to professional writing.

They join closer to the left bud and that puts more weight on the left bud.

Also I have not had any problems with the motor getting to hot because of the fire. I always plan my campouts with this in mind and what I'm going to cook using it. Wouldn't do a campout with out it.

I do like the singer's voice but it can get repetitive after you hear it in every song but I still really liked this album, especially the last track which is my favorite Aluminum track. Some of the tracks are really upbeat, which is refreshing and prevents this album from feeling too much the same. I would say this album is a must buy for Aluminum fans, but a first time buyer might be overwelmed with this album so I recomment you purchase their older CD titled 'Pelo' as your first steps into The Aluminum Group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Pop","review":"These guys are in their own world of Bacharach, smoove electronica, futuro jazz, Design references, and cufflink lyrics.

And she even had the nerve to drop it like it's hot in front of the students! Lastly, this book was 60% Summer and David; 40% David's family.

Tortoise at times sound like big kids playing around in a studio not taking themselves too seriously and other times they are downright mindblowing as if the studio is being used as an instrument as well. They are definitely one of my favorite bands and this compilation is probably geared more towards the fans of their body of work. I still think there is something for everyone on this compilation, some of the tracks take a minute to take off, like the rare mix of Ry Cooder, that really does make me laugh when I hear it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stiff uppers and sharp vent edges rubbed skin off little toes.","review":"While the sole is comfortable on hard surfaces, after wearing around town on a few errands, mostly by car, the skin on the tops of my little toes was rubbed off.

I was limping by the time i got home, and now I can't wear regualr shoes without bandaids until they heal. The uppers are too stiff, and the edges around the vents are sharp. Also, the insides of the little button things that hold the straps hurt the sides of my feet where they rub them. If I hadn't discarded the shoe box I would have returned them. Now they just take up space in my closet. Perhaps with socks they'd be OK, but that would defeat the purpose of sandals/clogs. I'm sorry I wasted my money.

In less than two weeks of purchasing, I was just showing up to class for attendance purposes. I learned much more from this book than lecture. The lowest grade I made on one of my tests was an 80! The steps to solving problems are clearly written. The exercises start easy to moderate difficulty before challenging to use what you've just learned. I would rate this book five stars but on some topics it can be a little sketchy and leave you scratching your head about what to do next.

In this comic, Catwoman is designed as she was in the 80's: Curled Ears, Whiskers, What appears to be Synthetic Fiber and....a tail. Now, I bought another graphic novel in 1992 that had Ctawoman depicted in this style, but one was enough. The artwork is very dark and unfocused, and a little haphazard.The story is pretty good, but not nearly as good as most other Catwoman stories.Also, it is extremely short, and the only really good part of the book is the front cover. Aside from that, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"After reading the reviews I decided to order this book. I was pleasantly surprised. It is a good follow up to The Long Halloween. I enjoyed the artwork and found the story to be, at times, funny. it does fill in some gaps in Catwoman's background. I wish I could find more books of this caliber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank Goodness!","review":"Thank goodness for a novel about the south, that doesn't cast us all as complete imbeciles and idiots! The story is enthralling. I couldn't put it down. When you think you've figured it out, you're suddenly at another crossroad. A central plot with so many wonderful turns and bends that never misses a beat with the intent and heart of the storyline. For a new writer,S.Alexander has done a great job. Her storytelling abilities are masterful. I look forward to more books from her in the near future, hopefully a sequel to Seth's Pasture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Felt like I was part of the book","review":"When I first started to read Seth's Pasture, I feel in love with Precious Huddelston. She's such a strong but passionate character from the begining until the end. Loved the southern dialect, and the wisdom from the character \\"Callie\\".

I recommend this book to any and all readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black & white reprints of classic four-color comics...?","review":"I honestly don't get the appeal of these books. Why bother making (or reading) black & white reprints of classic four-color comics...? I mean, yeah, the stories are still great and the original comics are hard to find, but a huge part of what made these comics great was the eye-popping artwork, including the bright primary colors: reading them in dull B&W; is just plain wrong. Sure, the printing costs are lower, so you can get more pages for your money, but it's more pages of boring, not more pages of fun. It's really a travesty.On the other hand, it recently occurred to me that these could be used as coloring books... Maybe you could buy a box of crayons to go along with all the artwork that the publishers ruined in this format.PS - Unlike several of the other reviewers, I actually always liked this run of the \\"Avengers\\"... especially Hawkeye being such a big butthead.

It includes the criminally hard-to-find 1983 Hollies version of \\"Stop In The Name Of Love\\". While some may argue this tune is marginal to the classic 60's and 70's output of the Hollies, no collection can be truly complete without it. Domestic compilations cover only the Imperial and/or Epic label Hollies tunes while \\"Stop...\\" was out on Atlantic in the U.S. Here, EMI of Germany has pulled it all together. With one exception the rest of the tunes represent the German-charting Hollies tracks.Sound quality is better than many other Hollies compilation CD's and these are all stereo versions. Liner notes are sparse - less than a single page - and in German only.This intriguing collection, although very pricey, is unique among Hollies compilations."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Skin of Our Teeth","review":"I am highly pleased with this product, it arrived in time and in wonderful condition!

It is like they are Adam and Eve and Noah and the President of the United States. Nothing makes sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reality check for the long term investor","review":"Malkiel provides convincing arguments for the efficient markets theory accessible to the economically illiterate and gives some useful tips on how to invest for the long term in a world in which securities move in a random walk.Even if you're already familiar with the theory of financial markets this book is still a worthwhile read because of the oftentimes satirical depiction of the very human reality behind the graphs and numbers.For a book about the world of investing it is therefore anything but dull.

It is mostly interesting to read whether you agree with the author or not (I don't in many cases). At the same time, the book is written for really beginners so probably many people will want to skip some chapters as too simple and obvious. The only thing that a little annoyed me is that when author talks about technical analysis and how wrong it is he reffers to various academical studies without really giving any details about these studies. I would like, at the very least, to have a bibliographical list in the end to be able to verify author' assertions. Also, you can see that this book undergone many editions. Some points and ideas are repeated in different chapters. But in the end, this book makes an interesting read, especially for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Egghead's Theory on how Wall Street Works","review":"It's interesting how with each new edition, the efficiant market theory slowly morphs into value and growth investing. When the book first came out, Malkiel wrote that a monkey throwing darts can beat professional stock pickers. Well, for a couple of years the Wall Street Journal ran a series pitting stock pros against a monkey. From what I remember the monkey lost. I also remember that Malkiel ran a mutual fund which wasn't all too hot (he probably used the Wall Street Journal's monkey!). Now Malkiel recommends loading up on index funds, which by the way are loaded with blue chip stocks and are not at all chosen randomly.

This is clearly true. However, it is also a nonsensical statistic. The statistic used to calculate the average performance of a mutual fund includes those of fixed income funds such as bonds. These drag down the averages. Also dragging the performance down are taxes on profits and money manager salaries.Dwell upon this: If you selected just one company in the S&P 500 that had plummeting profits and was in for obvious disaster, and did not invest in it, but invested in all the other stocks of the S&P, you have defeated the index.The idea that an intelligent human is unable to defeat the market is ridiculous and Burton G.

After nine months, I still listen to it all the time. Tops are tracks 2, 4, 7, 9-the end, although all are good and entirely listenable. The best thing about the music is that the songs are all upbeat, smooth, danceable house music that isn't obnoxious or annoying like some \\"Ibiza\\" style stuff, and don't depend on beat alone like some house music, but rather have great melodies which really set them apart. This music is great for a party or any other situation requiring some really good music. As one measure of its quality, I can say that every single friend of mine who has heard this cd has made a point of asking me to record it for them.

I dare to say that Lynyrd Skynyrd is a more talented band, but the guys in Molly Hatchet surly shine from time to time. The memorable tunes on this album are the opening hard and groovy \\"What does it matter?\\" and the southern semi ballad \\"Fall of the peacemakers\\", which is Molly Hatchet's \\"Free bird\\" (Lynyrd Skynyrd) or \\"Highway song\\" (Blackfoot).

When he left the band after their second album, that was the end of the band, as far as I'm concerned. And his coming back in 1985 to produce this CD does not save the day, I'm sorry. These songs are just WEAK. The only good one is the epic \\"Fall of The Peacemakers.\\" All the others range from mediocre to just plain bad.

The image on the cover is NOT in the movie. It's got some blood and gore and it has a nasty sequence involving a baby (fake of course) but the FX are so awful there is virtually no impact from anything they are trying to do. There IS however a LOT of pathetic over-acting and people screeching at each other through most of the running time and even though I normally have nerves of steel when it comes to no-budget horror, the obnoxiousness of the characters, the countless failed attempts at humor and the horrible camerawork was really just too much for me and I did fast forward some parts just to get past the tedium. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of one is because it has crazy ambition and tries to entertain, however the director's idea of entertainment is something most horror fans will probably find more irritating than anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Wahl is a great shaver","review":"I bought this beard trimmer for my son and he loves it.

It fell short in all categories. It offered little as a police procedural, very little character development, lightweight treatment of the story as a whole. There is even the story of 2 police officers dating that had no relevance at all to the story and didn't even have the decency to come to any reasonable conclusion as a side story. Was it accidentally inserted from another story? It bumbled along to the point near the end where I wondered why I wasted my time, when suddenly the victim is brutally raped and then murdered. The senseless violence was such a jarring incongruity to the rest of the story that it made me truly angry. I look at the credits and past books and would have expected that this author was capable of a great deal more. It's no wonder he doesn't publish it under his real name."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALICE IN TIN PAN ALLEY","review":"In THE FRUMIOUS BANDERSNATCH, Ed McBain weaves biting satire and police procedural into pure gold. His prime target is the 21st century record business and some of the evils wrought by monopoly of the airwaves, but along the way he manages to skewer other media foibles. (like the panels of \\"expert\\" talking heads that proliferate on television) The warp of McBain's loom is the good old 87th Precinct. The detectives of the 87th duel an FBI task force to solve a high profile kidnapping. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as ever.","review":"The story, the plot, the surprises, the style, the FUN, the easy readings, the fine structure....were even better than ever.(It's a pity the audio- cd and cassettes - is abridged, but I'm lucky to have the book to compare).But the finest reason why You have to buy the book/audio is:\\"That touch of GENIUS\\": The way Carella admits in the end, how he's being used as.....A splended opening for the next 87th-precinct to come: \\"HARK\\".

There was too much useless dialogue that I think was used just to fill up space on the page. I have enjoyed his previous novels, but not this one.

He plans a spectacular introduction of her first hit song accompanied by a controversial video of her being mock raped by a black dancer, dressed as a mythical beast, on a luxury motor launch on the river. Three masked figures appear and drag Tamar away to a waiting speed boat in front of a stunned audience. A phone call demanding $250,000 in ransom is made to Loomis's office and so the local police from the 87th precinct and the FBI are called in. The pace is cracking and the dialogue is authentic sounding as plots are laid by the baddies and plans are made for Tamar's rescue by the cops. It's a fast read, using characters that Mr.McBain has introduced before and, even though I've never before seen some of the words used by the author, most readers would enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 1/2 Stars -- A Good, Fast Read!","review":"The Frumious Bandersnatch is about an up-and-coming music star who is kidnapped from a rented yacht while performing at a party promoting her first album. In typical McBain fashion, his latest 87th Precinct police procedural combines an enjoyable, fast-paced plot with true-to-life characters and dialogue. Having said this, on a comparative basis, The Frumious Bandersnatch has a somewhat more predictable ending and has less action and surprises than several of McBain's previous books. Further, I found a few of the romatic sub-storylines (i.e., those involving Detctives Hawes and Ollie Weeks Hawes) to be more filler than having anything to do with the real plot of the book. If you're a fan of the 87th Precinct series I think you might feel (as I do) that The Frumious Bandersnatch is a good, fast enjoyable book but one that is a slight notch below some of the others in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gritty tale by a master of the genre","review":"The latest 87th precinct novel finds Steve Carella and company trying to locate the kidnapped pop singer, Tamar Valparaiso. Tamar was kidnapped in the middle of a publicity appearance on a boat. Time appears to be running out.There have been better and there have been worse novels of the 87th precinct. However, any book by Ed McBain is a welcome sight and this one proves no exception. It is unclear whether we are dealing with a more humorous book or one a bit grittier. The ending proves the later is the case. Well worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed with the obscenties...","review":"I used to love to read McBain's early 87th Precinct novels. I hadn't read any in years, so I decided to give this book a try. The language was so disgusting I quit reading this book.

Actually, sections of this trilogy are howlingly funny, especially Molloy, easily the most accessible of the trio. Malone Dies and The UnNamable both start out coherently, then drift onwardly into a sea sick like eulogy which might drive a reader mad.

The sameness of Beckett's themes alters only with the withering of Beckett's talents. Malone, like Sam in Watt as well as the narrator in \\"Stories\\" as well as Moran and Molloy, creates plots only to destroy them. In this respect, the narrator-artists are identical to Beckett himself.

Reppert doesn't rely on evolution but more on the basic characteristics of our universe given naturalism, and how those characteristics should be expected to interfact with the way beliefs relate to each other.A novel argument and one that naturalists would do well to carefully consider.Another highlight is the background historical discussion on CS Lewis himself and Reppert's arguments in favour of one understanding of the relationship between religious belief and reason- namely, Critical Rationalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for test 932 - Same material the Post Office sent me.","review":"What this book offered for test 932 was exactly the same thing the Post Office mailed me for free.

The waist straps are only adjustable at the point where you snap them together in the front. They have no tensioners at the hip, and are extremely long. Unless you're an 800 lb grizzly bear, the waist straps will be utterly useless, making all the weight of your pack ride only on your shoulders and chest. Sadly, I never even got to use this pack, and had to return it. The build quality of the bag is good. Great, reinforced stitching and heavy duty nylon with unlimited points for attachments and carabiners.

When I bought the Arose 11 Piece Fondue Set I expected it have instructions and for it to be intact. If you look at the picture of the set, you will see three stainless steal pillars. The problem is the cup that holds the burner will not fit through the pillars. It isn't easy to remove the screws that connect the pillars to the set. After the cup is inserted, then the set is in pieces and it isn't easy put the pillars back. A hint is you have to bend the set to reattach the pillars.

This book shows us the transformation of a teenage boy into adulthood in small town America, and is enlightening for those of us who did not grow up in a small town. As this book illustrates, however, small towns are not boring towns. Much to the contrary! The characters in this book are real and the friendships strong and genuine.

From a literary perspective, it might be the worst written series of all time, but as I said - you have to keep it simple for the idiot, uneducated people who take this literally. Put it this way, the authors have a web site peddling their mythology.If you read this series for fun, it is not that bad, but by book 7 or 8 it becomes reduntant and boring.

My proof is in the book itself. The chapters are written by Luke, Mark, Matthew, etc., ad nauseum.These were MEN, people. Woman were not allowed to read or write back then. Most men weren't able to either. Ergo, the \\"GOD wrote this\\" theory.When are we going to evolve as a species enough to reject this garbage scenario? God is NOT going to uplift certain people to heaven and leave the rest of us behind.This is an extremely barbaric way of thinking, to put it kindly.

Though the writing was very redundant and often times prejudicial in most of the books, I pressed on, overlooking the authors' biases and thinking surely the authors would leave reader electrified in their conclusion of events, but...OH WOW! HOW DISAPPOINTING WAS THAT? From a Christian perspective, I can't embrace their notion of God as this murderous character he was portrayed to be. In the end, I couldn't helping thinking that there was not much difference in the way God and Satan dealt with the disloyal. That's not the loving God I envision.

This material could have easily been covered in three very interesting and uplifting books, but they were drawn out exteremely too much.Also, I could have sworn that Rayford died at the end of the previous book"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I know writing about Jesus must be a tremendously challenging task. God is not easily confined to the printed page! However, if Jesus is anything like his portrayl in this book, I am going to be seriously disappointed. (And Jesus will never disappoint!) His portrayl was wooden and rather lifeless, greatly sapping the energy from this novel. Left Behind was a wonderful book, making one truly ponder one's religious convictions. However, each subsequent book has become more complex and bogged down in complicated events and an overabundance of characters. I'd advise new readers to read Left Behind (and maybe Tribulation Force) and call it quits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus Finally Returns, But Not That Great, Really.","review":"Like one previous reviewer noted, the previous book gave you the impression that the Second Coming was mere minutes away, and it turned out to be 200+ pages into the book, and when Jesus *does* come back, 95% of what He says is just Scripture, giving me the impression, at least, He had no personality of His own. When He speaks to a believer, though, it's truly moving to read.The angels had the same problem, too.Not the best, really. I'd recommend the third prequel, The Rapture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caps off a WONDERFUL series.","review":"The whole \\"Left Behind\\" series has been updated and will appeal to young and older readers alike.

This book \\"quotes\\" Jesus with no reference to scripture (i.e. the \\"quotes\\" are what they thinks he will say - which I have a problem with anyway) - and, so far Jesus has talked a lot but hasn't 'said' anything.What a disappointment...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible","review":"The eschatology of the writers blinds them to the truth. This is because they believe the resurrection is before the tribulation. Jesus said the resurrection is after the tribulation on the last day.

The greatest deceptions always came through the church."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great ending to the series","review":"As a true fan of the Left Behind series, I have anxiously awaited \\"Glorious Appearing,\\" making sure I was able to get one the minute it came out. Needless to say, the anticipation was greater than the realization. What should have been heralded with triumph and victory was instead a great letdown. I truly was disappointed in this book.

Unfortunately, this one came to a dead stop. I love Christian fiction, and enjoyed the first few books in the series, however this book is terrible! The characters are two-dimensional characatures of their former selves, their actions and the dialog is absurd! Did Tim & Jerry even write these books? This was such a missed opportunity, because the RIGHT ending could have made the series a good evangelistic tool to get non-believers thinking and asking questions.

In these books I find a message of hate and fear. Why are you so eager to condemn those around you who don't believe exactly as you do? The history of early Christianity isn't one of a uniform understanding of Christ's message. If even those right after Christ couldn't get is right, why, on earth, do you believe that you understand the exact message of God? I would suggest that you work on bringing yourself closer to God's love and spend less time imagining the punishment of those who don't conform to your idea of how God wants us to live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to read it 'cause I'd already read the other 11 books!","review":"I don't mean to slam LaHaye or Jenkins, because the series really was a good idea, however....The series really dragged on towards the end - 8 books would have been plenty.The theology is slavishly literal - even things that are obviously meant to be symbolic.The characters are shallow and the writing is elementary.The whole premise and execution becomes a caricature by the end. The writing is stilted and predictable.I would recommend the Last Disciple by Brouwer as a much better written novel based on revelation prophecy - of course the theology is much different than LaHaye's"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your valuable time!","review":"To put it bluntly, this book was more tedious than a bad church sermon. I'm not a christian, and after reading this book, would definetly be less inclined then ever to convert!

I was at the bookstore on the day it came out. Unfortunately, Glorious Appearing left much to be desired. It is full of filler, quotes from The Bible, and nothingness. I wanted so badly to enjoy reading it, as I have read the previous books and loved them. But this is not impressive.The wars are fought. Of course, we win, since nothing can harm the children of God. The Lord returns. And that is it! THE END!I am a born-again Christian who believes that the order of events in the books are correct. I know much about the Bible, and have done my homework when it comes to The Gospel. I am thankful that the series has led people to Christ, but I am sorry to say that this book has failed to entertain me."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you possibly make the return of Christ Boring!?!","review":"Somehow the authors have managed to make the climactic event of history into a yawner. Their endless sermonizing and stringing together of Biblical texts has created one of the most anticlimatic climaxes I've yet to experience. The logical conclusion to a series that began well and then was stretched way beyond reason for what could only be marketing purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Ending","review":"Despite what others might say, I found this book to be the completely satisfying.

Book 12, Glorious Apprearing, I thought was long and drawn out. What they covered in almost 400 pages could have better done in half that. For the last installment, that should have been the best with the coming of Christ, was a big let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"One thing I love I about the \\"Left Behind\\" series is that it is Bible based fiction. I have read all 12 books in this series. I have checked scripture in the novel against scripture in the Bible and it is accurate. this novel helps us better understand the prophecies (not just the ones in the book of Revelation, but also Daniel, Isaiah, and more) Reminds you what you already know...who wins this battle against good & evil.I agree with the previous review to check it against Scripture\\"God has breathed life into all scripture\\". 2 Timothy 3:16 you will find this is true.

This book reads like something that was churned out merely to make money. \\"Hokey\\" would be a good summation. In the book, Jesus sounds like an animatronic figure from the Disney lab.A majority of the Christian fiction novels are variations on the End Times theories. The writers seem to be scraping the barrel now, for grist for their creative mill. Enough of this End Times obsession. Surely, there must something else to write about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left Behind Series","review":"I believe this is either the last book in the series or next to the last book. It was awesome.

How the authors could make a book about the return of Christ completely tedious and boring is beyond me, but they succeeded in doing in! Pages upon pages of direct quotes from the Bible, and most of the book is spent with the Remnant and Tribulation Force running, yes running, across the Middle East following Jesus as he shows up and completely destroys the enemy with words. Then they run to the next \\"battle\\". Twelve books in i expect a little more drama, a little more payoff. Carpathia even comes off as completely idiotic. This book was not a good read, the authors would have been better served combining the last three books into one. Or better yet the whole series into 4 or 5 books. The series started off with a bang and completely fizzled. I know there is another book in the series, but since virtually all reviews state this is the better book of the two I WILL NOT be reading it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing...","review":"I read 12 books in 30 days (thanks to my public library).I really liked the characters, not so jazed about the religious preaching (I'm an atheist) but I kept an open mind, and enjoyed most of the first 10. By the time I got to 11, I was pushing my way through, convinved 12 would be worth it. Nope.I really liked the charactes, and thought book 12 would give good description as to the reunions of past characters. That is what I wanted, what I cared about.I think I got one, maybe two paragraphs at the end of the book. What a let down!!! After pushing through 12, 400 page books, I felt like I deserved more! You can bet I will be very hesitant about reading the pre-quel that is rumored to come out later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Behind is Right","review":"At the beginning...I thought they had something with the Left Behind series. At the very least, a way to reach out to a lost world with the message of hope and salvation in the Lord. With each subsequent book, however, the story line got weaker and weaker, until at the last- it was so far fetched and poorly written it was difficult to finish the book. I found myself wishing for a different author who could truly capture the essense of this story and deliver on the goods...certainly this shallow portrayal did not begin to tell the story! Not only is it poorly written, it jumps around from undeveloped thought to undeveloped thought. Shallow, uninspiring and hurriedly written, it leaves one with the idea that the author(s)just simply wanted to move on and be done with it all. Save your money- this book isn't worth your $ or your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This book doesn't even deserve 1 star. This book was so slow moving. The writing is so blah. The last 4 books in this series just stink. They could have done the entire series in 7 or 8 books. I didn't even want to finish this one it was so dull. In the beginning of the series I couldn't put the books down but not the case with this one or the last three. It was a waist of my time. Very dissapointed in the writing...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I realize it is difficult to write about the coming of Jesus, especially in a fiction series where one book is building on the book before.

It was so painful to read I almost didn't get through it. I used to be the biggest fan of this series and recommended it to everyone, but this book was horrible. No plot for the characters I liked and way too much scripture for filler. As if reading all of the scripture wasn't bad enough, they repeated it over and over in the book. Save your money. If you have to read it, check it out at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Doctrine of Ethnic Cleansing?","review":"In some ways this book is funny yet profoundly stupid. The writers Tim F. Lehaye and Jerry B. Jenkins have gloriously taken away the essence of Jesus Christ, which is Love. Their version of the bible is a doctrine of fear(almost sounds like the fear tactics of the current American Bush administration). And since when does Jesus like to kill horses? This is an important clue already that this is pure wacko stuff. Have we got another childish and primative interpretation of the bible here by these two silly-billys?Yes,people have a right to believe in a God who likes to rip open bodies and melt flesh into bloody messes. But I only hope they can keep their religious intolerance to themselves. If there is a devil, he certainly did a good job on these pious people who claim to love the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for last","review":"This series has been a long time coming.

Congrats on the book sales!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heretical nonesense","review":"This book is heretical nonesense and it is tragic that so many good Christians are being taken in by a nineteenth century invented heresy, called premillennial dispensationalism. Read Iain Murray's THE PURITAN HOPE and discover the genuine, biblically based truth about the end times. If you are a bible believing Christian, and, thank God I am included, then you want to base your theology on the Word of God and not what some nineteenth century guy (Darby) and two twenty-first century authors thought up. Jenkins can write (La Haye can't) but this is no reason to buy into non-Scriptural, unbiblical theology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed in the quality of this book. It's hard to explain but just trying to repeat verses in the bible as opposed to conveying how people would be at the second coming. I just couldn't relate. If you are an \\"in Christian\\", one could see that this is from the bible, but I thought these books were also for the mass market, and people could gain so much of Jesus through these books. I'm aware of some people who have become engrossed in these books, and I don't think they will be able to understand the last book. It just wasn't in simple enough language. And Jesus just was too distant. He is so much more than was conveyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, but don't listen to the audio version.","review":"I have listened to (and enjoyed) many books on CD in the past few years. This reader is among the worst that I've had the displeasure of hearing. The content of this book is great, so don't get me wrong. However, the reader makes it impossible to experience the book the way it was intended. He pronounces many character names incorrectly, including Carpathia and Adbullah. His character voices range from unconvincing to downright abrasive and/or annoying (especially Carpathia's). His voice inflection is often very wrong when reading dialogue. He also adds pauses in the middle of sentences without any obvious reason. These are just the most obvious and annoying problems. There are too many to list completely here, so please trust me and avoid listening to this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goosebumps!","review":"This book gave me goosebumps.

Picked it up at the airport, read it by turning through any diatribes, and left it with my discarded earphones when the plane landed.The series reminded me of those horrible comic books my little sister brought home in the 80s. They self-aggrandized whatever evangelical church it was and demonized all other religions. Thank God my father banned the comic books from the house and installed in us unconditional love and a hunger to be like Ascended Master Jesus THE Christ. Why do they call Jeshua bin Josef by his title like it's a surname anyway? Oh well, good thing He and the others love us so much and want US ALL Home. And Thank God He has a good sense of humour."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the worst book of the series (of 12)","review":"Judging the series as a whole I would give it two stars, but this book deserves the lowest rating this scale provides.

The thing is this, God doesn't put us in hell, we put ourselves in hell. That's why believers call themselves 'saved', saved from hell by God's grace and faith in the messiah. The belief is basically Jesus is a parachute when jumping from a plane, he saves you, keeps you from dying, that sort of thing.3) I admit, from what I did read in it I was more than a little disturbed by the glee that they had in their descriptions of the deaths of the nonbelievers. These people deserve our compassion, not hate or venom, love thy enemy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Thriller, Left Behind Series","review":"This is the next to last book in the Left Behind series of books.

It is great fiction regardless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously predictable, but too drawn out","review":"This series had to end the way it did, with the glorious appearing, but as usual, the autors failed to get us there in a quick fashion. The story had very little action, except for the decimaion of the enemy which was anything but action packed. What was left of the main characters (maybe two of the main 12 in the series)had ver little to say except, \\"Rayford was happy\\" then \\"Mac was happy\\", then \\"Chang was happy\\" I found myself skipping pages full of Bible text which was far too overwhelming for a non-christian who loved the series for action, and good story telling (see books 1-6, not 7-12). I also noticed that in the last few books, Carpathia, who was an interesting character, became a shadow of his former self, and not a superhuman as he was in earlier books. On the whole, I am glad that I read this series,but it easily could have been done in 6 or 7 books. Now I see there is a sequel and prequel? I doubt that I can sit through two more of these novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book - terrible transaction.","review":"This is not about the product, but the seller. I was told the product was new. It was clearly used and even had a bookmark in the middle. Great book. Very disappointing transaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"***Awesome ***","review":"This latest intallation of the left behind series is extremely well done and will keep readers on the edge of their seats. The character devlopement remains consistent and even for those who already know a bit about the end times the story remains very exciting. Readers who enjoy this fictionalized version on endtime events may also want to pick up 'Revelation Unsealed\\" by author Donald A Salerno which is an excellent non-fiction depiction of what the Apocalypse has to say about this final period of human history."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Can I Say?","review":"The book says that I die. It literally says that I, someone who has never met Timothy LaHaye in my life, deserve to be KILLED, and not just killed but eviscerated, and it celebrates my sentencing to a lake of fire as \\"righteous\\". WTF? This is how it describes my death:\\"But even as they struggled, their own flesh dissolved, their eyes melted and their tongues disintegrated... leaving grotesque skeletons standing, before they, too, rattled to the pavement.\\"These aren't evil people. They're just people who don't believe in Jesus! That's what Jesus does to every single non-Evangelical and non-Christian on the planet in Timothy LaHaye's book. Take a good look, because there's only one type of person who could possibly enjoy reading this book, and if there were a benevolent God those people would be put away in a very distant place where they could no longer be a danger to the rest of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Return?","review":"I'm a bit troubled by a book that manipulates sacred scripture as though the authors actually know the meaning and assume that St. John on Patmos was writing about the United Nations and not the empire of his time, Rome, and the very real destruction of Jerusalem and the desecration of the temple. To put the Book of Revelation into a contemporary novel such as this is by any definition a profaning of the good book and sacriledge. When you consider that one could reasonably interpet scripture to make G.W.s little venture into Iraq an action of the anti-Christ where do you go next? As for me I will not be one of those who feels that my car will be driverless in the event of Rapture. I know that I am unworthy and trust in the Lord and will accept what comes. The arrogance of these books in claiming to speak for that which cannot be spoken for is terrifying."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a disappointment after such a great series","review":"It appears that book 11 should have been a little longer and book 12 should have been skipped. It had a lot of filler and not a lot of substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"3/4 done","review":"I have read through the whole series and almost done with the last book. I don't think this will be the last book, cuz I'm almost done and there seems to be too much that is going to happen. Anyways, I read all the negative remarks, obviously from nonbelievers. A nonbeliever is borrowing my books and she likes the fiction story. However, it's based off the book or \\"Revelation\\" What they wrote is only a glimpse of what is coming whether you believe it or not. They could be right on, I doubt it, but what will happen is going to be something close. No matter what it's not going to be pretty. I read the \\"Davinci Code,\\" and many believers can't believe I did, but it's a great fiction book, one of the best books I've ever read. Honestly, doesn't matter if Jesus did get married, and had a daughter. According to the bible, getting married and having children is holy and considered a blessing. Besides, he is the same Jesus who died on the cross and rose again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This book is worth every cent. It should be in every believers household so that when the Rapture comes, those left behind will have something to encourage them. This book would do it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So glad it's finally over...","review":"Let me begin by saying:1. I am a Christian.2. I believe the Bible is a literal, wholly truthful account given to us directly by God.3. This series lowered my IQ, drained me of all energy and left me longing for the hours and dollars I invested in it.After picking up the first book I realized it was interesting though poorly written. Not wanting to start something without finishing it, I kept buying this dreck until I finally completed the series. I would not recommend these books to anyone, Christian or Non-Christian.I do think the potential for fictionalizing the story of the Rapture/Tribulation period is awesome, unfortunately these \\"books\\" fell far short of reaching any sort of literary goal. (Financial goals, of course, were surpassed.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but totally unbiblical","review":"These guys sure know how to write a pacy thriller! But that is all this book is, folks. For what they say will happen in the End Times and what God's Word, the Scriptures, say will happen, are two totally different things. Get your kicks out of reading a racy, pacy thriller! But read what the Bible says to get your theology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing End to a Disappointing Series","review":"A terrible ending to the entire series. There was so much more that could have been done with this finale. Character development - nonexistent. Plot development - nearly none. The first two-thirds of this book read like an extended Bible tract. What is brought forth in 300-plus pages could just as easily have been accomplished in a front-back printing on a single sheet of paper, which would be stuck under your windshield wiper at the local mall. The last third of the book comes off like an awards banquet more than anything else. Parts of the series were well worth the efforts of the authors, but so much more could have been done with it - and wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"The series ends with a fizzle","review":"This was by far the poorest book in the entire series. The series started out as a strong and creative interpretation of what Bible prophecies could mean, but also it was just plain great story-telling. It had an appeal to Christians and non-Christians alike because it was a good read. Somewhere along the line the authors lost the edge. It really shows in this final book, it is nothing more than page after page of direct scripture quotes and sorry attempts to tie together loose ends with side stories that read like afterthoughts. I never imagined the end times and return of Jesus could be portrayed to be so B-O-R-I-N-G!! It sounds more exciting in the Bible than in this horribly dry read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave this book behind!!","review":"So Christ appears on his white steed with a sash across his torso that says, \\"King of Kings\\"????

PUH-LEEZ!!!This is supposed to be the CLIMAX...Lahaye & Jenkins knew they were going to squeeze 12 books out of us, couldn't they take the time to provide us with something other than this poorly written ANT-CLIMACTIC drivel??Being a Greek Orthodox Christian, I was hooked after the first book (even though they got steadily got worse)...but I still kept the faith! But as we all know, sometimes the Lord's answer is no. No to this book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was painful to read","review":"After following this series from the beginning, and finding it at times enthralling, this final installment was so anticlimatic it was painful. The entire sub-plot following the believers in Chicago was a total waste of time and so uninteresting, I couldn't even remember who they were from the previous books. I found myself skimming over the massive dialogue issuing forth from the mouth of Jesus for the entire last 1/3 of the book as it was extremely repetitive and actually boring. Spare us from authors who think they can do credit to an event that is surely outside the realm of human comprehension."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly more enjoyable than a root canal","review":"While this series started out strong, it waned over time, and this last installment isn't worth the paper it's printed on. After the abrupt, as usual, ending of the 11th book, I of course had to read the last book all the way through, but near the end I began to suspect it of growing in size. This book is an enormous letdown after all the wait, and I advise anyone who intends to buy this book, if only to complete the collection, to save their money. In fact, give me a ring and I'll send you my copy instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story fell down","review":"I was eager to get the this book but found it fell short of the others. Way too much time was devoted to scripture compared to the others. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two more to go","review":"I have really enjoyed this series. I do think that it is being drawn out further than I would prefer. But I enjoy each of these books very much.Like the others, this book is a good example of what the authors view as the ideal. It is also a way to see how the author interoperates the Bible especially the apocalypse. The authors are very talented in writing action fiction. The work goes very fast and is an easy read.This is not a good book for a serious debate about the book of Revelation. The book takes a particular interpretation of that book of the bible and tells a fictional story based upon a portion of the teachings of the Bible as they are understood by the authors.I highly enjoy the series and recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buying into the Culture of Fear","review":"Please do not read these books & further brainwash yourselves. These books are all based on the fear of death and whether or not you will achieve eternal bliss. How about instead of praying for the end of the world, you sit back and enjoy life as it is. The fact that these types of books are shaping our country's foreign policy is disgusting. No wonder we are killing ourselves off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read with caution","review":"Given Mr. LaHaye's association with Rev.

I was glad to have read it and complete the series. I know many people will want the action/adventure of the other books in this series, and will be disappointed. This was more methodical. I tried to imagine myself seeing the people that led me to Christ when Jesus returns to say \\"thank you for being a saint\\" and others that have died that I now miss and will one day see again. In that way, this book was very special. Come Jesus!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glorious Appearing","review":"The book arrived within the promised time frame. Would certainly buy from Amazon again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I read all the series books from the beginning and enjoyed them as fiction. They were not the best written books by any stretch of the imagination. But they were a fun read. This last book was dull, drawn out, and did not have nearly the pay-off it could have had. The visual images were nicely done. Other than that, it was a disappointment. I will recommend it as closure to those who have read the other books, but will preface that with a warning that it is dull and does not have the pay off that one would expect in a fictional series of 12 books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left Behind","review":"Bought the first book and it was so good that I ordered the rest of the series...you will love it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal","review":"I got a great hardbound used book for 1 cent plus postage.

I read it a lot. And I found Glorious Appearing to be a great tool to envision how prophesies of the Bible might occur.As a busy working mom with 3 toddlers, I don't allocate much of my spare time to reading works of fiction...but the Left Behind Series has been well worth it.Glorious Appearing is good. Exceptionally good.Frankly, I had reservations about how the authors would attempt to portray Jesus without committing heresy. Apart from the Spirit of God and the Word of God, it would be impossible to avoid.Jenkins & LaHaye had the presence of mind to stay true to the Scriptures. It's a privilege to call them my brothers in Christ.This is a great book. Get it.

One of the things I liked the most about it was consisteny, and self-fulfillment. One of things I didn't like was putting words into Christ's mouth -- dat ain't right.I'm basically reviewing all the books this last one, and I must say, Mr. Jenkins needs a dang thesaurus, I thought I'd kill myself if I read the word incongruous one more time, it was used like 100 times in the book.I don't think the premise of these books makes sense. I decided to read a counterpoint after finishing, so I read \\"The Rapture Expose\\" by Rossing, and it totally debunked the whole dispensationlist viewpoint (left behind premise).

I am blessed to see the reviews of other christians who enjoyed the series as much as I did. This book was straight from the Bible and painted a picture in my mind of what the glorious appearing could be like. I think Rayford should have spent more time with Kenny rather than he being put off on others especially after his \\"job\\" was done. I also wish there would have been more to the reunions at the end, it focused on Rayfords family but I think there would have been more to it that what is written.

Anyone who loves Christ could not possibly love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst one yet!","review":"The first two books in this series were great and by rights drew a lot of people to the series. Unfortunately after that it started going down hill, picking up a lot of speed towards the end. This one definately deserves to be at the bottom of the heap. When it's not being completely hokey it's being preachy. It's fiction, but it's cramming out of context Bible verses down your throat along the way. I beleive in the Bible and this book does no justice to Christianity or even to the craft of writing fiction. Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read the entire series in a little over a month and thought the 11th book was headed down hill in it's ability to hold my attention. Hoping for a real bang in book #12 I was sorely disappointed. It was just plain boring....unlike what the real Glorious Appearing will be like. This book just stunk. I sure wish it had continued with the same magnitude as the previous 10 books. Of course if you've come this far in the series, you have to finish it and will see what I mean!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is an embarrassment","review":"I'm sorry, but after reading a few pages of this book, it is apparent that the authors are merely cloaking their brand of racial and ethnic intolerance as pseudo-pious narrative.The book's depicitons of violence and bloodshed are shocking to say the least. Far worse are the predications of violence based on differences in faith.Christianity teaches to \\"love thy neighbor,\\" yet the story we have in this book says that if your neighbor is of a different religion or ethnicity, then they will die an agonizing death at the hands of the Messiah. This is not why God made us all different. This is not what the United States stands for.I seriously question the authors' intent in writing this piece. Also at question are the hearts and minds of those who blindly accept this dribble."},{"rating":"1","title":"glorious appearing","review":"I have read all of the books in the series and each book grew successively more tedious.

The characters turned into bland, one-dimensional caricatures...wooden dialogue repeated over and over and over.

I am not, however, a big fan of this book. I found it to be long-winded and boring, not to mention anti-climactic. Maybe that's because I don't consider myself to be a religious person. When my step-son urged me to read the first book, I couldn't stop reading. My step-son liked them for the fast-paced action and excitement (he was 13 at the time). I liked them because they got me thinking about God, theology, and where I am in my life. The series had been out for a few years, so I had some catching up to do. I read the first 4 or 5 in succession and eagerly awaited the following publications. But with each new novel, I found them to be less dramatic, more unbelievable and a lot more sanctimonious.

Still, it'd be curmudgeonly to complain too much about someone who makes such consistantly enjoyable albums (& she does record a lot of them). This one is a solo concert, mostly in her quirky tinkling stride-piano vein; there's a few nice, sparing originals (especially \\"Dear Gaylord\\"), some handsome standards, & something of an emphasis on the blues, with a 15-minute version of \\"Straight No Chaser\\" being the disc's centrepiece. Her quoting habits get the better of her at a few points (for instance, she ends \\"Straight No Chaser\\" with \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\"), but on the whole this is a very strong disc, recommended to anyone looking for a sampler of Jessica's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"confused","review":"It would be nice to view it, if only I had it!

He has what the humorist Joey Slinger calls \\"meatloaf memories\\", recalling the things that weren't so funny like a father's death and a mother's insane expectation that her son will remain in a parallel version of her world.I used to think funny was the hardest writing to carry off, but funny and painful is actually worse.

I hope these stories are not a accurate look at the Wiccan community. The main character Bast; seems to be more interested in drinking beer and wondering who her next partner is going to be than doing any kind of magic or prayer or even ritual. The only ritual in the book is so watered down so as to be all inclusive that you can't even tell that it is a Wiccan ritual. Save your mony and look else where if you are hopeing to be entertained with realistic Wiccan magick and/or religion"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't smart enough to enjoy this book.","review":"OK, I know that I didn't finish college and that I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed, so this book made me feel just a tad stoopid. The author is obviously an intelligent and well educated woman. Too often I scrambled for the dictionary or encyclopedia (not that that is a bad thing, of course) when all I wanted was an amusing read.If you're kinda slow like me, try Jim Butcher's hysterical Harry Dresden series, or M.R. Sellars' intriguing Rowan Gant mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a real Wiccan","review":"Bast is a graphic artist and practicing witch -- a real Witch, not the Hollywood version. She is completely human; no magic sparks flying from her fingertips, no psychic battles with bad guys. Bast relies on her own wit, experience, and faith in the Goddess to solve the mysteries she becomes embroiled in. Not all pagans are portrayed in a flattering light, reflecting the all too true pitfalls of following a religion outside the mainstream. I only wish there were more in the series..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead on (no pun intended)","review":"Accuracy is the watchword for this trilogy - accuracy in setting (NYC), accuracy in representing the Pagan community (including some of the things we'd rather weren't there), accuracy in her realism. While this is a fiction book, it's not fantasy - anything out of the ordinary can be chalked up to \\"freak coincidence\\" by skeptics, while still retaining the mysterious aura that surrounds ceremony and magick.

Using the rollers with my 12-foot SOT, they spun on the crossbars when lifting the yak up there and gouged the top of my car. I see no advantage to these over the saddles, but, then, I don't like the saddles much either. Too much installation time, and they look goofy without a yak in them. Instead I stored the rollers and saddles in my garage and now use the foam blocks on my rack. They're not perfect either, but installation is a matter of minutes, they don't damage my car, and they're cheap (unless you've already thrown money at the rollers and saddles). I don't understand all the 5-star reviews here for these rollers. Maybe for small kayaks? Even then, doesn't make sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a dealer button...","review":"This dealer button is great. Ten programmable rounds, small blind, big blind, ante - its all there and all customizable. We live overseas and play in a foreign currency so the lack of any monetary units was nice - for us. The only issue I have is the size of the button. It's about 3inchs in diameter (not measuring it at the moment so three seems about right) which is a bit big on the table. That's just a personal preference though. If you're looking for a dealer button with some juice that does more then just count down the round time this is the one you're looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what yo need","review":"Completely programmable, no more PC clocks or phone timers.

There were lot's of times I had a pickup game and had to deal with trying to remember to keep track of the time on someone's watch, and remembering where we were after a break has caused some annoying issues.This is the perfect solution to this issue. It even survives the expected Fidget factor. When I have played with this the buttons are easy to push but don't get accidentally pressed when fidgeting with it.The best part is that it retains the time and blinds when you turn it off.

This album by GM is cheesy, period.

The beat is stronger and harder. Especially good, besides the title track, is track #6: \\"First Hand Experience in Second Hand Love.\\" Excellent techno riff that lacks the cheesey vocals, dated Expose sound effects and stabs. It just rolls and rolls and rolls. Nice driving cd. However, E=MC2 is a cd to pass on. I was very disappointed.

I don't like my office answering service calling my home number and prefer they use the mobile phone. Our house has two floors and I'm forever being called while on a different floor than the mobile phone and I hate having to carrying around a mobile phone while at the house.So with that in mind, I thought I'd give this phone (KX-TH112S) a try. I LOVE IT! It synced immediately to my Blackberry 8700 (AT&T;) and within ten minutes, I got my first call from the wireless service through my cordless phone. The reception is clear and if anything, better than on my Blackberry. I selected a unique ring tone to determine when a call is from the mobile phone. This Bluetooth feature has made my life much easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Phone!","review":"I'm very happy with this phone set. We bought the base and two extra handsets. The sound quality is great, and they are smaller than the last panasonic cordless phone we had. We have two phone lines, and this phone works great for that. You can choose different ring tones to tell which line is ringing. There is a jack for a headset on all the handsets, which I think is important. The cool feature is being able to link cell phones with this phone. Once the cell phone is paired, it's so easy to come home, press one button on the base unit and link the cell phone via bluetooth. Then I can answer cell phone calls (or make them!) from any handset in the house. It works great! You can link up to five different bluetooth devices. You can only use one at a time, but that's not a problem for us. I'm glad we bought this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Base unit quit working after 8 months","review":"I was fairly happy with the phone until the base unit quit working.The good news is that it failed before the 1-year warranty expired, so I will get a replacement for the cost of shipping the telephone to the service center.The bad news is that the quality of Panasonic's telephones seems to be dropping over time. I bought this phone to replace a KX-TG2740 which had begun to fail, but was still usable for short conversations.I doubt that I will buy another Panasonic telephone unless their quality improves significantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bluetooth compatible phone...NOT","review":"I have had this unit for about a month.

As you are probably aware 5.8 Ghz doesn't interfere with networks they way 2.4 does as 2.4 is the same frequency that WI-FI operates on. But if you look down to the actual product description (or on Panasonic's website) it states the phone is 2.4 Ghz, which will render this phone useless if used within range of WI-FI and may render your WI-FI network inoperable.

It is good for people who have never had any experience with arabic or for people who have. This book is in the Egyptian dialect, which is a good one to know because it is widely understood. But if one already has some knowledge of Arabic there is also the standard form of each word given in the Arabic script, which is also covered. What makes this book so nice is that it is set up so the reader can actually learn the language instead of just memorize key phrases. The subjects covered are extensive and the dictionary is Arabic to English and English to Arabic. No matter what level of achievment is desired, this is the best book to help reach that goal with. This book is not going to give complete knowledge of the language, but it will give as much as a phrase book is able to considering it's size."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks big time.","review":"This book teaches arabic for those who at least know a little about the alphabet.

In this movie you will see the survival in the worse conditions of the Penquin, but it is more than that. It is the story that is proof positive that creatures, other than humans, work together, love together, mourn together and lean on each other to survive. Through this movie you will be moved with a myraid of emotions from a giggle, to deep sadness, from horror to total respect. It is a raw look at the life style of yet another one of God's creatures and one you will not soon forget.I watched it with my grandchildren and we laughed and cried together. In it they saw life and they saw death; they saw the importance of committment and love for survival, the workings of a family unit in the wild and most important that creatures are not just dumb animals. Exceptional and well worth your viewing time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better without the French (sorry--)","review":"From what I've read on-line in many places, the original French version was not actually scripted as an actual documentary with a 3rd-person narrator. I'm not a fan of excessive anthropomorphizing the animal kingdom because that's too Disney and a bit dangerous, but having the penguins themselves speaking in French would have been incredibly cheesy, even in this American land of cheese (the Taiwan and Japanese versions also have dubs like this). As such, I'm extremely glad the American version doesn't have this voice dubbing. Freeman's narration is great. Ultimately, however... who wouldn't want to hug a penguin? (Don't--they'll probably peck your eyes out.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, they have the toughest lives!","review":"Who knew how hard these creatures have to work to procreate.

Its a pity, that the original version is not alternative on the disc with subtitles. The voiceover of morgan freeman is good, no doubt.

This is an emotional experience, plunging in to join the emperor penguins in a frozen, freezing world. Their sense of family, of loyalty and community is astonishing and pretty often I was tearing up. The dedicated photographers who gave up any other life to be there and make this movie possible is astonishing. We experienced all this right along with them. The emperor penguins are an incredible species and I see intelligence, bravery, dedication, talent and abilities that I never knew about before seeing this movie. Morgan Freeman, by the way, as narrator is perfect. This is not for one-time viewing, you'll want to see it again. I might say there is no plot per se, but yet there is a plot. There is a plot just as real as we have in our own lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful film - horribly boring","review":"A lot of people like lions and penguins. The get a little stuffed creature as a child. They read stories and watch animated films with cute, anthropomorphic versions of the real thing.Naturally, folks want to see a film about their animal heroes.The problem is that nature and reality in general tend to be both brutal and VERY boring.This is a two, almost three hour film that took over a year to film, and it feels like that. Yes, there is an impressive classical score, but it gets extremely repetitive after the first thirty minutes. All the songs sound the same.There is nothing to sugar coat when the sea lion has the penguin snack.It would have been an interesting 30 minute short, but subjecting the audience to 150 minutes of watching penguins walking and freezing ...Watch at your own peril."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for a nature-lover","review":"Got this as a gift for a nature and animal person.

An unusual ritual that shows the extreme and harsh conditions that these aquatic birds face and deal with to keep their species in existance.Morgan Freeman does an excellent job narrating the events that take place, and the film crew that actually endured these elements to capture everything these amazing creatures go through.The roller-coaster ride of highs and lows are experienced throughout this film as you witness the humor and tragedy that makes this such a great film to watch.I cannot recommend this high enough to all age groups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor little Penguins","review":"Wow! I had no idea what they go through in their lives, it's very intense and sad. You have to see it to beleive it, seriously, this is a extrodinary documentary on Penguins. You will be surprized on how hard they really have it. They can survive the coldest winters in all the world in Antartica. The filming of this must have been very, very dramatic and cold. It's amazing what these guys went through, but even more amazing is what Penguins go through, its almost depressing, but very educational, interesting and warm hearted. They are so very cute as well and funny looking too. These Penguins have it rough, and us humans think we have things rough. They go months without eating, wow I would totally freak out if I haven't ate for just a few days. Poor little Penguins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly Riveting!!","review":"I am still in awe after watching this 80 minute documentary a couple of months ago!! The cinematography is INCREDIBLE. I'm still wondering how the cinematographers were able to capture all the footage they did of the Emperor Penguins, especially the underwater scenes with the Emperor Penguins searching for food!If you love both documentaries and animals, then this is a must see film! This is a great family film and can be watched by all age groups! Morgan Freeman narrates and does a fine job of it. The script for the documentary is really informative about how thousands of Emperor Penguins make their annual journey to their breeding grounds in Antarctica. Each winter the single file, 70 mile journey begins, where by the Emperor Penguins travel through extreme climate and frigid temperatures just to find a mate, lay and care for one precious egg and raise the young penguin to fend for itself. It is an unbelieveable journey not to be missed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A depressing documentary","review":"This documentary should have been shortened and been on Discovery Channel. It is NOT for children. We bought it, watched it once and will probably never watch it again. It is a gruelling and sad existance for an animal. It makes you want to rescue them and relocate them to a location more habitable. The film is enlightening, but not entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrrrring","review":"Do yourself a favor and watch the movie for FREE by checking it out from the library BEFORE you decide to purchase it.I had read the rave reviews and heard the hype...I finally got a chance to watch the movie. The kids kept asking for something more entertaining but we kept watching thinking something magnificent would happen. Yawn. It's a documentary about penguins. It's interesting. It is not entertaining. This is NOT a movie for the kids to watch over and over again. It's not a movie that **I** ever want to see again either!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bad you won't get to see \\"The Emperor's Journey\\"","review":"It is extremely disheartening to see this fascinating project expropriated by the Christian Fascists, but I digress. If there were any justice, viewers would have the option of watching the ORIGINAL French version. Now, I'm not saying that version is better (it has the anthropomorphization of the penguins, giving them individual \\"voices\\"; it also contains an at-times awkward, blaring techno soundtrack), but the option SHOULD BE ON THE TABLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been interesting...","review":"Whoever made this failed.

Poor picture quality, and a minimum of information, with long periods of things happening but with no explaination or details. \\"Emperor penguins endure 3 or 4 winters before having chicks, and then only one per year...\\" 'How long do they live?' I asked out loud... silence...By comparison, Planet Earth has the most eye-popping cinematography I have ever seen in my life, and fascinating things are explained to you.

This is a great film for the whole family to watch, from start to finish you will ride the emotional roller coaster with the male & female penguins & you would not be human if you did not feel their pain from loss.I did enjoy Morgan Freeman narrating as he did not take from the spectacle itself, and I equally enjoyed the two mini documentary's in the special features section.This is a documentary that is well worth owning, if for nothing else other than to remind us humans how good we have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Yes, at times this film is overly sentimental. Yes, it anthropomorphises the penguins.But... the filming is fabulous... Freeman is a genius choice for narrator... it will take your breath away to see how beautiful a land of snow and ice can be even as you are horrified at its harshness.I highly recommend watching the feature about the filming of the documentary. It's nigh-on as long as the film itself and at least as interesting.

This documentary is and always will be my favorite movie. If you think youv'e seen better movies, see this movie. Sure, documentarys usually don't have shootouts, shower scenes, and/or Killers with chainsaws, but this movie had more than that. It was powerful. The educational purpose of this movie is to teach our children, and our childrens children. (If you even want to take it further) our childrens childrens children>>>>> You can't walk into blockbuster, or your local movie theater, or even your best friends home... and see this movie sitting on the DVD rack, hidden on top of the plasma TV, or on the PLAYING TODAY list... and not watch it. It's more than a movie, it is an opportunity...~Danny M."},{"rating":"2","title":"a truly amazing film","review":"A friend of mine remarked how amazing it is that such a film, with no hollywood stars (no people at all really, aside from narration and camera crew), could create such a stir. This is an excellent film for many reasons. First of all it is visually stunning and beautiful. Second, you learn a lot (my training is in biology, and I mistakenly presumed that I already knew everything interesting about penguins). Third, it inspires a lot of emotion, being sometimes very sad and often humorous. Finally it has all been put together into a truly amazing story. I am certainly no expert on film-making, but I know the folks who planned and put together something like this must be extremely good at it. Don't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Didn't Think I Would Like This One, but I Did","review":"So I was over my Grandpa's house Christmas day and he had the March of the Penguins DVD sitting on the sofa. I have heard good things about it and I was already getting bored with my relatives, so I popped in the DVD. The first thing you will hear is the excellent narration by Morgan Freeman (great choice) followed by the scenery that doesn't seem real. It is so amazing how this movie was filmed without interfering with the animals. It's like your right there with them, and by the time the film is over, you really feel like you know these magnificent birds as though they were human. After viewing this film, I will never complain about having a rough life or look at a penguin the same way again. If there is such a thing as reincarnation, please God, don't have me come back as a penguin. I hate the cold!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How good we have it...","review":"This movie shows one year in a penguin's life - the year when it finds a mate, produces one egg and struggles to raise the little one to a point where it can strike out on its own. The images are stunning, the narration is heartfelt and the life of the penguin - is about the starkest and cruelest it can be.Both my husband and I came away from this film feeling quite inspired. This film may be good as a nature documentary, introducing children and adults to unfamiliar aspects of animals' lives, but it excels as an antidote to self-pity on rainy days. All penguins seem to do in the unforgiving climate of Antarctica for an entire year is to feed and reproduce - we, humans, have a little more opportunity for work, fun, self-realization, let's make the most of it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Penguin Channel","review":"If this movie were made in the seventies, it would be called \\"Everything You Wanted to Know About Penguins, but Didn't Think to Ask,\\" and it wouldn't match the splendor of \\"March of the Penguins\\". What makes this movie transcend the usual nature movies like the old Disney features, \\"Vanishing Prairie,\\" et. al, is that it is exquisitely filmed, smoothly narrated (by Morgan Freeman) and fascinatingly focused. (The life cycle of Antarctic penguins is documented for one year, so it flows like a story.) The whole experience is vivid and engaging. The viewer is invited intimately into the penguin community, while the visual grandeur is garnished by beautiful music that matches the mood of every scene. The information is really fresh, for who hasn't known, or at least assumed to know, a great deal about penguins? \\"March of the Penguins,\\" takes new and old territory and packages it in a way that is surprisingly well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful and Informative Account","review":"This DVD goes far beyond superb photography and entertainment. As a science teacher, I found it to be very useful for science classes. It teaches so much about basic ecology, the Antarctic environment, the life cycle of the Emperor Penguin, monogamous bonding in the animal world, and the dynamics of paternal involvement in child raising, etc.Warning: The cruelties of nature are shown in graphic detail, and this may upset some sensitive and younger viewers. There are scenes of eggs and embryos frozen and discarded, young penguin chicks killed by the cold, and predators attacking a group of young chicks.One is amazed to learn that penguins may walk 70 miles to find their mates. Or that even adult Emperor Penguins can only survive the coldest part of the Antarctic winter by huddling together. The viewer may be endeared by the sight of females and males exchanging the egg for warmth and protection in the space between their lower abdomen and their feet."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Graphic for Little Ones","review":"I did not like this movie.

I saw the original with a five year old this summer and we left after 3/4 of showing. Get this, you watch a line of Penquins march 70 miles from the nearest food supply, stand in the cold to mate, then female marches back 70 miles while male starves. Female eventually returns to take over the egg and male leaves to hopefully march 70 miles to food in the ocean. Boring film, no action, no interest.

A fascinating journey with terrific narration and beautiful cinematography.My only disappointment was the end of the film, when things seem to wrap up rather quickly. The film overall builds a sense of wanting to know the ending and therefore, to wrap it up so quickly and neatly was a let down.Still, this is a five-star film and a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"March of the Penguins","review":"A very touching story focusing on the yearly migration of the emperor penguins.

Very little commentary; most of the time you just watch penguins walking or standing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"I would much rather see a documentary on the work that went into this film than the film itself.

Although I am sure that the mind-numbing tedium is supposed to reflect the mind-numbing tedium experienced by the penguins, I had to say for myself, \\"Do I really need all of this mind-numbing tedium?\\" While there were some amazing images, the \\"story\\" could have been told much more interestingly in MUCH MUCH MUCH less time. I really believe this was sold on the cuteness of the chicks, which gets old after the thousandth shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the Birds!!!","review":"Frankly I was underwhelmed........ it was quite repetitious.

Inconceivably cold. And it's dark. And it'll get colder, and darker. But wait... it'll get colder and darker still! Are you still enjoying this? Yes, it's visually spectacular and probably wildly entertaining to eudyptologists obsessed with Kierkegaard. Coldness, pain and death. Horrible, endless sacrifice, generation after generation, leading to nothing but yet more endurance of boundless pain and ever-greater coldness. Endless, forced cryonic 70-mile Bataan death marches to and from a source of food. Actually, it feels rather like life under a Republican administration. But still... our own lives are painful enough. Who wants to see these poor birds mindlessly suffer, huddling against the 100-mph winds and hyperboreal onslaught of frigid death? Maybe there is nobility to be found in the observation of life in hell, but we're all too used to it. We need escape, respite, remission of agony... Not The Passion of Opus."},{"rating":"1","title":"National Geographic Quality","review":"I was missled by this show. I felt the hype and previews were promoting a program my child would enjoy. It was enjoyable for about 15 minutes, then my child and myself became very dis-interested. This is simply a documentary on penguins. Nothing more. It is more of an educational film, rather than an entertainment film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick of penguins.","review":"I sat through half this movie and wished I never rented it.

There will be absolutely no picture improvement in the Blu-Ray version vs the DVD version.That being said ... of course the movie itself is GREAT!

MARCH OF PENGUINS earned well-deserved acclaim for its depiction of the plight of the Emperor Penguin, every year, as they march across Antarctica, to arrive on breeding grounds, to mate and further the species. It is beautifully filmed and soulfully narrated by actor Morgan Freeman. You will fall in love with the young penguins and grow very attached to the older ones, leading them to their destination. It takes a year for this brood of birds to reach their destination. That means enduring freezing temperatures, as well as staying clear of the advances of their predators. You're going to want to watch this from start to finish, just to see what happens.This film earned a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Documentary, and is an engaging study in the lives of these extraordinary birds.

Page 137, example 4.5 (b) gives contradictory exponents. The correct exponents are ^2 throughout. The answer is also wrong!

Beiser's lazy treatment of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and the Bohr atom amounts to little more than throwing out a few formulas and examples. The same goes for the transformations in special relativity - Tipler's treatment is superior. Even the Schaum's book in modern physics is better on this topic. His treatment of quantum mechanics was obviously meant to be ignored - hence the leaving out of important conceptual and explanatory material that, say, Modern Atomic and Nuclear Physics puts in. Overall, it is worthless in comparison to the previously mentioned books."},{"rating":"2","title":"So close to being a perfect textbook, but just missed.","review":"Beiser tries amazingly hard in order to make the book very understandable. He simplifies the math and explains the concepts very carefully.

However, his scientific biographies and occasional digressions, as well as its clarity, make this a solid textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Explanations","review":"I did not think that this book offered too good of explanations.

I was hoping for an interesting story however I should have known by its length that this book would turn out to be one long writing exercise usually required for a beginning creative writing class. An experienced writer knows how to get their point across, make the words flow and keep a reader captivated with fewer words. This story was filled up with any historical info the author could get her hands on. Add to that the creative writing exercises of how many different ways this writer could describe something led up to an exhausting read. Some authors get paid for each page they write so perhaps that's what happened here. This book should never have been published with more than 300 pages in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got Editor??","review":"I wish I had read all the 1, 2, and 3 star reviews before I ordered this book, as they say it all. Heed the warnings! I ordered this book on my Kindle, so I had no clue how LONG it is. Long is great if the story is compelling and well written - not the case here. It was a real struggle to trudge through this mess. I admit I eventually resorted to speed reading to get through it, but it still wasn't worth it. Those are hours of my life I want back.

My litmus test for any book is 50 pages. If it hasn't grabbed me by then it's probably not going to, and since I always have plenty of other books waiting to be read I put it aside and move on. \\"The Way the Crow Flies\\" didn't even make it past page 40. I was SO bored I could hardly stay awake. I admit it had promise. The post-World War II setting drew me, as I grew up in the 50s and 60s myself. For some reason I took an instant dislike to Mimi, the mother. All the endless detail involved in driving onto the base and Jack moving into his office, all the background of his days as a pilot I found incredibly tedious.I realize many great books start slowly and build into something wonderful (example: \\"...And Ladies of the Club\\" by Helen Hooven Santmyer) and this book may very well be one of them.Bottom line: I just didn't have the patience to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Wading Through A Swimming Pool of Paste","review":"This novel LOOKS good. The cover, paper, font, history are all there! However, trying to read this jumbled collection of intentionally clippy sentences, torrential downpours of pop references and flat characters that never seem to go anywhere but laterally is quite difficult, indeed.This book is good for you if you don't like action, development, flow, and coherency. However, if you're into taking an 8 paragraph synopsis in the back of the book and stretching it out by hundreds of pages, then this is the book for you.I had to force myself to read it and couldn't make it past the halfway point. MacDonald seems like like the wall of words approach and it can work, sometimes, but this book is just too much to chew on; literary paste to swim through to an unclear and wholly unsatisfying end* in light of the effort it takes to get to it.*I skipped to the last section."},{"rating":"1","title":"trite and hackneyed","review":"I found this book rather amateurish with tiresome cliches, boring stereotypes and a rather unimaginative, trite story line. Predictable and at times Ms. MacDoanld stretches the boundaries of belief. I understand that the author was attempting to contast the stark dichotomies of the pristine, hermetical family with the harsh, crass evil in the world, but please, the writing is so unseasoned that it detracts from any \\"message,\\" from whatever the point of the novel is attempting to make. Ms. MacDonald's\\"poetic license\\"was irritating, using one word sentences, incomplete sentences and a mish mash of popular songs of the day. I wanted to find something to keep me going after spending $29, and in the end it was only with the thought that I might be able to recoup some of back by selling it to a used bookstore.

It started out incredibly slow for me and I was getting a little frustrated with it. The main reason I purchased this book was because it was described to me as a murder mystery. However, the murder doesn't take place until half way through this 800 plus page book. Also, had I known about the child molestation in the book, I probably would not have purchased it. Having said that, I'm glad I did continue with it. The story was fascinating and very well told. Even the seemingly endless descriptions were beautifully written. If you're willing to be patient and let the story unfold, you will find this a very entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful writing but excessive & depressing","review":"I was very hopeful when starting this novel, however I agree with the Amazon.ca & Books Canada reviews. I love the descriptions and the flow of the writing. Unfortunately, Ms. Macdonald tries to include too many details and the last 150 pages are difficult to finish and more horrific than necessary.It has the feeling that things just aren't horrible enough and every gruesome detail needs to be revealed and forced upon you.I felt depressed by the overly sunny beginning to the completely shattered ending. No light is left glowing. The description of the murder was excessive & not truly believable. The description of the lead character's adult life was monotonous.There is something to the saying \\"Less is more\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story","review":"I liked everything about this book thought provoking made you think My kind of reading that I like to share"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"I enjoyed \\"Fall On Your Knees,\\" but \\"The Way the Crow Flies\\" may be the best novel I've read in a year or two. MacDonald employs much more than clever turns of phrase; her genius is obvious in every single page. Among her many devices is the precise insertion of quotes and lyrics which effects credibility and achieves a broad context that weaves historical events and culture into the fictional storyline. The drama is underscored by allowing the reader to be \\"all knowing.\\" Being privy to all the \\"secrets\\" pulled me into the plot and pushed me along with a desperation to reveal the information. The character driven, emotional storyline, is fraught with humor which is at once intelligent and silly.

It is about 200 pages too long. But I kept thinking it had to pick up, and I REALLY wanted to know what happened. Then it suddenly got worse and made little sense. But I kept plugging and chugging through. I almost wish I had stopped when the feeling first hit me. I rarely put a book down before finishing it but this one would have been a good choice for that distinction. The story is great but you have to read through lots and lots of unnecessary description of stuff.

Her characters are rich, settings are very well described. I did find that the book seemed to take on a less enjoyable storyline as Madeline became an adult. I didn't think that all of the lesbian turmoil was fitting, and was disappointed in that storyline. I guess it is a matter of personal preference, but lately I feel that gays are pushing their agenda in my face a little too much. I, too, wondered how the mystery would be solved, and though the reader is informed I am disappointed that the characters are not included in the revelation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to spread the word!","review":"This is one terrific book!

Yes this book is long, yes it is slow moving at the beginning and yes, it is annoying when an author sprinkles a foreign language into a book and does not give you the translation but I decided to continue reading. Why? I am not sure. Normally if a book does not grab my attention, I drop it like a hot potato since there are so many other good books (See my Listamania on books for all occassions) to read. For some obscure reason, the first hundred pages as boring as I found them to be lingered on my mind. Maybe it is not as boring as I think it is and maybe I will finish it.Once I have read the book I will come back and reevaluate my opinion.

Seven hundred and twenty pages and not a useless word.

I've been reading mysteries for years, and even though this book wouldn't necessarily be categorized as a mystery, I think it is one of the best mystery books I have quite possibly EVER come across. The book is pretty long, and I usually have a very low tolerance for books that just keep going and going, but I finished this book in two days. I just couldn't put it down. I started reading it at ten a.m. on a Saturday morning and I basically couldn't tear myself away from it until seven o'clock the following morning.

It gives concise, well-written reviews of both current and classic literature. I have chosen many new titles based on the reviews in BOOKMARKS, and have not once been disappointed. I often give this magazine as gift for graduations, birthdays, holidays. Every month they do an overview of an author: life, works, influences, and an analysis of the literature written. These articles are always an excellent read. This is a great beach/pool/summertime magazine. Also - a great resource for book clubs. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable magazine and wonderful resource","review":"I have been subscribing to this book magazine for over 2 years. During that time, I have been exposed to so many wonderful books and authors that I never would have heard of.Not only does the magazine cover fiction and novels, but it also covers other genres and interests as well.In every issue they interview a book club and the club shares what books they have loved or not liked so much. They also have a \\"have you read\\" section which interviews people on their favorite books.So if you want to increase your exposure to books you otherwise may have missed, this magazine is perfect. It's also enjoyable reading in and of itself. Their reviews have also saved me from reading books that I really wouldn't like after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bookmarks Magazine","review":"Cut through all the hype and use this to guide your bookbuying habits.

I read this and find TONS of books that I want to read. The only thing bad to come from this is the amount of money we have spent on books since we got it!

This might sound good, but unless you live under a rock, you've probably already seen the reviews. They only cover books that are already well publicized, so there's not much of a chance of learning about a more obscure title. Instead, you'll see numerous reviews of NY Times bestsellers, which becomes redundant. There are no surprises. In fact, Bookmarks is very similar to the newspaper style collection Book Pages found free at most libraries.For example, Freedom was heavily covered in Bookmarks, as well as everywhere else. But many other new titles, some much better IMHO were published at the same time. If you'd like to read about those, you have to dig deeper. The London Review of Books and/or The New York Review of Books are better values, as is The New Yorker magazine for variety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for book lovers","review":"Bookmark magazine is a great book review magazine. But not only are the reviews well written and insightful, there are usually very informative articles about various authors, both current and from years past. I particularly like the reviews because you get a cross section of what other reviewers have said about a book, in addition to the Bookmark review.My only concern is that Bookmark should be a monthly magazine. At times, by the time you get to read a review of a book, it has been out for several weeks already.Having said that, I still subscribe to this wonderful review of books and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great magazine!

Her third best album","review":"I like the intro, pick it up, make it good, got to be (check out the hot instrumental version on the Dap-Kings singles collection). Also really like Casella Walk, but -- on Sharon Jones' CD it's a 3 minute instrumental in a 10 minute track. The first seven minutes are blank. Really. Best to get it on the Dap-Kings singles CD, which is the same tune but in a 3 minute track. I'd say Naturally and 100 Nights are tied for her best. Get all three if you can, plus her Scion Sampler vol. 19 stuff and her songs on the Great Debater soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"the woman can sing!","review":"Very refreshing to hear a \\"new\\" singer sounding like one of the great soul vocalists from the 1970s. Of course, Sharon Jones is no sweet young thing who just burst upon the scene, but a singer who has paid her dues over the years. And man, can she sing! One of those vocalists who BELTS out a song and leaves you breathless. Sweet and sassy, fiery and funky; this is the real thing. And her band the Dap-Kings are VERY adept at playing their instruments; a tight band that knows where to place the groove. This was my first introduction to the music of Sharon Jones and I enjoyed it. Some of the songs might be a tad derivative, but all in all this is a most impressive performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"funk queen","review":"Wow this is real funk music.

No tricks, just solid information. I have purchased about two dozen of these for coaches and players who glanced through the book and simply had to have a copy of their own.

Their concepts are great. Both of them have a fundamental problem. I would return them but it is not worth my time or effort. The fundamental problem is that with the refrigerator motor, perhaps television being on or perhaps the microwave running you cannot hear the timer ringing. In most cases, it does not take much ambient sound to drown out the ringing of the timer. It is certainly not suitable for the kitchen. I would not recommend this timer's purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"West Bend Timer","review":"Unit is ok. I would not purchase another one.

It sold out quickly at all nearby booksellers-never to be reordered. \\"Fear Less\\" appears to be a hasty, ill-prepared response to the panic the author perceives to have followed the terrorism of 9/11. The book offers no more insight about paying attention to intuition and pre-incident indicators in order to avoid becoming a victim than it does protecting one from a random bird dropping while standing outdoors. The logic just doesn't hold water for the ordinary citizen in his examples. PLEASE READ \\"The Gift of Fear.\\" It should be required reading in all schools the world over. But \\"Fear Less?\\" Nah."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED!","review":"I finally got around to read the book when I was traveling.

He seems like a real classy guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE NEW RULES FOR A NEW TIME","review":"I found this to be so well written and on-target that I have already given three copies to people I know who have been particularly afraid since September. We get so many messages about danger and \\"the next attack,\\" but this is the first thing I've read that has an authoritative position on HOW to live these days, on what we can each do to protect ourselves. I started reading this at dinner, and I finsihed it by midnight. Glad I did, because now I know the inside way to interpret all the different messages and threats and warnings. It has really helped me make decisions about my family, and at work. It is the gift I'll be giving , to get a larger and larger group of people doing what this author suggests: Be part of the anti-terror network. The resources listed are helpful, but best was a chapter showing how different businesses in America might encounter terrorist conspiracies. This book is about stopping terrorism - not just waiting for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED!","review":"The first book I read from Mr. DeBecker was excellent.

I suffered with severe post traumatic stress and anxiety, but, thankfully, since reading Mr. de Becker's book, Fear Less, I again have the confidence and enthusiasm to do the job I love, and to know that I can have control and power in any situation.

I finished it in my normal reading time, but I came away with more, this book leaves an imprint, every last precaution I remember. There are to many details to mention, but they are both new and old with up to date solutions that I do know most Americans even now are unaware of. I believe books like this will be one tool to help us all get through this era of terrorism. Not everyone can read the book. But we can pass along the message, if you have the time and money to read it, do so, it will help you and others when you tell them of it, and you will tell your friends if you read it, that's for sure.With that I'd like to tell you about another book well worth it that mentions the terrorism and helps significantly, SB 1 or God By Karl Mark Maddox."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT, GREAT IN-DEPTH LOOK AT TERRORISM TODAY","review":"I learned more from this book than I did from watching 3 months of television and commentary shows.

If you like gossip, you'll love the book, its filled with seemy stories, but I'm left with the impression that the author has a hidden agenda that he failed to let us in on.

No one can particate in the activites that Mr. Burke claims to have participated in and be as angelic and innocent as he portrays himself to be. It appears as though he is trying to compare a filthy, classless, drugdealer(Senator Kennedy)and an innocent, babyfaced, ten year old choir boy(Burke).

Seriously, this season was bad...I'm not a Steph hater, but I don't think any contestant should be on the show again unless they do an All Stars episode..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Survivor Rip Off","review":"I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"I was somewhat disappointed in this collection, as I had not read anything by any of the authors other than Grisham, and was interested to see if there were any others whose novels I might enjoy. But although most of the stories were solid, and kept me insterested until the end, none of them had a very memorable or very satisfying conclusion. Moreover, at least two of the stories seemed to have no ending at all, rather, they just stopped. I wouldn't recommend this unless you already know that you're a fan of one or more of the authors, and even then, I would have to guess that their novels are better than what is found in this collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been So Good...","review":"This book sounded so promising when I bought it, that I was terribly disappointed when I actually read it. Most of the stories are devoid of any substance whatsoever. I know that they are short stories, but they should be gripping and compelling just like the novels written by the same authors. They weren't. On the upside, it turned me on to several authors of solid legal thrillers like Steve Martini and Jeremiah Healy. If you buy this book, plan on using it more as a reference for future purchases than a good read immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEGAL AUDIO BOOKS","review":"Having low vision and enjoying legal format, I purchased this. It is very slow as to the story line and a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Appalling! Abyssmal! The first few stories were so bad that I found myself writing derisive comments in the margins (something I don't generally do). Some of the later stories managed to achieve mediocrity, unremarkableness. But there are no interesting insights into the legal system here, no engrossing courtroom drama, no judicial puzzlers, no treatments of the important legal issues of our time.The most blameworthy of the stories is a ham-handed political tract, interspersed with awful *poetry* for heaven's sake. You can decide for yourself whether or not you want to be caught dead with a book that contains this:The President had gotten to Jersey Joe.Harvey'd been betrayed; a very low blow.He had many years to think about ethics.The age-old question: was it social or genetics?Gag..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it at all...","review":"I spent some money on these pens hoping that they would be of \\"better quality\\" than your average pen, since I was going to be taking so many notes. I wasted my time. All of the negative reviews are accurate. Does not write smoothly at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor decision","review":"I wanted a few good gel pens, and bought these on the strength of the uniball brand name. I regret this decision now, due to the poor writing these pens do. Yes, they function, but so far the one I have is worse than a usual cheapo BIC. It's scratchy, inconsistent, and will occasionally leave where I have just written completely blank. If you are looking for a nice ink pen, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pen - Comfortable Grip & Smooth Thin Line","review":"This has become my favorite pen in the office and I've ordered boxes of the same pen in blue, black, and red ink. The pen is a little thick so if you have average to larger size hands it really fits nicely in your hand. The grip is soft and comfortable without being too crazy looking or sponge like. Most importantly these pens just write so smoothly and crisply. There is never any gaps like you see with those cheap gel pens and the point is thin/fine enough for people like me who tend to write as small as possible to fit more on a page.The only problem with this pen is that it writes so well that people might end up stealing it or \\"purposely not returning it\\" when you leave it at their desk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST PEN FOR LEFT HANDED PEOPLE! (or just overall, not sure)","review":"I don't know how I got bargained into buying these horrible pens, but these are THE WORST GEL PENS THAT I EVER OWNED. I actually got a 2-pack for 1 dollar at Walgreens, but it wasn't worth it. I am so annoyed by these pens that I wrote a review on amazon to tell people not to get tricked into buying these terrible pens.Pros:-Look nice and grip is good.-I got a 2 pack for 1 dollarCons:-They only write on a perfectly hard leveled surface otherwise the ink skips on soft or wrinkled paper,etc-Once it skips, it makes the indentation, making it impossible to fill in with the same pens. I have used 10 cent pens that will fill in the indentation it skipped while the Uni-ball wouldn't.Because of those two flaws, it makes it the most aggravating pen I ever used. If you decide to buy this pen because of the savings, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Runs out of ink too quickly","review":"These pens might look good and write well for a short time, but there is a shockingly small amount of ink in each one.

I like them and they do the job without globbing up on the paper like some ballpoints do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"It is not very comfortable to write on these ball-pens. It is not very smooth at all. And I think I write very ugly using this ball pen. I do not recommend it, and the price is fairly high."},{"rating":"1","title":"A permanent pen that permanently sucks","review":"Upon using the first pen in my three pack I was ecstatic with how smoothly these pens wrote. Then half way into a word they would stop writing and instead leave a trace mark of the letters in my paper, with no ink. It would do this a few lines per page, so I began to think maybe its the paper. It wasn't. I tried other pens on the same pages and they wrote consistently. As all the other reviewers have said, that gave this one star, it likes to stop working, and that's the truth. It is extremely frustrating to be a college student and having messy haphazard notes because of a ill-made pen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jealous pens","review":"I got these pens for their security features but I found that these are very jealous pens. When you first get them they write wonderfully with very smooth and silky ink flows. If you put them into a drawer for week or so they will feel jealous and neglected and will not write well. Neglect them again and use other pens they will become very jealous and refuse to write at all. I have had over 10 of these pens in different colors and every one has stopped working after using only a small fraction of the available ink. All standard methods to revive the beginning relationship with its smooth and flowing line failed miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Not Write Consistently","review":"Terrible pen.

Maybe its because I don't use them regularly and the ink dries. Maybe it's my writing style.

Good price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Ink","review":"I bought a box and they run out of ink very quickly. I always lose pens long before they run out of ink. Not these. They are empty in a few weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed: requires scribbling and breaks easily","review":"I was disappointed with this product. I bought it because I wanted to have a pen that would write as soon as I picked it up every time. When the pens arrive they have a tiny cover over the tip so the first time you use it it does write immediately, however the cover is not reusable so if the pen then sits idle for a while, you have to scribble it for a bit before it will work. Perhaps I'm expecting too much.The second and more serious problem though, already two of the pens have broken. I am a fidgeter, but I'm not that mean to writing utensils, I've never had a mechanical pencil break on me, however these pens can't withstand my fidgeting. As another reviewer described, the very top of the pen breaks and comes out of the pen, so the whole thing becomes unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOP POPS OFF","review":"I love the looks of this pen but when you press down to write, the top pops off. This pen writes nice if you hold the top part down.The company must have quality control issues and I got a reject (4 pack). Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible luck with Uniball Gel Pens","review":"This pen looks beautiful but I've had terrible luck with these gel pens, including having brand new pens failing to deliver any ink, leaking pens, and gel ink only coming out intermittently from the tip. Based on my experiences with Uniball gel pens, I would never buy or use this product again. For gel pens, I prefer the super reliable and quality tip and feel of the Pilot G2 (I prefer the bold to the fine tip). Even the Bic Velocity Gel Pen is better pen than the Uniball."},{"rating":"2","title":"uni-ball Signo Gel 207 Check Fraud Preventing Pen-(Black Ink)","review":"I had bought one of these Signo pens early this year to use with our check book. I got the pen mainly because of the anti check washing capability with the gel used in this pen. Last year we had a check stolen out of are mailbox which had been washed and then forged with an amount of just under $500.00 which helped me decide to buy this pen. My wife and I both like the feel of the rubberized grip section in our hands and the easy flow of the gel when writing. We decided that since we both liked this pen that we bought this 12 pack (33950) and also the 8 Assorted color Signo 207 gel pens-8 pack (229171)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Single function failure","review":"The retractable tip is nice but a common feature. As is the comfort grip. The reality is, this is a pen. As a pen its sole function is to put ink on the page and this pen fails to do this. After the first 2 pens failed to write a consistent line I went to the third. My pages were full of ink-less indentations and angry ink-less scribbles on the margins. If I had to rely on this pen for anything that would be viewed by other professionals I certainly wouldn't have moved on to the 2nd or 3rd in the pack but chunked them into the trash at an even bigger. It is unbelievable that Uni-ball doesn't have better quality control over there products than this. A total waste of money, I would never buy these again and in fact tell others not to buy them quite regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writes nicely, but poorly built","review":"After much research, I landed on this pen for my office. It does write extremely smoothly and evenly.HOWEVER, after a few weeks of use, the top of the cylinder cracks and the \\"clicking\\" mechanism begins to pop-out making the pen unusable. That said, you won't have much use for the refills, since it is the pen itself that breaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pens","review":"Bought these over a year ago and I'm still using the same package. Still the same price (I see) with prime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Disappointed","review":"These pens came highly recommended, and I am entirely disappointed. The ink is inconsistent -- guaranteed that one+ letter in every sentence will be missing ink.

It is fairly easy to set up using two trees. The material is thin and lightweight, so it is great for hiking. However, the material is not the strongest and the part near the bag ripped a little bit.

It is falsely advertised as being able to hold 250 pounds. I weigh exactly 145.62 lbs (just went to the ER a few days ago and had it checked). This was a nice light hammock, but it snapped after maybe 1 hour of total use. These hammocks are light and poorly made, and you definitely get what you want for $15: crap.I repeat, do NOT buy this hammock! If you spend a little more money, you can get a hammock that is durable enough to last more than an hour of holding 145 pounds.I must admit though, it is possible mine was faulty. Apparently other people like it. It could be mine was just a hiccup.Still, this hammock does not hold 250 pounds, and shouldn't be used for extended periods of time like sleeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - the pictures show the tree slings...","review":"Just bought this and somewhat disappointed. The official pictures for the product (not the user submitted ones) clearly show the tree slings. The tree slings do NOT come with this product and cost about $15-$20 extra. So basically doubles the price of this product. Yes, I know the listing says \\"hammock hanging kit not included\\" but the picture clearly shows them. My fault I guess (buyer beware and all) but please don't include pictures of other products unless they are included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent, simple hammock.","review":"It seems like a very nice hammock, but I'm shocked at how simple the construction is. If I knew it was so easy to make these, I would've just made one myself for $6 in materials in 5 minutes on a sewing machine. All it is, is a sheet with the 2 short sides doubled over and sewn into sleeves for a bit of rope to go through. It's really that simple. Yes, they include metal hooks, but those are pointless extra weight because you're going to have to tie it to the tree anyway, so why lug around metal hooks? I feel just a little swindled because of how simple, cheap, and easy to make it is, while I paid $20 plus shipping. I should've made my own, but if you're not a do-it-yourself-er, then this would be a good buy for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical Hammock","review":"I was please with the quality of the product.

They are easy and quick to tie around any two tree's within a decent range and the hammock is surprisingly comfortable. Also amazing how strong it is. This is the best bet for quality/price unless you want to go up past $50, but you still aren't going to get much better than this.

I bought one for my fiancé and one for myself and we put them up immediately to start lounging. We then brought them camping with us and everyone that went with us (11 other people) had to have their turn in the hammock. I even had a few friends swinging in them. They are strong, dry fast (it rained on them) and are very comfortable. My fiancé took a two hour nap in one and I took I fell asleep while listening to friends in the other. The fact that the stuff sack is attached is very helpful.

Personally I plan on using tiedowns that I carry in my truck anyway. Bottom line. For a cheap good hammock. Buy this.

This includes use by two less than careful teenagers and their friends, who leave hammocks out in the rain for several days...The S-hooks have worked fine, although replacing them with a set of load-rated carabiners would probably make one feel more confident in the setup.I would buy this hammock again.

My wife and I were both enjoy the hammock and it seems to support at least 250 lbs when mounted correctly.It's only big enough for one person, however, and isn't pretty or warm.

First, this hammock does NOT come with tree straps as some reviewers have stated. It is simple to attach to a tree though. I used 550-paracord, tree straps, and even ratchet straps to attach this hammock to a tree with ease (I actually threw about 30-40 feet of paracord in the storage bag with the hammock and hung it with that for initial use). I immediately took this hammock on a 3-day survival trip, and it withstood the elements and packed away lightweight and in the very small bag that is attached to the hammock itself and doubles as storage while the hammock is in use (I put a 11\\" knife in it to ward off coyotes or snakes and to cut wood at night for the fire, and it fit easily).

I ended up buying two different straps, because the first one I ordered after buying the hammock wasn't long enough for the distances between trees in my backyard.That being said, the hammock is OK.

Using slip knot's (with the carabiner holding it in place) it takes about 30 seconds to set up, and only one piece of rope (or paracord) required.The rope that hangs between the attach points is perfect for setting up a tarp or mosquito netting.

First off, prepare yourself because this hammock does not come with anything to hang it with. You need separate lines to use because it only comes with S-hooks at either end. Secondly and mostly importantly if you do end up buying it you really GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. After two days of light use I (a 150 lbs male) fell straight through it when I went to lay down one morning while camping. So despite its claim it can take up to 250 lbs. I wouldn't trust it with anyone over 100 lbs.

No more than 10 minutes on it, I went to turn my body and the entire hammock split right down the middle. Thud! Hit the ground. Granted I wasn't hurt and my buddies and I had a good laugh out of it for the next half hour, while I was setting a sleeping spot on the hard ground, I was very disappointed with this. It had some great reviews. And no, I ain't a lard ass, I weigh about 150 lbs. Checked my pockets to see if I had a knife or something sharp on me that would have cut the hammock, but I was clean.

It isn't very wide but you'll find that you simply don't need to toss and turn in the night if you use a hammock because there are no pressure points on your body. Its light weight, folds into its sack easily and dries quickly. When you compare this hammock to the more expensive models, I'd pick this one every time. It does need a little modifications.

Instead of looking at things objectively, the contributors to this book unveil their assumptions and their beliefs- regardless of what evidence they might find.Contributors and authors insult and degrade the scientists who interpret the evidence differently.

It is a common practice for companies to raise money quickly by doing what is referred to as \\"harvest the company\\". In industry to harvest the company you stop doing maintenance on equipment, stop hiring young employees, stop all training programs, stop quality controls, and make your product as cheap as you can. It makes your company look very good on the bottom line for a short time. If I owned a lot of stock in a company and was ready to sell it I would do the same thing. I have no problem with companies going off sure to make there product as long as the quality remains the same. But this is not the case with Levi's they are cutting corners however they can even to the point of eliminating two belt loops. How cheap can they be? I very seldom return items, but I am returning the 505 jeans and I will find another brand after wearing Levi's for over 40 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same as the old 505s","review":"I have a pair of Levi's 505 regular fit that are great.

Not only did they change the fit, the increased the size of the back pockets so my wallet now rides down my leg. I can no longer carry my wallet in these jeans...therefore I will no longer buy these jeans.And 1 other comment - anybody notice Levis reduced the amount of belt loops from 7 to 5 a few years back? Another annoyance (cost savings) that I think changed the look and feel (I wear a belt so now the belt rides up a bit).It's a shame marketing folks don't learn from old mistakes...it's business 101. and if you don't know what I'm talking about, look up \\"New Coke\\".Off to buy some crappier jeans (Old Navy? Wrangler?) but at least they'll fit..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are these really Levi's!? Would NOT buy again","review":"These can't be real Levi's?!; the fabric is thin as a handkerchief and the stitching is cheap single stitched cotton thread.

Costs more to ship back from here overseas than the jeans cost.Very disappointed in Amazon because these were sold through Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the name remains the same","review":"These Levi's 505 jeans that I bought for my husband fit nothing like his old 505's do. He has always loved this style, but the styling has been changed so that the same size that once fit him like a glove is now at least 1\\" and probably 2\\" too big in the waist, and the rise is shorter by the same amount. If they wanted to make a new style, then, OK, but don't call 'em 505's!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Levis, but they don't make 'em like they used to","review":"They are still Levis at least... but they don't make 'em like they used to, that's for sure. These were made in some other random country, not the US of A. They seem to be of a bit different material and cut than my older Levis. I kind of like the slightly stretchier material and lower beltline... but they do fit differently. I don't think there are fewer belt loops, but it's like the actual belt loop area is wider than just below it, so the belt is really required and kind of pulls at the loops - weird and not as good in that respect as my older Levis. Would I buy these again? Maybe, but I will check the brick and mortar stores to see if they have globally changed - I'd rather have the old versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"ex-levi customer","review":"These pants are unacceptable. lightweight denim will not stand up. crotch is cut all wrong.

Sadly, it probably won't ne made in the USA.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalled","review":"I have been buying exclusively levi jeans for over 45 years.

I have bought my last pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality for Levi","review":"I bought several pairs of these jeans for my husband last year in 2009 and I can say that I am very disappointed with the quality. The material is very thin and I have had to put patches on the pockets and fix all of the belt loops because the material is thin and they have pulled away. The hem in the bottom of the pant legs have all started to fray as well. We have always purchased Levi jeans for him to work in and they have always held up well (years) not months. But I have never had to fix so many problems before. Do not buy these if you intend to work in them every day, they will not last. Very POOR quaility. Shame on Levi. I will be looking for Jeans made here in America from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spring '10: New fabric = junk!","review":"Absolute junk! I've noticed a decline in the quality over the last decade, i.e. the pocket stitching actually pulling away from the pant and making holes within months. But the new denim fabric is probably half the weight / thickness as it was for last year's 505s. I've been wearing 505s for construction since the early 80s. The new \\"denim\\" feels less substantial than their Dockers line. Levi, you've lost a 30+ year (once dedicated) customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is that odor?","review":"I bought these thinking 'What a nice color'. Little did I realise that the dye used for this color has a really unpleasant smell. I washed them repeatedly in my very efficient and eco-friendly Asko washer, but the smell remained. If the jeans were mixed with other laundry, the odor would contaminate the other clothes. So, they were returned to Amazon. Thankfully, they accepted them.(This, in many years of online purchase, has been my only return).I wish I could say something better, but the truth must be told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Levis 505 House Cat","review":"The color and texture is fine but the size is totally different from the original 30x30. I use to wear 505's in size 30x30 and they fit and feel different.

They don't have quality standards as other jeans brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHRINKS! 505 Straight Fit Jean, Tumbled Stretch color","review":"I haven't seen this problem with any of the other reviews so I suspect it may be related to the color/fabric \\"Tumbled Stretch.\\" When washed they shrank down a good two sizes, at least two inches smaller in the waist and the length. Hoping amazon will let me return them because my boyfriend can't wear them and they're even too small for me. Shrinking two whole sizes is just a bit too much to be normal.I would give the pants another shot in another color/fabric because before washing they fit perfectly. A little stiff like too much starch but perfectly. Then again, we picked out the straight fit because the pants he's worn through were the same brand and style which is the only reason we ordered them online."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL LEVIS","review":"INCREDIBLY AWFUL pair of Levis.

There is absolutely no quality in this product....hopefully others will read this and refrain from wasting their money.

Levis was recently bought and since has tried to change their look to appeal to the younger crowd. They messed with just about every type of jeans except the 501 but that has button fly and I prefer a zipper fly. The fit is super low rise on these 505 and every time I sit my backside shows and I can't stand it. My old 505s did not do this. The material is now super low quality and is not worth the price I paid for them. They shrink uncontrollably and now they are short at the leg opening exposing my ankle.

That, combined with the use of a much lighter weight denim, make these a waste of money at $40 dollars.

That's going to change once my current pair-bought at the flagship Levi's store in San Francisco, no less-finally gives up the ghost. The switch from \\"regular\\" fit to \\"straight\\" fit means 505's are now completely different pants. The waist is easily two inches lower on your hips, the circumference of the legs probably two inches less, too. If you're not a malnourished punk rock musician with no butt, you're going to look like ridiculous in these pants. And you'll feel ridiculous, too.

The first thing I did was throw them in the wash. More bad news, they bled so badly that the rest of the wash was stained blue! I had to run the wash several more times. The good news is that the pants didn't stink anymore, the bad news is that several articles of light colored clothing were ruined.On the bright side, they fit well and look good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Like Them","review":"You can't beat the classic fit and sturdy tailoring of a pair of Levi's.

However, these pants are way too tight on the thighs - especially when sitting down, and it makes the length appear much shorter because of it. I though about keeping them, but I cannot put up with the tightness at the thighs.

Seems that Levi Strauss is trying to lure in a new demographic (that like to have that modern everything exposed cut) at the expense of long term customers. Bad corporate decision making. Recommend that folks looking for the old 505 cut try the Austin jean if they can get them.

Their longevity is a testament to Levis. I bought these jeans without trying them on...why would I? They are the same jeans I have been wearing for decades. When I finally tried them on at home I thought I had returned to the 70's. They are very low rise jeans - the only thing missing was the 10 inch wide bell bottoms. The genius who decided to ruin a classic rather than simply introduce a new lower cut style, has probably destroyed relationships with thousands of life-long customers. I will return these jeans but never return to Levis until someone undoes a huge mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these Jeans","review":"The price was great, the shipping was fast and I love the Jeans.

The new ones seemed to feel 'rigid' in the material used. I washed them many times, and they are still not comfortable. Also they are 'baggy' in the thigh area.

No such luck! The new ones have less room from the crotch up, the stitching is shoddier, the belt loops are narrower and the cloth is thinner and less robust. In fact my two year old 505 Levis that have been washed countless times have thicker cloth than the brand new ones that have never been washed.What really bugs me is the fit above the crotch. It's more or less okay when I wear a shirt. In the summer with a skimpy shirt or no shirt, the crack of my a.. will show and that's really low class - even for females, which I am not one of.I am going to look at Carhartt the next time I need jeans.

There use to be 2 additional belt loops as I remember than there are now, I find the belt slipping over the jeans because of this cut back.I am and have been an avid Levi fan, would purchase/wear no other jeans, however, now I find myself looking for a suitable replacement so I can enjoy the quality that Levi once had.

I am still wearing Levi jeans, but with much disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Fit","review":"I used to love Levis, but now they have gone with a thinner material, fewer belt loops, and the fit seems to have changed as well. They feel cheap and thin. A belt doesn't hold them up evenly all the way around, there are 2 loops in front, 2 at the side, and only 1 in the back at the center. The effect is that you feel like your wearing a constant wedgy. Not to mention how they are charging more for these now.

I have in the past noted some variation in Levi's sizing from one batch to another -- some are tighter and some are looser -- but the basic shape has always been consistent. These recent jeans are ridiculous. They aren't cut the same way at all. The waist requires a tight belt to stay up, and bunches up under the belt, and the seat is flat and tight. Uncomfortable and unattractive.Levi's needs to fix this or they will lose many customers. I would think that the online outfits like Amazon would pressure them to improve quality control, because people order things online that they are confident will fit. If you can't trust consistency of sizing, folks will have to go to local retailers to try the clothes on first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"These are not the Levi's Jeans you were used to.

I have always been pleased with Levi's products and was very saddened and disappointed when I tried on the pair I bought through Amazon.com.Everything about them appears to have deteriorated in 12 years. I can only attribute the cause of it to the fact that Levi's have to cut costs everywhere in order to satisfy the demands of their Shareholders for more and more dividends in the face of ever increasing competition.Levi's have lost my custom as far as ordering over the Internet is concerned. At least in a Shop I can see when they are not what I am looking for and leave them.

The jeans ordererd through Amazon were a completely different fit. The ones in the store were made in Nicaragua and the Amazon jeans were made in Egypt.

Also a bit of sticker shock at how much prices seem to have gone up in the last couple of years. Last pair I bought was at a Sam's Club maybe 12-18 months ago for $27. Never minded paying a bit of a premium for Levi's in the past compared to other brands but even if they hadn't changed the cut, I'm not so sure they'd be worth the $40-$50 prices I'm seeing now, especially if they're being made in some offshore sweatshop. I never thought of these as designer jeans; I just liked the quality and fit. Guess the company feels that it's not profitable enough to also cater to the adult market. Good luck to them.

I never owned a pair of those and probably would not have owned a pair based on the other gentlemen's opinions. I prefer a lower rise because I do not wear my jeans up to my belly button. I also monitor eat healthy and exercise regularly, so a slightly trimmer fit is more appealing. It also sounds like a lot of these gentleman complaining have a relatively large midsection compared to their height, so perhaps that is the problem. My opinion of the 505's is that they are a nice straight fit, not too tight like slim and not baggy like relaxed, with a moderate opening at the bottom, not as big as bootcut but not tapered too tight. These are my first Levis since middle school and I am impressed. Modern fit while still comfortable.

I've been wearing Levi's 505 as long as I can recall. The move to overseas production has really hosed up the quality of these jeans, though. And they are terribly, terribly inconsistent. In the most recent instance, I ordered two pairs from the same seller through Amazon, in different colors. What I've noticed over the last few years is that different colors appear to be made by different foreign factories -- some in Mexico, some in China, some in Bangladesh, etc. And depending on where they are made, the weight of the fabric and the actual fit is quite inconsistent. When I order these things, I want/expect them to fit the same way, every color, every time. Not an unreasonable expectation, I think. Levi Strauss was able to achieve this for quite a number of years.

Therefore you buy the jeans thinking it is the old style but it is not, this one is supposed to be a hip hugger jean I guess. Why Levis did not just come up with another number for these lowriders I do not know, but what you get with the new 505 is not what you are going to like wearing.I finally went with the Premium Performance Wrangler regular fit and it is fine. Too bad since I have worn Levis for many years, but no more. Plus the lack of rivets in the back, lack of belt loops. Just not a good product anymore.They say other Levi jeans will work, they do not work so I can only recommend to the buyers here to try them on at a local store before you buy a Levis product and be sure it is really what you want.LDW120"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Straight Fit!!","review":"I avoided Levi's \\"Regular\\" jeans for many years due to the long rise \\"mom\\" jean look.

None fit like the old 505's I have. They were all about 2 inches larger in the waist and about 2 inches too long in the legs, and the bottom of the zipper is too low in the crotch causing the jeans to poke out like you have two or three pairs f socks in your underware. What a shame for a company that used to be known for providing great fitting jeans. I purchased a new pair of Wranglers and they fit the old 505's. It is a sad day when someone who has been wearing Levi jeans since the early 60's has to start buying Wranglers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redesigned to fit poorly","review":"I have purchased Levi's 505 Regular Fit for 35 years. Much to my dismay, the most recent purchase I made turned out to be the newly improved Straight Fit. I couldn't figure out why they kept falling down. When I called Levi's said they would replace the pair I bought with a pair a waist size smaller. They seem to think if my pants are tighter it will keep them from falling off. Since I work in these jeans, moving around constantly, I like some ease of movement within the garment.The redesign from Regular Fit to Straight Fit consists of shortening the rise from the top of the inseam to the waistband. I think it might be shortened as much as 2 or 2.5 inches. This makes it so the pants no longer sit at the waist, slightly above the hip bone which used to keep them from falling off.I am very disappointed in the new pants.My rating is really 0 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Death of Yet Another Great American Brand.","review":"I'm completely exasperated, disgusted and hopeless. These are entirely unacceptable. There's nothing \\"good old blue\\" about them. They're made of poor quality \\"denim\\" that bears no resemblance to Levi's good old denim. They look cheap and greasy, like some off-brand discount junk. In addition, they don't fit. They're almost 2 inches smaller than the stated waist size, as compared with the Levi's 505's of a couple of years ago. They're essentially hip-huggers--no room in the crotch. Worst, they're made in China. I'll spare the essay on Chinese trade and labor practices and simply remind readers of the frequent, nay, routine problems with the quality of Chinese-made goods, of which these are a prime example. I've trusted Levi's for over 40 years and have worn 505's since the 70's. No more. These represent the death of yet another great American brand.

The material is *much* thinner than it was even a couple years ago, and overall they look like flimsy knockoff copies of the genuine article. If you are considering buying these, don't just take my word for it, look at the other reviews that discuss the dramatic recent drop in quality; ignore these only at your own peril, like I foolishly did. The only consolation is that for $22 a piece, they are not such a bad deal for generic casual pants and as such I will probably not endure the hassle of returning them, but had I paid anything close to list price I would have felt royally ripped-off.

This was verified by a Levis rep I met at Macys. Guess they figure to save money by using less material. This is not just from Amazon but all original 505s are pretty much gone.

I learn it is necessary to consider the fit type, not only the size which is a bit strange as my old pair of Levi's 555 (33*30)(not currently available) were ok. The fabric is thick and there is not complaint about the material but the sizing is a bit tricky. Sizes across the different fits should be ok but it seems not.

They look nice. Just don't jump, squat, climb, run fast, leap, dance, ride a bike, or any other physical activity. I thought I had gotten a defective pair, but four pairs from different stores tore in the exact same place in less than a month of wear. Such a shame for what was once a great product. I'll stick to Wranglers which don't look nearly as good as Levi's but they last forever at half the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Richard","review":"The denim material is fine but the pants have too few belt loops, which causes the pants to sag in the back when you wear them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwanted Change in Cut","review":"Levi's thinks they can change the cut and quality of their jeans without losing customers.

I guess that I was expecting a bird guide that helped me identify species etc., something like a field guide. This is not such a book. If you already have identification books, or are already able to identify east asian birds, then this book will tell you the hot spots and help you plan a birding trip. It's got maps, useful vocab, and lots of other information about the surrounding areas of some good birding locations.

Deeply disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not just a history","review":"The authors did a reasonable job, the book is organized and readable, they just shouldn't have presented their expository as an objective history. It is simply an LDS primer with historical context. This book is not balanced and objective. While it does point out the controversies surrounding the religion, it tends to slide right on by rather than really address those issues. The preface actually points out the real purpose of the book, \\"The aim of this book is to explain how Mormons feel about their religion and how they hold on to their faith in the modern era.\\" With that the real purpose, the subtitle, \\"A History...\\" should have been left off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe you will happier if you change?","review":"The light-hearted descriptions of the contributors makes this an entertaining read- and more interestingly contributor Shauna Marsh's popular online [...] reveal the simultaneously secretive and extroverted dual-identity of a blogger for whom weight loss is both a public and private journey.

They would never let her forget she had been the mistress of the infamous savage warrior, Gray Eagle. As if the auburn-haired beauty could forget! Each night, Alisha sweetly remembered Gray Eagle's bold caresses, burning kisses, his blazing passion. Each day, she scanned the vast horizon in hopes her Oglala brave would recapture her. Then one day, as she beheld the blue skies of the wild frontier, Alisha saw hundreds of Indian warriors riding to the gates of Fort Pierre -- and at their head was the fierce Gray Eagle. Though her most fervent prayers had been answered, Alisha's heart skipped a beat: would Gray Eagle destroy her -- or make her destiny his own?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a book about wars and weapons","review":"I like to see those old style and modern style weapons all together in this book.

Easy reading, without too many superfluous details - just the highlights and parts the average person needs to know. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Informative","review":"This is a very interesting and informative book. It should be given to anyone interested in professional sports, especially people of color. The story told in this novel is about a man who willingly gave his time and expertise to potential professional atheletes. He stood by them during the down times and continuously encouraged them to strive for excellence. It is clear Dr. Mc Afee is a man not willing to give up his principles or morals. However, when it came down to getting the \\"BIG CONTRACT\\", the athlete choose to go with another agent due to the current agent being of color; the athelete did not show any loyalty to the man who saw you through the dark periods. Dr. Mc Afee did not let discrimation discourage him from fighting for his clients to the best of his abilities. That alone should let the potential athelete know the AGENT is looking to make $$$ and not truly concerned with the athelete after his playing days are finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening and Educational","review":"This book brings to the forefront what really happens in this country's divided society. It reaches across many levels of occupations and makes you realize that minorities have not advanced as far as they could in America. Dr. McAfee captures your interest from the beginning of FOUR GENERATIONS OF COLOR as he carries you back to his childhood in Atlanta, Georgia. Throughout his life's story he heightens your awareness of what togetherness as a race would mean in family, business, and sports. I highly recommend this book.

I would even say that Kenyon and Owens are on my \\"must buy\\" list when their new books come out. However, I was disappointed to spend this much money on this little content. Minimal plots, and in Owens' case, rehashing of previous ideas (from her \\"Heart\\" series -- Fam cats)led to, at best, an OK read, and at worst, just plain confusing or boring reading. I suggest borrowing the book from a friend or library and save your money for the authors' next novels. I will admit that I may be a harsher critic than most; I'm a fast reader and I've read so many books (romance, horror, fantasy, science fiction, nonfiction, etc.)over the years that my tolerance toward an average to below-average read has flagged recently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quantity doesn't equal quality","review":"If the sign of a good book is having lots of pages, I'm sure that this would be the best sales book on the market.

If I followed Brian Tracy's advice on Pareto's Law, then I'd be frustrated looking for the 20% of the content that is actually useful. This is Brian's worst sales book by far, and not a book I would recommend to anyone, let alone someone just starting out in sales.It would be a better book if he cut the fluff by 75% and got to the point.

However, if the person you are calling wants to hear you using the speaker, you have to raise your voice and put your mouth practically on the phone, which defeats the use of the speaker option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fred","review":"We were misled by other reviews of this product. While it does have the features claimed, the fidelity of the message system (digital, ie not the old fashioned analog tape style) is barely acceptable. We've had several who know us claim that our greeting/announcement sounds nothing at all like us. The messages others leave for us have been similarly garbled. The kicker (and not anticipated) is that, while the phone does work in the absence of power, there is a very annoying hum present. We specifically purchased a corded line to ensure the best sound possible (our previous corded phone gave us just that, but it is no longer made. Btw the analog tape message system provided TONS more clarity). This phone does only marginally better than our cordless, and the sound is pretty stinky when the power goes out. Not a good product, in our view."},{"rating":"1","title":"LCD Display Failure","review":"Everything on this phone is fine, though I can't comment on the digital answering component on this model because I use my telephone service provider's voicemail.

The only way to end a call is to disconnect it from the wall. It has other drawbacks such as the unreadable display and the less-than-crystal-clear message quality, but we could get along with those. A waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I got it...","review":"What I needed was a corded phone with which I could also use a headset. I bought the recommended Panasonic KX-TCA60 headset at the same time and they have worked perfectly together. I have a desk lamp, so the non-backlit readout is no problem for me. The keypad has a great feel and is easy to use. I find that I have had to keep the user's manual handy in order to use several of the phone's functions, which means that the layout is not totally intuitive in terms of programming the phonebook, etc. But I think overall this phone is a good machine at a decent price. I'm glad I got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"does what it needs to do","review":"Very good phone. My only complaint with this phone is the speakerphone sound quality. I don't get complaints from those I'm talking to, but they don't sound all that great. Same goes for the answering machine playback quality. Sometimes hard to make out what the person on the other end is saying.

Well, this is the perfect answer; and speaking of answers, this phone is also an answering machine, so you won't miss that message from mom, or your brother asking for money. And it's a Panasonic, so you know the company won't be out of business next month when you need tech help or warranty service. All in all, a good choice. And the price is reasonable for a premium quality phone. You won't be disapppointed here. Thumbs up..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and money.","review":"First few months this phone worked fine, then it started turning itself off. The only way to bring it back to life was to pull out and re-insert the power cable. Then the answering machine started failing, every time you deleted messages you didn't get all your recording minutes back. Finally even when I deleted all the messages it said the answering machine was full. I then disabled the useless answering machine function and oddly enough the phone stopped turning itself off. Save yourself some grief and try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good office phone","review":"This phone replaced one whose brand name was licensed from a big phone company. I found its speakerphone useless because it cut off soft voices, common when the other side was also on a speakerphone. The Panasonic is far superior; now I can participate in big conference calls with my hands really free. I also has a handy call duration display, useful in my billable-hours work. Overall the whole thing just feels well thought out, while the other one felt like a rush job in need of new firmware. Slight nit: It would be nice if the answering machine's remote access code were more than two digits long."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective product, bad customer service","review":"The phone's answering system did not work.

Each individual incoming message can be no longer than 3 minutes. When listening to messages remotely you have to hit 6 key strokes to delete a message. There is no battery backup, so whenever there is a power outage you have to reprogram everything. The message screen is not back lit.Update: The incoming message feature stopped working Jan 2013 so I did get over 5 years usage. However, I did not like it enough to replace it with the same one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing sound quality","review":"When the tape recorder on our old reliable Panasonic phone died, I replaced it with this new all-digital model because of Panasonic's reputation and since few manufacturers make basic corded phones any longer. Unfortunately, the sound quality is poor and when someone is on another phone at the same time, its volume drops off considerably and cannot be increased. Another annoyance is that it has no back-up battery so that the clock must be reset if there's a power interruption - unless you also have CallerID. The answering machine is simple to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"No conf call capability, no answerer for the 2nd line, no choice of ringers","review":"The description lists 3-way conf call; which it does nto have. I called Panasonic and they confirmed this.There is no choice of ringers, which is strange.There is no answering machine capability for the 2nd line. I needed to activate home voice mail on my home line which defeated the purpose of having an answering machine.Also, if you have the headset plugged in, you HAVE to use the headset.

This phone fits the bill. I have been using it for over a year with no issues and have bought two more. The speaker is good to about 7 or 8 feet away from the phone. I can work hands free and talk at the same time. I also got a headphone to use with long meetings."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice features, simple design","review":"I was looking for a simple phone with answering machine and this was one of the few options out there. I selected it because it has a nice streamlined keypad system - where other models had a mess of individual buttons for lots of functions I didn't need. So far, I am quite happy with this phone. It is very easy to use and has clear sound. I did have to get one of those dsl phone filters because there was a slight background noise on the phone - but since putting on the $4.99 Radio Shack dsl filter it sounds and works great. The one thing I would change is the message storage time. It only holds 15 mins worth of messages so if you have long-winded callers you need to clear out the messages regularly. Overall though, I am quite pleased with this phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone for home business","review":"This speakerphone works great even if you don't need the answering system.

It did not take long to receive the package from Amazon. I purchased the phone to better store phone numbers which had more than the standard 10 digits. The phone's memory allows for 32 digits which is very helpful if making international calls or using the pin number from a phone card. The only drawback that I've experienced is the lack of back light for the display. You need to turn on the light from the room to see who is calling because you simply can't see it from the display. Overall, pleased with the phone and the time it took to receive the item from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"Very short cord on the handset, I keep knocking it off of the desk when I try to answer it, the cord doesn't stretch far enough. I've recorded my greeting at least five times and everyone says that it's not loud enough to hear. the amount of missed calls doesn't delete so that when you check, you don't know if you missed any or not. I guess I could write down the number on the set and then see if it increased, but I think that would be annoying after a while. There doesn't seem to be any volume control on incoming calls, if someone is talking very loud you just have to endure it. I find this very cheaply made, with a lot of features that I won't use and a lot of problems with the features that I will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounded interesting; very disappointed","review":"How interesting - a six foot tall, slightly clumsy woman and the rake who loved her.

Not that it was anything more than kisses-- but I kept wishing he would just leave her alone a while.The rest of the story, even the side romances of others did not capture my attention.

It is sturdy and powerful, but what I don't like about it is that when you have it in it's normal, straight position and push hard on the end of it to put pressure on the the screw that you are trying to put in or take out, the screw driver collapses into it's bent, L shaped orientation. There is no way to lock it into a straight orientation. Frustrating. Also it didn't come with a normal screw attachment, only one for Philips screws.

The Hitachi has plenty of torque, an almost useful LED to light what you're doing, and the bits change easily. It does not have variable speed, so it is somewhat difficult to use in certain situations. My biggest complaint is that after about 1.5 years, the unit failed. First, the tool began to work intermittently (motor? switch?), so just when you get it positioned and ready to use, nothing happened. Finally, the clutch completely stripped. I don't suppose that I'll get another of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever powered screwdriver","review":"I use powered screwdrivers professionally at work.

The Li-ion is supposed to self discharge only 6%/year if unused versus 6%/month for the Nickel metal Hydride battery. The B & D is a piece of junk compared to this Hitachi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little tool! Well built, comfy, light, powerful","review":"Similar to the panasonic/milwaukee 3.6v driver but better. It is a little bigger but not much, grips better due to the nice rubber nubs in the grip, has an LED that can be turned on or off, and a nice size forward and reverse thumb switch. It has a quick release chuck that holds the bit unlike the others I mentioned, so your bits don't fall out. I own the milwaukee also, so I know of which I speak. Full range clutch that can even do light drilling. Comes with a nice charger and TWO batteries. Again, beats the others in overall value and features. Well built and ergonomically excellent.

It's the only one I've used so I don't have anything to compare it to but I do have one complaint. It is actually too powerful. On the low setting it has so much speed and torque that it doesn't stop as soon as you take your finger off the trigger. It's pretty hard to use for delicate screws. Sure you can set the clutch but then you are between too loose and overdoing it.It works fine for regular screws and even drives/removes large wood screws. You just have to be careful turning the thing over to the wife or you may be finding ways to fix all the stripped fastners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitachi 3.6V LI-Ion Cordless Drill","review":"Great little tool for a professional.

Currently, I use duct tape to tape my most used drivers and drill bits."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed.","review":"I was surprised to find that the drill comes with a case and extra battery but only one bit. Why would you sell a power tool with only one bit. And its a Phillips head bit. That's like buying a car but they give you no gas in the tank. I just expected it to have a few bits.

I looked at the new Makita but for half the price the Hitachi was the winner hands down. This was the most cost effective screwdriver on the market that met my needs. Saves my wrists every time I use it when high speed drivers are not practical and you need point control when working in electrical panels.Only draw back that makes it a 4 star is that the switch is very sensitive.

Very practical and thought-provoking advice. Tends to focus on little worst-case scenarios in an attempt to get people to plan properly for all the things that can go wrong in an estate.For what it's worth, I thought the book was generally best-suited for estates with $100,000 to about $2,000,000 in assets. Don't get me wrong, there's something in here for all estate sizes - especially for people just starting the process of developing a plan. However, don't buy this book looking for technical discussions of advanced tax-minimizing strategies. If you or your clients have estates over this $2MM mark, this book can be a great thought-provoker, but some of the advice isn't really suitable for larger estates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wodehouse is uncharacteristically dull","review":"This is the forerunner to all those glorious Psmith books.

Possibly for it's target audience (young English boys) it works well, I'm in no position to say. Given the very large number of books by Wodehouse that are superb, there seems not much reason to bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"Unofortunately, enthusastic reviews led me to expect more than Masie Dobbs could deliver. I bought the book in anticipation of ingenious plotting and interesting characters, overhashadowed by the Great War and all that implies. Unfortunately what I got was a strained plot, a relentlessly plucky heroine and a collection of characters right out of central casting. Devices used to create suspense were lamentably lame - one irritating example: for several chapters the author elects not to reveal an object found at the scene of the murders, but anyone who paid even the slightest attention to the title of the book is unlikely to be fooled.The one saving grace was the portrait of the time, inter-war England, complete with economic hardship, class distinctions and manners of the period. But it's hard not to think of Dorothy Sayers who did it so much better, with infinitely more subtleties of plot and character.\\"Birds of a Feather\\", a pleasant, light read.

I found it difficult to get into. As others have noted, Maisie seemed a bit too perfect, a bit too \\"lucky\\"--her own flat in Belgravia, her own detective agency, in the 1930s??? And the slimness, forgetting to eat, the MG. But somehow over the novel she grew on me. When the story ended I wanted to find out what happened next. Who does she decide to date? What happens with her relationship with her father? And so I have ordered four more Maisie Dobbs books, as well as the latest Charles Todd. Because charming as she is, she is nowhere in his class. His writing is deep, deeply felt, his characters dramatic where Maisie could well turn out to be--ummm--fluffy. But if she is fluffy then it's a nice cozy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"London in 1930","review":"This is an interesting story, but the writing style was not really to my taste.

Her domineering father, who wants her at home, hires Maisie to find her. The case would seem to be a simple case of finding a missing person, but murders are involved, and Maisie finds herself drawn back to events in the Great War where she and Billy had both served.The story has a lot of background color (details of the time period) and reveals a lot about both Maisie and Billy. Maisie finds out some things about Billy. Maisie also acquires a new man in her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging Mystery in the Aftermath of WW I","review":"The Maisie Dobbs series all reflect the devastating long term effects of WW I.

Being an extremely cultured and learned person, Mr. Ardagh delves into German culture, history, geography, politics and, Economy, painting a vivid portrait that is at times sympathetic and at times critical of the German people.

They covered a fair amount of epidoes with this CD.One parent addressed the issue of Ming-Ming's speech impediment...I'm sure the show was trying to be endearing, but rather than view it as a negative, I prefer to think of it as a way to show children that not everyone is perfect, and there's nothing wrong with being different.(I've worked with students who have speech impediments, and it wasn't because of something they saw on TV.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read description","review":"Well the service and the delivery time was excellent but the product description is off.

Along with some math books from Singapore(sgbox.com), and a learn-to-read series called \\"Now I'm Reading\\" by Nora Gaydos, these books are a great experience for your child. After your child has finished reading and they climb in bed, give your child something to strive for... turn on your booklight, turn off the room lights, and read your child a chapter or two from a more advanced book.

No, they are not the greatest of musicians but their ability to compose great metal is truly something special. As crazy as it sounds, this is one of the best live performances I have ever heard. The sound quality is raw, but what else would you expect from Venom; Production from Bob Rock? All of the pieces of music are performed well. The guitar solo on disc 1 is wicked and makes you wonder if Mantas was on acid when he performed it. The best songs on this double disc set include \\"The seven gates of Hell\\", \\"Nightmare\\", \\"Die hard\\", \\"In nomine Satanas\\", \\"Black metal\\", \\"Fly trap\\", \\"Warhead\\", and \\"Buried alive\\". The versions on this album, in my opinion are performed better than the studio versions found on their first four albums.

But where she really falls down is on her renditions of classical pieces. Thinking that she might have finally learned some bel canto coloratura technique, I bought her \\"Bell Song\\" track. Oy, what a disappointment!Tryon's \\"Bell Song\\" rendition of this album is painful to listen to. For starters, its tempo is slowed way WAY down to compensate for Tryon's lack of coloratura ability. But even so, nothing can compensate for bad technique, and Tryon clearly has no knowledge of how to do coloratura singing. Her runs sound like they are squeaked out so forcefully that they must have caused her pain when she sang them.She hits the notes, even if not very securely at times. So she's not quite at the Florence Foster Jenkins level of awful, but Tryon's \\"Bell Song\\" just one level up from FFJ's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I have been trying to find out how to introduce my son to black history.

The writing was very jerky, as if he had someone else flesh out the story line. It was not completely his style of writing. It did have his usual medical jargon, explained for the lay person, and his usual twists and turns in his plots and sub-plots. Some of it was slightly unbelievable, especially the cemetery scene and the epilogue.Now for the kicker: Didn't anyone realize that on p. 4 of the paperback, RC names two obstetric doctors in that hospital, one named Braxton, the other Hicks, saying that Jeffrey was glad they weren't on call that night? (Think about false labor pains--they are called Braxton Hicks pains, named after a doctor in the 1800s.) It's like Robin Cook (or whoever was filling in the storyline) decided it would be great fun to see what reader, if any, would catch that bit of word play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm a fan of RC and this is the first disappointment I've experienced. For me, a good book has a have a likeable protagonist and Jeffry was not only unlikeable, he was disgustingly indecisive, moronic in his decision making and rather than acting like an educated 40 year-old dr, he ran around like a 16 year-old with no clue as to what is going on.

I am still a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Breath-Taking","review":"I must admit, Harmful Intent was much better than I anticipated. With a somewhat slow beginning, it picked up the pace sooo fast! In my opinion, Robin's protagonist, Dr. Jeffrey Rhodes was unforgetable! Very smart and I loved the way he outwitted his pursuers. Nail-biting suspense from the middle to the end, and the medical terms were understandable to a great degree.

Really well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PLOT, GREAT BOOK","review":"Yet another great novel from the best doctor-turned-novelist in all history. It could only be Robin Cook.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a prude. I like a good shoot-em-up as well as the next guy. It's OK to have the villan kill one or two victims if that adds to the plot. That isn't the case here. Our villian kills and kills and kills and kills and it has nothing to do with the larger scheme of things. Just random killings.This killing spree wouldn't be so bad if he hadn't described each one in excruciatingly disgusting detail. I've read horror books with less gore.Even without the gore I'd only rate this book about a 3 because it is so predictable. Good girl had troubles. Good guy helps good girl. Good guy gets Bad guy.

My only quibble is that the author needs to research his geography before placing his characters. Here, he has the denouement scenes taking place in the City of Mountlake Terrace, Washington. He is correct that this city is north of Seattle - however, it has absolutely no connection to Seattle, is actually located in a different county from Seattle and has it's own police force. There is no way that a Seattle PD Swat team would be operating in the City of Mountlake Terrace. I know because I live just a few blocks from this city.Other than that, it was a fun thriller. This is the first book of his that I have read, so I will try other titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than I expected","review":"This was my second Ridley Pearson book. Based on the first one, I expected this one to be not only a good story but also to have a little depth. But while it was full of action and easy to read, it seemed to have no real substance.

I have not read any of the authors previous efforts, but it doesn't have to be a great read to beat this plot. So stupid. You take the only witness to multiple RICO crimes and put her right in the compound of the bad guys. As usual, the assassin bad guy is like Superman. Super fast, strong and can take multiple injuries and pain and keep going. This Marshall Larson must be a real puss. The heroine is so obnoxious, I was ready for the bad guys to kill her.

I feel the author has the information presented in choppy portions throughout the book it did not always flow together. Reading this book was similar to reading a newspaper. The authors attitude is to get rid of everything and that is not the approach to have with many clients that have difficult organizing situations.

This man has no empathy or sentimentality. If you want to live in a perfectly organized world without any special touches, this book is for you. Hopefully you don't own cats or have a weight problem. Lots of good tips and ideas, and thought provoking insights about clutter, but presented in such a way as to put one on the defensive. I found it irritating rather than inspiring. I need a much gentler, more empathic approach such as found in Karen Kingston's or Julie Morgenstern's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not inspired","review":"I was unhappy enough with this book that I had planned to return it, then left it on an airplane (United, Chicago to Denver) as too annoying to carry home. There seem to be a lot of reviews that found the author humorous, I found the writing dull and rambling. There were few useful suggestions and I was completely uninspired. For a better book, try Organizing From The Inside Out, by Julie Morgenstern. Very inspiring and extremely practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is CLUTTER!","review":"Clutter's Last Stand did not offer me the help I was looking for. It took hundreds of pages of junk to get to the one chapter of solution. Even the pages are cluttered with cartoons and cutesy top ten lists. If you are looking for real help and motivation, this book is not for you. It will merely clutter up your bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Change the Way You Look at Your STUFF","review":"All of this man's books are wonderful, but this one is must reading. I kept jumping around this book looking for the quick tips for organizing, but there were none.

The unexpected side effect was that it changed my buying habits (I stopped buying what I didn't need)."},{"rating":"2","title":"clutters last stand","review":"i have refered this book to everyone i know, it helps you get rid of things you might have kept around and is fun to read"},{"rating":"2","title":"OK, but if you really want motivation. . .","review":"read Clutter Free!!

And I really didn't want to end up in Don's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent! This book changed my life","review":"This book should give any pack rat as (I was myself) the inspiration to declutter and get rid of junk. I realize that I do not take junk to the grave, you take all those wonderful memories with family and friends. The book is funny and really makes you think about all the junk one stores throughout life. I fund strange that some people fund the book offensive, we all should take it with a grain of salt, it's supposed (and it is) funny as well as educational.I know it's hard, but if you are having a hard time getting rid of stuff read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too stupid to think, \\"hey throw out six year old daily newspapers?\\"","review":"Aslett thinks you are.I found the ideas minimally helpful in my first foray into decluttering (organizing is a different place) but Aslett is so condenscending in his writing and in the vapid illustrations, that I tossed the book aside in disgust.It's in a Goodwill in Aurora now.I don't need a lecture on drinking soda. It has NOTHING to do with getting crap out of your closets.Might be worth one library check out, or for a high school student.Better books by better writers are out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing! Hard to read! In a word...JUNK!","review":"I found that I was very disappointed in this book. While reading an organization book, the author recommended several other books including this one. I thought since the book I was reading was a good one that Clutter's Last Stand would also be good. Boy, was I wrong! It was boring and could be summed up in one paragraph instead of dragging this book out for pages and pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry","review":"Poetry has a way of touching subjects with both a feather and a hammer.

I would say Kressley's longer and more detailed book, \\"Off the Cuff,\\" suffers from the opposite problem in my opinion. Overflowing with filler and fluff, this book doesn't have enough useful or funny information to justify such a lengthy hardcover book. If you took out all the useful parts, what you'd have is Ted Allen's shorter - and cheaper - version. If you could buy them both used, I'd suggest buying \\"Off the Cuff\\" for what little it has that Allen's book doesn't have but otherwise save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Which one is this - Remus, or Romulus?","review":"Does he BELIEVE he was hired for TV because of his GOOD TASTE?

She ignored it entirely until a few month ago (she is now 18 months old) and she still tires of the images before I am done with the workout. The images go pretty quickly and sometimes they change before my daughter really grasps what is going on - but she does not watch any other TV so is probably not like most other kids her age.The yoga seems pretty outdated, but it does the trick if you are looking for relaxation and stretching, and is best for recovery, there are no levels or more difficult routines on the DVD. The picture in picture is cool, but the yoga picture is pretty big and often covers key parts of the images for the kids, there is no coordination between the pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"If you like words such as \\"special\\" and \\"share,\\" this book will no doubt appeal to you.An old Jewish woman, an African-American child, a cat - it's all too contrived and cute for my tastes.Sorry to offend anyone who loved this book, but it just did not work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"I'm only in the third chapter and already know without a doubt that every person concerned about their health must read this book.

It does a very poor job of getting FM or AM stations when you are not in a large city. I was using it in small cities. Second, the antenna is very hard to use. You need real force to get it out of the radio, and it seems to be breaking. This is after two weeks of daily use. The plus side is that the radio is light. But if I had to make the purchase again I would definitely buy a radio that weighed about 16 ounces, and might do a better job away from major cities and had higher quality control."},{"rating":"2","title":"No doubt gtr/bass tab","review":"I have found this book to be no less than what I expected of Hal Leonard books.

Catherine Cookson has an absolutely astounding way with the words that lead the reader into all Maisie's experiences the way she looked at it.It is humorous and sad book at the same time about a girl who grew up with abusive mother and who had artistic imagination that helped her to cope with her life and to remain kind and compassionate even having gone through such a harsh life.This book will make you laugh and cry and delight in richness of words that portrays the events of a book in such a vivid and bright way as if you were there.I recommend this book and can not wait to read more books by Catherine Cookson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent music... but...","review":"I own the Sega CD versions of Ecco the Dolphin: Tides of Time and the first Ecco. On those game CDs are perfectly playable tracks of all the games music, five tracks of which can be sampled through Amazon.So if you're leary about purchasing this CD, you might want to consider getting both Sega CD games as they might be cheaper in total, and contain a much larger amount of tracks (29 in total, I believe..).The music itself is excellent... The best in the world for a video game.. very atmospheric, and very creative. I could live without the dolphin sounds during the music, but at the same time it doesn't kill me.I hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite CD","review":"I'm a music artist.

I discovered the music is not the style I like. The tracks contain very little melody. The album contains much percussion,of various styles. The whale or dolphin sounds are limited, seemingly most noticable on the first track. One of the artists who contributed to the album has been noted to add \\"general weirdness\\" which I think is quite fitting. This album I consider to be on the lines of new age, mixed with avant-guard attributes. If you want some easy, relaxing, music, this is not the album for you. I prefer Nilsen's album \\"Architects Of Change\\" much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book by Winogrand","review":"Winogrand is in Europe not so well known as in the US.This is great, inspiring work.

I did not like this book at all and I do not recommend it. I suggest you try and find a different book on ancient Roman criminal law (hopefully there's another one out there). I found it very difficult to read because it lacked smooth transitions, sentences were often worded strangely, and the author assumes the reader is familiar with Latin or able to easily look up Latin words. Concepts were difficult to understand and I found myself re-reading passages a few times. If you're required to read it for a class, like I was, I wish you luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Cognoscenti Only","review":"Having been a practicing criminal lawyer for over 30 years, and having been a student of Roman history for nearly 50 years, I had trouble digesting this book. The diction was turgid, the allusions were obscure, and the author assumed too much prior knowledge on the part of the reader.Regardless of its shortcomings, the book repaid careful study. I recently began reading \\"The Trial and Death of Jesus\\" by Haim Herman Cohn, an Israeli Supreme Court Justice. That book presents another hard reading experience, but the background of criminal law and procedure gained from this book has served me well in helping to place Justice Cohn's analysis in context."},{"rating":"2","title":"666 IS A 10-10-10!","review":"ALARMA!!

It will rock on any good club or car system. Just be careful, because the quick siren sounds really scream on tweeters and will make your ears ring. Also, everybody will want to know what this song is and who it is by.

An added bonus is that some versions have an interactive CD-ROM which includes the incredible video clip too. Must see to believe!

It is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended for Fans of Electronic Music","review":"This is an excellent example of Hosono's innovations in electronic music. Borrowing liberally from old-school hip-hop (especially on the first two tracks), it is only very slightly dated, and still danceable, with \\"technopop\\" tunes contrasted markedly against experimental excursions. The fourth track, SFX, is absolutely brilliant and requires attentive listening to percieve its every nuance. \\"Alternative 3\\", the sixth cut on the CD, is equally remarkable, but is even more difficult to listen to (it is more impressive than entertaining). The last four tracks are also rather experimental, and occasionally ambient. But don't expect easy listening. Both of the \\"Medium Compositions\\" are superficially bright, but mask a somber undercurrent. The last track, \\"3-6-9\\", is rather dark and ultimately degenerates into digitally sampled noise. All in all, a tremendous achievement from the god-father of Techno music as we know it today."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a book with little value as a research tool","review":"It is unfortunate that a subject, as important as this,could not have been treated in a more intellectural manner.It is unfortunate that a series of photographs have been utilizied to represent ethnographic material to serious collectors or researchers,when the written material is superficial, at best.

Also thrown in is \\"Made of Wood,\\" a random Brubaker story featuring Green Lantern Alan Scott (another short story :/ ). 'Wood' is passable, but 'Man who Laughs' is a must have...\\"The Man who Laughs\\" storyline retells the first couple appearances of The Joker in Gotham city. Though the story is almost a direct retelling of Batman issue #1 (and other Kane stories) Brubaker finds ways to reinvent the story to make it much more frightening.A great addition to your comic library, but if you can help taking the time to find the original prestige edition - you'll save yourself about 15 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"outstanding story\\"","review":"the story was outstanding and the art work was great... being a big fan of the batman and the joker.. this story was one i missed 5 years ago, but thanks to Amazon .com i bought a copy of this great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"They are destines to do this for ever!

I didn't like \\"The Man Who Laughs.\\" The art style was meh and the plot was whatever. I'm glad I didn't purchase this because overall it was disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Joker read","review":"This story has every classic Joker element. Not the best Joker story ever, but definitely worth the read. It's a bit short, but the filler story with Alan Scott is a good comic experience in itself.

Both go back to Bat's Golden Age era, the first a take on an initial Joker encounter, the latter a team-up with the GA Green Lantern. Both involve Captain Gordon...They're both brisk reads, the Joker tale certainly one of the better one-shots, but sub-Killing Joke.MOST one-shots are sub-Killing Joke though, I think.The book itself is nice, sturdy, with excellent reproductions. Bat-fans will enjoy having this on their bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catchy Title but Overall Disappointing","review":"I was expecting a good insight into the topic of networking but was disappointed by the rather shallow treatment of this subject. The author tries to differentiate between the \\"name droppping, business card-distributing\\" schmoozer-type (that one comes across at parties, events, and conferences) and an effective networker, but in the end he fails to distinguish himself from those schmoozers.If you're looking for guerilla networking tactics you will find many (and you may already know most of those) in this book. If, however, you want some insight into effective techniques to connect (I prefer the word \\"connecting\\" to \\"networking\\"), then pass this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Name Dropping and Self Importance","review":"If you can get past Ferrazzi's name dropping and self-importance, his tips are good. As a reserved, shy person, I found his ideas to be beneficial, but I found, unfortunately, his bragging and name-dropping detracted from the book. Those who can filter out the noise created by his arrogance will find his ideas helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame is for Sissies","review":"As Edward von Kloberg III, a flamboyant lobbyist who did public relations for the most notorious dictators, would say, \\"Shame is for sissies.\\"This book proposes shameless use of friends and connections to get power and influence.Some of the tips are plain silly while others are useful.

I'm glad I borrowed it from the library rather that buying it. Each of Ferrazzi's 'secrets' is in actuality, complete common sense, that anyone with a smidge of social skills over the age of twelve already knows. Do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never sit next to Ferrazzi on a plane ride","review":"I found this book difficult to take seriously. It's advice is great if you are neurotically insecure and need everyone to like you, but I seriously doubt if you'll make many friends by pinging people you meet on planes. Ferrazzi comes across as an annoyingly insecure nuisance, name-dropping like it might impress people, spewing out blindingly obvious bullet points on how to be a human being.His approach to networking is exactly how gay men chat each other up at nightclubs. It works if you have no family, no responsibilities beyond work and can affort to flirt from one casual acquaintance to another without worrying about depth of relationship. It's the business equivalent of casual sex. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there anything worse...","review":"than the veiled call from a so-called friend to \\"catch up\\" only to discover that they need something. Seems like Keith does a lot of that. Does this guy have a true friend in the world or just a rolodex of people that he uses to move up the business ladder?No wonder they say it's lonely at the top. Sure networking is fine and so is success, but not nearly as important as true friends and family."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many names can you put in a book?","review":"A close friend recommended this and after reading it I didn't know if it was a book on networking or Keith Ferrazzi's address book. I would almost like to go back and count how many names were mentioned. The book brings to question, who not how? It seems to me if you're always asking someone else to perform on your behalf, you infact have no skill to offer. Ferrazzi seems to feel very strong about building relationships, not business contacts, which is respectable, but then it appears that he uses those relationships as resources in order to generate more income for his private consulting company, Ferrazzi Greenlight.

Unfortunately about three-fourths of the way through things seem to bog down a little. As you near the end it seems like the author is trying to convince you he knows a vast number of people by referring to his large database and vast contact sheets. I am sure he is super connected, but the ideas seem to become redundant as the book winds down. Overall, though, I have to say that it is a good book and a good read. I have already been referring it to my associates and partners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable insight for all professions","review":"Ferrazzi's book provides valuable insight for people of all professions, not just those whose business is business. All careers involve a social element, and Ferrazzi puts forth useful suggestions on how to make meaningful relationships with the people you encounter. Ferrazzi's advice for maintaining existing relationships and creating new ones cultivates necessary interpersonal skills.The heart of Ferrazzi's method is the belief that business relationships are not about getting the most from people, but rather doing the most for them. This warmer form of networking fosters mutually beneficial freindships that extend beyond the professional realm.My biggest criticism of this book is the abundance of name-dropping, but that's to be expected from such an extroverted author who owes his success to many people. Other than that, Ferrazzi's book is a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much ego, too little practical information","review":"There is some useful advice in here, but it is buried under a whole lot of self-aggrandizing. Also, Ferrazzi comes off as pushy and overly schmoozy, someone who only collects acquaintances in the hopes that he can use them some time in the future. Sort of a waste of time/money, at least for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly revolutionary","review":"I'll keep this brief. This book is written solely from the personal experience of the author. As such, although the ideas are reasonable, they all seemed somehow shallow. The ideas themselves are hardly revolutionary, possibly best described as \\"ideas from Dale Carnegie as applied to Keith's life\\". As I force fed myself this book, my brain kept regurgitating the thought that this is nothing more than chest thumping from an egomaniac."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was ok","review":"The subtitle for the book should be \\"And Really Annoy People.\\" I like the idea of this book, but it really is more or less just hounding people until you get what you want.

Out of the three I read biased on Amazon reviews, I like this one the best.I don't want to be like the any of these authors, they have too many loose contacts, but there is a lot of learn from them.What I like about Keith's book is he considers networking and making friends one in the same, or close to it. That for a great life, business and pleasure do mix. He lays this out in such an honest way that I can see it really does work for him.I tell you what, he convinced me to try working on making friends. And I can report it's working, in a honest way.Thanks Keith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good advice but too much self praise","review":"This book certainly has good points about networking/building relationships, but it is very hard in a lot of cases to get past the self praising. Obviously Keith has done well for himself and knows a lot of people, but I guess he has to establish his networking credibility somehow.I've reread this book a couple times and found certain sections to be more applicable as I get older. Hosting dinner parties might not be as relevant for a high schooler as for a twenty-something, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"I heard this guy at a conference, and of course our conference hosts presented us with the book as a gift in our rooms the night before. I walked out on the \\"speech,\\" and thought maybe the book would be better. Alas, it wasn't. This is the most self-aggrandizing book of this genre I have ever read. One wonders how many times that \\"I\\" appears in the book. \\"I did this, I did that, I'm great....\\" You name it. His methods smack of insincerity and merely using people for his own advantage. It disgusts me. Much better material out there; don't waste your money on this one. Unless you like to use people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Used Product","review":"I was surprised to see that the book I ordered had a number of pages that were highlighted.

It is connecting, connecting with other people and developing relationships. this is what this book is allabout, how do we go about doing that, who do we try to get to know. Mr. Ferrazzi tells how a small town boy from Pennsylvania grew to become the master networker and how you can learn from his success.I liked this book alot and took a lot from it, to develop my own networking skills, I especially liked the part about not schmoozing but at a function try to have a great conversation with 2-3 people not superficial ones with many. I also enjoyed the section on how to get past a \\"gatekeeper\\" ie personal assistant to get to the person you are trying to get into contact with.Great book on how to develop and expand your network."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Read this book you'll know the reasons why people succeeded in the 20th, 19th, 18th century, and will keep on doing so in the 21st century: Their people skills, not technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable tool for success","review":"This book reinforces the notions that every semi-successful person has always had. The more people you know, and know well, the more doors are opened for you. Never Eat Alone will remind you, or teach you, the ways of getting in on the action of business and life. It will teach that generosity is the key to ultimate success. Mr. Farrazzi is highly regarded as being one of the most connected people in the world, and his book DEFINITELY gives away the secrets to make every person with a little bit of ambition the tools to do so as well.

I would read a few pages and then put it down so offended by the self serving narcissicm of the story I could not read on. After a few days I would pick it back up again and read some of the smartest and insightful information I've ever found. I read to the point of Mr. Ferrazzi's divorce and I realizied that all of this information was useless if he could not maintain the one relationship that really mattered. I put the book down for several weeks resolved not to read again, he had lost credibility with me.

The ideas are superficial, hardly revolutionary, and not much different from the simple epiphanies that come into one's life at one point or another. To my surprise, for as many 'connections' as the author seems to have, I don't recall any of them providing any direct advice/quote(s) for the book. There's too much arrogance in this book to leave one enlightened. There are some feeble attempts at balancing his ego, but I would be hard pressed to believe that they came from Mr. Ferrazzi himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overboard, but still worth reading.","review":"Calling Keith Ferrazzi obsessive about social networking would probably be an extreme understatement. I got worn out just reading about his efforts. What saves this book is Ferrazzi's open acknowledgment that not everyone is willing to be as totally overboard as he is. This book does contain a few useful, and obviously well tried out networking techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Think of Networking the Same Way Again","review":"It's remarkable, really, that so many people still think of networking as shaking hands at a business event. After reading Keith's book, I remember one night, while waiting line at the parking garage, everyone was silent, so I struck up a conversation with the guy behind me - and it was amazing. Everyone in line had thought the networking time was \\"over\\" - and yet we made a far more powerful connection because it was memorable. And that's what you need to take away from Never Eat Alone - you may not become fast-friends with everyone you meet, but when you reach out, people appreciate it! Today I have my own communications consulting firm, work with Fortune 500 clients, and have two best selling business books, \\"Speak Like a CEO,\\" and \\"Motivate Like a CEO.\\" Keith is the real deal - it's really all about building relationships - one at a time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Secrets of Networking revealed","review":"Never Eat Alone was a life changer for me. The easy principals that Keith laid out in his book about how to place yourself in positions to create and maintain relationships were game changing.

I recommend this to anyone who wants to build deeper relationships or relationships with more people. Being a gregarious person, I didn't think I would get much out of this read. However, I was pleasantly surprised with a few gem ideas that only require simple discipline to put into practice. No matter your current aptitude, you will grow as a result of Never Eat Alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"great reference, tough read","review":"This book is a refreshing view of networking and is filled with innovative techniques that Ferrazzi has proven successful. However, it is much like reading a repair manual. To get the most out of this book I had to employ Ferazzi's excruciating practice of making endless notes and lists to keep my thoughts straight. Iview it as a manual rather than a novel. Either way, its content is sure to pay dividends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tips","review":"This book falls into that category of business books that you can quickly scan different areas as you go through and take the best parts and leave the rest. It did feel a bit bloated in certain parts and there were a few too many personal stories - though good and applicable to the point the authors were making - for my tastes. If you'd like a good networking book with a 'you can do it attitude' this is a good choice.

Like that great movie your friends (the media) say that you have to see, this one is a pass. After you cut through the fluff, there are two important concepts to be taken away from this book: 1) always be networking and 2) the most effective way to network is to think about how many ways you can give value, provide leads, or be of service to those in your professional network - this goodwill granted will come back to you in spades."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that changes your life","review":"Amazing book of how to do business by finding and communicating with people.There are some times when you see someone that looks nuts but you are envious of what he is dong.

My favorite part of the book comes up right after you have read enough to figure out just what a blow hard he is. Chapter 6, The Networking Jerk, describes how he used to be a self-obsessed bore until an executive coach straightened him out. He even gives her name, not recognizing that the obvious lack of success she had with him is not exactly a ringing endorsement for her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Read Junk Like This: And Other Secrets to Success","review":"In the interest of full disclosure, let me state upfront that I spent precisely 45 minutes (and in hindsight perhaps 44 minutes too many) on this book. The author has a keen, unwavering insight into the blatantly obvious and single-mindedly pursues a one-point agenda of self-promotion. The only striking and likeable aspect about this text is the neon orange dust jacket.

There is much more substantial business advice out there on leadership and confidence that truely is the backbone of American commerce and strength.

If you like reading history told as a novel, where you kind of know the story but not really, this will grab you. I especially liked how the author realted details like what life was like in Manhattan in the 17th century, how pirates lived, what trials and imprisonment was like in England, even how you went to the bathroom on board a ship.Two minor complaints: first, the author has an annoying tendency to italicize words seemingly at random and sometimes 2 or 3 times in a single sentence! Second, there is a bit of repetition; for example, every time someone goes to jail, they \\"rot\\" there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not all glitz and glamour","review":"I purchased this book on the recommendation of a co-worker and I thought it painted an acurate picture of what pirate life truly was, long periods of boredom puctuated by brief periods of excitement. While some did strike it rich, many didn't.This book describes how misconseption in a world where communication took months, sometimes years could make a \\"hero\\" into a criminal. Also how the word of the upper class was always true. Captain Kidd was not a successful pirate and was bamboozeled by money hungry artistocrats to become a privateer and capture ships of the enemy. However, through mutinees, bad luck, and betrayal, Kidd was partially successful, only to be stabbed in the back in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hunter and the Hunted","review":"A very interesting book about the life and tragic life of Captain Kidd, the privateer who can't catch a break and winds up being branded a pirate himself and hanged. The book shows how tragic his attempt is to get exonerated and how the legal system \\"loses\\" the one piece of evidence that can set him free, and he has to resign himself to his fate and await his death. The book gets a bit dry at times, but tells the story that I was unaware of about the true Captain Kidd that is not in the fairy tale books...incidentally, much more interesting. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"17th century world portrayed vividly.","review":"The true story of Captain Kidd is first of all a totally believeable work of nonfiction. The historical era of life at sea and the blurred and flawed objectives between the East India Trading Company, the Royal Navy and the privateer at sea as well as life within the pirate world is amazing. Equally amazing is the world of the legal system in the English colonies in America and back in London.

I was looking for a great adventure, and found myself getting bogged down by the author's penchant for skipping around in different times. For example, you're reading about two pirates and have been reading about them for some time, when suddenly he states, \\"in fact, they had met some time before...\\" and then goes to another chapter about what occurred ten years before. He does this several times and I found it disconcerting, and in some cases, boring. This author also has a way of stating an unpleasantry in a blunt and vulgar manner, that looks like he's attempting to shock you. I didn't appreciate that.Read Batavia's Graveyard, The Ice Master, or any other \\"sea adventure,\\" before choosing this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ancestor!","review":"Well, I just wanted to say that I am purchasing this to learn more about what could be, my ancestor!

I enjoyed the book overall, but I wouldn't necessarily call this a representation of cyberpunk. In fact, three of the stories to me (and more among others) absolutely do not qualify as such, and two of them actually seem to be more rooted in the fantasy field than anything else. However, it's a good read, definitely worth it for the stories by Willam Gibson, both solo and collaborative. Interestingly, my favorite was \\"Petra\\" by Greg Bear, which is one of the fantasies I referred to: a very original idea and superbly written.One final thing: if someone understands \\"Tales of Houdini\\", please contact me and explain.

Some of the stories in here are so perfect (500 Boys, Synners, Stone Lives, Tales of Houdini) that I find myself trying to emulate the slick, tight, ultracool writing style.

She grabs your interest in the early pages, then keeps you hanging right up until the final pages. Her plotting is superb,her characters very human.

That is not to be argued, if you have merely even skimmed the table of contents. Equally true is that certain speeches that are in line with this inclination appear to have been included with wide latitude given as to their literary and historical merit. Would, indeed, a speech given by Hilary Rodham as a college student have attracted the slightest notice without the context of recent political history? I must say no.That said--and a serious shortcoming it is--the book does, in sum, collect a large number of powerfully written and spoken words that constitute a brief sketch of many of the \\"big issues\\" of the century.Read it with a critical eye, but read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reference of Speeches","review":"Look - this compilation of speeches is well worth checking out. You can find the history of the 20th century wrapped up in the writings. From Roosevelt to Clinton there is much to be digested in this work. Any student of politics or history will be well served to read through this book and refer to it going forward. It is interesting to see how the language of speeches changes in the present, and how it recalls much of the past.Classic speeches from JFK, Reagan, MLK, Clinton, etc will keep you interested, and some other speeches will put you to sleep. The point is - you will know more about our world, and the USA if you check out this book.Joseph Dworak"},{"rating":"2","title":"Da Boy is Hot","review":"The first time I heard Lyfe was on Apollo singing the song \\"CRY\\" and I became a fan from that very day.

I wish I followed my instict!While Lyfe's CD holds great potential to be a wonderful piece of art, in my opinion at times the lyrics were predictable, mundane, and lack-luster. The music on the tracks is great, but the lyrics were quite a let down. After each new track would start, the music would let me anticipate lyrics worth listening to, but instead, all that was left was a huge disappointment.Lyfe has talent, indeed, and his voice offers a unique quality that is not found in many R&B; artists.

They were absolutely horrible and did not appeal to me at all. What are you people thinking giving him so many positive reviews. Are you all high on something? This is the worst record I have heard. First of all he gives a little history narration before every song which is very annoying. What really hurts this CD is the lack of quality lyrics, the right melodies and beats. I know he writes his own songs but he really needs help in producing quality music. The only song I liked was \\"Smile\\". This one is something to listen to. It has that 1970's flavor and actually sounds like music. The rest is just garbage and his voice isn't that great either, a little too husky.If you are in your right mind do not buy this CD.

I had the pleasure of seeing him live in concert, and he sounds even better in person. The man's voice gave me goosebumps. I even got to get his autograph.

We were listening to the CD on a road trip and after skipping through every track, we just took CD out and never put it back in. Maybe I'm being critical, but that's just my opinion of the album. He's falling into that \\"The only song I liked was the one they played on the radio\\" category this year.Update.**03/23/06** I still go with my initial review above... but I do think the track \\"Hypothetically\\" is very nice and extremeley clever, meaning, it's really unique.. unlike any other song out there.. it really makes u think and I applaud Mr. Jennings for that...

He needs some work on his songs, better yet, his arrangements because it's not fitting for his voice. I'd like to see something more interesting happen to him than this. The CD itself isn't so bad, I've heard snips and pieces of it and i'm still the same way about it, it's just borderline of good. Personally, I believe it's too much hype regarding his album of being \\"great\\".

He keeps it real and tells the story of his lyfe, leaving nothing out and basically keeps it real with how he feels.

It's odd to see how much someone can affect others just by singing lyrics, but Lyfe seem very genuine and basically a beautiful person. The songs that I recommend are made up my mind, hypothetically, must be nice, stick up kid, and cry. Compared to most albums, this is actually worth buying.

You like real soul singer with great voice and big instrumental, so stop looking for it, you find !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"This guy is the epitomy of contradiction. He is a compassionate thug, a caring ex-con, and an anti-church man of faith. His album is not merely a compiliation of songs, it tells the story of his life. Sometimes your heart has to be stepped on to display the type of emotion that is portrayed in his music. The emotion of his life is presented for us all to see in this masterpiece. Lyfe is truly an artist who goes against the grain to let us share in his talent with this album. This one is a must buy. This guy is deep. This is only the beginning for this guy. He is magical and greatness is just around the corner for this young man."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's the guy from Apollo!","review":"This man can sing! He has the soulfoul depth of Alicia Keyes and yet at the same time, he has talent that is uniquely his own. After seeing him win again and again on Apollo, I was not at all surprised that he was picked up by Colombia Records. It's about time we had a new black male voice. I was getting a little tired of Usher. Lyfe's CD is a must have; it just sounds too good to pass up."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Do this for Love","review":"My man called me today and asked that I go out and purchase Lyfe.

My only complaint is that I wish the characters were a little more developed. Though the heroine struggled with her emotions some, I still found the relationships between all characters to be cold, for the most part, as I did in the first book, The Island Tribe.

It is a family video and a christian themed video. I thought the actors were superb with Ruby Dee, Julie Harris among others. The story line of a man returning to his grandmother's house after she has suffered a stroke and he has suffered the suicide of his pregnant wife is sad but interesting as the viewer follows the characters to their respective ends. Without giving too much away, there is a sort of redemption for all characters, one way or another. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I felt that the video kind of left the story unfinished (at least in my opinion). You get the feeling that the main character will eventually return for good to his roots but you really do not know that and I felt sort of left at \\"loose ends.\\"Other than that, I really enjoyed the film and would recommend it.

I felt through out the entire movie that it wasnt its major theme. Im not a big fan of Potente, and never saw her other movies, but im a huge fan of medical thrillers. The \\"scary scenes\\" were done so that the audience only got to watch the poor humans face as he contorted as he was beeing cut, not much else, so this wasn't really that scary.this felt more like one of those scary wanna be teen flicks, and the secret AAA! society wasn't talked about or shown much!

Most of the movies was about mediacl students chasing each other with scalepels and sedatives......."},{"rating":"1","title":"horribly dubbed","review":"The ADR is badly acted, edited and ruins what could be a good experience.

Classmates turn up dead in the morgue. Paula uncovers a secret medical society that performs autopsies on still alive patients. I wouldn't recommend it. The acting was horrible and when turned the audio into English with no subtitles the voice still didn't match up with movements of the mouth. I would not want to see it again. And the \\"nudity\\" is on men."},{"rating":"1","title":"EURO SLASHER","review":"ANATOMY reminded me of some of those European horror flicks of the seventies like TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE or SUSPIRIA. Franka Potente (who gained American notice in the two BOURNE movies) plays a brilliant medical student who stumbles upon a covert medical society which actually goes against the Hippocratic oath. This society has a renegade faction that is performing autopsies on patients who aren't dead! The movie moves a little too slowly for my tastes, and its dubbing takes somewhat away from the movie in that most of the voices all sound alike. The identity of the villain(s) is pretty easy to identify and once the movie establishes their identity, it just turns into one of those chase the heroine around in the dark films that culminates in a shoddy ending, and with sequel written all over it. (ANATOMY 2 was made a couple years later). It's comparable to our teen slashers, but because of the foreign aspects, it seems a little cheesier."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe he did that to the girl","review":"They disect people like little pigs.

The story is interesting and the effects are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FUN HORROR FLICK WITH A FOREIGN TWIST","review":"I saw this movie solely because it is one of the few movies you can get in America that stars Franka Potente, best known from \\"Run Lola Run,\\" and it turned out to be a good movie too. Franka Potente is perfect in her role as the somewhat reserved heroine who uncovers an evil scheme in the prestigious medical university in Heidelburg. It was great seeing a foreign horror movie after seeing so many American ones. \\"Anatomy\\" is scary because it doesn't use a recycled plot and the movie really makes you wonder about medical science. It's not from Tom Tykwer, director of \\"Lola,\\" and it doesn't have that post-modern feel, but it's still definitely worth seeing this good, solid horror flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant, for a horror movie","review":"Why is it that the best horror movies are foreign? Is it that they are more intelligent and less likely to follow the tired, used conventions of Hollywood? \\"Anatomie\\" is basically a somewhat subdued slasher film, but it has the bonus of starring the always fabulous Franka Potente. Unlike the majority of horror movies, this one is WELL MADE and doesn't look like it was filmed in someone's backyard with a camcorder. Though like the majority of horror films, it is set in a college (it's always college or high school), and deals with something psychologically uncomfortable for everyone- possible dissection! Not to mention, the whole good vs. bad convention: is it a bad thing to perform inhumane studies on human cadavers if the research can possibly save lives in the future?P.S.- don't watch the sequel. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I HAVEN'T RECIEVED IT YET","review":"I STILL DON'T HAVE IUT...

A failing pre-med knows more than he does! He states something about the hormones maturing faster in girls. Well, last time I checked, the structure of various hormones was constant. The hormones themselves don't change a bit.

I believe he was trying out for a part as an extra...I think they just brought people in and told them to talk and eat. There's nothing wrong with little/unknown actors. Let's not go there.

Although this is probably a decent reference book for those already familiar with detection and estimation theory, it makes an extremely poor choice for a class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I've Seen but could be better","review":"Poor does a better than average job of explaining the complicated theory behind detection and estimation. He has many examples which clarifiy some complicated theorems. However I find that too many steps are skipped. Particularly in chapter II where the basis for all of the detection methods become apparent.The book is an excellent resource for someone who wants to learn detection and estimation. However don't expect it to be your only resource. In order to understand Poor's book to its fullest you will need to find supplemental material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not an \\"introduction\\"","review":"This was the textbook for my Signal Detection & Estimation class and I have to say that I found it to be nearly useless. It is not an introductory text; it is a reference text for people who already are familiar with the topics covered. If I had trouble understanding our professor's discussion of a particular topic, this text was no help at all in clearing up my confusion. The authors frequently leave out key parts of proofs and insert them as exercises at the end of the chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find another map.","review":"That anyone would mistake Greer's pseudo-philosophical rants for either an intelligent or thorough treatment of the subject is a testament to the pitiable state of Christian scholarship on the supposed \\"postmodern\\" turn in modern culture. Greer oversimplifies and misconstrues every complex philosophical term he touches, reading Derrida's \\"play of the trace\\" as a synonym for nihilism and spends a chapter \\"refuting\\" his views without ever providing evidence of having read (much less understood) him (no citations of Derrida's works are given).If you are looking for a shallow, irresponsible treatment of the postmodern condition that restates evangelical fundamentalism with big fancy words, Mapping Postmodernism should be right up your alley. Those looking for an intelligent treatment of the subject, however, would be wise to find another map."},{"rating":"2","title":"best single study of jazz improvisation","review":"This is the single most comprehensive study that's been done of jazz improvisation, and perhaps of any kind of improvisation, period. Berliner interviewed over 50 working jazz musicians-including name players such as Gary Bartz, Lou Donaldson, Tommy Flanagan, Lee Konitz, Wynton Marsalis, Max Roach, and Red Rodney. He's also transcribed hundreds of musical examples, including rhythm section parts. Berliner discusses every fact of improvisation, learning the craft, influences, practice and rehearsal, riffs and patterns, repertoire, interplay, comping and soloing, emotional impact of performance, venues, the life of working musician, etc.Requires the ability to read music if you want to follow all of the examples, though there is much you can follow otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, with a lot of musical examples","review":"This is a very well written and thought out book. It is not really an instructional text, but it could be used that way. Most of the book is easy to understand, except for a few technical things here and there that only trained musicians would understand. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to study Jazz in a musical way or people who just want to expand their understanding of music in gereral. This would make a great book to use at universities. The last section of the book contains actual musical examples of what is talked about in previous chapters, so if you can read music this is a great tool for musicians of all levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive Appraisal of Jazz","review":"It is well written ....having a well documented base with a historical background and a didactic perspective...Very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simmons mattress pads","review":"I think these were great mattress pads for the money.

Thus I expected much more than I received. I was hoping to identify a few mushrooms I had found in my area. After spending a great deal of time, I was able to identify none.

It doesn't read like a Dan Brown or anything, but he pinpoints specific issues, what causes them, and how to help them. I read this when I first started teaching, and continue to browse it when I need a refresher course. I'd say it's a must for any voice teacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woth buying but...","review":"This is one of the best books on vocal pedagogy ever written. I just got this edition in order to have the CD which I hadn't purchased with the first edition I had bought. The CD pinpoints vocal faults clearly. However, the sound quality of the recording is LOUSY. And to top it all off, this edition is really a reprint of the 1994 revised issue. So far so good, but the quality of both the paper and the printing is awful: on some pages the printing is REALLY blurry. If you can get the 1994 edition, do it, for it is much easier to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pedagogical book ever.","review":"Finally! McKinney does not cover only vocal faults but pedagogy in general. He covers topics in a wonderful way, without ever talking down to the reader, as other pedagogues do.

There's no attention paid to narrative, so the remixes are in random order with little dialogue, and the second cd of the set is simply full length versions of several tracks on the first cd. So you'd be buying this, then, for its worth as a user-friendly dance remix - however, most of the remixes are very cheesy house versions (I don't know where previous reviewers have found 'rap' and 'hip hop' on this release - there are no 'new' vocals and remixers Dario G and N Trance are typical examples of cheesy, faceless mainstream acts), so this particular release works best gathering dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeeek","review":"Don't get me wrong I'm certainly no (Prog) Rock Fan but please don't buy.

I had two vinyl record sets and wore out two 8-track sets (yes I'm that old!). On this collection all you will hear is hip hop and none of what you fondly remember! There is no trace of the performance I remember-- just hip hop! I can't even picture why anyone into hip hop would want this CD set.

Ugh","review":"This was supposed to be a comedy, but instead it is two hours that alternate between boredom and absurdity.The hero of the story is a well-trained, educated and skilled translator who -- instead of acting like an adult -- allows herself to become the whipping girl of a group of sadistic bosses.If any company like this actually exists in Japan, or anywhere else, I pity the poor workers. But I cannot waste my sympathy on anyone who chooses to stay and put up with the abuse and humiliation like this protagonist does.And frankly, the acting consisted primarily of Sylvie Testud looking either bewildered or blank.

First, I am terribly disappointed in that the whole flavor of the book is somewhat different than the first three. It is almost as if someone else wrote it. The style is so different. Second, the first three books were written consistantly in the \\"third person\\" genre, while this one (out of the blue) is written in first person ! It is very distracting and disappointing, as I was hooked on Doc Ford after the third book. I was expecting a continuation of the same great style White portrayed in the first three books. I am not going to rush out and get number five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky characters","review":"The intrigue in this mystery is doubled by the introduction of so many quirky characters into the life of the protagonist, Doc Ford. The mystery series never gets stale in the hands of this gifted author. Each book is unique in its own right and it is difficult to judge which is my favorite.

And all the cavats about Indonesia should have been researched away. Its creepy to accuse countries of false crimes. But the characters rang true and the nuggets of information were good and the chapters were incredibly well thought out and Ford is pretty damn cute. It was so sad that Big Six had to die: I figured that out early on. How else could the novel end with Ford free to love again?

I believe that this is the only digital copy of this song ever to be put out. Liz Damon (1900 Yesterday) was a long standing night club act at the same hotel Don Ho used to perform at. Kalapana, Cecilio & Kapono, and Country Comfort were extremely popular local Honolulu bands in the early to mid 70's.

I was searching for something to help my two oldest sons (8 & 11) improve their grammar. I found this book and, based on reviews, decided to try it. I have not been disappointed. We only do two lessons a week and I am amazed at my sons' progress. They used to have trouble with quotations and comma placement. Doing just two very short lessons a week and they no longer have issues. They have also increased their vocabulary. I love this book because the lessons are short and the kids don't mind them. On Monday and Wednesdays I write the paragraph on a dry-erase board and they know to go in and edit it. They also write the vocab words in their notebook and look them up. At the end of the day we all go in together to check it and see how they did. We started this in August and already I'm not having to make many corrections because they catch them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource!","review":"This is a great resource for all middle school English teachers.

Horror is a genre that tends to better as films. This book failed to make me afraid and thus I found it boring. However It was a little interesting at times and, to be fair, it is supposd to be one of the scarier novels down the timeline.The story was very predictable all the way through. It was obvious what Barlow was. It was additionally flawed by Stepehen King trying to show off his writing skills. Some of his long and 'clever' descriptions were irritating rather than helpful in jogging your imagination, making the story even more bland and fearless.Those of you that are quite easily scared of horror novels will probably like this, a lot. Unfortunately I don't seem to get scared much anymore, which is a shame really. This book failed to changed that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book - LOUSY READER!","review":"This is a great book - I read it as a little kid when it came out. I listen to dozens of audiobooks each year, and this guy is the second-worst reader I have ever heard (behind the guy who reads the unabridged version of Harris' Red Dragon - what a disaster that was!).All of the characters sound exactly the same to me, with the exception of the 10 year old boy. Of all books to let this guy read, a Stephen King book is probably not the one I would have picked.I know that Frank Muller is out of commission, but couldn't they have found someone else? BAD CHOICE."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best","review":"I've read about 8 ó 9 of King's books, and this has to be one of his best ( Bag of Bones is great too). I actually had a nightmare with the school bus scene. There's so much that's always lost in the movies. The book has some great characters that aren't even mentioned in the movie. e.g the young couple with their baby. And I must say I'm also a Vampire Freak, so I reaaaallly loved this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nail Biting","review":"Very scary and suspense full! Gory and bloody. Two parts of King's book that make them great novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing Dash of \\"Reality\\"","review":"I just reread this after letting it sit on my bookshelf for many years. I love King's new style but reading this reminded me why I got hooked on him in the first place. A combination of fear of the dark and the knowledge that (despite Hollywood's protestations to the contrary)good does not automatically vanquish evil in all cases and ANYTHING can happen to characters you care about in King's world. A great scary read that I would recommend to anyone who loves vampire stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern-Day Classic","review":"I've been a longtime fan of King, and 'Salem's Lot is near the top my list of favorites. King is as lyrically descriptive in places as Anne Rice -- especially the park scene with Ben and Susan. This book illustrates King's masterful talent for taking the everyday and the possible and turning it upside down to show you the horror in everyday life. King will go down as one of the greatest writers of all time, and probably the single greatest writer of our era, because he describes society as it really is - and as it may have the potential to be. If you like Poe and Hawthorne but think King is pop/pulp fiction, read this book with new eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly King's Best!","review":"I am a big Stephen King fan; he has written so many terrific books, but 'salem's Lot, one of the first I read, is still one of his very best. His handling of the classic vampire tale is stunning and his characters are people you really care about (not always true of his later works). This lends an additional sense of horror; every time something happens to one of the characters, you can hear yourself say, \\"oh, no!\\" This of all King's books has haunted me over the years; every so often I take it down and re-read it, and it is just as scary and effective the twentieth time as it was the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating read . . definitely recommended!","review":"'Salem's Lot is the story about a desolate town in rural Maine that becomes inhabited by vampires. The beginning of the book was a wee bit slow, but once the story started coming together I could hardly put the book down. Definitely one of Stephen King's most underrated novels. I strongly recommend this book. When I finished reading I was disappointed and sad only because there was no more left to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"As a \\"recovered addict\\" I claim this is King's \\"best\\".","review":"As a teen I read many of King's novels. Most of them I enjoyed, others I merely read. I stopped reading his work after Misery and don't regret it. Nevertheless I think Salem's Lot was a \\"breed apart\\", the one novel of his which I would recommend enthusiastically to any avid reader, regardless of their genre preference. King demonstrates clearly that he is no mere hack - the book makes a silly sounding premise (vampires? this is the 20th century - oops 21st!) utterly frightening. If you have never read a King novel before give this one a shot. And leave the nightlight on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Lot","review":"This is GREAT!! I actually got rid of my old Salem's Lot hardback to make room for this one. It's expanded, has illustrations and even a new forward by King. Besides the fact that this story is AWESOME, it's a must have for King fans who collect his hardcovers!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a true horror novel!,","review":"I think this has to be one of the best books I have ever read. It has great characters, great Villains and is truly Suspenseful. The beginning, the fist 80 pages or so, it is a bit dry. But once you get past that the remaining 300 or so pages are truly nail bitters. If you like horror this book is an absolute must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written, but pretty standard on vampire issues","review":"Considering the fact the book was written about 30 years ago, the 'standard' in the title of this review isn't as bad as it sounds. In the past 30 years, we've been exposed to quite a lot of vampire lore, in various books, movies and TV shows (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, for instance), so what might seem standard to us might have been a highly innovative idea when the book was originally written.S. King does what he does best, which is describing people's lives & personal perspective from a point of view he knows best (small Maine town, a writer is the hero, etc)."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 Hands UP!!","review":"I just finish reading this book. And it is amazing, great Vampire story, scary as hell, this guy is way out of his mind, I don't know how King can make this kind of stories, he must be from another world, it doesn,t matter where he is from, we will always love his work. KEEP THE GOOD JOB STEPHEN"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, horrible cover!","review":"There is not much I can say about this book, which in my opinion is simply one of the best. What really shocks me is this new cover the editors are using for it. I mean, what's with the flashback of the sixties? I don't like it. The black cover with the vampire in green and purple was much more a seller than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eh ...","review":"Salem's Lot is a really cool book. The infection of the entire town is methodical and all too possible. Barlow's seduction of individuals is entrancing. And the town's seemingly willing turn to the night is spooky. But ...But I found it difficult to care for the heros for any other reason than they were fighting (evil). Yes, Mark had his parents to fight for and he was remarkable in that seeing his partents killed didn't completely short his brain out. But King's insistance on telling the reader how quick the boy's mind was again and again was a little insulting. Yes he's a smart kid, yes he's strong THANK YOU!As much as I usually like King's work, and as much as i found myself wrapped up in the progression of the story ... I feel fairly non-commital about the whole thing. Eh ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of His Earliest and One of His Best","review":"Wow, I read a lot of Stephen King books, and I can't believe how long I put this one off for.

I really enjoyed reading this book. For the first 200 pages, the book is all about this town, it does not start off as a vampire story. Last nite I had 120 pages to the end, I was planning on reading 60 pages last nite, and finishing it up tonite, but I could not put it down. I had to finish, to see what happens. The ending part of this book is REALLY good!!!! For me, the only thing preventing me from giving this book a 5 star rating is, lack of character development. Salems Lot could have been longer, emphasizing on the characters a little more. Other than that, it is a great read, and very engaging.I have just started THE DARK HALF.....look for my review shortly.........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"I'm 13 years old and I think this book is INCREDIBLE!

King is masterful at detailing every character, as so you can relate to them, then killing off a few just to show that the hero doesn't always win.

He sort of set the standard for a lot of horror writers when this book came out. This vampire story kind of goes against the tide of a lot of modern vampire stories where the vampires are all super cool. This is a classic nosferatu, and its corrosive impact on the small town is horrific. Vampire fans should make it a priority."},{"rating":"2","title":"my thoughts on 'salem's lot","review":"It all starts in a tiny little town in Maine called Jerusalem's Lot.

I could barely put it down. I hope this review helps you decide to read it because it is an awesome book. There are many twists in the plot and it keeps you guessing."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRAGula ! What a waste","review":"I can't believe S.King wrote this. It's just another neck sucking, stake pounding DRAGula ! If you want a vambire story I reccomend Children of the Night -- Dan Simmons is it! It's refreshing, totally unexpected"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"I admit, I was put off immediately by King's author's note, in which he insulted the Lord of the Rings, saying it was a 'slightly sunnier version of dracula' or some book like that. Pfft. You could do worse than the brilliant Mr. Tolkien, King.That said, the book was lackluster. King was trying to rewrite his favorite book, Dracula. It didn't work.The characters. I just didn't care about them. Like the one-note Robert Langdon in the da Vinci Code, Ben Mears is bland, one note, and boring. I didn't much care for the people in the town, either. King did not give them enough depth for me to care.However, King writes suspense well. I'll give him props for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not terribly scary, with little realism","review":"This book starts out well enough, though the reader must trudge through the obligatory small peaceful town setup. As a writer settles back to his hometown to write a novel, a mysterious antique store opens up with some odd owners. From then on, the vampire situation appears.A small town infested with the living undead is a great premise, but the story just doesn't live up. Instead of a terrifying takeover and escape story, the book appears almost comical. Basically, in a period of a few days, a few men try to rescue the town, but do a downright miserable job. The ending is very disappointing, the characters are not enduring, the language sentence structure is too terse, it's too many pages, and the plot, to put in the vernacular - just sucks.This book is more reminiscent to a bad B-movie. It tries to scare, but the only frightening part was that fact that other people find it scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was King thinking, new Dracula?","review":"I did not like this book because of fashion it was written in. The description and suspense was, as in all king books, worthwhile. But I thought that King should have told the reader what happened to the vampire victims. Another thing that I did not like was making a timetable of the whole town; I thought that was very boring. When I finished this book I was glad, telling what the whole town did every day made it seem longer than 451 pages. Myself, I would not recommend this book to another person because only the last 75 pages were worth reading.This book takes place in a small new England town called Jerusalem's Lot, nicknamed \`Salems Lot. The main character, like most king novels, is a writer named Ben Mears. He comes to \`Salems Lot to write out his childhood fears. At the same time a new horror has arrived at the town and its taking over."},{"rating":"1","title":"So this is KIng??? Boring!!!!","review":"I heard so much about Stephen King. I had nothing to do so I read this book. Man! was it boring. No interesting characters. Didnt really scare me a bit. Boring plot. Man! if this is King's best work, I better stick with, the master of story telling, the master of the Vampire Chronicles, the real deal, Anne Rice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This is by far the absolute worst book I have ever had the misfortune of reading. The copy I read was 550 pages. The first 500 pages dictated the lives of every single citizen of Salem in soap opera fashion. Very little mention is actually given to vampires in the first bleak 500 pages. Whenever they (Vampires) do come out to claim a victm, King cuts off the sequence of events without ever telling what happened to the unfortunate soul (Ocasionally he will, but 350 boring pages later). It got very very frustrating. The last 50 pages were good, but the certianly didn't even come cloce to making up for the first 500."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most unoriginal book I have ever read!","review":"This book is the absolute worst \\"horror\\" book to ever be published. My father has gotten into King's books over the last few years so I decided to give him a try. HUGE mistake!'Salems Lot has a horribly cliched story line, the characters have no depth nor personality, and the ending is utterly lacking any imagination.I have read many horror books (and movies) having to do with vampires and this was the worst. King took every famous vampire novel and turned them into his own very bland story. If you like vampires without the cliche and with actual depth try Poppy Z. Brite or even Anne Rice, but don't waste or time or your money on 'Samems Lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst purchase ever!","review":"They said the book was like new.

He brings it all - Horror, Mystery, Romance and Life-Like problems all into one book. This is his second novel, and much better than his first novel - Carrie. The Scenes including Barlow, The Child Vampires and the Vampire Mike brought chills down my spine, and nearly caused me too put the book down (as i was reading this at night)! Mr. King has a way with words, and describes the town and townspeople so well, you would think that the little town of Jerusalem's Lot and Floyd Tibbits and co. were real. A great haunting read - reccomended to any King fan or a fan of Horror/Vampire novels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where King is King","review":"This is King's second novel, his first being Carrie, which was a manuscript his wife rescued out of the trash. Where Carrie is tentative, Salem's Lot is confident. By this time, King really has a handle on what he wants to do, which is to enclose his image of Maine in every paragraph. Oh, and its really scary too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down","review":"Wow. I breezed through this incredible book in a incendiary three-day ride, the fastest that I have ever read a book of this length. Not being a Stephen King reader I didn't know what to expect out of 'salem's Lot, and suffice to say it was the most enjoyable read I've had this year.What characters! Not only the main ones, but the side characters that make up the population of the town.The town becomes a character in and of itself, thanks to King's painstaking attention to detail and brilliant prose. Though a fictional place, Jerusalem's Lot is given such life that you could easily believe these terrifying events actually happened in a real town.I could go on and on about the merits of this story, but it is really something that needs to be experienced to be appreciated. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Salem's Lot, a city haunted by creatures of the night","review":"Like most of Stephen King's novels (maybe all of them), 'Salem's Lot is structured like this: a long introduction, where he describes, describes and describes until it's impossible to go any further. Then he begins to deal with the supernatural. Finally we have the typical Stephen King CLIMAX, which is worth the time you spent in the boring part, the money you spent buying the book and anything else. The climax takes you into a kind of ecstasy, when you damage the pages of the book with the sweat of your hands. Outstanding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best King novel","review":"Stephen King's \\"'Salem's Lot\\" is defintely his best book. It starts out introducing the two main characters, a writer named Ben and a young boy named Mark, and then introduces the town in which the story takes place, Jerusalem's Lot (also known as 'Salem's Lot). King does a great job at developing the town, its dark past, and its many residents. The trouble starts when two \\"business partners,\\" R.T. Straker and his partner, Mr. Barlow, move into the infamous Marsten House in 'Salem's Lot. King also creates a chilling story about the Marsten House in this book, and how metioning it still makes the residents uneasy. Eventually there is a disappearance of a little boy, and Ben and a few others suspect that it is not only connected to the Marsten House, but to vampirism as well. \\"'Salem's Lot\\" is the best vampire novel I've read, and is very freaky. If you're a King fan who hasn't yet read this, or just want to read something scary, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scared the crap out of me!","review":"This was a great book, Stephen King does a wonderful job of bringing the folklore of the vampire to life. This story takes place in the little town of 'salem's lot, or more formerly Jerusalem's lot. Slowly but surely vampires start to take over the town, and it's up to Ben Mears, Mark Petrie, Jimmy Cody, Susan Norton, Father Callahan, & Matt Burke to stop them. Mark was my favorite character, since I am a child also, and I love monsters and horror. I reccomend ths book to all King and horror fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"not one of his best","review":"I am and have been a fan of Stephen King's books for a couple of years.

It's been 3 years since. But I'm still scared of looking out of my window at night. King's a superb specialist when it comes to horror stories. We must also appreciate the skill with which he weaves in different short tales of unrelated people into a complex and very meaningful novel. I'd really recomend it to anyone levelheaded and who would like to taste a bit of a 'real vampire horror' tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"SCARY??? SOMEWHAT...","review":"I read this book a couple weeks ago and I have to say two thingsa) It was very well written. In fact, Stephen King gives the portrait of a small town, deserted mysteriously. The characters are very realistic, nearly alive. One of the best written books I have read.b) Just a good horror book.The book is not that scary after all. First, you know who the survisors are from the begining. Then, the book is way too big to keep you tuned. I only felt the creeps at three points: The visit to the house(while the hero is a kid) his nightmare(one of the most surprising scenes ever) and the scene after the funeral(cliched). But when the reader finds out who is the leading evil then reads just to see what happens next. A very long horror book seems boring to me. Personally I prefer Lovecraft.To sum up, the book was good but not something to give you THE creeps. I suggest you should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"Writer Ben Mears takes a journey of discovery back to the Maine town of Jerusalem's Lot. As a boy he'd had an otherworldly experience in the old Marsten House and it has haunted him ever since. He hopes by going back to 'Salem's Lot he can exorcise his demons and create another bestselling novel at the same time. But when he returns he finds that the Marsten house has just been purchased by two strange men, one of whom is never seen in the daylight. And then strange, evil things begin to happen. I've just finished reading this novel for the third or fourth time since it was first published in 1975. It is one of my favorite books and one I find that wears well. This was Mr. King's second book and he was just beginning to hit his stride as a writer. His prose is as good as any modern writer, a fact often overlooked because of what he writes. The characterizations ring true as does the dialog. And it is a plain scary classic vampire story. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic King","review":"Overall a little lengthy, I often found myself hoping I could somehow fast-forward and actually read about some vampires; King invariably makes up for this with his intensely thorough character development. Full of suspense, the reader will constantly be drawn more and more into the lives of the various residents of 'salems Lot, following them either into the ranks of the undead or to... well, I don't want to ruin anything for you. Bonds will be formed and unraveled, families torn apart. All-in-all a great read, I found it thoroughly enjoyable and engrossing.

Read by Ron McLarty. Although I own this book, I also have the Audio Book because the story is so deliciously horrifying and brilliant that I want to hear the words aloud. To me its like listening to a favorite CD over and over again, I love to surround myself with the visuals that Stephen King so eloquently penned into this book. At 17.33 hours, it's a long orgasmic poetic nightmare that you never want to wake up from. Ron McLarty does an excellent job, seeing as this book is written from so many points of view, female included. Listening to someone read a favorite book is comforting, and I also have found that I see things differently, hear things I haven't heard before, the story is more alive in some way through audio. If you love the book, get this, if you have never read the book, get this. When you are through share it with a friend, they will thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it if you're looking for good Stephen King","review":"As a King/horror fan, I'm sorry to say this book was a let down. In 600 pages (my version) there is very little character development and, as a result, you really don't care what happens to them when the action finally starts to go down (not that there is much of it). It isn't scary and the dialogue/story are sometimes laughably unbelievable. You can tell King was just starting off. It's a cool premise that goes nowhere fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone says that this is one of his best...","review":"I have read and heard a lot about this book, so I though I would give it a try. It was nothing like I expected. I have read almost all of King's books, but I think this was one of his worst. The plot was extreamly slow and it was not as good with the chareters as most of his are. His books are known for having a life of their own. But this one was just dead. I was so dissapointed in him for this one. If you really want some good reading material check out books like The Shinning and Bag Of Bones or The Dark Towers Series. But I felt this book was a disapointing waste of time. I am really glad that this was only a one time flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only emperor is the emperor of ice cream.","review":"This is one hell of a book, it is gripping and has all the necessary ingredients for a classic horror novel, it keeps you riveted all the way through, even when there is nothing really happening you are still gripped because you get the feeling that something will happen. Such as when Win Puritons dog is hung on the fence I didn't expect that but it was still tense. when I was reading up to it. I love the book, it is balanced with fantasy horror and realism that is so perfectly written it is bound to spark a lot of emotions, it is a pretty graphic and rather unsavoury thing to read, gruesome even, but that was what it was intended for and in that context it is a complete success and I love it well done Mr King..."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Salem's Lot Really Bites","review":"'Salem's Lot is the second novel by Stephen King. It takes place in a small town in Maine that is being taken over by vampires. It starts out kind of slow but when it picks up it really picks up. The main characters are Ben Mears and Mark Petrie. There are other characters of course but these two are really the main ones. Ben is writer who returns to the Lot to free himself of childhood evils. Mark is only a boy but he is as brave as man. You feel like you know the characters by the end of the book. King really knows how to probe into the human heart and express the fear and evil that lives there. It is one of his best novels. It keeps you turning the page to find out what happens. You can hardly put it down. It makes you wonder if something like that could really go on in a small town. The bottom line is if you like horror or Stephen King this is a book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read, slow start though","review":"Excellent story... unfortunately not entirely his own. King follows the same path as Bram Stoker's Dracula. The chain of events is almost identical. Fortunately, King puts his own style and twist into the novel with a few original ideas and characters that are much more identifiable than those of Stoker's. I was 11 when I first read this. I was so parnoid by the time I finished it(at 2am) that i pushed my desk in an attemot to block entry to my room. It scared me to death. I loved it! The chaces are that i am paranoid and demented but, by all means read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tied with Pet Sematary as King's best novel.","review":"I remember being seven or eight years old and snooping around in my older brother's room. I found a copy of Salem's Lot on the top closet shelf.Needless to say, a snoopy little brat like me couldn't pass up the chance to read something that would have horrified my parents.This book was my introduction to King, and what an introduction it was.A page turner from start to finish, shocking and terrifying, a true horror masterpiece.The plot, the characters, the imagery is disturbing and utterly perfect.If your new to King, there is no better place to start.Too bad this book has been made into about five different movies, each one worse than the one before it.Remember the original movie, what was up with the lead vampire with the big blue head????Nevermind..........Ignore the movie(s)!!!King's finest novel, right up with Pet Sematary.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Causing Sleepless Nights","review":"I originally read this one in high school and still \\"despise\\" Mr. King for many sleepless nights since."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic in every meaning of the word.","review":"I've read all of Stephen King's books to date, and this is a true standout.

This WILL keep you awake at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"VAMPIRES","review":"'SALEM'S LOT by Stephen King was one of a few books that I enjoyed reading. This story is about the classis battle between the undead and life. This book if full of suspense, happiness, saddness, and action. The book starts off with a writer, Ben Mears, who returns to Salem's Lot to write a book. In the process of writing he falls in love, loses his love and friends, destroys his book, and ends up being scared. I gave this book four stars because it was not as scary as I thought it would be, I thought there would be more action and suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"The King novel with the greatest power of longevity","review":"I only wonder why King has not produced a text of the same caliber as 'Salem's Lot. It is indeed his most important work, and out of his entire canon, this novel, along with the possibility of The Stand, has the greatest chance of being remembered as a seminal 20th century gothic novel in the years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing on every level. Pick a different King.","review":"I remember reading a few of King's novels as a kid, if more for the characters than for the monsters. Salem's Lot disappoints on both counts, with most of the characters remaining strangely lifeless (no pun intended) and the book's misogyny being much scarier than the actual monsters. To add insult to injury, I was not a big fan of the reader either (but that part of course is highly subjective), and the pace is rather slow at times. Still, I'm not much of a quitter so I managed to hold on for most of the story. But eventually, I had to give up in disgust, two discs from the end: A first.Corollary: If you want a story of King's at all, I suggest you pick a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"this really sucked , and I'm not talking about vampires","review":"I saw this movie , and it was horrible.

Carrie was pretty good do to its structure, but Salems Lot never really elavates past koontzes level. The story is very simple and the main villian is not really more complex than a saturday morning cartoon villian. I believe it's possible that maybe that is what king wanted, a scary fast rollercoaster of a horror story. But for my taste he is so much better while writing those epic and complex books that aren't so easy to group in one category."},{"rating":"1","title":"disturbing scene of child abuse...","review":"The beginning of the book drags with boring mundane details, but it picks up when one of the characters tells of a frightening childhood experience in the infamous \\"Marsten House\\" which continues to haunt his dreams. I was just getting drawn into the story when I read about one of the 'Salem's Lot residents, a teen mom who loses her temper and violently lashes out at her ten month old baby leaving his eyes bruised and swollen. At this point, I was horrified and had to stop reading the book. No matter how great the book may be, I don't want have those disgusting images in my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALSE","review":"This book was falsely advertised as illustrated.

Here he mercifully just bores us in a normal sized book. Hmmmmn. Chapters one thru twelve introduce everyone of no consequence in Salem. Chapter 13 kills them all off and turns them into undead. Why couldn't they be killed sooner ? I was fighting off sleep waiting for them to die. And gosh wasn't it so scary when the vampires \\"fell on them\\" ? Are these genuinely clumsy vampires or is Mr King's use of imagery not up to the task ? Watching old schlock Hammer movies is way more entertaining than reading this yawn-a-thon. Better than Anne Rice ? Do we care ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scariest book ever!!!","review":"This is literally the scariest book I've ever read!!!

The Sony DcrTRV-33 and even the DcrTRV-22 had beautiful pictures. Even the Panasonic in its class looked much better. My advice... take a look at the Sony, and ask to see the picture on a monitor, if the store doesn't have one, go to another store that does.

There are many theories as to why, but nothing has been resolved. Canon has not been helpful.

Well after three years of limited use, the Eject Tape warning would pop up. And recently, when I put it on record, the screen stays black and the view finder stays black. Like many others here, I called customer service and was told to send the camcorder in so they can tell me how much it will cost to repair. When I asked if there was a flat cost for specific repairs, they said no. After seeing how much people were qouted, I dont think I'll take the chance of paying for shipping only to refuse to pay the high cost of repair.At that time, they tried to sell me the \\"upgrade\\" program. Just pay $200 for a ZR85 or $499 for a Optura 400 plus the exchange of my broken Elura 50. Sound appealing until you ask them if the cameras are new. No, they are refurbished.

They even send me the free UPS label so I can sent it to them for free.I think Canon must be under a lot of criticism with all the problems their late model digital Camcorder is having. Their service and support for their product is very good. At least they didn't tell me to buy a new camcorder instead!

The female degenerates into a TSTL character and the author tries to make a plot out of this character's stupid thought processes. By the middle of the book she's self-centered and unambitious to such an extreme degree that it seems like she suffers from depression and whatever that anxiety neuroses is that means a person's afraid to leave their house (or go very far from it).

McCarthy's writing is uneven in that her contemporary work is some of my favorite - bright, delicious, clever, satisfying - while her supernatural work is more flat, less intriguing, the characters less likable.This book is something in between. The writing is proficient but nothing exceptional or exciting. The characters are not terribly likable. I actually disliked the hero from the beginning, and although he became likable, his transformation was not handled well or smoothly - actually, it wasn't handled at all, per se. The heroine was an unsexy country bumpkin who may as well have been a gawky, bubble-gum-popping teenager with braces. Her sexual issues intruded but weren't well fleshed out, making for some bumpy sex scenes that ended up being flat where they needed to be tension-filled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Good","review":"This book wasn't too bad, but it wasn't quite that great either. I keep giving Erin McCarthy's books a chance, but a lot of them just don't seem to blow me away. In my opinion, her book, 'The Pregnancy Test' is my favourite so far.The main character seemed a little too shallow for me. Considering her background and upbringing it's somewhat believable. Her boy toy... well, it seemed highly unlikely that they would have attracted one another since they were complete opposites, and no, I don't really believe in the quote that opposites attract.Give this one a try, you never know, you might like it much better than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Yakima flop","review":"Yakima packages these saddles with two tightening screws each but the saddle has four screw holes, I can't get them tight enough in the round bar I got from Yakima.

It is classic Bootsy catipulted into the 21st century, with the help of Snoop, Kelli Ali, and Fat Boy Slim, just to name a few. But Bootsy doesn't leave his funk behind, the lay-down beat is there as is Booty's classic style. This is a great late night CD, or club booper, as it keeps you moving and grooving.

Stick to your original sound forget trying to blend in with the new because most of this stuff out here is pure garbage anyway, and that's probably why your CD came out that way.

Art is great like in OLM but story is MUCH denser. I guess I have soft spot for movies/books/comics that take reader to orient, but make no mistake, this is no Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee type of story. It looks like good old Master of Kung Fu in his best days combined with great oldies like Richard Chamberlain's Bourne's Identity. Anyway, villain Cheshire is everything but one dimensional and cast of characters is great.PICK THIS UP!

Totally insulting to women on every level, I suggest you spend your time either with your family, or doing something productive. This book is nothing but a sad, unfortunate waste of time, catering to the lowest level of humor. Women: don't read this book if you want to feel progress is being made equality-wise.

For examples from page 5 to 19, he described humorous situations that happened because his last name was Dick.What I like the most about this book is one of Tim's philosophies. In Acknowledgments section, he said \\"All men like to think they can do it alone, but a real man knows there's no substitute for good help, support, encouragement, or a pit crew\\". I totally agree.Besides the two advantages listed above, the rest of the book is bland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't stand too close to this book.","review":"This book wasn't as good as it's hyped up to be. He spends an inordinate amount of time contemplating his genitals (because his last name used to be Dick, so he unloads years of childhood teasings here) and just generally being crude, vulgar and gross.

In all, I didn't feel like my own opinions were firmly challenged while reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disrupted by numbers","review":"I was dissapointed in this book. I found it a difficult read because the text was inundated with percentages, statistics and numbers. The author used statistics and percentages, which can be manipulated to 'prove' anything, to back up every one of her statements and opinions.I would have perfered much more straight reporting of her ideas and feelings and much less this mish-mash of numbers and percentages.

The writing is so hackneyed, cliched, and ponderous that I had to keep going just to see how bad it could get (very). What really really scares me is that lots of people believe this compendium of trashy conspiracy theories and overheated prose is all true. And what really really really scares me is that I've heard quite a few people say they want to go to Italy to see the sights mentioned. Thousands of years of history and art are powerless to move people to travel compared to one really stupid novel. I think we Americans will have to just give up and become a nation of retarded servants for the more discerning nations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible, Unbelievable","review":"This Vatican City, terrorist thriller pits science against religion (Roman Catholic) and neither wins.Normally novels that blend fact with fiction usually are, to some degree, plausible tales. Tom Clancy, Brad Thor, Steward Wood, to mention a few writers in Brown's genre, all write thrillers that are believable. Dan Brown, in this novel, does not.If set in today's world then a thinking reader has to question airplanes that go 15,000 mph! Anti-matter exceeding the destructive power of a 5 kiloton bomb contained in a plastic box! A Papal helicopter with a rate of climb only exceeded by military jets! And most implausible is the survival of the hero, American symbologist Robert Langdon, who falls to earth from a height of over two miles (using a windshield tarp and the rock free Tiber River, in Rome, to soften the impact) only to get up and save the day.This read is not up to story quality found in \\"the Code\\". Conditionally recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"basically painful","review":"Dan Brown demonstrates mastery of the \\"mindless pulp\\" genre of fiction. Shockingly, it isn't the quality of Dan Brown's writing that is most painful to me-it is my knowledge of this book's overwhelming popularity. Madness, madness, madness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not great literature, but great fun","review":"Angels & Demons is a fascinating and fast-paced adventure through mysterious Italian Renaissance art, and I personally couldn't put down. What you have to keep in mind is that this isn't Dickens or Tolstoy- Angels & Demons isn't a literary masterpiece. But it works well for its purpose, like an action blockbuster film- not incredibly deep or profound, but incredibly entertaining. Dan Brown has written an interesting and fun novel, and it shouldn't be judged for what it isn't supposed to be. I liked this book way more than I liked The Da Vinci Code- its mood suits each scene well and the storyline is ingenious. If you're looking to read something for entertainment's sake, then Angels & Demons will not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT The DaVinci Code!!!","review":"After I read The DaVinci Code, I was thirsty for more books like it; with its depth and intrigue, it was one of the most readable and fascinating books I have read in a long time. However, I found that Angels & Demons stretched the limits of credibility beyond the breaking point. Super humans and super demons were abundant, and the lines were crossed far too many times. I am willing to go with a writer and to suspend disbelief with the best of them, but this one made me feel jerked around. Though I stuck with it and read through to the disappointing end, I did not feel good about my efforts. I was expecting another DaVinci, but was sorely disappointed. Had I read this one first, I would have skipped the far superior product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brims!","review":"Apart from being such a terrific thriller, it is the way in which Dan Brown creates and allows the reader to enter the thought process of Robert Langdon, and lets the reader think along with him, as he uses all his skill and historical knowledge to try to outwit this assassin. To save the lives of the cardinals from such a deadly fate. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true barnburner!","review":"Next to Britt Gillette's \\"Conquest of Paradise\\", this is the best book I've read in a long time. I'm a first time Dan Brown reader but I'm hooked! I stayed up all night and didn't quit until I finished, blurry eyed and sleepy. I found myself believing every word and had to stop and remember that it's just fiction! I was amazed at the inside information about the Vatican (especially the library), and I finally got out a map and books from my trip to Rome to see if I could find all the churches. Anti-matter, illuminati, choosing a pope - all of it was fascinating. When I finished, I had to laugh thinking about the fact they never ate, slept or made comfort stops and neither could I. The ending was a total surprise! Anyone who enjoys non-stop action and information shouldn't miss this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Come On!","review":"The premise of this book is intriguing, and I have to admit Dan Brown tells a good story that keeps you reading. At first I was more than willing to go with the flow of the book. I don't know much about physics, so I could accept the initial premise for the sake of a good story. The trail of clues was fun. But page after page of descriptions of fighting between Langdon and assorted bad guys became tedious. Was he writing a novel or a screenplay for a B action movie? I was also willing to suspend logic to believe that Langdon could escape multiple near-death experiences within the space of a few hours, all for the sake of a fun read. But the helicopter survival? PLEASE - GIVE ME A BREAK!!!!!! Talk about ignoring the laws of physics - even I know his escape made NO SENSE whatsoever. There are so many twists with the characters that I felt manipulated, not entertained. All in all, the ending of this book totally ruins what could have been an exciting, if not very literary, read."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-movie level writing...","review":"I almost stopped reading 10 pages in. Dan Brown is clearly not a good writer. I did enjoy the intricacies of his detective work (Indiana Jones would be jealous), but everything else is rather silly.*SPOILER WARNING*The Mach 15 flight, the hilarious explanation for the containment of the anti-matter, and the astonishment at the symmetry of the Illuminati symbols (It approached parody-level at certain points; certainly it can't be so hard to believe when its RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE READER).In addition, the silly way that the characters wonder if the Illuminati still exist (\\"They can't exist...can they??\\" paraphrase) and the pointless plot-'twist' at the end almost did it in. I skimmed through the last 50 pages or so, I was so bored.Like I said, the detective work and references to history kept me interested (accurate or not), but this thing is pretty silly otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book gave me a pain in the stomach!","review":"This guy, Dan Brown, is a con artist. He has half the free world talking about him as if he's the 21st century answer to Shakespeare. I love a good thriller, but \\"Angels and Demons\\" was riddled with mistakes (The Prayer of St. Francis Assisi is not The Serenity Prayer), and if I came upon the sentence, \\"Vittoria looked confused,\\" once more, I thought I would scream. I got as far as the last 25 pages, but the book became so ridiculous I couldn't bear to finish it. I left it on a bench somewhere for some other poor sucker to pick up. You'd better believe that any inclination I had to read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" has evaporated."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perfect Bathroom Book","review":"This book is the perfect book to read while you are on the toilet. It is essentially the plot of some kooky, low budget tv series - imagine Buffy the Vampire Slayer, an replace the vampires with some sketch mystery cult, and you've got it. The plot is clumsily amateurish - we understand one group to be good because we are told so, the other group is of course evil, because they have to blow something up. Every chapter ends with some kind of \\"omygoodness what could possibly happen next\\" hanger, which each subsequent chapter seems desparate to top - to absurdity and beyond! I generally enjoy tripe like this, a la Clive Cussler adventures, but this book really couldn't hold my attention for longer than a couple of chapters at a time (hence a bathroom reader). Something about the best assassin in the world being overcome by one clumsy scientist and his partially bound love interest really is laughable. Oh well. Better luck next time Dan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puzzle Driven","review":"Interesting puzzles, gruesome murders and secret societies are not enough to save this thriller. The villian is identifiable way too early. The hero is an encyclopedia of trivia no one would know outside of the Vatican walls. Too many escapes and too few traffic jams in Rome."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Unfortunately I read Da vinci code first so when I started reading this book, I was thinking that it must be the same book with slightly different circumstances. Even in the begining when Langdon was woken up by a phone call, the same story with the beginning of Da Vinci Code when he was woken up by the police asking him for help.With this in mind, I kept on reading but then after Langdon found another body, gruesomely murdered and then met his victim's daughter, I said enough. I am not interested to read more.I was really looking forward to this but I am not a fan of formulaic writing, especially for suspense, mystery type."},{"rating":"1","title":"World's Dumbest Ending!","review":"If the book had ended earlier, I would have given it five stars. In fact, the first 75% of this book was TERRIFIC, but the last quarter of the book -- especially it's ending -- was so freaking dumb [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"FAST-PACE THRILLER!","review":"I happen to come across the book, when my sister had been visited by the author at Phillips Exeter Academy. I was reluctant, at first to read it, but when I hit the fourth page I was lost!This book is centered around Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbologist, and Vittoria Vetra, scientist and daugther of a murdered father. They must race against time to recover a missing destructive weapon and the two will come across troubles through a story of deceptive characters, murder plots, and hidden agendas. The book is fast-pace, thorough, and suspenseful. I recommend anyone to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"silly, silly book","review":"Dan Brown can write, i.e. he can create visual characters and places and has talent in that respect, but the plot on this and the actions taken by the characters is downright silly and dumb. It's interesting up to the mid point of the book then gets downright silly and dumb. The last 100 pages you just read to finish the book. You don't care about the people in the book anymore. He can do much much better. His editor should have sent him back to rework it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Must be Kidding","review":"It's astonishing that this is currently one of the biggest bestsellers in the world. It's a formula (Ludlum, Cussler, Clancy) and no better. It's a pageturner only in the sense that you wonder just where will this silly story go. If you want to read something that is well written, full of surprises and a mystery, buy anything by Arturo Perez Reverte. This book doesn't even reach the level of a good beach read. A waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"I went into the book store and asked for a recomendation. I told the sales person that I do not enjoy mindless books for the mass public. She then picks up exactly that. If you're only looking to read because you want to look smart, well this is the book for you. However if you are an evenly remotely intelligent person avoid this pseudo-litature at all cost. The author pretends that he did all his research but if you are at all educated you can see right through it. This book is written for a lowest common denominator audience. The author even assumes that the reader wouldn't know basic facts about major historical figures. If you enjoy Vin Diesel movies then pick up this book, rather yet just wait for him to star in the movie version and stop reading so I can avoid getting recomended books that are only being writen because of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty awful","review":"I guess my expectations were too high given the other reviews of this book and the description of the plot. Maybe Mr. Brown's writing improved as he wrote more books, but I find this book unreadable. In particular, he doesn't make logical transitions from the end of one scene to the next. For example in an early scene, he leaves the hero with his skin crawling with apparently overwhelming horror at something he sees. When this scene is continued just a few pages later, it does not continue or explain the earlier reaction. I kept going between the two trying to figure out what happened.I decided I just couldn't continue with the book, it is just so badly written. I recommend Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum (which appears to have \\"inspired\\" this book) instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the effort but . . .","review":"I'm not going to bother you with yet another boring review, there's tons of them here. BUT, you should know a couple of things:1. Though it's true Dan Brown can write, the average mystery reader can figure out what will happen to the four kidnapped cardinals without straining their brains. The hulking villian is so evil it is almost laughable. The heroine is predictable heroic, the hero is noble and has flaws which makes him totally \\"pc\\".2. ON THE OTHER HAND, BUT, HOWEVER the book is still worth the price of admission due to some unexepected plot twists, an amazing quirky turn, and an ending that was breath-taking. Like I said, the guy can write. So, Dan, why don't 'cha write great through the whole darn book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Ending for an incredible start","review":"The ending was so far fetched and stupid that I almost quit reading it in the last 100 pages several times. The beginning was really great, but got crazy and dumb at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy makes me read FAST!","review":"I read this book in two days, and I usually take about two weeks to read a novel. Yes, its slopy in some parts ... having an passenger plane that travels outside the atmosphere at present time is off the charts, and all the events happen in about one day, come on!!! ... but the story keeps you on the edge at ALL times, and the events near the end get unpredictable by the page. I personally liked this book more than the DVCode, maybe because it wasnt so polular when I read it and because it is much darker.I am now after Deception Point and Digital Fortress, will let you know how those are."},{"rating":"1","title":"From first chapter Angels to end of book Demons","review":"Wow, first page through almost mid-book, wow. Good read. I was so intrigued the first half - all the references to the Papacy and the Illuminati, but THEN, geez, Dan (and EDITOR of Dan) what the heck happened? How you can go from a decent thriller to a ridiculous sham of a book??? (Well, duh, capitalism - SELL THOSE BOOKS, who CARES if it's a good read! Everyone will buy it because of DaVinci Code, suckers!)... The ending is beyond ridiculous, so much so that I thought seriously about writing the editor to shake a virtual finger at (them). Unbelievable they published this book with THAT ending... Sigh. It started out so GOOD, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go with the illustrated edition!","review":"I had read numerous reviews about people having to stop reading and search the internet, etc. to see what Dan Brown was talking about in this story. The illustrations are excellent! They show precisely what it is the narrator is trying to describe. The photos take you on a journey through the heart of the catholic churches of Rome. All the architecture and art work are captured so that you know exactly what the narrator sees while you twist and turn through the streets on this fast paced, exciting adventure.Oh yeah, the story was great, too. It kept me glued for hours! Glad I didn't have to break away to surf the web for the pictures. Would have been 5 stars except for the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been a decent thriller...","review":"It could have been a decent thriller if the author could stop 100 pages earlier. Langdon's ability to survive would make James Bond jealous, but the last 100 pages converted this book to a farce. The survival of Langdon jumping out of the helicopter without a parachute put the last nail into the book's coffin.I am only giving this book a second star for some fun I had reading the first few hundred pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"No suspense of disbelief.","review":"Dan Brown is a skilled writer, but the plot of this story is simply too implausible. I did enjoy 'The Da Vinci Code' and especially the controversy it raised.If you like religious fiction as much as I do, then go for 'Journey To Eden' by Max J. Pucher and while the story in there is even less likely to happen, the plausibility, science and history is gripping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why o why did he had to writte the last 2 chapters?","review":"Yet another attempt to take a swing at the Catholic Church!! The books starts OK, an interesting thriller with some basic historical facts and good narrative, but instead of ending it on the right page, the author comes up with a ludicrous story about in vitro fertilization between a priest and a nun and twists an almost believable plot into a piece of trash nor worthy of the foulest waste-basket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please!!!!!!!","review":"Perhaps I was expecting too much, but I found this novel to be poorly written and full of clichés despite an interesting premise. It reads like an old dime store novel in spite of purporting to have scholarly undercurrents. The writing is amateurish, and the characters are all stereotypes. The twisty storyline wears out its welcome by twisting well past its logical dénouement. By the last third of the book I was getting really annoyed with the writing and wanted the book to end.Dan Brown takes an interesting idea and hammers the life out of it in this cheap \\"pulp fiction-esque\\" effort. It'll pass the time, but don't expect much."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the book for you!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Yes, if you enjoy overheated, cliched dialogue, unbelievable situations, characters with no real personalities, and stunning climax after miraculous revelation after shattering denouement until you wish the whole crew would just go home and relax - this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Langdon's first adventure","review":"I'm not going to write any spoilers in my review, so I'll try to sum this book up as best as I can.In Angels & Demons, Robert Langdon has learned that a ticking time bomb of sorts has been buried beneath the Vatican, and he must uncover a series of clues to find out where it is before it goes off at midnight.Robert also learns that a satanic cult named, The Illuminati have come out of hiding and have kidnapped four cardinals and they plan on killing one at the top of every hour, the last killing being at eleven o'clock.Robert only has several hours to find the \\"bomb\\", as well as the missing cardinals, unearth a bunch of clues in the Vatican's secret underground vaults, and race around the streets of Rome before all hell breaks loose.And just like Dan Brown's other book, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" the killer is the person you least expect.\`\`Katrina"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragically awful - stick to the Da Vinci Code","review":"I read The Da Vinci Code before picking up Angels & Demons. Now, I knew that TDVC did not present brilliant writing, but it was a fun ride so I gave A&D a try. Bad idea. The plot was so predictable and the ending made me want to toss the book at the wall....but I don't think my neighbor would have liked that too much. Apparenly Dan Brown has a formula that he likes to follow - \`reluctant handsome hero, and lest not forget brilliant, travels to foreign place to solve crime, is joined by younger female sidekick-destined-to-be-love-interest, together they experience much danger and peril, only to win just in the nick of time and have that passionate kiss with the sunset behind them.' Lame. If you've read TDVC and enjoyed it in all of its 3rd grade reading level simplicity as a merely fun read, then don't ruin that feeling with this atrocity passing as a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Searching?","review":"Ok Dan Brown has done it again by captivating the attention of everyone from Mormons to Catholics. He has set the stage for a new technology and another conspiracy theory in the Catholic Church. I really enjoyed this book as entertainment. But we were really searching there at the end for a story I would recommend this book for a good read. But the story was just searching for something at the end not really as good as the The Da Vinci Code. But carry on DAN you are doing an outstanding job causing great controversy in the Catholic Church and peeling people away from there faith in what they believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice plot, awful writing","review":"Mr. Brown's plot is thought-provoking and complex, though his writing reminds one of the entries in a high school literary magazine. It's a shame that such an interesting premise was tarnished by poor writing. Mr. Brown's heavy-handed foreshadowing makes what could have been several interesting plot twists obvious and mundane, and his liberal doses of \\"character development\\" read like his editor told him he had to put in some background on the main characters...on pages 87, 225, 316, and so on...making the supposedly enlightening looks into the histories of the characters seem misplaced and trite.Next time, Mr. Brown, come up with the story-line and let someone with real writing talent author the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not wait for the book to end.","review":"It is absolutely overrated. In terms of a travel book of Rome it is useful, but the style of writing is burdensome. The whole story could have been written in 5 pages, instead I had to suffer through hundreds of pages. Once I start reading a book I feel obliged to finish it, and this book was really a burden to read. For people that like B movies or thrash novels will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a novel.","review":"This is not a novel. It is not even a book. It is a tedious description of a video game.Dan Brown writes so terribly that he is beyond criticism. No adjective - no, string of adjectives - is too trite or cliché for him to throw in.All I can hope is that Mr. Brown made so much money off this mess of a book that he need not ever write another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exciting in a very dull way","review":"The story being told in this book is exciting, suspensful, and very interesting. The way Brown tells it, however, is nothing short of annoying. He has a knack for pointing out the obvious. Over and over. In fragments. Like this. Then, he recounts numerous tales from the characters' past. The majority of these stories have nothing to do with the current action and offer no insight into the character's psychology, they just fill pages. If you cut out that superfluous character history, the repetition and the messages from Captain Obvious, this would be a much shorter (and very much more enjoyable) read."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun thriller with an interesting premise","review":"Harvard professor Robert Langdon is awakened by a mysterious phone call and has the most thrilling, outrageous and frightening day of his life when he is called upon to use his knowledge of religious symbology to stop a powerful cult from destroying the Catholic Church.Author Dan Brown writes well. The book is a page-turner from start to finish, and along the way you learn a lot and want to stay up late reading. What's not to love? My only complaint is that otherwise intelligent characters are often extremely uninformed about matters of common knowledge -- this is an awkward way of allowing the author to explain things to the readers -- but otherwise I found this to be a thoroughly enjoyable thriller. Violence is not dwelled upon, though people are killed in bizarre circumstances, and the material may be offensive to some Catholics but not most. The book would benefit from a page or two telling the reader what is fictional and what is not.Lots of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow - amazingly bad","review":"I read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" a few weeks back and was blown away by the pace, the style, and the fun I had reading it. So ... I decided to try his earlier novel. It's practically the same story! So how could this one be so bad and Da Vinci be so good? I'm still trying to figure it out. This one has such a formulaic feel to it that it becomes insulting. And what is with the exclamation point?!! Earth! Wind! Fire! Water! And sometimes, question marks followed by exclamation marks?!! This guy has read one too many Robert Ludlum novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Unreadable","review":"I picked this up because I had enjoyed the 'Da Vinci Code.' While I found the writing style of the Da Vinci Code pompous and insipid, it was a great story, and that more than made up for it. Sadly, this early work is unreadable, at least for me. The characters are so unidimensional, and the dialogue so stilted and contrived, that the reader is too distracted to suspend the disbelief necessary to submerge into the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dippy rehash of the dismal DaVinci Code","review":"Let's see, a strange murder by an underground cultic organization bent of discovering long suppressed secrets, followed by a phone call to the sleeping \\"art critic and symbologist\\" who slams the phone down with a \\"call me at the office!\\" attitude, but then can't sleep, wondering....This is the story board for both this screenplay-disguised-as-a-novel and the dismal \\"all of this is really true\\" pack of lies called Da Vinci Code. Dan Brown has one story, and is trying to sell it again. Happily, this one has less of an axe to grind, but just as much non-scholarship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn and run","review":"Awful, just awful. Bad science on every page distracts from what might be an interesting story. Dan Brown should stick to writing about what he knows. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, just lame","review":"The book has interesting elements, lots of history and mysticism, it started out quite entertaining, although completely implausible. But the author gives away the villain in an obvious aside in the first few chapters, why bother reading further? Then, when he could have ended the novel tightly, he continues on and on until you are insulted by how confoundingly dumb the ending is. If he had ended it 200 pages sooner, I could have given it 3 stars. I sure hope the DaVinci Code is not this dumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read and a lot of fun!","review":"I enjoyed this book even more than The Da Vinci Code, because after reading The Da Vinci Code, I was used to Brown's wild imagination and roller coaster plotting. Like The Da Vinci Code, Brown mixes fact and fiction into a thrill a minute mystery that will leave you amazed at his ingenuity and breathless at the fast pace. Sure, his science is a little weak and his history is often a stretch, but his inside view of the Vatican is wonderful and his appreciation for art and art history are an education in themselves. Whenever he seems to stretch his facts too thin, just tell yourself \\"it's only a story\\" and enjoy the ride. It's a lot of fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite thriller","review":"I don't mind authors applying artistic license to the facts--it is, after all, fiction. But I do mind sloppy storytelling. I think that's what this is. It seems that character development and great writing were ignored in favor of action/pace. It's obvious that Dan Brown is a decent storyteller, just not a fabulous one. He knows the elements of good thrillers: setting high stakes, pitting good-vs-evil (even when there is a graying or blurring of them), making the solution time-critical (the ticking time-bomb), a sympathetic protagonist. He just doesn't pull all of it off that well. And there's some ridiculous action toward the end that made me want to throw the book across the room. Is it trash? No, bit there are a lot better suspense/thriller novels out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the movie","review":"Wow hated the book. Loved the movie! To Dan Brown: have screen writers redo your next novel before it's released. They will improve what is incredible and implausible to credible and plausible.A couple examples of the screenwriters improving your story line: In Angels & Demons the book, our do-everything hero, Robert Langdon, bails out of a high-flying helicopter without a chute and incredibly survives with a few scratches. The movie has the camerlengo going up alone.And, incredibly in what is clearly a mega disaster unfolding, the book had only the Swiss Guards involved. The movie had swat teams, commandos and other authorities involved in clearly an emergency situation.Finally, in the movie, Langdon was truly an academic, not Indiana Jones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dan Brown's Series","review":"A wonderful and thrilling read from chapter one. Looked forward to every free moment to continue were I left off."},{"rating":"1","title":"So totally unbelievable and the writing...","review":"Thrillers encompass a suspension of belief that holds the story together. Jumping out of a helicopter and floating down on coattails did not do it for me, nor wrestling down a sarcophgus. Brown's earlier thrillers, although over-the-top, were more believable. Less controversial, but more believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book","review":"I loved this book, I literally did not want to put it down. It is a great story that is masterfully written. One of my top 5 favorite books ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"page turner no doubt","review":"I read this book in less then a week also. Second of the trilogy. Heart thumping, and keep you up past midnight (despite the fact that the kids will be waking you in the wee hours) kind of book. Again I watched the first movie The Da Vinci Code so I could only picture mr Tom Hanks the whole time and hear his voice in my head. I think my only reason for the not5 stars here is the fact of how many times he almost dies. But I think you could almost read this book without the first. The writer keeps you guessing on this one the whole time and just when you think you have it figured out...well you will see. Art and artists will love this one as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful, awful","review":"There are several murders in this book and after reading it I wished I had been one of them. People that are raving about this book should be ignored. They have no credibility or taste. This book is drivel and should be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish, pathetic book","review":"This book is pathetic...it is almost a bad comic book translated into text. The personalities of the characters are stereotyped and unidimensional, things happen without reason. The vilains are as credible as Batman's Penguin. In fact, nothing in this book is credible, from the ultra-sonic space ship-like plane to anti-matter bombs. The heroin's father dies and she has the reaction and feelings of a Miss Universe competitor talking about world peace.It is possible to write a book using fantasy, if you are able to have some drama and some good characters (check Jules Verne). This is not the case. This book sounds like two guys got together for beer, and after drinking a dozen, started to think about a story, adding a character here, an action scene there, a fantastic gun there. The they add the patches together and make a book.It is a mystery to me how this book is a bestseller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big let down","review":"My first Dan Brown experience was with The Da Vinci Code, and what a great book that was. I purchased Angels & Demons shortly after expecting the same thrills. It just wasn't so, I thought this book was a complete let down. Professor Langdon was a weak character in this book and an even weaker, or more like pathetic, excuse for a hero! Overall, a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angels and Demons tour","review":"I just got back from Rome, Italy and took the Angels and Demons Tour offered by Mr. Sergio Caggia's company, Nerone and Rome Made to Measure at www.nerone.cc The tour lasted 8+ hours for us, or they can split it up into two 6 hour days, depending on the clients schedule. Let me put it this way, If you liked this book, you will love this tour! Sergio's guides, we had Mauro, are University graduates, extremely qualified,can get you in to places you could never get to on you own, and make this book come alive. The way I figured it, this tour saved us at least three days of trying to do on our own, as the cab drivers had never heard of some of the locations. This great book is worth a trip to Rome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illustrated edition","review":"If you have not read or want to read DBs books, do yourself a favor and opt for the illustrated editions."},{"rating":"1","title":"imitation late Ludlum.","review":"What a disappointment. I bought this book based on the reviews and while it has some good ideas the style, story and characterisations are so obvious as to make them ludicrous, as is the bad guy. Pick up a second hand copy of some of the later Ludlum rubbish instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written novel","review":"This novel is written for someone who reads at a grade nine level. It's like an action movie on paper without any clever or subtle ideas expressed. I would not recommend it to any of my friends or family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book...","review":"I've read in years. My husband bought it at the airport and having enjoyed The Da Vinci Code, I expected this to be a fun read too. It's poorly written, the plot twists and turns are not believable, and the ending is just ridiculous. I want my time back."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've read one and you have read them all","review":"The Da Vinci code was great fun and I enjoyed it enormously. However when I read Angels and Demons I felt I was re-reading the Da Vinci code -- with some new names,and places and organization. In short Brown used the same plot and just plugs in different historical facts, inventions, and locations. Very boring. You read one Dan Brown you read them all. Don't waste money on his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Insult To The Reader","review":"This book is a waste of time for anyone who prefers to read a novel with credible happeningsAngels & Demons - Movie Tie-In: A Novel. The hero, Robert Langdon, is a veritable superhuman whose mental computations and physical prowess far exceed those of a normal human being - sad that the Illuminati should have chosen to take him on. The reader can delve through pages of his processes and action and then realize only one minute of novel time has passed. Brown twists time to the extent where he might as well have ended the novel on the first page. The end is the \\"crowning glory\\" where Langdon parachutes to safety under a 10 kiloton blast, using only a tarp. If the history of the Vatican and it's churches in Rome is true, it's the only thing which saves this novel from being pure drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the great mysteries of literature...","review":"...namely, why the hell does anyone buy this guy's books, let alone enough of them to propel them to best-seller status?Crude prose, mechanical plotting, ludicrous motivations, cheap suspense tricks, shoddy scholarship and geography, cardboard characters: lord, the list goes on.Seriously, save your money. Maybe its follow-up, ''The Da Vinci Code\\", takes an enormous leap in quality, but I'm not willing to test that theory without some firm evidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd best book by Dan Brown","review":"The precursor to the infamouse DaVinci Code that shocked the world. You can tell the writing style in this one isn't as well polished. However, the final suspense is almost as good as DaVinci Code. You really have to read this one to fully connect with the main character from DaVinci Code."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Gripping easy read","review":"This is a fun, gripping easy read. What I found most enjoyable about this book is how engaging it was. It also appeared to me to be well researched. The characters were believable and I certainly got attached to them. I finished this book in a weekend, too, so I liked how it was a quick read as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Thriller...","review":"This novel was my first exposure to Mr. Brown. I had heard all of the hype concerning \\"The DaVinci Code\\", but realized that this book was the first in the Robert Langdon series, so I purchased it first. I must say that this was a wonderful book. There were so many times when I had to make myself put it down. It is very gripping and very intense. I am sold. The best way to describe this book is \\"well thought out\\". Dan Brown is a master."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I loved the idea of reading about the famous secret society, the Illuminati, and I was not disappointed. Brown's information was so realistic, and I am sure has great truth in it. Constantly I was waiting to see what would be happening next, and to see how smart the character Langdon was. If you want a novel that is filled with historical fiction, this is one for you. The only problem seemed to be that the secondary characters seemed a bit flat. But don't let that stop you from reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Always Read the Book First!","review":"I was taking a long road trip, so I decided to listen to the book first instead of reading it. Big mistake!! The narrator/actor's over-the-top melodramatic style of reading only magnified the annoying way in which Mr. Brown seems to absolutely refuse to give the reader any straight information. We know that Langdon is gazing upon one of the most horrific things he's ever seen, but we won't know what it is for about fifty pages!As the end neared, I found myself getting irritated at a book! Who does that? And I don't know if I was bothered by the content, or the cheesy, dinner theater-style presentation. I adored Da Vinci Code. I think I would have an entirely different opinion of this book if I'd read it first! Lesson learned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll like whichever you read first...","review":"I gave this book four stars only because I probably would've loved it had I not read \\"the Code\\" first. I agree with those who state that these two books are too formulaicly (is that a word?) similar. I pretty much figured out most of the book way before the big reveal, so it was disappointing. Had I not read the other book, the twists may have been more surprising and I would have given the book my rapt attention.At least I know who Vittoria is now."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the same book as the Da Vinci Code","review":"This book was terrible. Interesting info and research but it was EXACTLY that same plot as The Da Vinci Code. In both books, it is easy to anticipate what is coming next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near as good as The Da Vinci Code","review":"This is a messy, often boring and somewhat ridiculous novel. After reading The Da Vinci Code I picked this up expecting a silly but entertaining page-turner. What I got was not only silly but downright retarded. The villain in this book made me laugh. Oh, and the \\"surprise twist\\" at the end is super-predictable. Don't pick this up unless you're in the mood for a laugh (and a lot of eye-rolling)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt cheated! Don't bother!","review":"I just put down the \\"Davinci Code\\" and I couldn't wait to read more, so I picked up \\"Angels and Demons\\". Wonderful! I FIRST thought....I was mesmorized at the beginnning of the book - then (UNFORTUNATELY) - I get to the end and the book and it totally untangles with ridiculous events.After I read the Davinci Code, I talked about it and lent the book to my friends. But Angels and Demons went right into the trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Professor Langdon looked down at his tormentor:","review":"\\"As soon as I finish eating this bowl of New Engaland Clam Chowder. Langdon said, wiping his mouth with the napkin woven from the finest Belfast linen.\\"You will rue the day you woke me from my sleep.\\" Langdon thought.....To the Bat-Sub Robin! Bring Dirk Pitt with ya it's the Joker again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap pulp at best","review":"(warning- Spoiler in feedback) The evidence of historical research supporting the backdrop was commendable. However it does little to elevate the novel beyond pure pulp. Some segments were too far fetched and coincidences too contrived. The principal characters were cartoonish caricatures. The Pope involved in artificial insemination? A priest who just so happen to have a helicopter license? Gimme a break. Save your money. Wait for the B movie version on Spike channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This book is very disappointing. Almost all the quotations in Italian are misspelled and sometimes written in a very poor dialect. Even the names of the most important locations inside the Vatican are ridiculously misspelled. It seems like the author did not spend much time in checking names and quotations. I found this offensive! The author is not aware of the fact the Swiss Guards are only one of the two \`armies' of the Vatican. He is also not aware of the titles of the hierarchy of the \`Curia Romana'. And I have only read 130 pages... I'll keep you posted. Mr. Brown, how is it possible to contact you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Demons and Demons","review":"Was a book that made me want to put it away after completing each chapter... felt like throwing it away after I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foucault's Pendulum for dummies","review":"A shallow, dumbed down version of Umberto Eco's great Foucault's Pendulum. After all of the raves I have heard about this book and this author, I was very disappointed. The characters are predictable and only lightly fleshed out, especially the villians. Everyone's motives in action and in life are easily explainable in a paragraph or two, and many of the characters are just absurd (the assassin especially, or sorry, Hassassin). The plot is filled with historical references and conspiracy theories, but it all feels hastily put together and too light, as if intended for TV. A second-rate thriller at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Da Vinci Code- Beta version 1.0","review":"The editor was asleep at the wheel for this one. So many goofs. There's a lot of bad hokey stuff in this book that makes me scratch my head and wonder WHY or HOW dumb do you think people are? That kind of thing should be cleaned up by the editor.But!!If you liked The Da Vinci Code, you will enjoy this book. The formula is the same:Church vs enemy (science in this case)Langdon teamed up with smart female love interestZealot badguy on the looseLots of clues to solveBig finishWhat a stinker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Cliched it Gives Cliches a Bad Name!","review":"I was thrilled to finally get my hands on a copy of this much-praised thriller, but after the first couple pages I was reading just for laughs---and there were many. The cliches of character, description, action, plot, and just about everything else are a hoot! The characters are so comical, the writing so hackneyed, and the love affair so predictable that this book gives cliches a bad name. If you ever read Alastair Maclean, seen Raiders of the Lost Ark, or most other thrillers of this ilk, you'll groan over this book---my wife and I had a great time on vacation reading passages out loud and laughing aloud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it","review":"I couldn't get past page 100 of this book. The action is the type of junk that I wrote when I was 12 years old. Beyond that, I couldn't tell what kind of book Mr. Brown was trying to write. He mingles bad action, real science, long disproven conspiracy theories, deep religious contemplation, and soap opera romance. It's enough to give any thinking man a headache......guess that's why most of the general public like it so much. 90% of our population couldn't think there way out of a paper bag. I thought I would read this before I read or saw The DaVinci Code.....I don't think I'll do either now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing","review":"I, too, first read Dan Brown through Da Vinci Code and decided to read an earlier work. In many ways, I found Angels and Demons to be more spell-binding, albeit also gorier, than the better know book. It would be quite difficult to make a film of Angels. By including a substantial excerpt from Deception Point, the publishers have hooked me to plan on reading it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm hooked!","review":"Dan Brown is an amazing storyteller! I still like The Davini Code better, but this is a close second and well ahead of his other two. He's improving exponentially with each book and I can't wait for the next to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Da Vinci Code","review":"If you liked \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" you'll love the prequel. I had heard this story was good but put it off for a long time. I came away from reading it with the same feeling I got from DaVinci Code, a hunger to learn everthing I could about the people and places featured in the book and a thirst for a sequel, which is always a sign that I've read a good story.Although I didn't think that Brown did very well with the character development in this story, and this book didn't have as many shocking moments as \\"DaVinci Code,\\" I enjoyed the story more and it was more thrilling. This book was a lot like an educated man's Robert Ludlum: fast-paced and filled with suspense, while containing everything you find in a good issue of National Geographic."},{"rating":"2","title":"great quick read","review":"dan's style of writing is great. quick, easy read, he kept me turning the page. Rob is such a great character. i felt like i was in rome."},{"rating":"2","title":"So so","review":"Another great page-turner from Dan Brown. I loved it until the end, when some ridiculously unbelievable things take place. I won't spoil it, but it just was too much to suspend disbelief over. Which is unfortunate because the story is a great one."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the movie! hands down!","review":"I was hooked all the way through even though there were some redundant parts. Definetly can't judge the book by the movie. The movie completely slashed the story....hated the movie with a passion..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"Dan Brown has me hooked!! He would not be able to write books fast enough to keep me happy!Angels and Demons is a terrific read. The historical information is fascinating. If you liked the DaVinci Code, you'll love Angels and Demons. It is not as predictable as the DaVinci Code and Dan has given more detail and thought to the plot and how he builds the story and its characters. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I haven't read the DaVinci Code yet, but I will after this","review":"I would highly recommend this suspenseful read.....though not if you have a queasy stomach (some scenes are pretty graphic). I picked this up at the airport, expecting the usual fluff, and I was more than pleasantly surprised. I literally could not put it down! With twists from beginning to end, this book incorporates a traditional murder mystery with a fascinating exploration of terrorism, human nature, and the complexities of modern religion. If you're an art history buff, the main character's pursuit of evil based on clues left by Bernini is an added bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding and Hypnotic -- A must read !","review":"From an ancient secret brotherhood to the Swiss Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire, Brown's writing is very entrancing and revealing. You will find it hard to put this novel down. I gave this tale 5 stars because it is very lucid, exceptionally fast-paced and filled with style. From cover to cover it's a religious thriller. I highly recommend it. Here's another novel you should check out: Dragon Man The Adventures Of Luke Starr ... It's a fast-paced fantasy and a real page-turner ... a must-read. You can check it out and read an excerpt at: http://www.dragonman.tv"},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting, if preposterous, premise","review":"Brown comes up with fascinating story ideas but his execution is sub-par.

He appears to be writing for a t.v. movie and takes too little care with his prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"Even though I had long stopped caring I really don't know why or how I even bothered finishing this .Brown's fantasy as the elder scholar coming to the rescue of the young damsel who falls madly in love with him has been tired out for a very long time.Enough already.As for the rest of the \\"plot\\"its pretty much a rehashing or i should say a prehashing of the da vinci code.i suppose the next book will be a posthashing with the masons filling in for the illuminati=knights templar-masons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate anti-Catholic junk","review":"I had to read this book for work, and I hated it! It is not only subtly anti-Catholic, it also contains a myriad of factual errors. These errors might be more easily forgiven if the book did not open with statments of \\"fact\\" many of which are just plain wrong. I was also annoyed with the writer's incredibly cliche style. I read aloud to my daughter a particlarly bad passage of one other character's \\"thoughts,\\" and she quipped that she felt less intelligent after hearing it. Don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less then mediocre","review":"Just like the DaVinci code the book is filled with innacuracies, does this guy really do any research??

It is perfect if you are looking for a page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did you read DaVinci Code yet?","review":"Both books are entertaining but once you've read one, you can easily predict the other. People tend to like which ever book they read first. Still, its worth a few hours of your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taken in...Wanted to escape...","review":"It really was hard to determine if I actually liked the book or not. I enjoy reading Dan Brown, I personally believe he is an excellent author, who has mastered the ability to grasp a reader and not let them go, as he did me with this writing.Though plagued with scientifically preposterous notions, far-fetched adrenaline fueled scenarios which leave you asking \\"how\\" more often than not, and one-dimensional characters; I couldn't put the book down.Through the twists and turns, starting out at CERT, ending miles above the Vatican, Robert, Vittoria, and the host of other characters all have a way of locking you in to their individual roles and personal turmoil.Again, though it is far fetched, and leaves you scratching your head, I would recommend taking the time to read through and not let anyone else's opinion matter. After all, it is entertainment, and since when has reality been that big of a factor in entertainment?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe Too Good??","review":"Really enjoyed the book very much. It was very hard to put it down and stop reading. Also could not wait to get back to it once I HAD to put it down.Very informative about the Vatican and Rome. I have been to Rome once but I feel I want to go again and use this book as a travel guide. Also the ambigrams were fascinating to look at.A word of warning! If you have a little kid in the house and you are supposed to take care of him/her then DO NOT read the book while you are supposed to be looking after the kid. My 10 month old son had done a lot of damage to his room while I was engrossed in the book and I got an earful from my wife. I dread to think what will happen when I start reading the next Dan Brown novel.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than \\"The Da Vinci Code\\"","review":"Great fast paced page turner that will keep you reading until the suprising end.If you liked \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" you will love \\"Angels and Demons!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"How could you not read such captivating words??","review":"Dan Brown only became extremely popular with the fast-paced book, The Da Vinci Code. After reading it, I couldn't help myself to find his other completed novels. He is a master in storytelling, keeps his readers satisfied and wanting more, and an extremely patient man to have researched the information included in his novels.Angels and Demons takes its readers to the Vatican. Robert Langdon, the college professor of symbology, stars alongside Vittoria, a beautiful CERN employee. Throughout their journey the two are engulfed in antimatter problems, lost holy men, and cryptic messages that will leave you unable to put your book down. This book left me looking for more. The man is a genius! You don't have to be looking for a book about religion to like this.Religion or not, you will finish this book being smarter than when you started."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read Adventure","review":"Renowed Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon discovers the resurgence of an ancient secret brotherhood, the Illuminati. This organization has surfaced to carry out its vendetta against one enemy, the Catholic Church. Rushing against time, Langdon runs through Rome following sealed crypts, symbols, and sculptors to save the Church from destruction. This novel is full of intrigue and drama, keeping the reader in suspense. Brown also creatively weaves fact and fiction, descriptively depicting the Vatican. However, Brown lacks focus in his conclusion. After the climatic end, the plot becomes predictable. The suspense built throughout the novel is wasted. Overall, the novel is worth reading. It is a breathless, exciting adventure, hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention Grabbing","review":"Dan Brown really knows how to write a novel, based on facts and historical surroundings. I am amazed at the complexed knowledge he has in so many areas. I LOVE all of the pictures and illustrations.

Where DaVinci's intrigue centers around the art history world, Angels is more of of an action-thriller set in the Vatican. Really enjoyed this one and hope to see more Robert Langdon thrillers in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"Horrible writing, horrible plot, two dimensional characters and so many inaccurate facts on Rome, I wonder if Dan Brown took the trouble to visit it. Not a single soul on the Piazza Navona?? Very unlikely. Climbing La Fontana dei Fiumi to the platform on which the obelisk stands and admiring the magnificant view of Rome?? Admiring the second story windows of the buildings that surround it on all four sides is more like it. The \\"roaring\\" river Tiber drowning out the sound of our hero's voice?? haha. The \\"hidden\\" passage from Castel Sant Angelo to the Vatican??? The passage is in plain side most of the way and mentioned on every tourist map available. This is just plain horrible (and I have not even made it as far as the helicopter episode!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sax Rhomer, where are you now that we need you?","review":"I got about 1/4 of the way through and stopped. The amazement that the Illuminati should still exist baffled me. The characters were childishly protrayed as was the physics. I hated the very short chapters. It made the prose choppy and distracting. I guess in the days of MTV and the quick cut one might expect that an author might try it, catering to the miniscule attention span. The story reminded me of the Fu Manchu novels but those novels were better written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is There Less Than One Star?","review":"To begin with, I will confess that I am only less than 50 pages into the book. Appalled at the quality of the writing, I promised that I would give it 50 pages to improve, since its popularity must surely indicate that there is something to it. Other reviews have mentioned that the characters are one-dimensional, but \\"cardboard stereotypes\\" seems more accurate. Maybe this started life somewhere as a comic book, and, if so, should have stayed there."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Her cell phone had no dial tone...\\"","review":"Of course her cell phone had no dial tone--no cell phone does. His protagonist's claim that early Christians got the Eucharist from Aztec culture is just as preposterous--Christians and the Eucharist were around long before Europeans discovered Aztec culture. These are just a couple of examples of Dan Brown's lazy story telling. I'm with Stephen King on this one. The Da Vinci Code wasn't a good book and neither is this one. It's too bad a hack has gotten ahold of an otherwise fascinating genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"absurd","review":"This book reads like the screenplay to a very bad soap opera. Towards the end it gets so melodramatic that I am suprised Brown did not get sick writing it. I will not even go into the lack of historical accuracy. There are two errors, though, which struck me as particularly heinous (both are rather central to the plot). The notion of a Catholic priest adopting a child is absurd. And since when has the Catholic Church been a proponent of in vitro fertilization? But then, Dan Brown did go to Exeter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written novel insults reader's intelligence","review":"I would guess that this was a first draft of the Da Vinci Code that was deemed too poor a work to be published and then put out to cash in on the success of the Da Vinci Code. In it the author tries to get the reader to accept characters, their actions, and events that are just too implausible. I don't mind a writer making things up, playing with facts and in general messing with the readers head. This is a novel after all. However, Brown's characters are motivated by such cliches and vapid beliefs that I was unable to accept them and allow myself to enter the world of this novel. I won't cite specific examples lest I spoil someone else's enjoyment, but helicopters and virgin births are some prime examples. I read this to get some background for The Da Vinci Code and I never would have finished it without a determined effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must Have Been Written By a Sixth Grader","review":"This book is a major waste of time. I don't know what was more shaky, his science or his religion. In either case this book is poorly written to boot. If you are interested in wasting your time and money, then by all means buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"trash to the trash","review":"Interesting premise but poorly written. You can see the formula writing especially after the DaVinci Code. Don't understand what all the raves are about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Living off the Da Vinci Code","review":"Just a terrible, terrible book. While the 'Da Vinci Code' was not the most well written book, it was at least entertaining. This book completely falls apart about 100 pages from the end. It was like a nine-year-old trying to pull all the parts of the story together and couldn't without resorting to magical thinking and psychotic logic. I am not sure how anyone could write this dribble and keep a straight face. The interweaving of fact and fiction that was the 'Da Vinci Code' was totally lacking in this book. I was half expecting to see John Wayne ride in on a thunderbolt at the end of the book to save the day, that's how absurd this book became."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"If you liked the Da Vinci Code, you'll defitnetly love the prequel to it. This fast paced book takes you through an exciting quest through the secrets of the Vatican. I believe this book was far better than the Da Vinci Code because you coudln't put down this book after you started. The endings of each chapter left you hanging, wanting to know what happens next and the next thing you know your done with this book! I enjoyed reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angels, Demons need Editor","review":"I don't know what happened between \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" but anyone who expects to find a worthy precursor to the Code will be disappointed. The prose limps; the plot is chaotic; there are countless bits of narrative that don't ring true (e.g., an extremely bright young girl raised in an orphanage asks, \\"What does 'adopted' mean?\\"); and the endless ending(s) are as tedious as the twenty codas of those second-rate pieces of classical music that won't quit. I can only conclude that Dan Brown underwent an editorial transplant at some point, with excellent results. It's too bad that his publishers felt it necessary to trade on the success of \\"The DaVinci Code\\" by reissuing this very weak earlier effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another GREATstory from one of America's greatest writers","review":"I have to admit I got hooked on Dan Brown's work purely out of luck. I read The DaVinci Code first, and couldn't put it down. I immediately logged in to Amazon and ordered all his other books. Although I'm not the most religious person, I still found the story captivating and loved the characters. I thought the story dragged just a little in one or two areas, but not enough to detract from the overall power of the story. Dan Brown truly has a gift for taking the reader for a ride they don't want to get off of. Can't wait for his next novel! If you haven't already read his other works, buy them NOW, you won't be sorry later!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Angels & Demons by Dan Brown","review":"I have read several of Mr Brown's books and enjoyed them all. Loved the DaVinci code but then someone suggested Angels and Demons. So I gave it a try. Easily one of the best books I have ever read. The storyline was interesting and believable. I love the way his stories unfold piece by piece. Would gladly reccomend this book to any and all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angels and demons","review":"Harvard symbologist professor, Robert Langdon, was sleeping when the phone rang. A mysterious mans voice is heard, asking him to come to his lab, to study the forgotten illuminti symbol branded on a dead mans chest. Little did Robert Langdon know, that that phone call, would lead to the forgoten sinister illuminti lair, and bloody deaths. Join Robert Langdon as he travels through Rome with Vittoria Vetra, to save Vatican City from a horrible ending of a bomb. Follow him through his journey, as he learns how religion, and science come together."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"While not as successful as \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" \\"Angels and Demons\\" is just as suspenseful and fast paced. The prequel to the massively popular \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" introduces readers to Robert Langdon as he tries to track down an antimatter device that could destroy all of Vatican City. It's a fast paced chase through Vatican City as Langdon tries to stop the device. Having the opportunity to visit Vatican City this past summer, knowing a majority of the locations mentioned in the book allowed me to enjoy reading it that much more. Overall, I would recommend this book to those looking to enjoy a thriller set in a real world environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real suspense thriller!!!","review":"Angels and Demons is defenitly the best book ever!!! Angels and Demons starts off with a man named Leonardo Vetra. He was a physicist at CERN which is the worlds largest scientific research facility. He died due to the fact that the murderer wanted his eye and the man was branded on the chest with a certain name. The name was \\"Illumaniti\\" and thats basically how it starts off. Just in case you don't know who the Illuminati's are I'll explain. The Illumanti's are an ancient secret brotherhood society. I won't tell you more because reading the book is much better and do read it!! It's a MUST!! So for now, until I read a better book, (which I think I won't) Angels and Demons will still stay at number 1 and I defenitly plan on reading The Da Vinci Code!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Have not received the book.","review":"It has been a long time, yet I have still not received this book.

I hope You can assist me with this process.SincerelyMary"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible and Genuis","review":"I can't possibly put into word what I desire to say about Dan Browns writing. So I wont even try. He is certainly a genuis and a natural with talent that can only be inborn. This type of writing cannot be taught or i would have found the teacher and studied with them for years. Brilliant, genuis, and extraordinary is all I can say about Mr. Browns incredible talent. You must read his books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocked...","review":"Solid Read. Great plot, dynamic characters, and it was impossible to put it down once you picked it up. Well researched, well written, well done. Got me hooked on Robert Langdon, and I look forward to seeing if in the Solomon Key the character is given back the spirit that made it possible to stay with the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book to read on a trip to Italy","review":"Loved the book! I read it during my trip to Italy, and it was great to see the places described in the book in life. The book also raises questions of religion vs. science, good vs. evil... food for thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better if you plan to visit Rome some day.","review":"I didn't get into this in the same way as Davinci Code but it is very interesting, especially if you are going to Rome where most of the audio book is centered. It's a little 'futuristic' with a superfast jet, falling out of a helicopter without a parachute and living, etc., but it will hold your interest on a long drive. Long book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this before the Da Vinci code","review":"I am really glad that I read this before the Da Vinci code - it isn't necessary - but it was nice to read it first - to set up a bit of the back story for Da Vinci. I think I liked this one better than the Da Vinci code. I found the story very intriguing and the characters fresh (mind you this was my first foray into this type of book). I definitely look forward to reading more of Dan Brown's books and the first two I have read were definitely eye opening and followed along paths that I was already headed spiritually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"I loved this book; I couldn't put it down. I think that this is just as good as \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". I would recommend this book to anyone weather or not you have already read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining but a bit tragic","review":"Throughout the story, the author has been very successful in holding suspenses and build up reader's expectations and climaxes. With the use of famous artworks, description of Rome's architecture and Galileo's work, the story becomes very interesting and substantial. His description of the hero and heroin are also fabulous; their warmth and faith in each other brings out the bright side of human nature, which is such a big contrast to the coldness of Kohler and the assassin. What surprises me is the sudden change of Camerlango Carlo Francesco. Although the change bring us with a big twist and irony which is needed for the development of plot, as reader, I must say I am unprepared for such a drastic change. As such I am quite uncomfortable after reading the truth of the story due to the tragic ending. Afterall, if you are not too serious with the message of the book, you will find it enjoyable and recommendable to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough to please !","review":"Finished this book in a day. OK it is not classic but it is fun read, with a plot exciting enough to keep me flipping the pages. I know this is fiction but Brown should have tried harder to get his facts right. I am an admirer of the great genius, Michelangelo and Brown has definitely erred in his reference to this great artist's works. First Michelangelo was not the architect of any stair case in the Vatican City. Second the Vatican does not possess any male nude sculpture by Michelangelo, with its stony penis removed . Dan's errors is irritating and a trifle irresposible. Still Angels & Demons is great entertainment and will not be my last book by this writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish","review":"I love to read books and have read many wonderful books by great novelists like Fred Forsyth, Robert Ludlum, Stephen King, Alistair MacLean to name a few. All I can say about Dan Brown and his book is that it is very amateurish and I do not understand what the hype is all about. I guess to the average reader; free masonry, illuminati and the influence they have in our society may have a huge \\"wow\\" factor. From the time of King Solomon's death this sect has been in or around civilization for centuries. If you want to read a more detailed account instead of this drivel by Danny B, check out this site at: http://www.harunyahya.com/globalfreemasonry_introduction.php I would also suggest you read his other books all available for free.

Do your mind a favor and read Eco instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"So suspenseful my blood pressure went up!","review":"I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. I could only devour the pages of Angels and Demons. If you loved Dan Brown's other books, you certainly won't be disappointed with this one. It's swift, breathtaking, and excruciatingly suspenseful."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time!","review":"Unfortunately this book is only being sold due to the success of The Davinci Code. Dan Brown was obviously still working on his \\"craft\\" when he was writing the book. It was far-fetched, ludicris,boring and so not the page turner. I got to the last 25 pages and really didn't care anything about the characters,so rather then waste any more of my precious hours on this earth, I chucked the book in the bin. Four of my fellow co-workers finished the book, told me the ending and ALL expressed disappointment. Many comments were down right vicious in their loathing.

It really is that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchase review","review":"The book I received wasn't the one I expected...

I have a collection for Dan Brown illustrated version (lost symbol and Davinci code) both with hardcover and I was hoping to complete the collection with Angels and Demons..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Although somewhat implausible, highly entertaining and fast paced","review":"As a history buff, I always enjoy seeing historical elements brought into present day stories. So when I read the book synopsis (and having read Da Vinci Code before), I was definitely excited to read this book.Brown does a great job of connecting the historical churches and sites with the Illuminati plot. The suspense builds as soon as Langdon gets to Rome, and doesn't let up throughout.My problem with the book was with the camerlengo character. Without giving anything away, his connection with the plot was not entirely plausible. But fortunately, Brown does a good job of having Langdon pursue the false trails until he picks up the true trail. I really love the sense of history that Brown brings into his books. Unlike the movie, I do recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked the Da Vinci Code? Read this!","review":"I read the Da Vinci Code not knowing what to expect. I loved it. Couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy of the Angels and Demons. At first I wasn't impressed (first 20 pages or so), it started slow. After that I fell into the same trap as with the DVC. I couldn't put the book down! I had to take it everywhere, read at the dinner table, red lights, everywhere until I finished it. It's a completely different type of story from the DVC, there are no codes hidden in paintings, it's still extremely exciting. I even found myself interested in religion, the Vatican, it's past.. I couldn't possibly say whether I liked this or the Da Vinci Code better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan Brown = Cheese...","review":"Give me a break! I was expecting a well-written and somewhat believable novel; instead, I felt like I was trapped in an all-too-predictable soap opera. Dan Brown is a crappy writer and persuaded me, via \\"Angels and Demons,\\" to steer clear of \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\"I admit, I was frightened at first by the hype surrounding the novels, but I foolishly ignored my instinct. Don't make the same mistake I did! As Oscar Wilde said, \\"Popularity is the crown of laurel which the world puts on bad art.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a bit of fun","review":"First of all, I would like to say that I enjoyed this book immensely - because it is a real page turner, and Dan Brown really knows how to write a good story.For all the people who may be turned off by the reviews that point out the factual inaccuracies and impossibility of the actions of characters, don't be. Who cares if a few facts are incorrect? Most people aren't going to know, and why bother pointing them out to the world, and spoil the book? I don't think Dan Brown intended Angels and Demons to be a reference point for scholars, just a novel a person can sit down with, and have a darn good time. If you want to know more about the things he talks about (e.g. the symbolism, the Illuminati, the Masonics, etc), go to a library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book - If you check some reality at the door","review":"This is the first Dan Brown book that I have read and I enjoyed it. In fact I could not put it down. It was quite disturbing but also really made me think, which is an important element in any book for me. Just don't think to much about plausibility or probability.All in all some of the best pop fiction I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to Watch","review":"I really love Tom Hanks, so I admit I'm biased.

I liked him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book!","review":"I still have not read the Da Vinci Code but I just finished this book which is the first book with Robert Langdon and I will definitley buy The Da Vinci Code this weekend.This book has many twists and turns and I never forsaw the ending. It is apparent that Brown has researched Vatican City and Rome extensiveley and it shows in his writing. Books that are fiction but so closely incorporate factual information you can't tell which is which are always the best to read and this one is better than most. There were one or two things that I didn't see happening but I won't rehash them here as I don't want to ruin anyone's read. Let me just say I recommend this book for what it's worth and I advise you get it. I enjoyed it immensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt cheated... read DVC and stop there","review":"I have to admit that, while I found myself annoyed for enjoying the _DaVinci Code_, I felt possitively duped into getting _Angels & Demons_. Okay, the parts regarding the selection of the Pope and the inner-workings of the Vatican and Catholic hierarchy was fascinating. However, unlike _DVC_, I just could not suspend my disbelief and let myself be swept into the story, which, by the way, went on and on and on and on and... several false endings later, I just felt disappointed in myself for being swept into the hype.I did like the clues and the ambigrams, and I did like descriptions of Rome and the art... like its sequel, _A&D;_ made me want to look deeper into the artists described. However, I shall not read any more of Dan Brown's books. _The DaVinci Code_ is a much better story, read it and be satisfied. Or if this was your starting point and you didn't like it, go on to _DVC_."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Could not put it down!","review":"Wow. That was all I could say about this novel. I orginally had planned to read The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown; unexpectedly I found this book, and came to realize that it was the predecessor to The Da Vinci Code.I instantly sat down and dove into this book and simply could not put it down! The further I read in this novel, the more captivated by it I became. Dan Brown manages to create twists at almost every point. Though some parts of the novel slightly confusing, overall the novel was well written, and clear. I would suggest this to anyone who likes mysteries linked with accurate historical information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and thought-provoking!","review":"I love any book dealing with the legendary Illuminati (which I believe, to some degree, actually exists in some form or another). And Dan Brown, as usual, created a great story with plenty of intrigue as well as plot twists. It's only problem might be in the fact it was a bit too long. Sometimes it is better to have exciting books a little faster in pace and shorter in pages, such as \\"Darkeye\\". Though not as great a book as \\"Angels and Demons\\", it is a good example of how you can have an exciting book without too many pages to deal with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I must admit, I had difficulty putting this book down. The story has its faults, but considering how captivated I became in the tale - and how it held my attention throughout, I can't be overly critical.The pace of the story is intense and most of the characters are pretty well developed.

I would warn anyone before reading this book, that if you like it, you may very well end up burning very hot indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommendable if you enjoyed Da Vinci Code","review":"Angels and Demons is the story of the Illuminati and their plot to destroy Vatican City. This group was formed many centuries ago by men of science who were threatened and punished by the church due to their discoveries, most of them against the catholic paradigm. In this novel, the group was far from being extinct and they return for their final revenge: to use their ultimate weapon to destroy their enemy.The novel is highly entertaining. I personally found it better than Da Vince Code, and the end is astonishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sequel is much better!","review":"Okay, so we've read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and now we all have to get a copy of this book so we can be introduced to Robert Langdon and find out all about him. As in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", Dan Brown is obviously a man who does his research before applying it to paper. Everything he wrote in this book is factual, with the exception of antimatter being that's in a state of scientific development. However, I did not find this book to be as exciting as the sequel. In fact, it lost steam before the last sixty or so pages after the crisis was taken care of. And, it leaves some loose ends with the villain's fate being a mystery.In all, the only reason this book is selling so well is because of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". If it weren't for that book, \\"Angels & Demons\\" would be a book no one out there would even care about. Still, pretty goo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it for what it is, a page turning thriller with twists","review":"I tried to read The DaVinci Code several times and just couldn't get into the whole symbology thing. I decided to grab Dan Brown's first Langdon book from the library the other day, Angels and Demons. It does a nice job of setting up who Robert Langdon is and tells a great tale of his mad dash across Rome in an attempt to save the four preferiti and Vatican City. It is not a literary masterpiece, but it's a page turner, and that's what sells these days. There are certainly better written books in terms of prose and character development, but it's an enjoyable ride, knd of like that guilt you get when watching a torrid soap opera or 'professional' wrestling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angels & Demons Audio","review":"I have listened to 100's of audio book and this is the first time I have come across a narrator I will never listen to again. I only listened to 1/3 of the book because I just couldn't stand to listen to this poor reading. The part of the book itself was well written and it's to bad they were not able to get Paul Michael. He narrated the Da Vinci Code and The Lost Symbol - both EXCELLENT books and WELL read.Mr. Poe has a tendency to over act. LONG pauses, even when he says the chapters, it's with so much drama it wants to make me gag. I'm guessing by his voice that he is a chain smoker, because of this you can't tell when the female character and the male character are making statements.Get the book and read it, DON'T BUY THE AUDIO, unless they have it redone by Paul Michaels."},{"rating":"1","title":"No More Italics!","review":"Will someone please disable the italic setup and the exclamation point key from Mr. Brown's computer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I read this after reading the Davinci Code. It follows too much of the same pattern but since I loved the first protagonist, I read on. It is intersting in some parts and gory in others and also exciting near the end but then gets very tedious. Brown manages to totally destroy the book with the ending. It seems he couldn't end with anything inspirational or thought provoking. The ending, in fact, made me angry that he had wrecked the book to propogate his own cynicism."},{"rating":"2","title":"The prequel to the DaVinci Code..","review":"Fantastic, a must read for DaVinci Code lovers! Robert Langdon is again at the center of another riveting and suspensful thriller. Dan Brown has the formula down, he provides good guys, bad guys, a threatening danger, murder, suspense and then keeps you guessing till the end who is the evil mastermind.I won't get all book reportish on you, you can read the above summary provided by amazon. Compared to \\"The DaVinci Code\\", \\"Angels & Demons\\" is like Dan Brown's blueprint for his most famous novel. Similar plot, similar situations leads to a somewhat familiar read.

Sound vaguely familiar?No plot spoiling here, you will have to follow the events which again occur within a matter of hours, not even days. The plot twists are here which makes the read enjoyable and Mr. Brown's style is again excellent matching the teacher in him with the story teller.Overall a good winter read, curled up in front of a big fire place with a heavy Afghan to keep the shivers from becoming too violent as the chase quickens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was disappointed with my purchase. The book I received is different from the one advertised even though it's the same book. The cover was old and the side came apart. The cover did not have Angel's and Demons by Dan Brown on the front cover. It was a plain brown cover. I will never purchase another used book again. I think this seller ruined it for everybody. I just hope the book itself is good since it was a Christmas gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Another incredible book by Dan Brown, and in some ways a prequel (cliché term of the decade) to The Da Vinci Code. This book is actually the introduction to Robert Langdon, the main hero of The Da Vinci Code. It gives you another shining example of his Vatican, cult, and symbollogy knowledge wrapped up in a very compelling adventure story of deceit, faith, attraction, protocol, and of course, Catholic history. Definitely a great story, but don't be fooled: You do not have to read it to understand any part of The Da Vinci Code.There are rare parts that could have moved a bit faster, but they do not greatly impact the anxiety and excitement of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting, Suspenseful, But a Little Over the Top","review":"If you're a fan of Dan Brown's style of writing, Angels and Demons will be a pleasure to read. He mixes religion, history, and a twisting plot that will have you on the edge of your seat. You'll be engaged throughout and engrossed in the story from start to finish.The story did \\"jump the shark\\" toward the end and was over-the-top and lost all believability. While this may translate better for an on-screen adaptation, it will have you rolling your eyes at some of the adventures the main characters come across. If you thought the Da Vinci Code was far fetched, this book raises the bar.But overall I was entertained which is all I could ask for. I'm a fan of Dan Brown's writings and while I know his history and research is at times flawed, he never ceases to produce an exciting page turner that is both easy to read and informative. If you enjoyed the Da Vinci Code, you'll enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN","review":"I felt as if i was there watching the plot unravel. It was not only a piece that i will read countless times, but i will have my children read it, because i feel that this book could have a significant inpact on the future of america. Because i am a kid i was able to look at how Dan Brown made it interesting to the reader by puting in details and facts to spark the imagination of someone my age."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent Fiction book!","review":"The title of my review is \\"excelent Fiction book!\\" because that is what it is. FICTION. I read several of the other reviews where the author discussed how impossible some things are in the book, etc. What these people failed to remember is that Dan Brown was writing a fictional book. In fiction, everything that happens is not required to be factual.Knowing this, I believe this is an excellent book. If you liked The Davinci Code, you'll surely like this book. What happens in Angels and Demons is referenced several times in Davinci Code, so if you were wondering 'what happened last year,' it'll all be answered here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Thriller!","review":"This was a wonderfully exciting book that kept me captivated for the two days it took me to read it. I couldn't put the book down. The ending was a little predictable for me, but still exciting. I would recommend this book to anyone that thirsts for an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blend of fact and fiction","review":"The way Dan Brown weaves fact and fiction in to an action pack thriller is amazing, the suspense never stops and by the end you are ensured you want to buy The Da Vinci Code, and continue the Robert Langdon adventure. Excellent read and definately a book worth reading many times over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of action and suspense!","review":"After all the hype of 'The DaVinci Code,' I decided to start at the beginning with 'Angels and Demons.' I must say, this is one of the best books I've read in a long time. Dan Brown does a great job of putting the reader right there in the action and suspense. Brown's character Robert Langdon races across Rome in order to help solve the mystery of the Illuminati before an advanced scientific weapon detonates within the Vatican itself. It is a great story and the characters come to life with such precision that I can't wait to read 'The DaVinci Code' after this to follow the further adventures of Langdon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angels & Demons","review":"Angels & Demons was a wonderful, captivating book. Though it did have ties to another conspiracy theory, it wasn't nearly to the same level as The DaVinci Code, so I think more people would be able to enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check your common sense at the door, and hang on","review":"The book to which The Da Vinci Code is the sequel. (Published before DVC, so not technically a prequel, if \\"prequel\\" were a technical term.) Almost laughable in terms of character, plausibility, and dialogue (the last line especially); almost admirable in terms of how to craft 700 pages of pure page-turning suspense - \\"almost\\" because it gets so obvious and heavy-handed.If you hated DVC, you'll hate this one too; if you liked DVC, that's no guarantee you'll like this one - it's definitely the less polished of the two. But if you want to just turn off your common sense and get swept away in a mad chase and a silly puzzle (punctuated with some gruesome murders), then you'll probably love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor knockoff","review":"Geez. If you absolutely loved the Da Vinci Code, then I suppose you might like this one. However if you found any weakness at all, forget about this one. All the weaknesses are magnified 100x. It's like Mr. Brown had a week to write a quick book so they could make a movie and this is it. I forced myself to read the whole thing, but I have to say the final 30 pages took 3 days -- I just couldn't get up enough energy to read the last drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"perhaps the worst-written bestseller of all time?","review":"I struggled through the ludicrous and risible, far-fetched and preposterous Da Vinci Code, then thought I would give this author one more chance, despite the horrendous and mind-numbing dead weight of his cliche-laden writing style, by trying this book. Big mistake. It is quite possibly the worst-written book I've ever read. I struggled, waded, crawled and staggered my way through it. Then when I finished it - what a relief - I opened the window and threw the book out into the street. I'm very glad to say it was raining at the time. I will never read another word written by this author again. Yet, strangely, the book left me mildly optimistic: if a bestselling author can dredge up this dross, and write so appallingly badly, and get away with it, then surely there is hope for all of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long serie of mistakes","review":"a) chapters are too many and too short which is unnerving as you have to keep jumping back and forth from one scene to the other.b) half of the sentences in Italian were wrong...a suggestion to Dan: if you don't know a language, please avoid using it!c) some scenes are just ridiculousd) can anyone explain me how a Catholic priest can adopt a daughter?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on","review":"I'm continually surprised by the popularity of this book, as well as its even more well known brother The Da Vinci Code. The only purpose for a book of this kind is to provide diversion from the discomfort of a long plane ride. This book lacks any real character development and boasts the most unbelievable story lines possibly ever written. If asked, I assume Dan Brown would admit that this is not a work of literary genious, but mere literary candy to be enjoyed at the detriment of your own mental health. After all, any author with any intellectual honesty would admit that a book that ends every chapter with a cliff hanger must lack true plot development. Life is too short to suffer through the empty experience of this book when there are so many great books that you would undoubtedly enjoy more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"After reading the Da Vinci Code I thought that Dan Brown had something special which lacked in other fictional authors. I started reading Angels and Demons and it just did not hold my interest at all. The main problem is that it jumps right into the plot without developing the characters. It also mixes like a thousand plots at the same time. I didnt even read further than page 100."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really amazingly bad","review":"I have a bad habit. Once I start a book, I finish it, Hell or high water. Only thus can I explain how I got through this one.Paul Laughlin's review is excellent but generous. The book is full of idiotic errors. The supposed geniuses who populate it are amazingly stupid. The relationship between science and the Catholic Church portrayed here is unconnected to reality. The plot twists make a Paul Bunyan story look sober and realistic.OK, we expected all that. What surprised me is how badly written it all is. The writing is clumsily manipulative. The dialog is awful: X delivers a lecture while Y repeatedly gasps in amazement at the astonishing and shocking things he says (which leave you yawning). The plot is completely predictable. I guess, from reading the other reviews, that some readers actually WERE surprised by the ending, but for me the only surprise was the absurdities Brown was eager to commit to force the story to follow its predictable rut."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a fit of rage I threw it against the wall at page 510","review":"After the hero jumps out of a helicopter at 15,000' using only a tarp as a parachute, surviving an anti-matter explosion on the way down, only to land safely in the river where coincidently a doctor sees him land and revives him. (His third or fourth time he has escaped death today). All the while, the \\"pope\\", who had a parachute, is pretending a miracle has happened as he has landed atop St. Peter's to the roar of the crowd. JEEEEEEZ Get me outa here!!! Even as a movie, this would get boos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insultingly written","review":"The first page of the book starts with the word FACT, and then goes on to discuss antimatter. There are at least a half dozen errors on that page. This sets the tone for the book. Dan Brown's blatant disregard for accuracy is an insult to the reader's intelligence. If you're going to write a techno-thriller, then you have to get the technology right. There may be a good story buried in there somewhere, but if you know any physics what so ever you'll be so distracted by the glaring errors Brown continuously makes that you'll never notice it."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than The Da Vinci Code","review":"Being a Catholic, I enjoyed the Da Vinci Code very much (the Mary Magdalene theory is fascinating to me) and when I learned that Dan Brown had actually written an earlier book featuring his hero, art history professor Robert Langdon, I knew I had to track it down. Well, due to the popularity of The Da Vinci Code, it was not hard: I found a mountain of Brown's books at Price Club!Now that I've read both Langdon books I can declare that Angels and Demons is the better of the two! It's a richer story about a mad plot to destroy the Catholic Church by killing the Cardinals of Rome and annihilating Vatican City itself! Plus it's a better-written thriller which established a formula that was re-used in The Da Vinci Code.I could NOT put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought!","review":"While you can read the countless reviews of the plot, I'm just going to stick to my opinion... This book was close to being a great book (while I agree with some that the ending was a little too unbelievable, it was different). It reminded me of what a Michael Creighton book should be. Unlike Creighton, Dan Brown, in this story at least, takes a piece of non-fiction and makes it interesting WITHOUT the canned plot. The story and history of the Illuminati was very interesting, and the fictional portion helped moved the story along devoid of being the same old boring stratagem. The amount of \\"near-misses\\" and other such plot-devices were kept to a minimum.One word of caution... This might not be a good book choice for the deeply religious. I know that while I was reading it all of my Catholic teachings came roaring back in my mind. But if you can put that aside and enjoy it for what it is, a work of fiction, you'll be glad you decided to pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"mildly entertaining... for people who enjoy bad writing","review":"The book is written in such a poor format that nearly every chapter ends with a \\"surprise\\" fact which any semi-intelligent person can figure out. On a few occasions, words like \\"Art\\" even have their own paragraph. You will find phrases such as \\"despite the satisfaction in his loins\\" in some of the most terribly done chapters I've read. The characterization is completely flat, the plot is predictable, and the author obviously had no confidence in the reader's capacity to think.I gave this two stars because the book was just that funny. Also, some of the scientific discussion, although painfully slow-paced, has interesting theories."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave it 60 pages and gave up and skipped to the end","review":"\\"Hey, Vittoria!\\" \\"Disprove any more of Enstein's theories?\\" \\"The carmelango is in danger! Open the door! Hurry! But it was too late.\\" \\"Dawn came late to Rome.\\" If you think this is good writing you will enjoy reading the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read worse","review":"It's not that bad, really; just phony. And very manipulative. Also, makes one think Vatican City and Rome exist for [weak] literature's sake. It features an American hero only our Harrison Ford can immortalize for the US collective psyche. One more thing: the author should urgently hire an Italian editor, because most of the Italian quoted in the book is ridiculously wrong, and occasionally plain Spanish. Kind of embarrassing for a book that wants to appear well researched in Italian culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most. Predictable. Book. Ever.","review":"Only resurrected due to the success of the Da Vinci Code. No question why this book was never a hit until after that one came out. More like a \\"practice\\" manual for Da Vinci, working out the kinks in his writing style.Book drug on forever, one of the few books that I could not wait for the ending to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to suspend disbelief..at all..not one bit.","review":"Am I glad I checked out the reviews here so that I can feel better about not liking this book. Oy. I've tried 3 times to get beyond the first 15 pages and I just can't do it. Ditto exactly Jane Bond's earlier review! I, too, read the Da Vinci Code, which was interesting at the time, but this overwrought Angels and Demons feels like been there and done that and don't want to repeat it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just painful","review":"After the first 100 pages I was starting to feel the pain - that dull throbbing right before a full-blown headache. For some reason I was convinced to persevere. Someone swore it got better was worth finishing. And the experience got more and more painful. At least in Da Vinci Code the book was interesting to the halfway mark. In Angels and Demons it was over much sooner. Yet another example from Dan Brown of what authors should not do."},{"rating":"1","title":"a grown up version of the famous five","review":"being a fans of Eco's, i found Dan Brown's book as entertaining stuff but not satisfying. The bad guy is easily predicted, the girl (vittoria) is merely there for the sake of romance...and its not a good romance either. It feels like hollywood movies, some indiana jones/007 stuff. I was hoping something like the Foucault Pendulum...but what i got is a grown up version of Enid Blyton's famous five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foucault's Pendulum \\"Lite\\"","review":"All in all, this has the feel of a wannabe. I really could not get over the kind of \\"dumbed down\\" feel of the stereotypical \\"Harvard professor\\" with his tweed schtick long enough to feel like I was reading something worthwhile. Having read Umberto Eco's \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\", this felt a little like the juvenile version, watered down with enough summer thriller plot cliches to appeal to the beach reader and fool them into feeling like a \\"serious reader\\".If you want a book that spoon feeds you a plot that shouldn't be too difficult to predict after 15 pages, this is the one for you. If you want the real read, pick up \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" and commit to expanding your vocabulary and your attention span for more than is required of the 30-second commercial spot."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Illuminates","review":"For anyone with a love for art and thrillers, this is the deffinite book. Dan Brown is amazing! This book keeps you chasing page after page along with the characters to see how it unfolds. Robert Langdon is quick and intelligent. The plot is unique and breathtaking. The Illuminati is a brotherhood you'll never forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining","review":"I grabbed this because of the title. I love books about Angels and Demons. The back cover mentioned a guy out to save the Vatican. It sounded cool.However, it had nothing to do with either angels or demons. It was one long anti-Catholic diatribe. It criticizes the Holy See for spinning rumors then does just that itself. As a person of faith, this reader found the writer to know nothing about faith.The Vatican apologized to Galileo - publicly - about 10 years before Brown wrote his book. Science and religion CAN walk hand in hand. Today, scientists study the power of prayer and communicating with those who have passed on. The Vatican has had its own observatory in Arizona for decades. As far as faith protecting believers from all harm - that's about the silliest thing to say about a faith launched on a man who was crucified.It was entertaining. I do feel very sad for folks who think this stuff is truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to be kidding!","review":"My reactions as I read this book went from \\"Ewwww!\\" to \\"man, this is exciting and intriguing!\\" to \\"Huh? Did he do any research at all?\\" to \\"Oh, give me a BREAK!\\"If you can suspend your disbelief long enough to have fun reading this airplane/beach read, well, good for you. It IS exciting. The only trouble is, it totally falls apart if you stop to think about it or actually check many of his 'facts'. As for the ending...words fail me. Dear, oh, dear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After finishing \\"The DaVinci Code\\" (a good book, but IMHO a little overrated) I bought this book. It's nothing more than a bad clone of TDVC (or maybe a rough draft, as it's older). The story and the characters are not believable. Cardinals are depicted as superstitious and gullible: in real world Cardinal are skilled politicians before being priests, and I am sure they are less prone to believe in miracles than the average believer is (well, I'm an atheist, so probably mine is not a fair vision).Moreover, as an Italian, I was bothered by the several errors in the very many Italian sentences the book contains. I think that Mr Brown could have had them corrected by an Italian, or not included them at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twists and Burns?","review":"I must say that most of the book is enjoyable. It is a very engaging read, that makes you want to continue to read. Whether you believe all the author writes doesn't really matter, it is fun to read. However, the most important part of the book (the conclusion) is beyond belief! The author adds twists that are not needed nor believable. The book should have ended at the conclusion of chapter 123 or at least that is where it is should have stopped adding new developments. Unfortunately it doesn't. The rest of the book is the author trying hard to make \\"miracles\\" of his own (like how can I add another 100 pages without really writing anything worth reading). It's too bad that such a fun book for the first 400 pages has to end so poorly. I would recommend reading it, but stopping after chapter 123."},{"rating":"2","title":"predictable, but fun","review":"for those of you who liked the davinci code, this will be a fun read. d&a is terrible literature, like davinci, but is a fun read. it follows the same general formula, but has a couple different twists, and has more of that is-it-true-or-not church history. okay, so you generally know how itll end.. but whatever. its still fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK, so I'm not a physicist...","review":"...or looking to become one. Errors, shmerrors. I thoroughly enjoyed this book for the terrific story it was written to be.I had the good fortune to read Angels & Demons before I got to DaVinci Code. In fact, I read all of Brown's books in the order written, and having done so actually found Code to be somewhat anticlimactic.Having heard so much press on Code, and being so impressed with A&D, I set myself up.I loved the characters (looking forward to the next Langdon tale!) and the suspense was delicious. A truly riveting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining It Is","review":"The science buffs are critical and the religious buffs are contemptuous. The reviews are entertaining. Jealousy simply oozes from some. This book has been reviewed over a 1000 times and my guess is author Dan Brown is smiling.The Pope is dead and it is time to select a new one. Unfortunately, others have plans as well. Enjoy the story without getting lost in the science and religion. It is entertaining, even if not entirely accurate. It is a novel after all!This book stands on its own as a character prequel to the Da Vinci Code."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzz *snore* Zzzzzzzzzzzz <cough cough>","review":"Seems like a bubble gum rip off of Umberto Eco's \\"Fouccault's Pendulum\\". I haven't been able to finish it.

I do want my money back!","review":"This book is very disappointing. Almost all the quotations in Italian are misspelled and sometimes written in a very poor dialect. Even the names of the most important locations inside the Vatican are ridiculously misspelled. It seems like the author did not spend much time in checking names and quotations. I found this offensive! The author is not aware of the fact the Swiss Guards are only one of the two 'armies' of the Vatican. He is also not aware of the titles of the hierarchy of the 'Curia Romana'. And I have only read 130 pages... I'll keep you posted. Mr. Brown, how is it possible to contact you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Pages","review":"I was so excited to start this series. Unfortunately, when I went to start this book, the first 9 pages were missing. In the garbage the book went :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd, Ludicrous, Infantile...","review":"This is the most ridiculous book I have read.. maybe ever! The only way it succeeds is in earning more royalties for Mr. Brown.The plot is far fetched, but remotely plausible. But the revelation and resolution of the primary threat purely by devine intervention is way too much, and the escape from the helicopter is just plain stupid. The plot has no depth... the bad guys (arab extremist, of course ... trite and hackneyed) are all bad and the good guys, all good. To think I wasted my time in reading this one dimensional work when there are great reads awaiting, well it just plain hurts!Brown's The DeVinci Code was great. Such a shame he stooped to this level on Angels and Demons. The author hath no pride!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Amazon should have better control over used materials that are sold on their website. The used audiobook CD's I received were in a filthy case that was taped to hold it closed. Upon removing the tape, the case fell completely apart, the front and back covers falling away from the rings holding the CD sleeves. One of the CD's was scratched.The case also had a library label on the spine, which tells me that the seller bought it from a used book sale at a library! Probably for much less than the $8.00 he sold it for on Amazon!! I will not buy any other used materials from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"For his next book, I wish Dan Brown would investigate...","review":"The KFC secret recipe. Or maybe the Big Mac secret sauce. By the way, I don't think Dan Brown is his real name. Sooo generic. What - was \\"Joe Smith\\" taken?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fact and Fiction","review":"Angels and Demons, like all of Dan Brown's books are best read without taking his words as facts. If you start checking his claims, they start to crumble. 'Novus Ordo Seclorum' doesn't mean New Secular Order but rather New Order of the Centuries - and this is just one of the things that jumped at me, without even doing any in-depth checks.One of the things that bother me is that although all his characters are scientists, they talk and behave like idiots, as Dan tries to explain to his readers some scientific concepts he doesn't understand himself.Like all his books, A&D; is full of mysteries, twists and turns, some more effective than others.Overall, it's an enjoyable read for a rainy Sunday. Just don't take it too seriously"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oops he did it before!","review":"Angels & Demons is a well-researched book. Dan Brown has a mind for mystery/thrillers. He must have been a handful as a child. A mind with so many secret doors must have been hard for his parents to handle. Reading The Davinci Code made me want to read Angels & Demons. I was just as impressed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"If you read \\"The Davinci Code\\" first, don't waste your time with this one. I thought it would give me more insight on the characters of \\"The Davinci Code\\", and it didn't. It is the exact same plot as DC with a different setting and characters. It will truly spoil any love you have for DC and give you a very low opinion of the author who has actually written some good books. So I beg you not to destroy your mind with this crap. And, Dan Brown, do us all a favor and write and original story for once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book 'till the end","review":"This was another great book by Dan Brown untill the part with the helicopter. When Robert jumps out, he so happens to grab a tarp and it so happens that the tarp is big enough to slow down his fall. He falls a few thousand feet, AND WALKS AWAY ALMOST UNHARMED!. That almost ruined the book but this ruined the book. After Robert leaves the hospital, the camcorder still works, and it confesses the whole evil plot. Like I said, great book, till the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been There Done That","review":"This author redefines \\"formula\\" writing. Angels and Demons is essentially The Da Vinci Code with the same wafer thin characters in a different setting and slightly different plot.Great setup, just as with Da Vinci Code - this one involving a secret organization and corruption in the Vatican. But much of the action is so silly it takes away from the potential drama. Langdon's escapes are just too lame. The final one is so ridiculous I wanted to throw the book across the room. Yes, it's a novel, but it's distracting and less enjoyable to me when things get that unbelievable.However, this is certainly a page turner. If you like your novels light and cheesy, it's a fun and quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio-Did not even get me to work","review":"In the perpetual search for audio material for my two hour daily commute, I latched on to Angels and Demons with great anticipation. I'd found DaVinci Code annoying in some matters of style (every chapter cliff hangers) but enjoyed it all the same. Several days' entertainment with Angels and Demons would be welcome.I gave up before getting to work this morning having not even completed the first disc. I just could not endure any longer. I simply found the voice the narrator used for Langdon so annoying I could listen no longer. Langdon is voiced in an overwrought manner with every enunciation a groan. Coupled with the melodramatic style described by other reviewers, when it was not laughable, it was annoying. Who needs to start the day like that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"I sort of enjoyed The Da Vinci Code, despite being skeptical of many of the \\"historical facts\\" embedded in the story. Angels and Demons, even though it was written before DVC, is more of the same, though less carefully written. I am not even going to finish it.If you're interested in the history of science, read The Discoverers, by Daniel Boorstin, which is non-fiction but exciting reading anyway. Only read Angels and Demons if you have already read everything else and just want to pass the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please....","review":"After enjoying the yarn Brown spun in THE DAVINCI CODE (albeit while overlooking the pitifully cliched characters), I picked up this prequel. However, you'll have read another review to find out if any of the story after page 9 is worth your time. I stopped there. When a briliant, handsome, single, wealthy Harvard \\"symbologist\\" walks into an airplane hanger to find a futuristic jet that travels 15 times the speed of sound and is owned by a private nuclear research company, and THEN climbs aboaord like it's no big deal to settle in for an hour's flight from Boston to Geneva....that's where I get off the boat. Au revoir, Mr. Brown."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start","review":"Angels & Demons By Dan BrownThe setting is Vatican City; the plot is contemporary with some historical background.The science fiction requires a subsection of belief, but so does most science.The characters are well rounded; the reader will find them easily to empathize with.At 569 (paper back) pages this is not a fast read, but it is fast paced enough to hold the readers interest.The book is graphic in more ways than one, this is not a book for the Harry potter set, and there are adult themes here in a very believable context.I generally liked the book; it stands up well on its own, or with the DA VINCI CODE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, spell-binding.","review":"I'll have to say this book is one of the best I've ever had the pleasure to read. I thought it was the maybe even the best, but that was before I read The Da Vinci Code. Dan Brown weaves a tale that keeps the reader wanting to turn quickly to the next page to see what happens next. Robert Langdon is another later version of Indiana Jones, but to my way of thinking, the characterization of Langdon is even BETTER than that of Indiana Jones. I hold nothing but the greatest of admiration for Dan Brown for his intelligence and wit in the writing of this novel. And even more so, because Brown takes the reader where most authors fear to tread. And he does it so well at that. I only wish I could give this book a ten-star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"Although I found this novel to be an exciting and fast-paced adventure mystery, I didn't think it was as good as Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" Maybe Dan Brown just got better the second time around or maybe I should have read \\"Angels & Demons\\" first. I didn't find \\"Angels & Demons\\" to be quite as believable as \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\"Robert Langdon is definitely a well thought out character and very likeable. The ins and outs of his adventure held my interest. I didn't want to not finish this book.

What an experience!!! Yes, there might and will always will be someone who is not happy about these type of stories, but it is fiction, even though there are some elements of truth. These books make you think and wonder. They captivate you and keep you in suspense until the last page.I hope Dan Brown will consider further adventure of Robert Langdon, or create an equal strong sequence, full of secrets, where myths and facts inter-wind resulting in an awesome reading.Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"I cannot believe I waited so long","review":"Just excellent work by Dan Brown. I could not take it off my eyes and my hands once I started reading. Highly entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ripping Yarn","review":"This novel by Dan Brown, the author of \\"The DaVinci Code\\", is, not unsurprisingly, just as fast paced and as full of plot twists. Following the exposition, the action takes place almost entirely in Rome and the Vatican. In a macabre version of a treasure-hunt, the hero dashes around Rome following clues left long ago by Bernini, the 17th century sculptor. Incidentally, you will learn more than you ever needed to know about Bernini's masterpiece \\"The Ecstasy of St. Theresa\\". Anyway, it's a ripping yarn, combining mystery with science fiction, medieval secret societies, and the inner workings of the Vatican!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Review","review":"Stop if you've heard this before. An ancient secret organization is out to destroy the Vatican and bring down modern Christianity. It is up to Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon, with help from a beautiful scientist, to put together pieces of the puzzle that will stop the bad guys. If it sounds familiar, it's because it is the same exact plot of \\"The DaVinci Code\\", also written by Dan Brown. This story is the prequel to \\"DaVinci\\" and introduced the world to Robert Langdon.I've read this before and wanted to re-read it before the movie is released later this summer. Personally, I enjoyed this book more than DaVinci, primarily because I enjoyed the setting more. It's a quick and easy read that is perfect for reading during a flight or commuting on the bus or train."},{"rating":"2","title":"smooth reading","review":"This book is even better than the movie. I usually read the book first, but didn't this time. After seeing the movie I bought the book, and though there are a few differences, the movie stayed pretty close to the story. The differences made the story even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angels and Demons","review":"Angels and Demons was a quick-paced and thrilling read. Dan Brown is a master at creating cliff-hangers at the end of his chapters that make you want to keep turning the page. I just had a little trouble with the ending of the book. It seemed to me that you really had to suspend belief to accept that all of the events could occur in such a short time-span without the \\"hero\\" being beaten to a pulp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dissapointing Finish","review":"Wow, I loved this book, that is until the last hundred pages. At the end Mr. Brown added twists and implausible senarios which took away from the well researched thrill ride of the first four-hundred pages. Angels and Demons is still a book worth reading, but not a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable but long book!","review":"I actually thought this book was pretty well written. I really liked the style and pace of Dan Brown's writing. The story starts off kind of hokey and boring,but gets very fast paced past page 100. The subject matter is pretty interesting, having seen the movie years ago. I really liked the book's more detailed explanation, and it wasn't as confusing as the movie. The whole Illuminati vs. Catholic Church battle is an interesting subject to write a novel on. Let alone a fast paced thriller, makes Dan Brown a pretty good author. My only gripe about the book is that it's pretty long and lengthy. It's a great novel,if you have alot of spare time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan Brown, crap peddler...","review":"As the great Bob Marley once said: \\"is Mr. Brown controlled by remote?\\" The answer is \\"yes.\\" If you are a revolutionary the easiest target is to attack a target that can't fight back. Hence, the Catholics.The book in a few words: unimaginative bird vomit, but perhaps that is isn't descriptive enough: BORING bird vomit, but don't take MY word for it, I am a professional book reviewer..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor follow-up.","review":"I started to read Dan Brown's book but could never finish it. He has a nack for performing all these feats in a matter of two or three hours that would take the ordinary person several months to accomplish...he's amazing for his lack of timeliness. I also think, and I came to the conclusion with this book after reading the DaVinci Code that he is anti-Catholic. I'm not sure what's eating him but something must have happened to him in the past. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, in fact I've got a copy that I could give away if anyone would take it. I won't read anymore of his books nor will I recommend them to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome book!","review":"The book, angels and demons i think was a very exciting fast paced book with an unexpected ending. It starts out with proffesor named robert langdon who teaches on symbology at harvard. He is asked for help identifing an anchient symbol burned onto the chest of a scientest. The book picks up pace as the reader finds out as a result of a pope who died there was an \\"election\\" for a new one but the anchient illuminati anti-cathlioc group had kidnaped the 4 main canidates for pope. And you find out the illuminati steals a little of antimatter, cappible of destroying the entire vatican and hurting the cathloic curch verry much. The book is basicly about that one night as it follows a crazy chase to find the 4 cardinals before its too late, and the antimatter before it destroys eveything. The end of the book revals a very intersting twist to the story, overall it is just a good book that i would say is very hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"insulting","review":"This book was an insult to intelligence, period. Don't waste any brain juice on it, absolute garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit chaotic","review":"I listened to this book in its entirety on CD. I really enjoyed the twists and turns. I should have read it in print instead though, it is a lot to swallow on a long drive. I do enjoy religious thrillers. I think the Left Behind Series in some ways is better, and in some ways, this is better. It just depends on personal preference. I always felt the Pope's protege was up to no good from the beginning. Even in reality, there's always something very mysterious going on with the Vatican and the Pope, so I think it gives people a sense of being \\"in the circle\\" of knowledge, even if it is fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's God Awful!","review":"A&D is so full of trite cliches it's painful to read. I even said that I'd stop reading it if I saw \\"she moved like a cat\\" and I wasn't disappointed. A textbook of metaphors and similies could be written for young students using this as it's only example. Give it a pass unless you are 12 and hate Catholics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story.","review":"I enjoyed the story, very much. As usual, Mr. Brown brought forth some things to think about. There were a couple of points that I thought went \\"over the top\\" and therefore caused me to say to the writer \\"Oh, come on\\". I did, however, have a hard time listening to the audio version. I did not get the end of every 3rd or 4th sentence, it dropped too low. If Mr. Poe could keep from losing so much of the text it would have been much more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely amazing!","review":"i literally could NOT put this book down- i found myself reading it as i walked out of the door to my car!The pace is breathtaking, exciting and fantastic- i have never read a book so fast paced. If you want a quick, exciting read, this is it. Science fiction, mystery, horror, detective, and romance fans will love this book. There are plenty of other reviews describing the plot, which is amazing.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"God Awful","review":"This is the first book I have ever chucked across the room in frustration. After reading the Da Vinci Code, I figured I was in for more of the same. I can't stand Dan Brown's writing style, but enjoyed the plot and factual background of the story.Angels and Demons has about half the historical and factual background as the DVC, and the plot is a million times more ridiculous. Too many twists and turns. I'm all for poetic license, and can shrug my shoulders at a few \\"well that would never REALLY happen\\" moments, but this book is just silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Lesser Known Book","review":"Of course everyone is reading the DaVinci Code by Dan Brown, but the prequal about the same character is equally absorbing and one of the hardest books to put down that i've read in monthes, i loved the entire story except for the very very end, the end of the main story was great but the last few pages were a disappointment, however i overall loved the story, i would give it a 4.5 but thats not an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book! Great action!","review":"If you have never read anything by Dan Brown - this is a good place to start. Great action, a lot of surprises, and you definitely can't guess the ending! Both my husband and I (who have different reading styles and interests) enjoyed it tremendously and had a hard time putting it down once started! This is a really good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Dan Brown hit","review":"Phenomenal book with so many unseen twists. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it just kept surprising me near the end. But, if you're too lazy to read the book there is a movie made after this book. Warning though, the movie is atrocious."},{"rating":"1","title":"B.C.W","review":"I read all Dan Brown's book. First was really amazed by his talent so I went on and bought the whole set. Then I realized his every book is all the same. They all apply the same writing techniue. A great danger for a brilliant author like himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched","review":"I couldn't wade through this dreck. This is one of the worst books I've ever attempted to read. Cardboard characters, unbelievable plot, and extraneous and boring detail substituting for plot development made this work unreadable. I rarely encounter a novel that I cannot finish, but this book went into the \\"donate\\" pile after I'd read about a quarter of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO WAY.--I'll take the Devil.","review":"I have read the Da'Vinci Code, and I loved it-Angels & Demons, propaganda, from hype. I picked up Angels and Demons as a package with Billy McCarthy's The Devil of Shakespeare, and I have to say, this Billy (who's a fox) guy has \\"a first' that absolutely blows this book away. Angels & Demons is living proof, give it 3 or 10 books to skyrocket the author. The Devil, is nothing like Angels & Demons, but what are we all here for?? Original Voice, CHARACTER, CHARACTERS--not politically motivated brain-wash from someone who finally got it write--finally, on Da'Vinci and never on Angels and Demons. I'm sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This is more of a comic book interspersed with art history and symbology. It's the kind of book you read in a few days and then discard or use as a doorstopper, not the kind literature that will last... although, great material for an action-packed Hollywood movie for teenagers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible","review":"It reminded me of Jurassic Park. Ok to read to pass the time when nothing else was around during a snow storm."},{"rating":"1","title":"filth","review":"my friend's trash roommate and her hick boyfriend like this book...enough said. this is a poor man's stephen king or nelson demille novel. most of the book has no plot, and when there is, its stupid and unbelievable. if this book had a soundtrack, it would be the polyphonic spree. you really feel stupid after reading this, for 2 reasons. 1-the plot kills brain cells and 2-you think of the money you wasted down the Stop n Shop book aisle (because thats the only place that will sell this!!!) if you are still interested, just wait for the public access movie version of this terrible piece of \\"literature\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE MORE NAIL IN THE PARANOIA AGAINST ARABS","review":"Guess what...the great killer (Hassassin) of this book is a member of the Hashishins, an Arab sect extinct in the Middle Ages during the Crusades.Mr. Brown could not have the creativity to think of a better example of \\"evil\\" than an arab - not a white, japanese, chinese, etc, it had to be an arab killing people all over Rome.Things like this help to feed the constant paranoia of the West against Arabs and Muslins.Bad book, bad characters, same book as \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", once you read this last one, you read all, plus you get more influenced by his anti-arabic paranoia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Note to Dan.","review":"STOP INSULTING YOUR READERS INTELLIGENCE. With that said, I would like to say this book is the biggest bunch of garbage ever compiled in the history of mankind. Yet, so is the Davinci Code. My main problem with this book is it's so artificial like the anti-matter bomb ergh! We know right in the beginning the anti-matter bomb will go off in the end. How stupid do you think your readers are? Yes, most people love your novels and I was told at the local bookstore by an idiot to buy your other piece of garbage (D-CODE). Yes, you will be number one because your books are all about heresy. That's the main plot of your books and the reason they sell. I've warned people about your idiotic excuse for a book, but they won't listen. Hopefully, someone sees all the bad reviews and sees the thread of insulting, cliched, and waste. And realizes that were not lying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"This book tries to give science and religion equal grounds on which to stand which is its fatal mistake. You just can't be divided down the middle on a topic that involves God, you either believe or you don't, Brown tried to write a book that did this but it was apparent that he figured he needed to choose a side in the middle of the book and chose to side with religion. This is the reason why the book should only be read by certain people, if you consider yourself highly religious or an atheist then this book just isn't for you, the book is very irritating to read; only the slightly religious could probably read it without wanting to burn it afterwards. My advice, DO NOT READ THIS PIECE OF CRAP!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"This is some of the worst prose you will ever read. Does anyone else detect the not so subtle tone of racism directed at Arabs in this book? Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read this book as Pope John Paul II was in his last days!","review":"It was so exciting to have read this book at the same time Pope John Paul II made his heavenly transition. I was following along in the book as the true life events in Vatican City (conclave, electing the new Pope) were occuring; the comparisons were right on. What a story! I was hooked on this book the minute I finished the first page. Great book, great author, quality time spent on the imagination!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timely Re-Release","review":"Dan Brown's carefully researched material provides an authentic setting for this thriller. I enjoyed \\"Angels and Demons\\" even more than \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", which was educational and exciting. \\"Angels and Demons\\" is gripping and well paced, and also provides insight into the procedures for the election of the Pope. The timing of the re-release, given the health of the current Pontiff, is fortuitous. Thank you, Dan Brown, for another great read. I look forward to your future works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard characters, interesting information","review":"The idea has a lot going for it - the execution is poor. The only reason I finished it was to read about the sites in Rome and their history. This reminded me of Clive Cussler - male series character, new woman in every book, obligatory relationship. Ian Fleming did it better. Nowadays the females get interesting professions but it's really their appearance and attraction that get the attention. There isn't any character development that is shown rather than told.The villain became obvious fairly early on. The last couple chapters involve a twist that seems written in according to formula.I had high hopes for this. The author obviously has a lot of knowledge and good plot ideas. The writing, however, is so flawed that it robbed the book of any charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angels and Demon editors","review":"This book is badly edited. The Italian is often absurd and, for instance, \\"camerlengo\\" is constantly given as \\"camerlegno.\\" At one point Olivetti, the commandante of the Swiss Guard claims that the \\"camerlegno\\" has not even been canonized yet. Huh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Continued Greatness","review":"I read this, after seeing the movie and reading The Da Vinci Code. I found the book to be far more enthralling than either movie or reading. Masterpiece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"It is wiser to find out than to suppose.\\"","review":"I really wanted to give this book a chance. But, over and over, I would just get into it and then Brown would make a stupid mistake. Causing me to become frustrated and a bit offended by his lack of respect for his readers intelligence. I am not Catholic but I do know a great deal about the inner workings of the Catholic Church. After reading this I can now see why the church is so angry with him. He simply has things wrong. Most of the \\"facts\\" he states about papal succession are wrong. As well as several of the things the former pope was supposed to have said and done no pope would ever say or do. If he had he would never have been elected pope. I am also not foreign to scientific understanding and, there as well, are some very basic mistakes. The reviewer before me has pointed out language mistranslations so I feel that I can safely say that Dan Brown should heed the advice of Mark Twain, \\"It is wiser to find out than to suppose.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Da Vinci, you'll like Demons","review":"The book had a pretty good story line and I thought it incorporated historical fact into fictional story telling pretty well - although not quite as well as Code does.Bottom line, it's an entertaining read, and if you like Da Vinci Code then you'll also enjoy Angels and Demons."},{"rating":"1","title":"A flash in the pan ...","review":"If you want a 4-star read, tear out the first 70 pages, the last 20, and suspend all disbelief that a Harvard professor can solve an ancient mystery created by the greatest minds of an age in six hours, instead of six decades with the assistance of guide dogs and cavorting clowns holding signs that say 'Clue Here!'The story was pretty good, but the author's political drivel and distortions of history really drag it down. I never actually read the last few pages; the ending was that lame. This paperback is going straight into the trash bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly Book #1","review":"Okay, I admit it, I'm the last person in the Northern Hemisphere - except for a pocket of Eskimos - who has not read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". But, wanting to make sure that I had the code framed correctly I had to read this book first - the prequel.All I can say is that this is a silly little - although 500+ pages - book. It is not Trevanian, Follett, nor even Clancy at his worst. It is barely a book for a long airplane flight nor a bout with allergies. Why did I read the whole thing? Why do we watch baseball????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why this book sold in some countries - and not in others","review":"I am currently writing a thesis on sociological behaviour and statistical analysis on human intelligence among and between OECD countries. This book, branded by some European opinion leaders as the \\"most pathetic and stupid book of the decade\\", still became a million-plus seller in some (so-called) developed countries, though this phenomenon seemed to be isolated geographically. My thesis will try to unveil if this phenomenon was mainly due to economic behaviour, such as marketing or distribution. Or if it is explained by the somehow globally accepted view that some (so-called) developed countries have intellectually challenged populations."},{"rating":"1","title":"good plot, dreadful writing","review":"Seeing the description of this book as being comparable to those by Katherine Neville (The Eight, A Calculated Risk, et. al.), I was very excited to read Angels & Demons. Boy, was I disappointed. The author doesn't seem to think much of the intelligence of his readers; the writing is studded with superfluous and exhausting italics, the foreshadowing is done, not so much with a heavy hand as with the heavy feet of a football team (yech - I apologize for the metaphor, but you get the idea) and his characters have uncharacteristic moments of stupidity (not figuring out something really simple) so he can ratchet up the tension a little bit. All of which is really too bad because the plot, in itself, could have been really exciting,If you enjoy a good conspiracy yarn - this ain't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy reader","review":"This book is not well written. If I could have given it a 0-star rating, I would have. The plot is absurd - falling out of a helicopter and landing safely! It is playing on the present \\"new age\\" movement. The sad thing is that some people think this is nonfiction rather than fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"all plot","review":"What a disappointment. I forced myself to finish this book. This book is entirely plot driven and the writing style is not more advanced than a young adult book. I agree it's sometimes fun to read a good story rather than read a novel that's all symbolic and philosophical; but if you want a good storyteller read any Barbara Kingsolver book (particularly The Poisonwood Bible) or Vikram Seth's 'A Suitable Boy' (not An Equal Music). These people tell stories much bettern than Dan Brown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan, You let me down","review":"Of course we know that Dan knows how to make us turn the pages really fast and furiously. That is great. This book, like the Davinci Code, drew me in. I got quickly caught up in the characters and plot. But when an ending goes flat and array like this one did, it is in some ways all the more dissappointing. I was expecting a wonderful wrap-up to this thrilling ride. It just didn't make it at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than DaVinci Code,!","review":"As usual, Dan Brown comes through with a great, complicated story. I liked this book better than DaVinci Code. There is only one weak point -- and that is when the main character is \\"stuck\\" in a helecopter without a pilot. How he gets out of this jam is sort of goofy. But the rest is pretty believable and it's really engrossing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stinker","review":"Beware. Makes Robert Ludlum look like art. If you liked Da Vinci Code (which I did), then stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could it be any more insulting?","review":"As a reader, I don't really enjoy being led around by the nose -- there are a few things I'd occasionally like to figure out by myself, thanks.The story is a neat idea, though nothing new if you've seen/heard any conspiracy theory shows in the last 30 years. Essentially, the Illuminati are coming to take over the world -- funnily enough, even though I've heard of them, and I'm sure you've heard of them, none of the educated elite in this book have heard of them. Apparently they've never listened to Art Bell, or seen the sci-fi channel. Or read a history book.The characters are flat and uninteresting and horribly cliche, with the main character's description looking suspiciously like the author's picture, and the buxom genius scientist damsel in distress.If you like being told exactly what to think and feel while you're reading, (in fact, this book would probably do remarkably well as a TV show), this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"After I saw some reviews, I thought this might be an interesting book, but I was heavily disappointed. The comparisons by some reviewers to e.g. Umberto Eco's works are fully misplaced. This is just run-of-the-mill pulp fiction, interleaved with highly improbable would-be science and theology. Not worth while spending your money on, I am sorry to say.The same goes for its companion The Da Vinci Code, which is not more than a clone of Angels and Demons, with creative use of \\"find-and-replace\\" word processing by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure schlock","review":"Repeat of DaVinci Code with slightly different premise.

Exciting. Hate to put it down. That is all I can say right, as I have not finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched and poorly written","review":"I never understood what all of the excitement was about \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and this is just slightly better written, in my opinion. Da Vinci was essentially a really bad detective story with historical speculation cribbed directly from other sources inserted throughout.\\"Angels & Demons\\" works slightly better as a thriller, but the dialogue is cheesy and I find it hard to believe that the female lead would fall in love with Robert Langdon so quickly and especially so quickly after the murder of her father.Also, how poor does your research have to be if you don't know that cell phones done have dial-tone? This is mentioned at least a dozen times. Dan Brown didn't own a cell phone in 2000? I find that hard to believe. Just lazy writing. Could have been changed to checking for a signal and wouldn't have seemed like just poor and lazy research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked it even less than DiVinci","review":"Dan Brown has now joined my James Patterson/John Grisham/Dean Koontz Club -- so much potential -- so much disappointment!The only thing I can think of that would be more painful than trying to finish the book (only read about two-thirds of it then skipped to the end) would be trying to watch Tom Hanks play out the role with his one serious expression and freaky hair . . . again!

But great if you are looking for a simple read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Pehaps one should expect it to be difficult to follow up the DaVinci Code, but surely Brown could have done something better than this. The plot is beyond silly, the characters are poorly developed, and the action is unintereseting.It gets a second star only because the settings and research into them are, assuming Brown has been accurate, quite interesting. But after the first hundred pages I began skimming liberally, and don't feel that I missed much, if anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exceptionally farfetched page-turner","review":"Anti-matter, The Vatican, The Illuminati, Galileo...did I miss anything? Dan Brown introduces his symbologist hero, Robert Langdon, in this totally ridiculous thriller. Filled with enough red herrings to fill the hold of a ship, yet failing to disguise the fairly obvious climax, Brown does create an outrageous page-turner. By piling on one crazy idea after another, Brown is able to keep the reader interested by keeping his prose fats moving and compelling, not letting the reader sit back and say, \\"Oh Please!\\" until the end.I read this one before taking on the best selling sequel and now I find I'm in no particular hurry to read that one. I will say this you won't be bored by this one, although you may find your mouth wide open from disbelief by the time it's over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre read","review":"Written in the same style and structure of the Davinci code, it's boring and a bit predictable.

We still have a naked man murdered at the beginning. The author makes references to penises and phallic symbols throughout the book, just like \\"Da Vinci Code\\". The setting is still present-day Europe and another tourist attraction in Italy, instead of France. There is the beautiful young woman related to the murdered man. The same Robert Langdon. Another crippled man as a minor character. A search to find who killed the man and the use of symbolism to decipher a \\"code\\" or \\"map.\\" Do not waste your money. Just read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb Dumb Dumb","review":"I originally bought \\"The DaVinci Code\\" Bool on CD for a long car trip and found it enjoyable, so I bought this one for the drive back. In the first 10 minutes I realized just how mediocre an author Dan Brown is. Both stories sound like they were written using the same outline. Maybe it was because I listened to it first, but \\"Code\\" came across as much more enjoyable, and without a lot of the hokey elements that plague \\"A&D\\". It's a shame too, because this story could have been really good with a little effort. Langdon could be an interesting character, but Brown doesn't develope him at all. He comes across like a one dimensional \\"Jack Ryan meets Indiana Jones\\". The end result is that this book is so bad, it not only ruins itself, but also ruins \\"The DaVinci Code\\" along with it. If you enjoyed \\"Code\\", do NOT buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some books are made in the end...","review":"... and some are broken. The book's strengths (excellent pacing for much of the first half, an astonishing level of attention to detail of art and architecture) are overpowered in the climax by a series of questionable coincidences concocted to make the implausible conclusion have any sense of narrative cohesion. This isn't Tom Clancy, where you can suspend disbelief and pretend that one man can indeed stop nuclear war if only he is on the telephone at the correct time, no, it beggars the imagination. For a book which seems impressively researched, there are errors in Catholic theology (from who is eligible to be elected Pope to the Church's rationale for celibacy) and particle physics (too numerous to mention) which could have been caught by running the text past one of the undergraduate students of the main character. Profoundly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my god, this is so bad","review":"Every once in a while, you read a book that just floors you with its low quality. This is one of those.Let me see if I can summarize it for you.A sexy, single, well-liked-by-his-students Harvard professor with a swimmer's bod (he swims fifty laps a day) hooks up with the smartest woman on earth (she is also very sexy)to thwart a \\"Hassassin\\" who was hired by the illuminati to blow up the Pope with anti-matter.Yep, that's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even worse than the DaVinci Code ... yes, really","review":"Complicated, unlikely plot, silly dialog, unrealistic characters.It's not all bad, though. There is one upside to Angels and Demons. It's the unintended hilarity of the close-to-final scene where our hero lands in the Tiber after a spectacular leap from a helicopter, and the villain parachutes to the top of St Peters. You don't see writing and plotting like that very often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, fun book","review":"Picked-up this book at an airport news stand and read 250 pages on my flight.

I grew up in Rome and am familiar with many of the sites described but as an Italian I wish Mr. Brown had taken the pains to have a native speaker do the translating into Italian of a number of expressions.

It's the second and last Dan Brown novel I will read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Eternal Struggle","review":"The world is made up of Angels and Demons. Brown scores high with this tale of human imperfection. It is a fascinating read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conflicted","review":"How do I say this? Extremely well written book. Author is amazing. BUT, I cannot give 5 stars to a book that is so polar-opposite to all I believe, no, all that I know to be true regarding God and faith. Left me with a bad taste.Would like to read a book by author that is not based on religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan Brown can't write","review":"It is a sad state in the realm of American fiction that DB is able to convince thousands of reviewers here, and millions who bought this book, that what we have here is a good book. DB violates every convention of fiction to produce a plodding, ham-handed, clumsy \\"story\\" that in the end is implausible and absurd. What a waste of time. From his knowledge dumps to his utterly crappy dialogue, this is just pure junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fast Paced Read","review":"I thought this book was very good. I like the Da Vinci Code marginally better, but that could be just because I read that first. Overall, I thought both books were very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.9 stars","review":"I loved, loved, loved, loved, loved, loved, LOVED this book!!!! I bought the illustrated edition because I didn't want to surf the web while I was reading to see what he was talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"There goes a couple hours of my life","review":"Dan Brown is not your author if you are looking for a thought-provoking book, or even a credible plot. This book can be a fun read, but it is (thankfully) forgettable.Readers can enjoy the scenery--although several of the scenes were unnecessarily graphic--just don't look too closely at the details!Even with plot holes and a high gross-out factor, I was enjoying the book right up until the end. The plot twist and plot complication completely lost me. I had a hard time believing the characters' motivations at that point.This book is not the best or most entertaining Dan Brown book available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudoargumentation","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of my granddaughter who is a practicing Wiccan. Ah! Children!I read the work after having talked with her about Mr. Brown's other masterpiece \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". They are similar tomes. The stories they tell are good, but the points they try to make are bogus. They both play on the idea of a Catholic church conspiracy dating back before Constantine. The \\"facts\\" they perport to make are either false in themselves or are used to establish a set of conclusions that \\"do not compute\\".I gave this book 2 stars for its story. That is probably 2 more than it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting mystery","review":"After reading and enjoying the best selling 'Da Vinci Code' I was hoping this book would be as an exciting read. It basically was the same type of novel with the same type of suspense and I wasn't disappointed.While Brown's writing style is not classical literature by any means, and sometimes borders the obscenely ridiculous, it is fast paced and action filled and I can't seem to stop turning the pages until I get to the conclusion of the mystery he lays out from page one.While my high rating doesn't mean I rate this as being on par with some of the other genres I read, this book certainly ranks on the top of the pile with others in it's type. Look past some of the obvious \\"that could never happen\\" moments, and just enjoy the quick and exciting mystery for what it is and you'll probably feel the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predicatable and condescending","review":"I read this after hearing great things about it and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". The first 200 pages or so are admittedly gripping, but shortly after, I had the rest of the story figured out and spent the remaining 300 or so pages hoping, futilely, to be surprised. Brown doesn't seem to trust the reader to put any pieces together for themselves -- from translations for every minute bit of Italian that is spoken, to a map in the front of the book that allows the reader to figure out where everything will be taking place hundreds of pages before they happen, the author holds your hand through every step, hoping you're keeping up when in fact you're way ahead of him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed Research?","review":"This was the usual thrill-a-minute book. Interesting concepts, lots of twists, turns and surprises. The author purports to be an authority on a number of subjects from symbology to theology. However, I did notice two mistakes. Brown writes that only Cardinals can be elected Pope; acutally any male (and, please God, someday any woman)can be elected Pope without even the need to be an ordained priest. Secondly, Brown defines \\"Devil's Advocate\\" as the cleric who vets any potential Pope. The \\"Devil's Advocate\\" is the cleric assigned to challenge the canonization of a person being considered for sainthood. These two points could have been easily researched --so how valid is the remainder of his research? I'm reading the \\"DaVinci Code\\" now, so I'll see how accurate he is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and suspenseful read","review":"If you are going to (or have) read The Da Vinci Code, you have to read this book as well. Both books follow the same style in how the plot unfolds and how the reader is drawn into the dramatic conclusion. And, while the style and form are not particularly original, the author's use of symbolism and religious factoids make it far more interesting than other books of the same genre. It's definitely a can't-put-down-page-turner. So, be sure to find yourself some \\"free time\\" before you dive in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! Even worse than the Da Vinci Code!","review":"How does this jerk and his publishers get away with it? Dan Brown's books are so apallingly researched and error-ridden that it really is an insult. I'm not driven by any ideology, nor am I pedantic - but it's the writer himself who pretentiously claims the details in this book to be \\"fact\\" in the preface. I find it impossible to enjoy a book when every page is riddled with simple error. For goodness' sake, \\"My First Book of Art\\" or a simple map of Rome is all you need to find them! As for the so-called \\"Art Expert\\" (Robert Langdon), he has got to be the the most ignorant art teacher on the face of the planet. I'm insulted by such blatant disregard for accuracy, and depressed by the low standards of the reading public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"There are few best sellers that make me wince, but this is certainly one of them. Beyond the stilted dialogue, the cliches, and the hit-you-over-the-head-with-a-brick endless foreshadowing, this was an embarassing mess from start to finish.It actually scares me that otherwise intelligent people found this worthy of such praise. Admittedly, this isn't my genre, but this is pure schlock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you on the edge of your seat","review":"I bought the book after reading Brown's \\"Da Vinci Code,\\" and found this book to be just as enticing. Informative, with many historical and religious references, this book is a definite read for those who love to get lost in a good book. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down","review":"In the same way I go through James Patterson's Alex Cross series,unable to stop and put the book down, so it was with Angels & Demons. The story is a great thriller and has a new hero Robert Langdon.What I like most about the story was it's sophistication, fast pace and great value in exposing audience to art history.Everyone I turned on to this book loves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved by the Plot","review":"This guy really doesn't really write well. It was difficult to keep reading with the obvious writing cliches. You know when you notice the writing style, there's a problem. Too many adjectives. HOWEVER. If you can stand the stilted writing long enough to get into the plot, it's very clever and original and if you are at all interested in Roman sights or church history, you can forgive the not so good writing. I didn't care much for the ending, but it was still a good ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angels & Demons","review":"My friend who lives in Rome suggested this book. I generally avoid Dan Brown, and sort of wish I had avoided this book. His research was great, if you can believe all of his information, and the well described locations all over Rome were marvelous, but ........ Two, not one but TWO, men fall out of a helicopter very high above Rome and land unharmed? Many other plot devises were quite difficult to digest. Plus, Brown seems to have a personal vendetta for the Catholic Church. God certainly knows a lot of evil has been done in the name of religion and the church probsably leads the pack, but Brown's problem seems rather personal. Maybe he was abused by a priest?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be picky!","review":"Great book, no doubt about it, who cares if things in it are impossible? The fact is, it's fiction, its fun to read and has tons of suspense. So what, we know things can't travel at mach 15, but who cares? It's a book, fiction book! It's not your NEW scientist mag you get weekly, that tells you how you cannot make antimatter due to this and that, or travel mach 15 due to whatever. It's a fiction book, a great read, enjoy it as a book, not as your encyclopedia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Implausible....yet entertaining!","review":"Although this book contains several events that seem impossible and implausible, it was entertaining. I felt short of breath and as if at the edge of my seat while reading this book. I couldn't put it down. It was amazing how Langdon gets out of every \\"pickle\\" he is in despite his tiredness, getting hurt and feeling hungry. During all this, of course, there is an attraction to the female protagonist which ends predictably.I found myself courious as to how Brown would treat The Church. I got the impression he attempted to give credence to Science and God simultaneously while also showing their weaknesses. Although I don't agree with a lot of his point of view, I did find it intriguing. Even if some of his facts are erroneous, it was interesting reading about a secret brotherhood and their mysteries. It was a good book, however, The Da Vinci Code seem more palatable. Nonetheless, I did enjoy this fictional novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death of Literature","review":"After finishing this book I was so happy to get it back onto my shelf. Not only is Dan Brown a horrible writer, but the twists and turns of the book are enough to incite laughter. I thought getting through Brown's cheesy and preachy religious rantings would be the worst part. Boy, was I wrong! Not only does every artist, president, and poet from the past 600 years pop up on every other page, but the characters and plot are flat and lifeless. I felt no attachment to any character and could care less whether they lived or died. As the plot progressed and \\"surprises\\" were revealed, I found my self laughing out loud in disgust. I think the Vatican banned it no so much for being a threat to Christianity, but for being a horrible book in general!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched garbage","review":"I can't believe I read the entire thing. But with my time invested, I had to see how it ended. The plot is so outlandish that suspension of belief is impossible. Surely no one could take this book seriously. But there are all of these stellar reviews...Even if the book were a bit more plausible, there's the hackneyed writing to wade through -- hackneyed because Brown and his publisher spell out every last aspect to the story; nothing is subtle, nothing is left to the imagination. Brown either does not trust the reader, or he is simply inept. When one considers the single dimensional characters standing in for some of the sharpest persons on the globe, this reader cannot help assuming the latter.What garbage. Save yourself the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid and mind numbing - actually 0 stars","review":"This book is yet another stupid and mind numbing FICTION novel by a guy that has a few bones to pick with the Catholic faith. 1st: I am not a catholic, but the way he attacks the catholic church in his books is bothersome. 2nd: the fact that he presents his details as facts that have been uncovered, as opposed to details he made up is even more troublesome. The guy finds names of old goups (secret societies as he presents them) and creates a whole new mission and purpose for their existance. He even adds 1800 years to their age in the case of the the Divinci Code. It is all very disturbing. Even more disturbing is the way so many people mindlessly embrace his books as enlightening. You are reading some of the biggest lies in the history of mankind, paying for it, and feeling like you have learned something. It is SAD. And that is without all the typos, mis-uses of words, and timelines that just do not add up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clone of DaVinci code - but not in a good way","review":"If you read the DaVince Code and are yearning for more (as I was), you might find this book to be a let down. It starts out almost EXACTLY the same. Mr. Brilliant is awakened in the middle of the night for an urgent crisis that only he can assist with. He must board an airplane and meet with some mystery men who want to pick his giant brain. Yawn. I was shocked at how the author doesn't even try to hide the fact that he's written the same book all over again. If you want to read something that similar, you'll probably love it. I did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written, badly edited - why is this guy so popular?","review":"Haven't read the Code, thought I'd start with Angels. What a disappointment! The characters are stereotypical; the only significant female character is a yogini physicist scuba diver whose role deteriorates from central character to simple object of desire. The plot is full of implausible details, and the ending is a multiple-twist confusion worthy of a Harry Potter novel. The errors are annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"best selling, but why?","review":"A hideous, godawful, video game masquerading as a novel. There is not one single character to care about and all the frenetic plotting just exaggerates this deficiency. I never even found out if they saved the Vatican cause I couldn't be bothered. I will avoid Dan Brown's work like it has Anthrax in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced cheap thrills","review":"If you're looking to learn Italian or Latin, or hoping to learn history or science, look somewhere else (Mr. Christian, stick to West and Wallace, leave the cheap thrills to us mere mortals ... mercy). However, if you don't take yourself so seriously and you like your cheap thrills topped with fast-paced action, silly special effects, 007-type fantasy, this is an excellent read. It goes down easy, like a hamburger and fries, without the indigestion. OK, it ain't James Joyce, but if you liked the DaVinci Code, you'll like this one. It reads like a two-hour action-adventure spy flick. Very little snob appeal here, lots of pleasure though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad. . .","review":"Several reviewers have already mentioned the factual, historical, scientific and translation errors, so there's no point in going over those in detail. The most offensive part of the book to me was the poor writing and plotting. Brown's foreshadowing served absolutely no purpose; neither did his editorializing. The implausibility of the characters' breadth of knowledge is laughable. On the positive side, though, one has to admire Brown's ability to get the reader to turn pages; despite the poor writing, the book is a Patterson-like read.Although I can't fault the author for the blurbs printed on the cover, I have to wonder if those reviewers who referred to the book as \\"smart\\" and \\"high IQ\\" are the types who wear round, plain-glass specs because they think it makes them \\"look\\" intelligent?I hope that the tremendously popular _DaVinci Code_ (which I have not read) demonstrates a maturation of the author and his talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book","review":"Like most people, I read \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" and was entertained. I then read \\"Angels and Demons\\" expecting to be entertained again. I was not. The best word to describe this book is \\"dumb.\\" The story is predictable, and is so absurd that one must rethink the definition of fiction. Read \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" and stop there. I can not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic...","review":"I've read four of his books: Deception Point, Digital Fortress, The DaVici Code, and Angels & Demons. I didn't care for them, and like this one probably least of the four.I won't spoil the book if you want to read it, but if you've read one of them, then you've basically read this one too. If you enjoyed those, you probably will like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite","review":"I am always given Dan Brown books to read by a friend or family member who loves them. I try to give them a fair chance but he is such a sorry excuse for a writer that I always end by skimming the final 3/4. Angels and Demons is yet another example. However it is so implausible that it actually elevated my opinion of The DaVinci code. The DaVinci code is bad but Angels and Demons is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Physics Right Next Time","review":"A novel about reconciling science and religion would be worthwhile, but you need to get the science right or at least plausible. I ran into a dozen \\"Give me a breaks\\" before I put this book down in disgust. Some of these are that gravity is 30% less at 60,000 feet (it's 0.3% less), using tuna to disprove the theory of relativity, and making antimatter proves God's existence (physicists have know about antimatter since the 1920s and first made antiprotons in the 1950s). Despite thanking CERN and Brookhaven in the acknowledgements, it's clear that Mr. Brown didn't have a physicist or even a high school physics student proofread this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank Goodness It Was A Fast Read","review":"I really wanted to like this book. At first I cherished carrying around the thick 569 page hardcover enjoying the ease of which Dan Brown's writing can be read. But something happened midway through the story. The story that began with so much scientific intelligence and religious tradition suddenly took on a MacGyver-like air. The book started to truly test my intelligence and patience. As I pushed toward the story's conclusion I realized the best of it had already come and gone some time ago. Anti-climatic might be a word to describe this story. Or maybe I'm just out of touch with the new Video Game style of story plots in books and movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big YAWN !","review":"I'm sorry, but this book is 10 percent story and 90 percent encyclopedia. If you removed all of the tedious regurgitation of information, you'd be left with about twenty pages of plot in a very long book.I don't get the appeal, and would be more likely to go for this if it were Brown writing non-fiction travel/historical books.Page after page after page of facts. Ugh. Even if some of the facts are interesting (and this certainly is the case)- they should have been force-fed to us in smaller doses, in abbreviated versions, so that readers could remember what the actual plot was supposed to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than The DaVinci Code","review":"Dan Brown's Angel and Demons was a book that once I started, I could not put down. It was well written, and the historical references were right on. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed The DaVinci Code."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like to be insulted by an author , this book is perfect","review":"I felt this book to be insulting. As several reviewers have pointed out, the Italian language is so mangled that you wonder what Brown used for translating (Italian is my mother tongue, and I suffered considerably throughout the book. Once, I had no idea what Victoria had said -in Italian).There are several factual errors, and your credulity is stretched to a point where Harry Potter (which I like a lot) feels like a history book. I cannot believe that an editor ever set eyes on this text before publishing it...At the same time, I am not too surprised that the book received so many good reviews, because it is packed with action and twists and turns. But I hope that not too many readers take Mr Brown at his word, because if he can get away with Italian that bad, I shudder to think how he must have done his researh..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go see a Hollywood Action Thriller - This book is Similar","review":"One of the dumbest books I ever read! The history of Catholicism, the Vatican, Rome and the Illuminati and ambigrams were all interesting, but once the action starts, this book is like watching a dumb Hollywood action movie where the bad guy (like Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction) is left for dead by the heroes and then miraculously arises for one last blow while the heroes rest. The book and ending is convoluted with several different endings and the story is too fantastic for an intelligent mind to ponder the reality of it. When the hero jumps from a Helicopter miles up and lives because he used a canopy to break his fall, I knew I made a mistake in reading this. The end of the story goes on forever and the writing is simplistic. This author is a hack making millions of dollars by exploiting the mindless! Do yourself a favor and shy away from this book. Like they say, \\"candy will rot your teeth.\\" Well, this book will rot your brain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous read - good taste! riveting!

It is now not only a vivid tried-and-true, \\"who-done-it\\" plot about good versus evil, but also a window into the arcane world of the Conclave and the Camerlengo. Since the College of Cardinals has not met in Conclave for some 26 years, the twists, turns, and profound bits of history that Dan Brown weaves into the plot will be of great interest to both Catholics and non-Catholics alike. You can find perfectly good information on the Internet about electing a Pope (e.g., www.catholic-pages.com/pope/election.asp), but this book adds TONS of life to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Langdon's adventure","review":"Angels & Demons is the first book of Dan Brown's that i have ever read. i would have to say that this book was very well writen. it had just the right amount of fact combined with fiction. i must say that when i first say this book i was skeptical about how i would like the book. much to my surprise i really enjoyed it more than i realized at the time.Robert Langdon was an ordinary symbology teacher at one of the top schools in the United States, Harvard University. one morning Langdon gets a mysterious phone call. after some persuasion Langdon is flown to Switzerland to a place called CERN. CERN is a highly respected science devopement agency. soon after he finds out the reason that these scientists need his help. an ancient society called the Illuninati have resurfaced and are threatening the church in vatican city.

I would probably have the opposite opinion if I read it first. These two books are basically the same.\\"Angels and Demons\\" is a template for \\"The DaVinci Code.\\" If you like authors that don't stray from one type of story line, Dan Brown is the guy for you.

The plot wasnt all that gripping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith Redefined","review":"This book was my first experience reading anything written by Dan Brown and I must say it was excellent. The main character, Robert Langdon, is drawn into this adventure because his expertise as a religious syboligist is needed by the Vatican to confirm a symbol. And not just any symbol. This symbol is said to have been left by the infamous Illuminati, long thought to have been no more. From beginning to end this book is action packed and keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing what will happen next. If you have never read Dan Brown I would highly recommend this be your first book of his you read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written for the fourth grade","review":"Okay, I want to say that I started reading this book because a friend highly recommended it to me. While the overall synopsis of the plot has merit and could no doubt be turned into a great story - the writing is absolutely abysmal.The characters are shallow, and the reader is dragged through each paragraph like a slack-jawed mouth breather with no sense of deductive reasoning to draw on. Despite the nice plot, I could not finish the book.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleat - unmitigated bleat","review":"The book starts out bad and then proceeds to worse. Every bad thriller idea extant is packed into this book . Brief example, if you cannot spot the \\"Evil Genius\\" the instant he appears, you should turn in your U.N.C.L.E. communicator. And, of course, the \\"Hashassin\\" from Syria must be part of the \\"centuries -old\\" plot. I could go on, but I feel ill. The story is full of supposedly intelligent people acting painfully stupid, and being shocked by the obvious. I could not finish the book, it was that bad. The author and publisher should be arraigned for arboricide. Please, if you wish to read an intelligent thriller, read Alan Furst, Len Deighton, Arturo Perez-Reverte, or John LeCarre, do not waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awfully written book....","review":"I actually gave up on this book because of annoying idiosy of the plot and complete inability of the writer to express his ideas clearly. Da Vinci Code is equally inept..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too over the top","review":"Much preferred Da Vinci Code. The scenarios in A&D are outrageous and the motives, reactions and responses of characters are too often unrealistic. The last few chapters are laughable with unsatisfying twists, coming off as twists for the sake of twists. Made-for-TV thriller material here with awkward commentary on the so-called spiritual state of the modern world. Da Vinci Code is somewhat better researched, a better paced thriller and its weaknesses are generally forgivable."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Dan Brown or you enjoyed the movie, you will enjoy this book.","review":"I liked this book. I read it before the movies came out. However, there is a caveat.I can not read more than one Dan Brown book per 18 month period. I read Angels and Demons and Da Vinci Code at about the same time and I feel like I would have gotten more enjoyment out of it if I had spaced it out and read them a couple years apart.The story was not enough to have me on the edge of my seat, but it was good.The story was plausible enough that if it was based in truth I would not be surprised or shocked.The story was entertaining enough that I would not rule out reading it again in the future.Overall, it is not the best book ever, but it is worth your time and is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"angels and demons","review":"this second book of Dan Brown is a joy to read. For readers interested inhistorical places such as Rome, this book points out several new facts unknown to most of the readers, although many of them have been to Rome before.The story is thrilling and keeps the reader interested, wanting to know what happens next. Dan Brown's explanation about the Illuminati is well documented and tickles of the curiosity of the reader. The illustrations in this book are beautiful done and helps the reader to understand even more the setting of this compelling novel.Due to use of larger typing, it's easier to read (for instance in bed with less light)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thriller:Church-Science-Secret Society","review":"The college of cardinals are meeting to elect a new pope. The key characters are: Maximilian Kohler,head of the Swiss scientific research facility CERN, Robert Langdon, a professor of religious iconology at Harvard, Leonardo Vetra a physicist at CERN and his daughter Vittoria a beautiful scientist, Hassassin a master assassin, Cardinal Mortati the overseer of the sanctified event and the carmerlengo Carlo Ventresca. There are clues that the Illuminati are involved in the murders of Leonardo Vetra as well as four preferito cardinals who were the favored candidates to become the next pope. To further complicate things an anti-matter device that could destroy the Vatican is stolen from CERN. Plenty of spine tingling excitement in this excellent read. Who will prevail?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting fun read","review":"I thought this book would be \\"heavier\\" on content, scenery, and what not. Having read all of Vince Flynn's novels to date, most of Tom Clancy, Bernard Cornwell, Stephen King, and other really involved authors; I found Dan Brown's writing light, easy to follow and it maintained a good momentum.The history of some common phrases was interesting. The description of the scenery in Rome was excellent, and the novel takes place in one day. Might make a good 24-type movie.The hero isn't heroic a first, but when push came to shove, he knuckled-up and got the girl.I was guessing until the end and was surprised but the conclusion. It's a mystery novel set against the conflict of religion vs. science.The monologues are excellent, well-thought out and thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"KINDLE","review":"I started reading this book because some one recommended it.

They are in the same league. Highly entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"...yawn...","review":"As a conspirologist, I was intrigued. Sadly, this was a by-the-numbers thriller. Nothing new. I'll stick with the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you serious?!","review":"After reading the DaVinci Code I thought that Dan Brown had something going for him and was suckered into reading this book. The historical and scientific accuracy he uses to beef up his plots are his only saving grace. Other than that, I have a hard time believing anything that he writes. It's fiction, I know. But I just kept having this feeling that this book would could easily turn into one of those absolutely unrealistic action movies with Tom Cruise or Harrison Ford where jumping out of an exploding helicoptor at 3000 feet without a parachute doesn't kill you. Better luck in the future, Dan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Lemons for Dan Brown","review":"It just gets worse. I must have been insane but I decided after abusing my inteligence by reading \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" to try \\"Angels & Demons\\". Crap is too kind a term for this work. Not only is the style, plot and characters exactly the same as Da Vinci, but the end, its just rediciulous.Mobilis In Mobili"},{"rating":"1","title":"Such an assortment of misinformation...","review":"I work at CERN. This book's relationship to fact or anything like it is minimal at best. What a pile of garbage - the only thing you can safely credit is that CERN in near Geneva and that there is a huge accelerator (being built) there.Everything else is hokey baloney. Everything. Which means you really can't take anything he says seriously. At all.That in addition to being a Mad Libs/Xerox rehash of DaVinci Code. Which also wasn't terribly burdened with facts.The philosophy was laughable and... sophomoric. What can I say?That being said - when I wasn't groaning out loud, or laughing, it was an OK thrill ride. It's not worth all the fuss, though - this isn't in the same league even as Grisham or Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brown doesn't know much about Catholicism","review":"I hope I'm not giving away anything here, but near the end we're told that a certain two parties had a child together through artificial insemination, and therefore \\"commited no sin\\" under Catholic doctrine. Brown needs to check his catechism again. The fact that this error is critical to the book's ending calls into question the reliability of any of Brown's statements about the church and church law."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice plot - interesting read","review":"The plot and characters are similar to the one's of the Davinci code. Reading this one is easier and plot follows easily. I particularly liked it cause it takes place in Rome one of my favourite cities around Europe. Some of the points are totally unbelievable but i guess thats what fiction books are about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Angels not on Brown's side","review":"As a loyal reader of Brown before the popularity of The Da Vinci Code skyrocketed last summer, I can honestly say that this is my least favorite of his novels. While the premise of the story is interesting and the descriptions of Rome fantastic, the ending of this thriller is just too unbelievable for my tastes. It left me skeptical of Brown's abilities as a writer and made me wonder how he was able to write such a fantastic story of The Da Vinci Code after this bungle called Angels & Demons.Save some time and do yourself a favor: skip this Brown novel and head straight to The Da Vinci Code."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"With 200+ reviews before me, I don't have too much to add. This was a fantastic book -- one of the best suspense books I have read in a while. The characters were engaging and interesting and the plot made me stay up late into the night to finish the story. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Good Enough For Vacation Reading","review":"Based on all the great reviews, and the comparisons to \\"The Eight\\" by Katherine Neville, I brought this book along on my last vacation. While it is a page-turner, the writing is poor, and the plot borders on the ridiculous. I completely second the other review that mentions the preposterous ending. I was highly disappointed in this book, even for beach reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU HAVE IT FIGURED OUT...","review":"This is an excellent \\"page-turner\\" of a novel. Filled with historical accuracy and a frightening amount of scientific possibilities, Dan Brown has written a gripping drama of Science v. the Catholic Church. Without a doubt, the best part is how this book ends. You will think you can guess the ending, but keep reading, I guarantee you will be wrong. Great book-one you won't want to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as THE DA VINCI CODE, but no better","review":"This one gets four stars as well and, I suppose, is worth being a bestseller, but isn't it about time people turned away from Dan Brown and looked at other truly worth authors and books? Especially science fiction and fantasy books like: THE LORD OF THE RINGS, ERAGON, THE TIME-TRAVELER'S WIFE, RINGWORLD, FOUNDATION, I,ROBOT, CHILDHOOD'S END, PUPPET MASTERS, RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA, NEUROMANCER, CRYPTONOMICON, SNOW CRASH, DARKEYE: CYBER HUNTER, and so forth."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!! My favorite mystery!!","review":"What more can I say? WOW! Once I began reading this book, I could not, no matter how hard I tried, stop reading! Angels and Demons is full of mystery, excitement, suspense, and even romance! I won't write anything concerning the contents because the book is much better if you are oblivious to the plot. This book comes highly recommended! I've even begun distributing copies to my friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ending","review":"Like most readers, I came to this after reading The DaVinci Code. The parallels with DaVinci Code are obvious: the two are cut from the same cloth. Coming to this earlier work later, however, it did seem to pale slightly by comparison: DaVinci Code has perhaps more purely intellectual nuggets, and is even more thought provoking. Though dealing with weighty thematic topics, it is none the less more of a straightforward action story: think Michael Chricton plotboiler, with familiar themes of technology run amok found in some of Chricton's work. The last 80 or so pages featured one plot twist after another. I will not spoil them for you by going on. But if you loved DaVinci you will also enjoy Angels & Demons; if you thought DaVinci was stilted & pretentious (as a handful of people with whom I have discussed it felt), you still might like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, But DA VINCI way better","review":"I recently finished The Da Vinci code, and I have to say this was one of the most intriguing and suspenceful books I have ever read. I enjoyed this book alot, and I heard there was another book with Robert Langdon. So I went and got Angels and Demons, and started to try it. I love the way the author writes and I really like Robert Langdon, but I cant help but feel , that Angels and Demons isnt the same as DA VINCI.Didnt give off the same feeling. It was great, I read it in a good 14 hours, but sometimes I wanted to stop and pick up another book. He( Dan Brown ) fails to get the same groove in this book as he did with Da Vinci..... its a great read, but nothing like his bestseller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet!!","review":"Brown's book is packed with loads of entertainment, loads of educational information, and loads of stunning anagrams. although the ending is a bit trite, this book will leave you breathless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's no DaVinci code, but still riveting","review":"After reading \\"The DaVinci Code\\", I coudn't resist reading another Dan Brown. While this book is not as smart as DaVinci code, it is more action-packed...a real thriller instead of a brainy tour-de-force.The main thing that disappointed me about this book was that I was consistenly one step ahead of Robert Langdon, while in \\"The DaVinci Code\\" he was always figuring out the codes and puzzles long before I did. But in this book, it is not Langdon's job to be brainy, he is instead more of an action star, an unlikely Jack Ryan.If you thought \\"The DaVinci Code\\" stretched the limits of reality (which it did, but at zero detriment to the finished project), then you're going to be in complete disbelief of \\"Angels and Demons\\". The story is totally implausible. But really, who cares? The action is fast-paced, the history lessons intriguing...a totally enjoyable read that will have me reading another Dan Brown book before too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't Let Me Down","review":"This is the 2nd Dan Brown novel I have read, the first being his acclaimed DaVinci Code. After reading the DaVinci I was hesitant to embark on this novel because I enjoyed his first one so much I couldn't see how he could possibly match the excellence of the DaVinci code with this earlier novel. I finished the book in less than three days and was relieved that Brown didn't let me down. Just the educational portions of this novel alone would make it an excellent read, the trouble and efforts that Brown goes through to make sure his facts are accurate are amazing. But on top of the facts is a suspenceful, believable, and page turning story that makes the read quick and quite enjoyable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Naive","review":"Deposit your brain at the entrance before opening this book. You'll have to exercise your suspension-of-disbelief skills to a high level in order not to laugh too hard.Case in point: a scientist discovers the secret of Creation and a terrible weapon, then conceals it in a lab guarded only by a retinal scanner. Any security expert worth its salt will tell you that using a single biometric identification method without an associated code or passphrase is foolish.The plot is mildly interesting, but the characters are sketchy and stereotypical.What annoyed me the most, however, was pitting science and religion against each other as if they had been mortal enemies for centuries, which certainly is not the case. At one point, you get the impression that the Catholic Church is still clinging to creationist beliefs like bible-belt preachers, whereas it has accepted the evidence for Darwinian evolution for quite a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dan Brown Disappointment","review":"Perhaps I should have read this Dan Brown novel BEFORE I read Da Vinci Code. Perhaps then I wouldn't be so disappointed in this slow-paced, oft predictable, & inexplicably BORING book! I was SO excited to read this novel, after all, Da Vinci Code is my favorite book of all time, but I quickly learned that this book was NOTHING like its attention-captivating successor. The plot is cumbersome and the ending is just plain STUPID!I have to give credit where credit is due, though. The ambigrams were amazing, and I appreciated the fact that the author gave his audience some visuals to aid in an otherwise boring reading experience. I also like the fact that I was able to learn from the novel. It was very informative, and one could easily tell that there was a vast amount of research put into the book. Also, at the end of the day, you can still tell that Brown is a very imaginative & descriptive author.But I have to give my overall opinion in this review: THE BOOK SUCKED!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgustingly Bad Writing","review":"My teenage sister could have written better than this made-for-TV-movie author. Full of cliche characters and predictable plot turns, it would probably make a good TV movie. I'm perturbed to see that Dan Brown books have somehow become the most popular things to read. Even the Da Vinci code turned into a painfully bad movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"And there are Demons out there...","review":"Another masterpiece! What can be said here? After reading Dan Browns' DaVinci Code, I read Angels & Demons. This was another great page-turning suspense thriller. This book was just as good as The DaVinci Code if not better. I can see a movie being made on this novel as well. Between the reader visiting ancient Rome, the papacy and its' secretive ways, old-world myths carrying consequences to the present day, ancient religious scrolls, and primordial organizations fighting against the church's teachings - this book was exceptionally captivating!!! It has some of the same plot and characters involved as the other book, yet it is not an exercise in futility to read in any way shape or form. I don't know if Dan can write a manuscript that can oust this one. This book has a lot to offer, and I enjoyed it thoroughly..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Like Da Vinci this book was hard to put down. Unfortunately life keeps me from reading as much as I would like, but when I had time I was glad to have this wonderful book. Although I was able to see some of mysteries before they were reveled it was hard to guess them all. An excellent book... more spellbinding then Da Vinci and an excellent read! I was sad when I finished the book... I cried because it was excellent and I didn't have another Dan Brown book on standby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, strange plot, good references","review":"I purchased a paper back in the airport going to China. Finished the whole book by the time I got there. Usually I sleep on the plane, especially on long flights. This book kept me interested and I ended up reading the whole thing in 12 hours. You will like this book even more if you have been in Rome since there are a lot of references to different places in Rome.I \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" by Dan Brown also, read it on the way back from China. I like Angels & Demons a lot more. The plot is not as artifical and the pace is much after since there is a time bomb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar BOok!!

Then Rocky 2 came out and it wasn't quite the same. Isn't that true for the most part? Nothing's like the original. Well, its reverse for the Dan Brown novel Angels and Demons. It actually precludes his best selling and very enjoyable Da Vinci Code (see my review). The Da Vinci Code had a great fast paced plot as well as historical tidbits that made me want to do some research. Angels and Demons has a weak plot and lags in many places. His \\"historical items\\" center around the Illuminati, a scientific anti-Church group. They rise again to attack the Church in the setting of modern Rome Brown could have had some great science vs. religion debate included in his novel but the dialogue falls short.Brown's novel is plagued with \\"Harry Potter virus\\". Like Potter's author Rowlings, Brown had one great book but his other works hasn't been able to capture the success of the best seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Ridiculous","review":"After reading the Da Vinci Code, I was very anxious to read Brown's earlier novel, but was disappointed by how shallow and predictable it turned out to be. I thought it contained interesting information about the Vatican, art and the Illuminati but the characters seemed to be almost identical to those in the Da Vinci Code. I was particularly disappointed to see how little credibility the character of the Hassassin had. Obviously Brown had not researched Arabs or their way of thinking (or even their language) and just made the villain an Arab because it's fashionable to make the Arab the bad guy. All in all it wasn't a total waste of time, but I don't see what the fuss is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're Kidding!","review":"How is this book different from Da Vinci Code? Not very much, except that it is a much inferior read, and makes much less sense. The author seems to have written these two books in cookie-cutter style, with an unsuspecting protagonist, the close-of-kin lovely, a completely implausible plot, all rotating about an ancient sect that no one knew existed in today's world. It was a fast read, but a very poor one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preposterous Plot","review":"Did I read the same book as the other reviewers? Although, the book was full of very interesting facts, they were interwoven into the story in a very annoying way. The narrative was overly melodramatic, amateurish, and sometimes downright silly. For people with a deadline to meet they sure had a lot of time to discuss everything to death. The plot was just plain ludicrous."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST BOOK EVER!!!","review":"Seriously, this is the worst book ever! Dan Brown obviously did NOT research this topic thoroughly. The author constantly contradicts himself from beginning to end. The book was total waste of time, and YES ... I did throw it against the wall! I didn't even bother finish reading it. I wish I would've wasted my time on the movie instead! I hope ALL the people that Dan Brown offends in the book find him and hang him by his tiny b#lls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a Monopoly game that will not end","review":"This is the worst novel I have ever read. (I thought that the Da Vinci Code was entertaining BTW.) It is the worst because I have always stopped reading anything remotely this bad. Unfortunately a friend loaned it to me and once I recognized its hideously obvious plot-line, I stopped reading and tried to give it back to him. He refused telling me to read it and then return it. I return books to people who loan them, so I speed-read through the other deaths by the elements and then its ridiculous ending. O horrible, most horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending was a big stinkbomb","review":"I loved the Da Vinci Code and loved 3/4 of this book. Then, suddenly, the reader is thrown into some pseudo \\"Indiana Jones meets The Ten Commandments\\" nonsense. Although the willing suspension of disbelief has its place in the literary world, the end of this book is garbage. Sorry Dan..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Da Vinci Code Instead!","review":"Yes, it's a page turner for awhile. But the plot is so ridiculous and implausible that it makes me long for the more realistic novels of Flaubert and the other classics. This book is nothing more than a cartoonish treatment for a bad Hollywood movie. Read Joseph Wambaugh instead if you're looking for fiction. Unfortunately, Brown's other earlier novels are just as awful so stick with the Da Vinci Code."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Roman Catholic Bashing","review":"Here we go again. I read this book before I read the DaVinci Code; had I read the DaVinci Code first, and seen and read the reviews that exposed that book as a thinly-veiled anti-Catholic diatribe, I doubt I would have read Angels and Demons. If anything, Mr. Brown's hatred of and contempt for the Roman Catholic church is even more obvious in Angels and Demons. For Mr. Brown, the demons are the murderous, power-hungry members of the church hierarchy, as well as the self-deluded, moronic Catholic faithful. The angels, of course, are anyone who exposes the church for the poison it really is (to Mr. Brown, that is). Fool me twice, but not a third time - I'm finished with this author and his poison pen."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does this guy make a living at writing?","review":"As with all of Dan Brown's books, the writing is atrocious, but the story pace is the novel's salvation. In this case, the story is too flawed to carry the weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it over already?","review":"That's what I kept asking myself after the story got stale.

One of the best books in a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you guessing!","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I could not put it down! It is filled with suspense and plot twists. Just when you think Brown can't possibly add more to this story, he surprises you. He keeps you guessing till the absolute end of this book. I thought I had it figured out several times, but I was way off! I would recommend this book to anyone who loves mysteries.Brown has an uncanny ability to mesh fact with fiction. Most of the facts you read about in his books are true. He just put a fictional storyline behind them. It makes the story so believable.If you haven't read this book, you're missing out!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Brilliant","review":"Even though this books seems full on the impossible, Dan Brown makes everything seem realistic and that takes talent; pure and simple. The story draws you in from page one, Robert Langdon is a great protagonist (not brawny but smart), and the historical facts woven throughout the book serve as a learning tool for many. Kudos to Dan Brown for writing a magnificent novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel I truly enjoyed!","review":"I'm not going to summarize the plot, nor will I put forth the effort detailing the pros and cons of this book; I will simply encourage anyone who enjoys a good technical thriller, with ties to factual physical science and religion, to read this book.

If you skip any pages, you may never figure it all out. Dan Brown is an excellent author able to keep the reader turning the pages until the very end. This book had quite a surprising ending that seems to be the formula in Dan Brown's other books - I have read them all and they are all excellent.The pictures add a certain reality to the story, even though it is fictional, that was worth the extra dollars. Having never been to Italy, it added a great visualization to see the actual places and art referred to in the story.If you like mystery thrillers with a twist you never expect towards the end, this is your story. 2 Thumbs up to Dan Brown for another great novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately Disappointing","review":"On the level of any pure thriller, this book is certainly engaging and will keep you turning pages.It is obvious that it is meticulously researched and plotted. Credit must be given for that. However, as the book nears it's conclusion, things get so outlandish, so preposterous and so completely removed from reality that I was extremely disappointed. It becomes a fantasy which given Brown's proud and careful researched-and-rooted-in-reality, \\"notes\\" in the beginning was an unexpected letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"christian fiction","review":"I liked Angels and Demons better than the Da Vinci Code. Has a lot of history in the book. Even though it is over 700 pages it was a fast read. Lots of action througout the book. Definetely for people in their late teens or older. Very descript and gory. Would reccomend it to anyone interested in history, adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"REDICULOUS!","review":"Let's float in on the coat tails of success and take advantage of media hype and then crank out pure pulp. From page one events of an unbelieveable proportion occur. The main theme (science v. faith or science + faith) needs much more development and careful planning. The pity is that the concepts are really interesting and the history of the Illuminati is fascinating. 'Mores the pity' they were not treated in a plausable way. Who are we kidding? A huge unknown research lab in the Swiss mountains?...Our hero is contacted after a 15 minute Google search?...The dear professor is immediately included in the most top secret research?...We find ways into the Vatican's inner sanctum (AKA \\"American Treasure\\" ilk)?...We jump out of a helicopter and float to earth hanging onto the corners of a tarp? This should have been a comic book - excuse me - graphic novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe this guy was published","review":"I just finished Angels and Demons by Dan Brown. A colossal waste of time. Book marked by cascading cliches, amateurish prose and characters that would not even fit in a comic book. This is perhaps the worst book I have read in forty years!

With cliches. It's totally unbelievable and poorly written on a literary level. It got me to the end, and I was curious to see how it turned out. It turns out preposterously. If you like serious literature, skip it. If you aren't very picky about the quality of the language - only a decent story to while away the hours - then ok. Go for it.

I'd heard raving reviews on it. Everyone said it's better than The Da Vinci Code. I finished reading it this morning, and felt like I wasted my time. This book had so many similarities to The Da Vinci Code it's not even funny. Guy gets murdered, his daughter/granddaughter has to help Robert solve clues to a puzzle before they both get killed. Bad guy is who you least expect. I'm surprised in The Da Vinci Code, Robert didn't say, \\"Didn't I just go through this last year?\\" It really made me lose respect for Dan Brown."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thriller!!!","review":"I have been looking for a good thrilling book, fast pace and intelligent book to read. I was skeptical when my friend recomend this book and said the vatican was part of the plot and I thought another anti-christian book!! But it is far from that and it was a really really good book. Once I get in the middle, I could not put that book down. While Dan Brown research is amazing, I think the book retain his fictional characteristic.

However, if you can look past some of the more untenable issues in the book (I will let you determine what those are), the book has a very quick, action-packed story line. As a matter of fact, it all takes place within the span of a day! Many of the characters lacked the proper background to make them more realistic/believable. Yet despite these problems, I enjoyed reading the book. Hopefully Brown can come up with a new formula for his next book, because I think the religious conspiracy issue has been done for now..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an engaging book at all","review":"What book were these other reviewers reading?!?The Illuminati lore is poorly researched, the plot painfully transparent, and the overall pace of the book is erratic.If you are stuck in an airport, and need SOMETHING to read, I guess this book is okay.

Dan Brown weaved a very clever and intricate tale, combining fact and fiction well. I was completely enthralled with the book until the final 100 pages, as the culprit was being revealed. I felt that the story went from a thrilling mystery to a soap opera. I felt let down; almost like a cop-out. Based on the ending, I would've only given it 3 stars but I still want to acknowledge Brown's imagination for creating such a novel. I'm hoping The Da Vinci Code is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"blech","review":"So much has been said about Dan Brown's books it seems futile to contribute but for this one I had to: IT AIN'T WORTH IT. I bought this at the airport thinking that, like Da Vinci Code, it would be good company on the plane. My money would have been spent more wisely on Jackie Collins. Even the moderately entertaining scavenger hunt through Rome doesn't compensate for the heavy-handed and boring dogma, the unidimensional characters and overblown sentimentality (that's right, I said Jackie would have been better). The writing lacks whatever charm and big screen drama The Da Vinci Code possesses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather predictable","review":"After reading \\"The da Vinci Code\\", I couldn't wait until \\"Angels & Demons\\" arrived. However, after the first twenty pages, it became apparent that the style was the same. (Reminded me of Grisham's same old, same old!) The second disappointment came, when I figured out immediately WHO the 'bad' guy was. The rest was just getting through. Although the research was impeccable, I was not as thrilled about this book. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Dan Brown Book","review":"I much preferred Angels and Demons to the other Dan Brown books.

For those interested in Roman sites mentioned in this book, and in Rome in general I recommend instead Morton's \\"A traveller in Rome\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than DaVinci Code","review":"In my opinion, Angels and Demons is a better book than the Da Vinci Code. I like the Code, but Angels and Demons kept me interested the whole time. I was so into it, I just couldn't put it down.It is apparent that Dan Brown definitely did his research on this book. These are many historical documents and artifacts that are utilized as part of the plot. If you like action thrillers, you will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this before Da Vinci Code","review":"I am a huge Crichton Fan, I am finding Dan Brown as good as him in writing thrillers based on some facts, some fiction a lot of technology and your are learning while getting entertained"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get on with it","review":"I found the book to be a bit too long and followed a kind of comic book formula of the hero getting into trouble but finding a way out of his dilemma. There were characters who may or may not be bad guys through the book and the mystery was to work out who the true bad guy was.If you like adventure books, you may like this one, although Clive Cussler does it better.Perhaps the movie will be an improvement......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written Well - Bad for Society","review":"Angels and Demons like the Da Vinci Code was written very well I thought. These books both keep you reading and wondering what is going to happen next. They are however both going to contribute to societal decay. That makes them harmful rather then just inert entertainment. I have read them both but many with little faith or knowledge seem to be treating them as fact instead fiction sprinkled with a few facts. Since societal evolution is so important I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely ridiculous!!!","review":"The only redeeming quality of this book is it takes you on a modest tour of Rome, a city I LOVE. However, the writing is so melodramatic and the ending just blatantly insulting to one's intelligence, that I finished this book with a giant roll of the eyes and promptly opened a bottle of wine to erase the memory of what I'd just read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factually inaccurate, but mildly entertaining","review":"After reading a lot after Pope John Paul's death last year, I learned a lot about the church and the Papal election. After reading this book I questioned the research and factual accuracy of this book and it has to bring into question the factual accuracy of Dan Brown's other books.Aside from that...if you can get past it, the book is an entertaining summer read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed Action Thriller","review":"Let's keep it simple.

The story is pure drivel and the writing is wretched. The bogus \\"miracles\\" at the end are just the cap on a collection of incredible (in the strictest sense) plot gyrations that induce a mental gag reflex. The text is replete with numerous stylistic and even a few grammatical boners. The writing is \\"hack\\" at best. Don't waste your mind or your time on this. I certainly won't bother with the Da Vinci Code."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grat Read","review":"I just could not put this book down I read the whole thing in 2 days my wife was upset cause I wasn't talking to her I was reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More research needed","review":"One other reviewer cited numerous errors of language, geography, etc., but the one that really irked me concerned the physics.The supposedly brilliant physicist Vittoria wants to use antimatter as an energy source to cure the world's ills, but fails to reconginize that no matter how efficient the production of anitmatter might be made, one cannot get around Einstein's mass-energy equivalence. Even with 100% efficiency, it would still require putting as much energy into the production of antimatter as the subsequent annihilation would release.While the story is a fun read on a rainy afternoon, it was built on such a flimsy foundation that I was glad when it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Page turner","review":"I will give Mr. Brown his due, this book is a page turner, after reading it however I wish I could get my 12 hours back. Calling this book immature would be an accurate critique. Don't bother reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan Brown thinks your dumb","review":"Is there action? Yes.Historical intrigue? You got it.Romance? Yeap.So what's the problem.The problem is it's all just so conveniently wrapped in a thick cloth of unbelievable coincidence and painfully dumb prose. Brown acts as if audience has an IQ of 12. He endlessly explains and reminds the audience of facts that any reasonably educated adult should know. What's worse he explains these facts by way of the characters, who are all highly educated albeit in different fields. The net effect was painful irritation to the point were I had to set the book down and walk away. I did make it through, since the premise and the overall story are quite compelling and I wanted to see how it would end. If only this idea had been developed by a writer like Haruki Murakami instead of Dan Brown.I have not read or seen the De Vinci Code and I can't imagine I will. Not even 1,000 angry, albino monks can make me."},{"rating":"2","title":"You wouldn't want to put it down!!!","review":"Dan Brown is one of the best modern authors. This book makes you forget about the outside world!!! Exciting, interesting and captivating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it and read Da Vinci Code","review":"This book starts out practically the same - complete unoriginality, but at least he did it better in Da Vinci. Read this one first so it only get better, or just skip it. This one was a little tedious, although it had a lot of the same elements. Big disappointment after Da Vinci Code which I loved and finished in a day or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great, read","review":"The author does a really good job of blending many aspects of the story line together, but in the end, I was a bit unfulfiilled. Still an excellent read, however. wwr@virginia.edu"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book by Dan Brown","review":"I did not care for the last 100 pages of this book. I do enjoy Dan Brown's writing, however this book is a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but an obvious agenda (Spoilers below)","review":"I really liiked this book for the first 600 pages or so...MUCH better than the DaVinci Code.But then the true Dan Brown kicked in with his anti-Catholic agenda. (For the record, I am neither Catholic, nor devoutly religious)He writes a tremendously stirring speech about religion and science which, in my opinion, is among the best I've read. But then, since he just can't STAND to have the Catholic church look good in any way, he makes the character who delivered that speech a crazy psychopathic zealot and the ultimate villian of the story, thus wiping out all the credibility and reason of the earlier speech.He did this anti-religion crap in DaVinci Code and he does it here as well.Having said that, if you have to pick one book or the other, pick this one. It's a much better read.It's just too bad he can't let go of his agenda to discredit modern religion. He's just another liberal mouthpiece in that regard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced and captivating!","review":"Although it's clear from the beginning that a lot of things in this book can't be true (like a super fast air plane, the existance of antimatter, etc) this book is really captivating. It is fast paced and I sometimes had to browse a few pages back to reread and make sure I understood the hints that had been given before but that were not clarified yet. Every time I thought I knew what would happen the story took an unexpected turn; bad guys turned into good guys, good guys into bad guys. I would definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan Brown is overreaching","review":"In Angels and Demons, Dan Brown was seriously overreaching. The book is a fiasco and the ending does NOT make sense at all. I don't know how he built this whole story.I do give him credit for his writing abilities, which earned him 2 stars for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An 8 year old can write better.","review":"This book is rubbish,....really. The silly story is one thing, but the dumbed down writing style is just too much. I'm no great expert on novels, but I know crap writing when I read it. It really is lowest-common-denominator stuff. If you enjoy a good read, don't be fooled. this is not one. Dan Brown certainly didn't gain his fortune and fame with DVC because he is a good writer, the esoterica and arcana that he utilised to build his plot around seemed to strike a cord, however, the writing and character development is rubbish. Same here. Don't waste your money on this. Dan doesn't need it thats for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not if you've got a brain","review":"The plot twists and turns with today's style and the author's inaccuracies on just about everything could be ignored to make this an enjoyable read. However, his allusions to how non-believers can have no morals, and for me a wonderment of why his book attacks the Order of the Masons as being Satanic has made me decide that when I force myself to finish the book I will never read another of his. The world does not need his new versions of torture, nor his misconceptions about the world around him. I've read other somewhat preachy books - one about the millenium being when Christ is reborn that were thrilling and wonderful. I know this book is fiction, but I also know that people read and take a lot of print as truth, or at least the ideas in them. Dan Brown's ideas are of no worth and destroy what fun there could be in reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Time","review":"Angels and Demons would be a wonderful book if Dan Brown could write. The premise is compelling, the anagrams are fascinating, the science presented is interesting.The problem is that the pace is off, the characters too easily solve the puzzles(no new information has been presented about the current conundrum, but somehow, the answer that has elluded our imminent symbologist heretofore suddenly pops into his brain--just in the nick of time to avoid death and destruction. That scenario is believable one time, but Dan Brown does it again and again.), and the attacks on the church eventually began to annoy this reader.I was hoping for an intelligent thriller...instead, I got a book that just couldn't deliver. Umberto Eco and even Michael Connelly are much more worthwhile authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"So awful it's painful","review":"More konspirata drivel. The opposition runs around in sweatshirts that are emblazoned with \\"BAD GUY\\" in large red letters; the hero is actually stupider than a box of rocks, despite his academic qualifications; the Swiss Guard is once again reduced to a group of bumbling idiots; everyone dashes around being shocked by the obvious; etc. etc. It is almost as though Brown tried to cram every possible thriller cliché into 569 pages. If there had even been a leavening of wit, this would have been the comedy thriller of the year: The Pink Panther meets James Bond. As it is, alas, deadly, dully, heavily serious, there is no redeeming social virtue what so ever. Virtually the only use for this thing is as a doorstop or paperweight, please do not waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's just ok","review":"as someone already said, \\"improbably, boring, dull, and over the top.\\" the beginning of the book was good and pulled me in, but the rest of the book gradually left me wanting more. the main character runs around on a wild goose chase escaping from death in the most unbelievable and ridiculous ways. he had too many unlikely escape from death experiences and \\"oh yea i've got it\\" momments to make me puke.if you like run of the mill and luke warm fiction this is for you. if your favorite books are bought from the impulse isle in the grocery store then this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible writer!","review":"I wish I could assign less than one star. I bought this because I wanted to start with the earlier books before reading the DaVinci Code. I'm assuming that the writing is much better in his later books. The triteness of his prose, the lack of continuity (where was the editor?) and his undeveloped characters with their stitled dialogues made me abandon my efforts to read the entire book. Umberto Eco he's not.Suspending belief is one thing, but you would have to suspend any expectation of good literature to read this. I have too many specific complaints to list here. Don't waste your time, even for a beach read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this better then Da Vinci Code","review":"This is a fast pased prequil that you do not have to read any of the other books for. While Dan Brown got the Papal elections and some hisorical facts wrong, it was a great thriller and was well written. If you haven't done so, read this one.Dan Brown takes on the Catholic Church in a conspricy involing the downfall of the church and it secrets. Protected by a secret sect called the illiminati, a group of inteltuals who see science as thier religion. It is centeres aourd the the Vatican the art of some of it's compatriots.I had a hard time puting this one down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another failure...","review":"This book is a book written by an author thinking that his readers are feebleminded. He's aiming for an audience that doesn't know fact from fiction and won't bother to look up what they don't know. Again he tries desperately to meld fact (very few things in this book are accurate) and fiction, and it just results in something too predictable and really dumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed review","review":"I read Da Vinci Code first and absolutely love it. This book wasn't as good but definatley worth reading. Some of the things that happened to the heroine were just so unbelievable, like the helicopter scene. However as alway it was a page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than expected!!","review":"I read this book after the Da Vinci code and as others have indicated, I too was very surprised as I did not expect this to be as good. I enjoyed the quick pace of the story, the diverse subject matter, or anti - matter :) and the plot and descriptions of the Vatican were well worth the price of the book. The jump from the plane was a bit much, not even a broken bone, but I forgive him because the rest was very enjoyable. I appreciated as well that I didnt have to read either book in any other to enjoy them both completely on their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"roller-coaster ride","review":"I thought this was a great read. I heard that I had to read this first, before the Da Vinci Code, so I did and couldn't put it down. I'm not well-read enough to be aware of all the factual inaccuracies, so I'll just report on the fact that the novel is fast-paced and exciting. I liked all the historical facts and mythology and plot twists. There was a certain lack of substance with the characters and the plot tended to wrap itself up \\"nicely,\\" but overall, Brown's writing kept me turning the pages. If you're looking for accuracy and credibility, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a fun read that keeps you interested with fact action and plot twists that you keep you guessing, this is your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Miracle","review":"That this novel is so popular makes you believe in God. Miracles can happen. For this is simply a very bad book. The language is flat, the characters are caricatures, and the physics simplistic. Copernicus was not executed. The story of Galileo is more complex than Brown allows. The Catholic Church embraces evolutionary theory and does not require the teaching of creationism. And their are legitimate moral concerns about scientific research and developments.Maybe there is a superb plot twist at the end. But I can't put myself through the torture of reading such bad writing and so much misinformation to find out.Check out something like The Seville Connection for an intelligent mystery involving the Vatican. The difference is as between light and darkness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect blend of religion and science","review":"I started reading this book when the power went off during an ice storm; I lit all the candles in my apartment and read 250 pages in a single night. When my power was restored the next day, I cut the lights off again and finished the book by candlelight. Once you start reading this book, you will not be able to put it down.Nearly every review I read about this book applauded the author for his plot twists, the book's basis in factual information, and its quick pace. While I enjoyed every single one of these strengths, I especially appreciated Dan Brown's excellent presentation of the conflict between science and religion. As a scientist trying to resolve these two aspects of his life, Angels and Demons provided some excellent food for thought in a very entertaining package."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never met an Illuminati I didn't like","review":"Dan Brown has created the ultimate thrill ride with Angels & Demons. After buying this book and only spending a few moments with it, I told a friend that I had just read the most exciting 27 pages I could remember, and that if the rest of the book was half as good as the beginning, I hadn't wasted my money.Once I had finished the book, I went looking for other Dan Brown titles, knowing that I was unlikely to be disappointed with anything else he'd written.Angels & Demons forces the reader to ask some very interesting questions. Did the Illuminati exist? If they did, what was their effect on Western Civilization? Do they still exist, and are they a danger? One hopes, of course, that they have always been mythical, but there are those lingering doubts.Filled with interesting, complex charactes and wonderfuly exotic locales - even if they are in places we think we know - Angels & Demons delivers the goods. A fun and exciting read all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hackwork from a Google Searcher","review":"The prose is incoherent. The storyline incomprehensible (and unbelievable). The characters are straight out of a Hollywood blockbuster scripted by Donald Rumsfeld, complete with an Arabic bad guy who's portrayed as a savage. The \\"clues\\" are hokey. And I swear, if Dan Brown wrote, \\"He was not prepared for what would happen next\\" one more time, I would personally send him my undergraduate fiction writing textbook free of charge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prelude to a masterpiece","review":"While this was not as exciting as The Da Vinci Code, I feel Dan Brown should get more credit as an author for this lesser known prequel of sorts. It really set the stage for The Code, and kept me just as intrigued. No need to red the books in order either! I read this after The Code and found it just as exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"book summarized in beginning!","review":"don't be fooled! the whole story was summarized at the beginning of the book leaving no suspense at all (unlike the da vinci code)! i was bored and had trouble keeping my eyes open most of the time. consequently, i only finished 2/3 of the book and decided enough was enough. i went ahead to began another book and never looked back.A&D only peaked my interest after being blown away by the DVC, which im sure holds true for many others. i have to say that i'm truly disappointed with A&D and am skeptical about brown's other work. i just hope the sequel to DVC will live up to its potential (DVC II expected release date is Summer 2005)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A majestic, stirring score","review":"Ron Goodwin's soundtrack \\"Battle of Britian\\" has to be one of the most stirring, exciting movies scores I've ever heard. It deserves far more praise and attention that it gets. The music of this soundtrack truly moves you and you want to hear it over and over again. It will always be one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Ron Goodwin Score","review":"The film score by Ron Goodwin is wonderful to listen to. However, with only a couple of exceptions, I found the score by Sir William Walton painful to listen to (no wonder much was not included in the film). Be sure to rip the Goodwin pieces to a CD or MP3 player and leave Sir Wm. Walton at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overview of a little-known event","review":"In 1841, Mary Rogers, a well-known resident of the city of New York, was found floating in the Hudson River, dead. The investigation was hampered by jurisdictional disputes and the primitive forensic science of the time, and is officially still unsolved. It was a great stir in its day, and everybody had opinions about it; Edgar Allen Poe based his \\"Mystery of Marie Roget\\" on it. Geary gives us the known facts, and proposes a solution in line with the modern thinking on the subject. His evocative artwork makes this book a visual treat. I'd love to see him tackle the alleged murder of Sarah M. Cornell by the Reverend Ephraim K. Avery; it occured at nearly the same time this case did, and is still officially unsolved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stranger than fiction","review":"I'm addicted to Geary's true-crime series, \\"A Treasury of Victorian Murder\\" and this volume is probably one of the best I've read thus far. The story is that of the well-chronicled but mysterious death of a popular New York cigar seller, Mary Rogers. The circumstances of her death, the people involved and the evidence gathered all make for a seriously bizarre but fascinating true-crime tale. Rick Geary's meticulous black-and-white illustrations are tidy and convey the story wonderfully. An unusual use of the \\"graphic novel\\" medium, but an effective one. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irresponsible Seller","review":"The dvd has problems. I suspect it is probably a pirated copy. It does not play well on my TV.

It is nice to read something upbeat with decent, nondisfunctional characters and a happy ending for a change. And there were some good points made about our political processes. I put it down with a smile.That being said, the middle dragged,and the characters, except for the late-appearing female Chinese scientist, were appealing but not really interesting.As a science fan, I was very disappointed that the book was not better.

It also dovetails very nicely into birthing positions.

Upon receiving this DVD, I found out that the DVD offered no captioning OR subtitle features. I spoke with Amazon and suggested that they remove the captioning claim so future customers with hearing loss won't make the same mistake; the response I received was that my suggestion would be taken into consideration at this time.

If it's not bad enough that you're tired from being pregnant, this DVD puts you to sleep. I understand that yoga is supposed to relax a person, but this is severe boredom.

While the preferences and decisions that one has in regards to their own relationships are a very personal thing and while interracial marriage and relationships are something that deserve serious discussion and consideration, I wonder how anyone feels they can find valid advice or analysis from a volume whose very cover portrays a very racist and derogatory image of a white woman.

But wine is just fine. He could die at any moment, and his mother lets him go off to New York with his two moronic friends. What mother would do that? At least go with him! He could die at any moment! And what about his friend's parents? This movie is just so incoherent.

So, we have to suspend our disbelief when he takes off for New York to woo a supermodel. Alright, I can do that. But then we have to add in a bit of a subplot with the old mom going for evening strolls with the good-looking football player. It was really one too many impossible relationships for me to buy into. The movie went all over the place, and not in a good way. Felt like they were BSing their way through to the end of the movie. And all the flashback/hallucinations got tiresome fast. It's not that there weren't any redeeming qualities to the movie, but that those qualities were diluted and squandered by the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The more strange, the better","review":"I was enchanted and stirred by this film. It begins very much grounded in sad realities --a teenage boy dying of cancer, his widowed mother bereft as she tries to help him pass away with as much happiness and dignity as possible. But as the story unspools itself, it moves beyond reality -- in fact, beyond expectation -- as the young man edges toward ever closer communion with his late father, with spiritual truths, and with his own earthly and adolescent dreams. The more strange and ethereal this story got, the more I enjoyed it. The performances are true and compelling, particularly Michael Angarano's and Cynthia Nixon's. This was a movie I happened on almost by chance, and not the sort I would have normally seen. That would have been my loss. I've thought about it quite a bit since I saw it in a theatre more than a month ago. I'm certain to see it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, uneventful, glib","review":"I'm going to ignore that this movie looked and felt cheap throughout. It's obvious the budget was low. Low budget movies can be good if they have good writers. One Last Thing has nothing close to good writing. The writers had a lot of themes they touched, but none with any impact. Dying, loss, death, hope, faith, doubt, suffering, these are all part of the movie, but are used so thoughtlessly. Pearls are cast before swine and made to plastic. The characters are grossly undeveloped and the relationships as plastic as the themes. The marque relationship consists of two people who share three minutes of camera time and 100 words. Any tears that could come from that are fake. Don't waste your time. There are plenty of good movies about suffering, death, faith, and doubt. One Last Thing should be the last one on any such list."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"This author does a half... job at tearing down the accomplishments of social science - particularly sociology. He often fuses ideas of the individual (psychology) and the social reformers (I suppose he means sociologists).

I found his work to be completely bias and often times contradictory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, not great","review":"There is a rawness in this recording that is refreshing, both in the playing, which seems to fall apart at times, and in the recording itself. There is also a humor in the approach--the name, the names taken by the bandmembers, the song titles. However, I was ultimately somewhat disappointed in this. After only a few listens, I didn't seem to be getting anything new out of it. I think a good record does that, giving repeated listens a value as you discover something new.

I read it very quickly and the only problem I had with it was the heroine during the first part of the book. I just feel that she didn't match up to the quality of the heroine's in all of Lisa's other novels and that she was a tad mercenary. But, she improved as it went. I just LOVED Simon!

At times I was rather bored with all the details. There were moments when the transition from one paragraph to another was abrupt and confusing.

I believe that there was too much going on with the other characters as well as details about games...I find that this author's previous work has more to offer the reader.

This first book was a great start, to hopefully, an excellent series. I loved the author's smooth writing style with hardly any boring moments in this book. Her characterization was excellent and if Simon is an example of her heroes in following books, then I can't wait to devour them all.

Simon is okay, but not the dreamy heroes Kleypas usually conjurs up.Kleypas is usually steamy, but the love scenes here seemed forced. Worse, the entire books is shallow, superficial, much like the heroine. It's slow and makes for a long read. A real disappointment. In fact, as I've written this review, I've lowered the rating.

It took me almost 5 days to finish the book, (I usually finish her books in one night) & the last half I practically skimmed through. I really didn't like Annabelle, even though I tried my hardest, I thought she's exactly what the earl of Westcliff says in the book, \\"shallow and selfish and self-absorbed.\\" In my opinion, even though Simon is a \\"commoner\\" and a butcher's son, he's too good for her.

Those who paid more attention to the book would recognize what happened when she married Simon and not a peer. Money was high on the priority list for a groom, but being a peer was not even an option---it was a must. I thought Lisa did a wonderful job conveying how the London Ton would have viewed this couple. Unlike other historical romances where daughters of dukes marry horsetrainers and are welcomed into societey with open arms, this one is realistic and all the better for it.

The book is so short and so densely packed that it is difficult to absorb the information. The author uses the regionalization of the Blues as it traveled from the South to the North as his basis for examination; occasionally throwing in lyrics or musical notes to support a point, but their inclusion seems to be haphazard at best.

But alas, AMC is going the cheap route (fewer zombies and less action, limited location shooting). As it is, we spent all of Season 2A running around in a circle with a less-than stellar ending. \\"Nebraska\\" does little to ensure that Season 2B is going to be anything special, seemingly drawing an even smaller circle within.

I swear that women is the dumbest person on the show. Really how long could she have thought her husband dead. He had on IV bag that may last about a day or two at most depending on how slow the drip was, than the body can only last a week with out water. I guess the lesson is that if you think you love one is dead and zombies walk the earth wait more than a week to sleep with their best friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show","review":"Season two is a bit slow, but it doesn't lack excitement and good zed head killing.

Has a good storyline and character development. It is gory, I mean the dead are eating the living and there is blood and guts and decay but I have to say it wouldn't be a bad show for teens to watch with parents, there isn't any nudity that I recall or lots gratuitous sex scenes to make it inappropriate or uncomfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this episode.....","review":"Finally, some reality...I hope the series is taking a turn from the \\"who's my baby's daddy\\" drama and getting into the nitty gritty of what the world would become if this were to really happen. Shane has some bad qualities, but my hat was off to him this episode. He has the guts to do what others will not. He is a survivor. Rick finally grew a pair as well and I cheered him on on the last part of this episode. Not a lot of zombie action this episode.....but it wasn't needed. They are in survival mode...there's plenty of time to run into zombies, and truth be told.....in a situation like this, there is way more to be feared than zombies. Enjoy! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guess they can leave the farm now ;-)","review":"Zombie Survival Rule #37:Kids, when an adult tells you to stay put in a safe location, don't get retarded and wander away, else you will get zombified.Finally!

Bring Maggie along though...she's cute!Maybe this signifies a turning point in season 2, and we'll see less melodrama and more terror.

Unfortunately, those have been dashed after the writers decided to have the cast settle into little house on the prairie so that they can all work out their emotions.This season is floundering, and why did they think that basing the entire season around finding a single lost girl would be a good thing? Okay, we get it, you still think she has a chance. Unfortunately I don't think I can say the same thing about me coming back if there's a season 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Regaining Traction","review":"My first disappointment is that it is yet another episode spent/wasted searching for the lost girl. As a consolation, a major character expresses his exasperation with this futile and monotonous pursuit.Now for the foolishness:An unconscious character wakes in a stream-bed to find a zombie munching on his... steel-toed boot. A barn full of zombies that hitherto and inexplicably went undiscovered is revealed at the end. This is done in typical Lost (a detestable show that I quit watching after 2 seasons) and Breaking Bad (a series that turned things back around midseason) style where the episode's major revelation is left for the very last scene.All this portends to a Lost style program. A foolish program that I despised.[..]Set the hook, keep giving them mysteries, and, most importantly delay, or better yet, deny a pay off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Days of Our Lives, with Zombies?","review":"Each episode in season 2 seems to follow a template:- 5 minute intro teasing the viewer into thinking something interesting is finally going to happen,- 30 minutes of endless soliloquy, ineffectual shouting matches, and baby daddy drama,- 10 minute climax in which something at least mildly interesting happens, giving the viewer hope that the next episode might be worth watching without the fast forward button.I'm ready for the gang to get back on the road and advance the story. Sadly, AMC's listings for the rest of the season indicate [*slight spoiler*] they won't be leaving the boring old farm for the foreseeable future. I'll give the rest of the season a miss and wait to see if season 3 - should one be forthcoming - can bring back some of what made season 1 so gripping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is a horrible disappointment for me.I wanted to watch an excellent show in it's second season and what I got instead was a terrible show that couldn't figure out what it wanted to do with it's self.It spent most of it's time in a place that wasn't nearly as prominent in the books,and then had it's main character at the end of the season completely change.You may like this show regardless of how poorly it is done but I am not watching it any longer and am certainly not paying to watch it ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"streaming problems","review":"I guess i read it wrong and the husband was unhappy i didnt buy him the dvds.

We do watch the series even though I took a strong dislike to some of the characters and wish they'd decide whether zombies can or can't open doors, pry things open or flap at them, run or drunkenly reel around. Let's face it, when all that's working in your skull for \\"thinking\\" is your brain stem, you're essentially walking piece of rotting meat, not Einstein. The special effects are great, and this case looks just as ucky as the guy that Andrea stuck with the screwdriver, and I'm waiting for the next season to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"very entertaining","review":"You may think think this is just another show in the zombie genre, and it some ways, it is. But the characters are complex and they are developing interesting roles. The writing is compelling enough so just when you want to see some zombie chase scenes, one comes along. I would say that this is not horror in the traditional sense. I get freaked out by horror movies, but this show does not scare me like those. This show falls more comfortably in the drama genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It!!!","review":"One series I will watch over and over again.

The visual effects are great and the storyline is also been pretty solid. The one thing I don't like about it and some might find fault with is that he gets caught up in the TV \\"drama affect\\" sometimes. Where they make a lot of big deals out of emotional things that I think sometimes are overblown. Another thing you might dislike is the amount of stupid decisions they make as a group it's laughable. In all seriousness this group of people would not last as long as they have on the show.So is the few things and think about but I highly recommend you check it out if you're like me and love zombies."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Incredible Walking Dead","review":"Here's the thing: this show is amazing. To say anything less means you are a terrorist. And Americans hate terrorists. Are you an American? Or a terrorist? The acting is superb, the drama is exhilarating, and the suspense is so thick it can be cut with a knife and served with Thanksgiving dinner. I can't think of a better TV show at this point. Waiting the two days to get this in my mailbox was two days too long. We really need to develop teleportation devices so when you buy this award winning, face melting, life altering show, it can immediately pop itself into your DVD player and play itself.

Things seem to be becoming a little more bizarre every week. This may not be necessarily a good sign.4.) great actors and great acting giving us memorable characters.Conclusion:Overall a rather slow episode (2 1/2 to 3 Stars), but with a stunning finale (5+ Stars)Aggregate rating 4 1/2 Stars.Ray Nicholson"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zombies?","review":"Ok, I don't like zombies! I have never watched a single zombie movie all the way through, but this caught me up. Really I find myself watching it for the actual characters.

When season 1 was released I bought it immediately, only to find a few months later that a better more fleshed out bluray/dvd was released. This appears to be happening again. I just want AMC and whoever else is in charge of these stripped down releases to STOP doing this. You aren't doing yourself any favors by alienating and infuriating your core audience with sub par format releases. I will not buy this version and neither should you. Instead, wait for the better release that will come a few months after this one.

Show was probably made by morally bankrupt liberals. One zombie for the whole issue!? Come on! I watch the show now only to see their demize, I hope Shane is dismembered and served up as a burrito.

Plenty of military weapons laying around, M2 .50 caliber machine guns, tanks ( why not start one up and use it? )etc... and they do not gather them. They keep themselves meagerly armed despite many opportunities to upscale their protection. Someone needs to pick up one of those M2 machine guns a mow down a heard of walkers.

The action is spread throughout and the dialog seems to be getting to a place where the arguments that were slowly boiling are starting to get more honed.My issue is currently the static nature of some of the \\"dark side\\" members of the cast - we continue to see them make bad decisions (this episode really highlights that) yet the group keeps them around, with little more than a slap on the wrist. I hope that either they begin to change their nature and grow, or the group sees the true hazard that they represent and removes them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets move on","review":"These guys can't quite get out of Atlanta.

Gruesome, gross, and downright AWESOME! I haven't opened mine yet, but my buddy got one and I was able to check it out! Screwdriver while sending this undead horror back to whence it came also serves as a locking mechanism that when pushed in fully, locks the head down and keeps your blue rays safely inside! I swear this must be the zombie \\"Andrea\\" killed in the second season inside the camper in exactly the same fashion. My reason for not opening it yet is simple, its a limited edition, and Netflix now has the second season up for streaming, so there is no need for me to open it and possibly devalue it! If you can still get one at a similar price to what Amazon had it for, go for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Season 2 Is Terrible","review":"If you thought season 1 was ok, season 2 is trash. It has quickly become a soap opera loosely set in a post-apocalyptic zombie-infested world. The characters and their drab relationship dramas take center-stage, with occasional zombie attacks. Who the hell would have time for silly relationship issues in a world full of zombies trying to eat your flesh? It's also full of plain stupid writing. The zombies are attracted to sound, this was established in season 1, yet the survivors drive around with a Harley Davidson, and waste bullets shooting cans for some sport target practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show!","review":"This show is better than 3 star rating it currently has...It's a good show.

I am addicted to zombie movies and shows so have seen tons that are horrible. However, I feel that the conversations this seasons is less realistic and if this was really going on would not be so polite. The first seasons talking parts didn't seem as bad. Honestly, if I was with a group and a man that just woke up to find out it was the end of the world started leading and kept bring us to dead ends I would so peace out. I really don't understand as well why no one has ever seen a zombie movie before. If more common knowledge was in there, the talking parts would be more tolerable.

I understand why people want to see more zombies, but I also understand why the writers are only giving us a couple at a time. If every week we watched a zombie army attack the camp we would all become numb to it and when the story called for an epic zombie bloodbath it would just be another drop in the bucket.The thing that surprises me the most about all of these episodes is how closely they follow the comics. I expected the writers to go where ever they wanted but they're staying pretty true to the original story. So as a fan of the comic I couldn't be happier watching the comic being brought to life for TV. Before the late 90's any comic to TV or Movie adaptation was pure garbage and rarely even attempted. I guess that's why I think this show is so great."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW.","review":"We knew another Rick/Shane confrontation was going to happen, but everything else in this episode was out of the blue.

They are cheating the fans with dry episodes having ONE and only one thing in each episode that makes it worth watching. What a rip-off. I love zombies and this is NOT ABOUT A ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE any more, it's a soap opera where they throw in a few zombies to keep the title. I am not sure I will continue to watch. Yes, I can write better episodes which leads me to believe the professional writers are not so talented. I won't be wasting my $2 an episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF?!

I've watched the first season at least 20 times and it never gets old,just a really well done show.Season 2 however is....Ehhh there were like 4 episodes that were decent but totally not worth the $70 price tag that they want here. The main Character Rick slowly became a mega DBag and completely unlikeable,they did nothing the whole season but sit on a farm Talking and occasionally killing a zombie or two....Boring!

Would definitely recommend this store and product :) :) :) :) :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor acting/poor theme","review":"Just watched the first episode of season 2 and just like season 1 this show seems to be pretty boring as far as plot and acting go. The ending to the first episode was probably the dumbest 2 minutes I have ever watched on TV. Why on god's blue earth would the two men just let the boy walk towards the deer? Why? Why would that happen in reality? And then the boy gets shot by another hunter! You have to be kidding me. This will be the last I watch of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This episode literally added nothing to the story. It was as if this were all of the scenes they would have normally thrown out, but just put them together and said \\"Yay!

We hate this show and don't want to work on it anymore.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Fell Off Of a Cliff","review":"If you are looking for an original, exciting, well made and well acted horror show to spend your time and money on, don't just run away from Season 2, FLEE as if a hoard of ravenous zombies was 3 feet behind you and just seconds from sinking their foul, rotten teeth into the soft flesh of your backside. On the other hand, if you're an insomniac, and are looking for a cure, something that will lull you right to sleep, then this is just what you've been searching for. Remember those low budget, made for video or TV, horror movies that either bored you to death or were so silly that they made you laugh instead of scream? Yes indeed, the season 2 writers must have dug up a bunch of them and used them as blueprints for this show. Seriously, terrible is far too soft a description. My family has been waiting over a year for season 2 to come out on Netflix, and now we are disappointed enough to almost cry. Just skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty darn good","review":"it is a little soap opera-reish BUT! the plot is good and the ending to the second season was a shocker great job now all they need to do is cut the soap opera stuff a little and kill off mrs grimes for cheating on her husband"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother, It's Just Dead","review":"This show isn't even walking anymore.

With very sparse sprinkles of zombie action, this show has become a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I waited a whole week for this? A cool series turned slow boring drama, with the occasional zombie for shock. This show is Walking Dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disintegration of any value","review":"What is crazy is both the way this show has simply gone no where since the beginning of the season, and how much the positive reviewers ignore the obvious bad writing, bad acting and silly repetitious plotting. It's like General Hospital with the addition of a weekly zombie or 2, where no one speaks like humans, they just stage whisper because Hollywood thinks that shows powerful emotion. I'm sorry, this show has just gotten embarrassing. At least they finally followed the books and killed off the main cause of the redundancy, the Shane character. It's about a season and a half too late, but progress is progress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made his day","review":"My husband about hit the ceiling when he opened this. Perfect for him!

This Farm is a rut and the series is doomed until you get the characters out of that cesspool that is Hershel's Farm. Move on let it go. Accidential fire, anything just get them out of there. Please look for the \\"Was this review helfpul to you.\\" statement and then click the yes button. Maybe like the virus that brough us the Walking Dead the \\"Leave the Farm\\" request will get under the director's skin and he will relent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will bore you to death.","review":"This show has gone from bad to worse with the second season. They should simply remove the zombies, they never get more than 2 minutes in the series. I expected to see more zombies than endless chatter. This series is just filled endless talking and crying. Lots of grown men crying constantly. Need a downer for the week?... just watch an episode. I do not plan on paying to hear people just chat on and on about their issues and no one is being proactive in establishing anything for themselves. Why can't they go find there own house to live in. The have the whole US to pick a house at this point.To summarize my review..... the opposite of crack writing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh SO Boring!","review":"I too, like many of the other reviewers, have been disappointed in season 2, it has gotten so boring.

I don't know what it is about this show but I can't wait for the next episode! Having all the seasons to watch together is really cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Series is Slipping","review":"Season One was great, particularly early on. Season Two (4 episodes in) is a big come-down. Not enough action, too much talking. Every episode there are around three scenes in which characters have a long, tedious heart-to-heart about their relationship and it kills any narrative momentum. Take a tip from the zombies--stop freaking talking! If it weren't for Crossbow, there wouldn't be anyone (alive) left to like."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Walking Dead","review":"I LOVE this show. My husband and I are completely addicted.I avoided this show until now. I finally caved while my son was on leave from the Army and we couldn't stop watching. The writing and story are captivating. It's fascinating to ponder what you would do in the same situation. We found ourselves pausing the episodes and debating who was right/wrong, etc. It's so hard to wait from week to week for the next show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never thought I'd like a show like this...","review":"I've never been one to like zombie shows and creepy movies. Hubby got me watching this show and after I watched the first season I had to buy the 2nd!

If you've watched a show like Dexter, that is pretty normal. I watch Dexter by the season, so I guess its different when you watch 5 episodes in a row. This series, same way =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely watchable","review":"This show has become a slow & uninteresting soap opera. In a post apocalyptic world we're still supposed to care about stupid relationship issues in episode 5? Not only this, but zombies are attracted to noise, the characters are aware of this, yet they drive around with a Harley, waste bullets shooting at can targets, and I just can't stand the level of stupidity put forth by the writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING DOESN'T DESCRIBE!!!!!","review":"I was a late comer to this series. I randomly decided to buy the season 1 dvd, because I had a gift card to Best Buy to use up. Since then, I have obsessed. I own all of the first series figures, all of the novels to date, 30+ of the comic books, have a dual photo pic of me, Jon Bernthal (Shane), Norman Reedus (Daryl)...always looking to add more stuff. Enough about that, this is the best zombie show made. You get the character build up, the actual way people would deal in a situation had it actually happened. Hell, I even got a Zombie Survival Kit. This show takes a hold of you, and doesn't let go. I highly recommend this series if you love suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"The first season was amazing, and this season is like a Lifetime movie of the week, except it has zombies in it.

The silly interpersonal relationship issues are just ridiculous, and drag on, and on. With very sparse sprinkles of zombie action, this show has become a dud. There are just too many unbelievable nonsense fillers, like riding loud Harley Davidsons, and wasting bullets shooting cans. I can't watch this anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and slow and where are the zombies!","review":"The first season rocked and the second season sucks! I bought the second season on Amazon but have lost interest due to the lack of zombie presence. The second season does not have the raw grit, and attraction that the first season had that kept me staying up late to watch. I hope the producers fix this soon before I just give up on the walking dead completely. This show is more like a slow soap opera on a farm than a zombie movie classic that it was on track to become."},{"rating":"2","title":"starts slow but ends with a BANG!","review":"The second season of The Walking Dead is certainly full of ups and downs. Fast paced in some parts yet yawn slow in others. Very tense in some places yet boring in others. The one thing it has going for it over other series, is characters. Very well created and acted characters that you actually care about them (love some/hate some)The second season starts slow but builds pace in the later half very nicely. Over all, this is IMHO the best TV series on TV since lost. I am not a huge fan of zombies yet I love this TV show! I hope season 3 does not disappoint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Walking Dead - 'nuff said","review":"The subject says it all, it is the Walking Dead folks.

Each episode is like a theatrical production. Great effects and excellent acting. I cant believe we have to wait until Fall for another episode.

The very first episode draws you in quickly with the \\"wow, what would I do in that same situation\\" and \\"wouldn't that be freaky\\" kind of feel. My husband and I love the program and adore the option to download episodes on our own schedule, for $2 each, immediately to our TV, via our Amazon Prime membership. Very cool option for busy parents - just lock your door while you watch so that kiddos don't see zombie action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun","review":"Good Sci-Fi.

Have you ever watched a scary show or movie & been screaming at the characters, \\"what in the hell are you doing man! Don't go off in the dark alone! Don't leave your gun! Moron!!!\\" Well, this is one of the very first shows where I see people making decisions similar or identical to the ones I would make in the event of a zombie apocolypse.

I found some of the characters remained frustrating to watch, but overall this season kept me coming back for more episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"SNORE","review":"Season 1 of this show was beautiful. Every episode, my stomach was knotted up with the question, \\"Who is going to get eaten?\\" Nowhere was truly safe, even the camp was eventually overrun, and people died. It was frightening and I couldn't stop watching.Season 2 is a snoozefest focused on character development and emotional drama. \\"Im pregnant dont tell\\" \\"You told\\" \\"I love you\\" \\"I slept with Shane\\" \\"You had me at hello.\\" Blah blah blah. I care less and less about these characters. We are six episodes in and I dislike them all more with each passing episode. Without the 'survival tension', the show is just really a soap opera with zombies at the backdrop. Im secretly hoping the walkers escape from the barn, and kill everyone, except for Daryl, he's good peeps."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best episodes this season","review":"Season 2 of the Walking Dead has had its ups and downs, and I have been getting less enthusiastic about the show lately due to how it is dragging out conflicts in the group that could be handled with a little more imagination on the part of the writers. With that said, I feel that we have all been waiting for this episode to happen. I don't want to put spoiler's in here so I'll just say I can't wait to see how it plays out. I want to see how the rest of the group reacts to what everyone who has seen the show now knows. (On a side note, I took away a star for a campy b-movie horror flick effect they used close to the end. Like I said, some more imagination and a little less overt foreshadowing would do wonders for this show.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"Walking Dead is a great series! Keeps you on the edge of your seat always!! Never saw it coming!!

And I loved the 1st Season of The Walking Dead.Unfortunately, the second season and I am addressing the entire season here now as I don't have the time or inclination to rate each episode, IMHO, completely looses the thread of the Zombie genre'. Zombie books and movies are about Zombies chasing, threatening, and dining on the \\"survivors.\\"This is what made Season One great. Season two, has almost none of this at all. No heart rending turnings of bite victims, not brains or viscera getting dined on, few head shots, screams, terror or any of the things that are great about Zombies vs. survivors.I am hopeful that this is just the sophomore blues for this series, and it attains the entertainment value of the 1st season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thankfully there are no zombies because these people have low IQs.","review":"Just OK and I am being generous. No need to check towns or stores anymore before deeming them safe. No need to take precautions of the most basic kind (see ending). No need for guns. This group would have been dead in a real war.

This was first seen when the sheriffs friend turns to a zombie without even being touched. Are you serious? Oh by the way sheriff, your wife is pregnant also. Come on. As the world turns has better stories in it than a no win like this. The human mind wants some kind of hope in their life, how do you get it with that? Almost the whole season takes place at a farm that herds zombies in a barn. Anybody know what the ammo count is? I am a zombie-olic and love any movie zombie but this is getting just plain boring.

Try the internet, but for god's sake stop embarrassing yourselves with your ignorance of nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back from the break","review":"While the first half of the season left me feeling unhappy with the lack of development while we continued to watch the group deal with the same issues week to week, the comeback promises new things on the horizon. The shock of events surrounding the mid-season finale seem to wake up some character that have remained static for a while and the path the group has before it now seems to open up. Not much action in this episode, but some surprising turns near the end leave me with hope for the rest of the season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continues to be among my favorites!","review":"Don't listen to the naysayers! This is an amazing series. I loved the first season and \\"tried\\" to wait patiently for the second. It was well worth the wait.

I've experienced zero trouble with the streaming video. Now, this show is plain awesome. I can't wait for season three. My only problem (which is very specific for my taste) is that sometimes the zombies and killing are really gory. I can do without the gore. The core of the show (and the best part) is the interaction and group dynamics. So, good show, good service.

This is a delightfully fun series, not perfect, but how can anything in a 'zombie world' be perfect? The acting is good, story line fun, although a couple of the characters are whinny which can be irritating but overlooking that .. its just a fun series. And the best character in my book is Daryl .. Norman was great as a saint and even greater as a zombie killer.

The sex scene wasn't even played up hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"From First to Worst","review":"What started out as an excellent show has gone terribly wrong in it's 2nd season. Obviously, the producer and current crop of writers lost thier jobs when the 'Days of Our Lives' soap opera was canceled and were quickly hired to take over 'Walking Dead'. Sure, it's a perfect fit, just create endless melodrama and throw in the occasional gore to keep the kiddies happy and you have a hit show. Right? What a huge disappoint 'Walking Dead' has become. I doubt it can be saved under current management. AMC would do well to cancel the show, now, and save face. Maybe find a director and writers who actually enjoy the Zombie genre (and maybe someone who has a sense of humor) and try it again next year. That would be better than the slow death 'Walking Dead' is suffering now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst episode yet","review":"I think that the other reviews pretty much sum up how I feel. This show isn't even about zombies any more, it's just about petty drama stitched together terribly. This used to be my favorite show, but I give up. I'm not going to make excuses for it any more. It's not going to get any better. Good job on ruining a great idea AMC. Shouldn't have fired Darabont."},{"rating":"1","title":"The show rules but this special edition is a bad joke!","review":"When AMC announced this sweet box set it was a no brainer (no pun intended) for me and i ordered it immediately. Today i got it and i must say i was in shock. Not because of the sheer horror the head was bringing up in me but because it looked like an ultra cheap fake copy of the head that is printed on the cardboard box (not to mention the promotional pictures of it). This is by far the biggest case of \\"mcdonalds effect\\" i saw in the last couple of years!!!

I can't stand zombie movies at all and the only reason I tuned into this show is that is was being filmed near my hometown.

I had almost given up hope for the show until I saw episode 12 which def sent everything in a much needed new direction. The writing also kind of bothers me. You start to dislike some of the characters and find them annoying. Rick the lead character also kind of gets on my nerves that he always trys to save everyone. I also kind of wanted to see Hershel go down with his farm like a captain goes with his ship, but rick had to ruin it... The show also keeps around way too many unnecessary characters that should have been killed off much earlier in the show. It felt like season 2 was on a tighter budget and they had to keep all the action for the final episodes. But the show is still pretty good and I couldn't stop watching. I'm waiting for the season finale. 4/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"so happy","review":"i am so glad this was on amazon and i didnt have to wait till it came out on dvd i did watch them all on their air date except the one where sophia goes missing so i was a little pissed but thanks to amazon i can watch them again and again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth It!","review":"This show really understands suspense and strong story arc.

If you like a good scare, give it a try. I liked the first season better though. The first season you would have an episode where some thing would happen, then move on to the next episode. There where still a few cliff hangers and questions. But in the second season, they seem to be dragging it along, with a few things sprinkled in to try to keep interest. But I am still left wondering, what happened to Daryls brother Merle? What ever happened to Morgan and his son? My favorite characters are Rick, Daryl, and Glen. They are awesome! A show that you can really relate to and feel like you know the characters.

Yes this season had it's slow points, but i never for 1 second lost interest. It's twice as long as season one, so of course the action will be drawn out. Either way, this finale was EPIC!!

The first three-quarters of this episode was as exciting as watching ditchdiggers work. Literally. The characters are still endlessly pontificating their roles and society's new woes.

This subtitled film opens with a somewhat conventional and interesting storyline of a wayward truck driver, but ultimately gives way to lot of shifting scenes where shifty characters predominate.Nonethelessss, one is given a great visual window into the unforgiving wintry tundra and the feral, primitive villagers living in an authoritarian but nonethess lawlass state. This film is obviously not for the faint hearted given recurrent themes of brutality, thievery, cruelty and misanththopy. I should add that it was difficult to keep track of the comings and goings of this rather large cast which otherwise did dispaly exceptional acting skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love foreign films but not this one","review":"I watch at least one foreign film a week and like movies from all over the world. This one, however, was just strange. It was just too difficult to follow. Not only were parts of the movie almost impossible to see because the screen was so dark (and I watched it on a big flat screen HD TV), but characters just kept popping up out of no where and I couldn't tell what happened to the original main character who got lost in the woods in the beginning.I gave it two stars instead of one because some of the dialogue is very funny in a dry humor way and some of the scenes surprise you with an unexpected (though usually deadly) twist. But two stars is all I can give - this movie just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a mystery...","review":"why this book has almost five stars!

There are six characters who have been friends since childhood, slowly one by one they are being killed- but who could it be. No one is safe, and who will be next? Keep guessing. There are a bunch of twists throughout the book, which keeps your attention. You won't be disappointed when the killer is revealed. A must Read!!! Don't miss!! Its so cheap used and s&h is only 3.49. Never read a carlene thompson book. This was my very first one and I still love it. I now own her entire collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Missed Being Great","review":"This book engaged the reader from the first page. It was interesting and suspenseful, however it lacked continuity and its characters were somewhat nonsensical. The main character, Laurel, is presented as the typical heroine, sensible, cautious and level-headed. Her impulsive decision at the very end of the book, therefore, is completely out of character, and one gets the impression the author just wanted to wrap up loose ends by creating a convenient ending. The killer, once revealed, is a stereotypical sociopath, and the killer's reasons for murdering \\"The Six of Hearts\\" are cliche and silly. Although it seemed Thompson was deliberately obscure at times, the book was enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"in the event of my death","review":"I didn't like it.

Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I would definately read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you guessing","review":"Like all of Carlene Thompson's books, \\"In the event of my death\\" features a suberb plot and deep, complex characters.

Her carefully planned out plot twists and turns guarantee you a scary ride and a shocking ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot recommend this book","review":"I purchased this book after reading the other reviews, and was extremely disappointed.

The original has an 80s new wave guitar ballad feel (reminds me of Fiction Factory's \\"Feels Like Heaven\\" or \\"Heaven\\" by the Psychedelic Furs). The Cicada remix is 7 minutes of electro synth flourishes and beats that, while not a major dance track, will definitely have your body swaying. As brilliant as the mix Cicada did on Thirteen Senses' \\"Into the Fire.\\" The b-side, \\"Italian Girlfriend\\" although not featuring a remix, is another light synth guitar track, but not as catchy as the lead track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neo-noir Jazz","review":"Subterranean Jazz's second album (following their brilliant eponymous debut in 1999) shows the band expanding their melodic grooves to include a panache of latin rhythms, complex harmonic structures, and creative songcraft. The elements of the group --guitar, stand-up bass, drums, and saxophone -- blend beautifully with each other to create a cohesive, smooth machine. Each musician gets many opportunities to shine both musically and compositionally on this record, most notably saxophonist Tom Clohessy, whose mellifluous playing on such standouts as the Indian-flavored \\"Azahar\\" and \\"Santa Cruz Postcard\\" exhibits a clear understanding of the kind of noir-jazz that brings to mind the era of 1950s.

Others, it might be wasted on."},{"rating":"1","title":"a short shelf life","review":"Ultravox is like that container of cottage cheese on the dairy shelf at your favorite supermarket. It tastes great for a time until it reaches the expiration date and then you just have to throw it out. I enjoyed this and many other recordings of the Midge Ure-era when they were new and fresh, but listening to them now makes me wonder if they sounded dated and hopelessly out of place even before the decade of the 80's came to its final conclusion. This music came out at a time of great excess and a live for the moment attitude. Few bands in my mind have been able to trancend this highly disposable era and unfortunately, Ultravox is not one of them.

I bought this book and was thoroughly disappointed--I actually gave it away. Lant seems to like hearing himself talk because this book, like his others, are the result of taking a handful of information and spreading it very thinly thoroughout 300+ pages. Lant seems to equate a high page count with quality. The info in this book is so behind the times... he apparently never took the effort to update it. Save your $$ as all of the info in this tome is available for free--and more interestingly written without the pomposity he's so well known for--on the web. If you must, get it second hand. You'll find plenty of copies in used book stores. Hmmm... I wonder why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Thankfully, I checked this book out from the library.

If so, Jeffrey Lant's books will not be of much help...Clever (long) titles, but don't be fooled!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted this review to be better","review":"I read Money Making Marketing and loved it. For the most part I have found Lant to be very good at getting his point across and providing good information you can use. Unfortunately, with \\"How to Make a Whole Lot More than 1,000,000 (& etc)\\" he talks down to the reader incessantly and he offers very little in the way of substance. I cannot tell you how many times I have tried to wade through this book and found that I just can't. I wanted to like this book, the subject matter is near and dear to my heart. However, Lant needs to focus on the subject hand, follow his own advice and give the customer what they want. People buy this book because they want clear, step-by-step advice on how to produce a product that they can sell. I am no different than anyone else in that I want that real how-to advice. Lant completely fails to provide at all tangible in that area. Save your money and bypass this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have a better marketing strategy","review":"I suppose you could find some useful information in this book if you have the time and the patience to sift through the nauseating verbosity the author is so good at.

Whoever scanned it from the original book did not have the equipment set correctly and apparently did not check on what was being reproduced.

Though it was less than $30, it looked great on my wrist and fit perfectly. The Indiglo feature worked very well.The problem: After 1 month, the battery died. When I tried to fix it, the back of the watch wouldn't come off without bending the metal, and putting it back was impossible. Frankly, if $30 buys me one month of watch use, it's simply not worth the trouble - a Rolex (despite its ridiculous cost) will cost less per operational day!The bottom line: Don't buy this watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex Watch w/ day of week","review":"I ordered this watch because I wanted a watch that showed the day of the week on it's face.

In truth it should be billed as the Christmas forgettable series. This is one of those humdrum, mundage animated Christmas specials that fail to capture even a tiny bit of the magic of some of the true classics like Rudolph or Frosty. Voices are provided by Travis Tritt, Nell Carter, and John Forsythe. It's a sappy story about how three orphans in the town Harmony look to give the the people of the town a gift and basically come up with Christmas Carols. It's a pretty weak premise to begin with and when you couple it with weak animation, and an annoying theme songs that plays over and over, this one adds up to a very forgettable holiday chunk of coal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect much.

Next is cleaning the gun, but it only covers basic field cleaning. Next he pitches his own cleaners oils and lubes. That's right I paid a lot for things that either come with the owners manual of the gun, by watching people shoot at the range, or watching late night infomercials.

But you also can see the faces and hear the timbre of the voices -- you decide who was evasive, who avoided giving verifiable facts, who refused to answer questions, who was grandstanding.The film does not give us a balanced picture of the two sides. But that is because the sides weren't balanced. McCarthy had finally met his match -- people who were tired of his tactics and refused to be bullied any longer.

I even gave this machine an easy test run, bread. The blades wobbled, the sound resembled that of a lawn mower and I used two hands to hold it because the base is so large and awkward.

Like Mr. Rich I found comfort in the wonderful world of cast albums, dreaming of seeing a Broadway show,keeping a vast collection of programs, etc. Mr. Rich proved to me that there were other kids like me and he had the guts to write about it.

The problem lies in the story... While the idea was cute and perfect for a family film, it was just too pathetic for anyone, including kids, to relate to. Even if a kid was to take over the world, grown adults wouldn't think of serving his every whim. This movie should definatly be seen once by every family with young kids, but once is enough, trust me... Parts are very funny, and others very touching but the story is the scum of movie making."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"North\\" is a miss","review":"This is by far the worst of Rob Reiner's films. The actor playing the main character never connects with the audience for even a moment, and the entire film depends on that sympathetic connection.

I give this film a 0 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"The legacy of North","review":"Well I'm assuming you already know the legacy of the movie North as one of the most hated films of all time. Ill-concieved, unpleasant, contrived, artificial, cloying, and uninspired. Many have attempted to figure out why Rob Reiner wanted to make this story into a movie (I know Roger Ebert did, it's one of his rare \\"zero star reviews\\"). This movie is almost unwatchable and even worse, kids have seen it, and during its entire running length, the movie does everything it can to deaden their imaginations and manipulate them (although the film is so pathetic it even fails at manipulation). The movie is so bad in so many different ways that it has reached a kind of grandeur as one of the worst films ever made. If you've never had to sit throw this piece of garbage, consider you're one of the lucky ones (and if you don't believe me, just ask Roger Ebert)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give a negative score... PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!","review":"You know, people talk about bad movies. When seeing Bruce Willis as The Easter Bunny is the highlight of a movie...P>To say this movie is the worst I ever saw doesn't do it justice. I would be tempted to watch Mondo Trasho, a movie which caused me to need therapy, before I would watch this again (ok, that's an exaggeration... I didn;t need therapy, but I felt soiled after watching it).Take a talented director, and tell him to remove all semblance of a real plot, good dialog, and good acting, and North would get an A+++++.... This has to be used as a movie to teach others how not to make a movie.To this day, I can't take Elijah Wood seriously as an actor. It was only after I made that connection that I started to enjoy \\"Lord of the Rings\\".On second thought, burn every copy of this film and remove it from human memory. This would be the kindest act that could be blessed upon humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"would have been nice","review":"I purchased these twice from 2 different vendors through amazon , twice the the order was canceled and I then found out that amazon holds orders for up to 90 minutes before submitting them to the seller .

The worst part the dvd starts right off five minutes into the movie, no movie title or credits or start of the movie.

A refreshing story where the main characters are actually really bad, with no apparent conscience or ethical problems with any kind of wrongdoing. At one point, Ellen even says, \\"Stealing is WRONG, IMMORAL, only WE should get away with it.\\"Parents worried about children emulating the nefarious capers of this dynamic duo would do well to give children the benefit of the doubt and realize that unless there are other serious problems in the child's life, they are not going to emulate games like \\"Does Pet Bounce?\\"All in all an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This book is a godsend.

Now when I go to the doctor, I'll be aware of the tests that should be ordered, how to understand their results, and what alternatives I have for treatment.I love the fact that the book doesn't have to be read cover-to-cover. I can turn to the chapter about whatever concerns me most about my health.

While it dried the lettuce, it was awkward and difficult to handle. There is no handle to hold onto, so it is difficult to spin without sending it flying across the room.

The sound quality so low and one can barely tell what Darth Vader is saying. The oversized Vader head at the end of the pen (which makes it almost unusable as a pen to write with) maybe the best part of the whole toy: it makes a good Vader character on-the-go for with the little bonus sound FX.It's really a useless as a pen, but makes a fun toy for a young Star Wars fan...the fun factor fades quickly and don't expect this one to last very long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ATV and Snowmobile rider","review":"This Garmin mount works great on the handlebars of both my ATV and Snowmobiles.

However, knowing the great work of Susan Sánchez-Casal, I did not hesitate to purchase this literary treasure. I felt really involved in each story; the characters, their relationships with loved ones, and their emotional, spiritual and intellectual journeys. A few of my favorites were: \\"Things I Learned from my Mother,\\" by Sylvia Rosa-Casanova, \\"Every First Friday,\\" by Alejandro Díaz, and \\"Lavender Roses,\\" by Caroline C. Sánchez. I also really enjoyed \\"Child of The Americas,\\" by Aurora Levins Morales; she does a great job of deconstructing her identity as a Latina. This book is a treasure on my bookshelf, and I find myself going back to re-read certain stories, as their lessons prove to be invaluable in my own life's journey. I give many thanks to the contributing authors for sharing their experiences in such a powerful and moving way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I love all the stories and the different themes and perspectives. There's something for everybody. I like the way that there's Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican and Dominican authors, and even a few who don't seem to be Latino. In my family we are all reading it, and everyone has a different favorite, everybody has something they identify with or something that makes them laugh or cry. For me I love the book because it's the first time I read something that shows how Latino people deal with everyday life, and how we get through things by using humor and faith and a positive perspective. I've never read anything like this before, and I'm glad that my children have the chance to read about people like their family. Every story is wonderful. Thank you for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and Spicy Soul","review":"_Chicken Soup for the Latino Soul_ opened my eyes, ears, heart, mind and taste-buds to the rich beauty of many Latino families and their cultures. I also discovered that I may have a Latina soul! Although Swedish by genetics, _Chicken Soup for the Latino Soul_ embraces me and each reader as a confidante. Susan Sanchez-Casal has compiled stirring and hopeful tales of deepest family treasures. These are human stories, anecdotes that reach across boundaries and illuminate our shared and unique experiences. A book of pride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful addition for a multi-cultural curriculum!","review":"As a contributing author to this book and former school teacher, I just realized how invaluable this little book of stories is to the future of our Latino children. This great book should be used by any educator wishing to connect with high school level students who will find relevance in the subject matter they are reading. Not only is it enriched with the history of our people and the story of their struggle, but you will also read modern-day social commentary from a Latino's perspective and discover how we contribute to the wonderful tapestry of this mult-culturally rich country. I would recommend this book for all educators seeking to add a book to their multi-cultural curriculum.JAX, author ofHeart of The Jaguarand contributing author to \\"Grandma's Recipe\\" and a \\"Bridge to Freedom\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCKO STINKO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I think that I have purchased and loved every single Chicken Soup for the Soul book.

That's all well and good but I bought a book on SQL Server 2000 and in 2000, they are there and I've been using them.

Almost 2 years later I started swimming and used it again to minimize the effects of the chlorine...and my skin started tearing again. I haven't had the problem since I quit using the lotion.

Not balanced at all, just the usual leftest media slant on history. Certainly some is valid, but there was no counterpoint offered.

Besides being an obviously low budget dvd she has no good information and uses extrememely innappropriate and unintelligent word choices. She has no idea what she is talking about. Also the fact that she also said, \\"when the doctor tells you to push\\". A doctor should not tell you to push a woman will know when it is time. Besides I assume that the women using this plans to have a natural unmedicated birth and possibly even one at home.

And I love that these have plain simple ingredients, Coconut, Brown Sugar Syrup, and real Strawberry. No chemicals here.I e-mailed Oskri because there seemed to be a discrepency on their nutritional info on different sites. So if you were confused too, here's the deal. They recently switched to using real fruit like strawberry, mango, etc in their flavored bars. They said this does, however, add to the total amount of sugar in the bar. So unfortunately there is more sugar in the flavored bars, but the trade off is you are getting real fruit and it tastes better, and the plain bars still have lower sugar content if you are concerned with that. The strawberry flavoring is worth the extra sugar for me, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coconut craving curber","review":"I reciently purchased this product because I was wanting something to curb my coconut cravings.

I, however, did enjoy them as they have a very light flavor (mostly coconut, I couldn't taste much of the strawberry) and are not very sugary at all. Perhaps this is why I liked them but the children did not.

Think \\"Little House on the Prarie\\" meets Australia with some \\"Little Women\\" thrown in. This is a well written piece with some surprises, twists and an interesting non-beautiful main character. Its actually a great story that doesn't need to be any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved until I read \\"The Blue Castle\\"","review":"I loved this book when I first read it. I found it funny and refreshing. In fact, I replaced my paperback copy with a hardcover copy. Then I read \\"The Blue Castle\\" by L.M. Montgomery, the auther of \\"Anne of Green Gables\\". That's when I discovered that \\"The Ladies of Missalonghi\\" is nothing but a rewrite of another book! It is more than just similar plotlines which often occurs in the Romance genre. It really is a knock-off of Montgomery's book which was first copyrighted in 1926. I was so disappointed that I now rate this book a 1 (the worst)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A flagrant example of plagiarism","review":"I read this years ago and could not believe how the author dared to steal the plot from LM Montgomery's The Blue Castle. Ripoff!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A slight, delicious romp in the Blue Mountains","review":"Colleen McCullough is known for long and winding novels like \\"The Thorn Birds,\\" so I was surprised at the light touch in this story. It reminds me a bit of \\"Persuasion,\\" by Jane Austen, but with an inimitable stamp of Australian life. McCullough really makes the charm and deceptive quiet of the Blue Mountains region - still beautiful and aloof from nearby Sydney today - come to life, and her plucky heroine is easy to like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete plagiarism","review":"I read this book when I was about 18 and enjoyed it.Then I read the Blue Castle, recognized instantly that this was patent plagiarism, and have since written McCullough off as a hack.What kind of an author lifts a plot--not just the rough idea, but the complete, whole plot right down to the characterization? The heroines of both books even detest oatmeal, but are forced to eat it! Nearly every detail of the Ladies mirrors the story in Blue Castle. The Blue Castle is much better, and L.M. Montgomery deserves all the credit for the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I read this book after reading the Thorn Birds, hoping that another book by the same author would be as enjoyable. I was thoroughly disappointed though. It had none of the magic that the Thorn Birds had, it was just another romantic story with a sappy happy ending. It wasn't even extremely enjoyable, it didn't grab you or fascinate you or pull you along with it. I couldn't believe the author of such a great book as The Thorn Birds could write such an uninteresting story. I only kept reading it because I hoped it would get better. It didn't. To make matters worse, it wasn't even realistic. It included a \\"ghost\\", which is an easy way to avoid reality and patch things up perfectly in a book. I would not recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed The Thorn Birds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exact replacement","review":"Installed today and this is exactly like the original I pulled out, only new.

Before I watched this film, I thought it will be full of fashion stuff. Things like shoes, bags, dresses, you name it! However I was surprised it didn't have this much fashion in it whereas it focused so much on Chanel's dramatic love life and the tough challenges she faced on her way to becoming so successful and famous later in her life. Her life was indeed a difficult and complicated one, which shows that the road to success is never an easy one!The movie is well produced and directed. The casting and the dialogue is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"As a fashion history buff, this movie dissapoints. It wallows too much in the love story between Coco and Etienne, then the years 1912-1914 when Coco made hats. Her real breakthrough was in the WW1 years, but the movie almost skips this period altogether. The acting is mostly bad... with the (french) voices sounding stiff and funny.Also, the older Coco\`s (Shirley Maclaine) comment that \\"I have no one to thank but myself for my success\\" is uncredible when the movie quite clearly shows her accepting a lot of grants from her lover Boy to finance her early career.\\"Chanel solitaire\\" from 1981 still stands as the major movie about Coco Chanel.

Well, these boots sadly are not in that category. The pleather started cracking after I wore the boots x3; the lining was poorly cut to begin with and started unraveling.

I tried several songs and all did this. I suppose it could be the phone, but some web research suggests this is a common problem when using wireless bluetooth headsets. It may be a bandwidth issue with Bluetooth v1.2.With my IBM X40, using the included USB audio gateway: many fewer dropouts, but still some--even though I was sitting at the computer.Bottom line: probably not ready for prime time.

Eur.","review":"Kundera's work \\"The Joke\\" is an intricate metaphor which describes the impact of the communist system in east central Europe. Kundera describes how communism actually robs E. Europe of its culture by imposing a rigid uniformity which is actually intended to eliminate culture and nationalism in these satellites. By eliminating culture the Soviet Union will not have to contend with dissent. Ultimately, the Czechs and other eastern Europeans will see the communist system for what it is - oppressive- and will rebel.

Kundera has more respect for his characters than any American novelist I have ever read. Rather than creating characters to tell the world about himself, I felt that Kundera revealed these characters' lives to tell us all something about the world. The best book I read in 1996 due to its complexity of story yet ease of reading, its engaging characters, and its honest depiction of people who learn to live thier lives despite the expectations of their society.

As an editorial review pointed out, we're not translating the Dead Sea Scrolls here. It's just one Indo-European language into another, and a fairly close one at that. *Five* different translations?

The performers play the music like it was written for them. The music comes out naturally with great flow and lots of passion. The Mozart 9th Piano Concerto was his first true masterpiece in the genre. Each movement is just about 10 minutes long giving the work great balance.

Power in the Darkness, the other big singelhit is also included. Sweet Black Angel, my fauvorite rocker from TRB 2, the hit that should have been, is not here, but you get All right All night from the same album.
