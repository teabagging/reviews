And old Adolph himself must have been vertiably pulsing with positive energy? Cancer victims and AIDS patients bring on their own diseases due to their thoughts? And Donald Trump is filthy rich because he wished, very effectively, he was? No, although it might be comforting to think that all you have to do is wish for something and it will come true, Peter Pan is a fairy tale.

It suggests that if you concentrate real hard on the Hope Diamond and really believe you can have it that it will appear in your living room!!! This is one of the stupidest cheap claims out there. John Edwards, Miss Cleo, and the makers of The Secret are only out there to take advantage of your beautiful willingness to believe and steal your money.

In some ways, this is an incredibly cynical philosophy which essentially blames the individual for not \\"manifesting\\" hard enough if they suddenly find their wildest dreams aren't coming true. And what about individuals born into difficult circumstances rather than a life of privilege? This \\"philosophy\\" assumes we all start from a common footing, which is just NOT the case.

Sometimes people get lucky, others never do. A positive attitude *can* help keep things in perspective for us, but the claim of this film that your attitude interacts with the universe to influence the outcome is silly.More than silly, it becomes dangerous when we consider that this movie's premise basically says if someone experience something bad, it's their own fault.

They show a boy really wanting and dreaming about a bike and then finally getting it as a gift just because he thought about it so much. They didn't show the boy thinking AND working to get it. Just thinking about it and looking at a picture of it. As though your mind has the power to make things come to you without you having to do anything. It was very odd. They didn't even go into depth.

They insist there are no evil people only evil acts - although they don't really believe in evil, from what I gather. So Hitler was not really evil; he was just a manifestation of what our collective mind was conjuring up, and he \\"probably was not all bad.\\" (Wow.) There is negative energy and positive energy, but just Who decides what is negative and positive and why there's a difference (since there's no evil) is not really explained.It must be remembered that its adherents are not dumb; many are well-educated.

I must have gotten my wires crossed, because I thought the 'Secret' movie was a... MOVIE. Not so. It's just the book recorded; plus, I had to be navigating between chapters.

I especially liked the attention paid to teaching the audience how to step from wherever they are to wherever they want to be.Having said that, I will also say it raises many questions and is definitely controversial.

The content is very similar to original \\"universe\\" thinkers such as Napoleon Hill's \\"Think and Grow Rich\\".If you've never explored self improvement products maybe this could help, if you can sit through it. This is not worth the $29 in my opinion. Get it used at a discount if you really want to see it.

You could even afford the postage. Just give them away for the good of all mankind. But above all, do anything EXCEPT prey on people's need for hope.

It is very poorly put together.I fell asleep during the first watching, then made myself watch it a second time just to make sure I hadn't missed something that would change my life. Nope - 'fraid not.I leafed through the book version in a store recently and saw it contained some good quotes. If you have to purchase a version, I would take the book over the DVD.

Perhaps this is an astonishing idea, but it is a pretty basic psychology concept. This isn't to say that the idea doesn't have merit, because attempting to filter your thoughts - be optimistic - will affect your behavior and experiences, but the film was just too hokey and ridiculous. Everyone referred to this concept as \\"The Secret\\" and made it seem like the best thing ever.

What about the kids who are victims of sexual predators? Jessica Lunsford, Samantha Runnion, Polly Klass, etc. Did they bring that on themselves? It would be nice to think that we control our destinies, and to a certain extent we do.

They use common, positive knowledge, to get people to start nodding their heads, and when the watcher (or reader) goes on, lots of plain lies start getting thrown in there - in a very deceptive manner and sandwiched between real common knowledge.Stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secret DVD","review":"Everyone should read this book or see the video---!!

The Secret reminds me of those forwarded e-mails that state, \\"Forward this e-mail to 10 friends in 10 minutes...\\"I found that The Secret conflicts with my religious beliefs... that you don't get what you want, but what you need... from God.However, as you read other reviews you'll find many people loved it and believe in it.

After about 10 minutes into it my amusement went to annoyance as the whole premise is insane.Some notes on what I did watch:-just because you try to cram as much Phds, MDs, Revs, analysts, and other doctors into your commentary does not make any it more believable. Gullibility to the max!I feel duped after watching this, like watching a fake infomercial or Shamwow program.-if I understand correctly, if one creates one's universe then there would be major conflicts in interest and therefore no possibility. Its like both sides of a baseball game praying to God that they win--there will always be winners and losers, not everyone can win all the time in all they do just because they \\"put their mind to it.\\"So in conclusion, I recommend reading a book or taking a walk over wasting your time in voodoo.

It's the single most important thing I've ever learned. I'm so grateful to those who are spreading the word and grateful for all the wonderful changes in my life. I owe it all to knowing The Secret.

If you 'get it' and incorporate it into your life, it will change your life for the better. If you don't 'get it' the first time, try looking at it again with an open mind.The best evidence for the validity of The Secret is to compare your ordinary thoughts to the kind of thoughts you have towards a BURNING DESIRE.

For in the original, Esther Hicks, speaking for Abraham, shows us the principles behind Law of Attraction. The producers of this film decided that the general public weren't ready to hear this message, so they deleted Esther out of the film, and re-made it, with a watered down version. The problem is, without an understanding of how this powerful law works, it leaves the viewer thinking that \\"taking action\\" is the way to go...where Abraham has stated clearly, \\"All the action in the world won't amount to anything, if you haven't lined up your energy. I reccomend the book: Ask and it is Given and or attending any of the Abraham seminars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good information but a bit hoaky","review":"This DVD is entertaining but a bit too hoaky, almost informercial like.

Ok, how about know what you want, positive imagery helps, and work very hard to get the things that you want.

Positive thinking and gratitude are good and healthful practices, but the so-called secret encourages readers/viewers to identify with consumerism and overindulgence as if that is the focal point of life to which we should all aspire when such practice, in reality, can only lead to further disatisfaction when more is not enough- and, truth be told, it never is. For a practice with lasting rewards, read \\"God Without Religion\\", which offers techniques for freedom from dependance on false securities along with a philosphy of self that is inclusive of all humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"You shouldn't pay for false hope.","review":"This video overlooks the GLARING fact that it takes work and personal effort to be successful. You cannot get what you want by simply visualizing it. \\"Keep your eyes on the prize,\\" sure.. keep your initial motivations in mind, keep your brain focused on what you want and use that to FUEL YOUR TASKS on executing your goal. This video doesn't belong at the top of anyone's list, in anyone's personal collection, and especially doesn't belong in schools. All of the so-called philosophers in this video (apparently they weren't making money doing anything else at the time) seem to have never studied what self-actualization is... that's pretty uncommon in the professional field, and they don't deserve any credit for their words. The video clips are ridiculous, exaggerated, and it feels like a complete waste of time. Luckily, I didn't have to pay to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely powerful!","review":"I was totally blown away when I watched this DVD.

Closed minds learn nothing. See The Secret and make your own evaluation based on content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your money","review":"I have long implemented the concept of the law of attraction in my life and understand well that \\"thoughts are things.\\" But this DVD is an insult. The content is poor and the message is spiritually degrading. It seems to me that it is designed to appeal to our lowest nature -- greed, consumerism, quick fixes -- while brilliantly packaged to appear as a highly spiritual revelation. If you are interested in this subject matter, read Napolean Hill, Emmet Fox, Norman Vincent Peale. All do a supreme job of writing about this powerful concept while maintaining integrity and honesty. None of them falsey claim that they discovered an ancient secret that's been kept from the masses by a plot that is undefined and unexplained. \\"The Secret\\" is no secret.

And if you meet someone who doesn't believe and refuses to believe, well it's their loss.This is one of the most disgusting, pseudo-scientific, psedo-psychological programs/lifestyles currently doing the rounds.The implication that anyone who is struggling is responsible for their situation is reprehensible and shows like Oprah and Larry King are just showing where their so called journalist credentials lie ($$$$$) by even having it on their shows.It is propaganda for the vulnerable and gullible.Instead of encouraging an original idea or even real action, this absurd and well marketed doctrine is little less than a money spinner, collecting cash from those that can least afford it whilst the creators and promoters fill their pockets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disk Was in 2 Pieces","review":"Disk was completely snaooed in 2...

There is no \\"law of attraction\\" as this moronic Australian woman would have you believe. In fact, I would go so far as to call this particular philosophy morally shameful. To actually think that hundreds of millions of people live in life-threatening poverty simply because they lack \\"happy thoughts\\" is a disgusting explanation for the problem of evil. Even if you can watch this for free (as I just did), don't. It would be an incredible exercise in wasted time.

Look for good things and you will find them. This is a great message -- but a secret?? No. This information has been around for many, many years.Here's the rub -- wishing for material objects? Too greedy, too selfish.The DVD shows people thinking positively about money and things and getting them -realistic, I think not. Where is the work that you need to do to get these things besides just thinking about them. What about learning from the past so you do not make the same mistakes again.Another issue - Positive thinking to be cancer free? This is frightening. The woman was saying how she did not have any chemo but had positive thoughts about being healthy. Positive thoughts are very helpful but I would not want anyone who has cancer to forgo traditional treatments. Positive thinking and alternative methods can help but please have what the doctors prescribe."},{"rating":"1","title":"losers apply here!","review":"this has to be the ultimate in new age garbage.

They have been teaching this since the 80's and I have found their work to be life changing. Happy creating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LIfe changing information","review":"The message in The Secret is so well-delivered and inspiring that if you let it sink in, it can change your life dramatically. A great value because you wind up watching it more than once and also loaning it out to friends & family. If you find yourself wanting to seek more information on the subject of Law of Attraction, I would recommend the book and/or website \\"Wealth Beyond Reason\\" by Bob Doyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT SPEND $30 ON AN INFOMERCIAL!!!!!!!","review":"Total waste of time!

Positive thinking is good, but to claim that through Quantum Physics, man has the power (enery) to affect the world (energy) around him/her is proposterus. It is also incredible that they use Jack Canfield (played by an actor, check the credits) in front of a chicken soup for the soul poster. They never say that this is the author of the Soup series, but the trick is not lost on the observer. Be very careful with these liars. Think positive, but don't give your money to scoundrels."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a seeker born every minute...","review":"Oh, the injustice of having to give even one star in this review...\\"Thoughts become things\\" and the \\"power of positive thinking\\" never fails to sell -- or stand up to critical thought or evaluation. That such a flashy, glib, and facile sham could become a best seller shouldn't be a surprise, but it is a disappointment.Of course, if you get a bunch of self-satified people together, they will tell you their dreams became reality.

For those of you who understand what it means to be \\"aware\\", this will be highly disappointing. It will be quickly obvious that the producers are not that enlightened. It reminded me of the late night info-mercials where some salesperson is repeating a magic formula for having what ever material thing you want just by closing your eyes and thinking real hard.

Dangerous for the weak of mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerful in concept, Pathetic in delivery","review":"I feel that the Secret brings up some ideas about reality and personality that are beginning to finally be looked at. It raises several topics that need addressing as well.My problem with this film is that it is amateurish and, from a film theory standpoint, sends very negative messages. The delivery is materialistic, base, and basically concludes that one can be happy forever, and forget all of life's problems by using the law of attraction.I feel that it misuses and misguides viewers about the law of attraction and it's complex involvement in our perception of reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but mostly a marketing ploy","review":"The Secret contains some interesting and compelling ideas about the power of positive thinking, but I think overall it's an amazing marketing ploy that's making the producers a LOT of money. Which is brilliant! But since I purchased it and watched it, I sort of forgot about it. I'm generally an optimistic person anyway, so it wasn't an \\"a ha\\" moment to see them talking about how putting vibes out into the universe makes it come back to you on some level. However, the way they indicate that wishing for something as specific as a bicycle will make it appear in your life is sort of ridiculous. If that were the case, every kid in America would have a pony. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"the secret is so damn old","review":"I bought it and I am never sorry for the things I buy.

I worked at a store where this CD played a couple times a day. I never thought I'd say this but, I miss hearing the songs. The tunes are catchy, make you happy, and seem to stick in your head all day. Great mood music for a party."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book","review":"This is a good book for learning about all the things that could go wrong. Although the author tries to be balanced, I was left wondering how we could do anything without violating some safety concern. I would recommend it for the awareness it will raise in you concerning some avoidable mistakes. Also, there are some good sample forms in the back. However, parents are not necessarily going to sign their names to the provisions given in the forms, such as that they will not hold youth group leaders liable for any injury or death. I'm not sure what to do when people won't sign the forms. We let the kid come anyway. Overall, an informative book which all youth group leaders should read at least once but not take so seriously that it wrecks their ministry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"The packaged arrived on time and was in decent shape.. The only thing was that in the packaging, the inside on the package was sticky and ended up on the book. Overall, very pleased.

I was pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While this rifle looks really authentic...it was totally disappointing.

It's not a bad movie, but it won't really cause Reeves fans much excitement. For completeists only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transylvania - today 1966","review":"Real name of the film \\"La sorella di Satana\\" and Sorella is played by Joe 'Flash' Riley. That is why we watch the film. Oh yes there are other actors as Barbara Steele; however no one would buy a movie because of that.My star rating is a two. However there is no telling for taste. If you like witchy women with bad completions this can be a good addition to your film library.Innocent newlywed Veronica (Barbara Steele) meets Count von Helsing (John Karlsen). Due to a little mishap her VW goes into the lake and she is displaced by the Witch of the Lake.What should have been a straight forward bad witch movie turns into a slapstick auto chase with such lake-luster dialog as \\"is he able to talk\\", \\"No he is dead\\", \\"then he is obstructing justice.\\"If you like the original Keystone Cops you can appreciate this film.They are only missing a good title song like \\"Get me to the lake on time.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid transfer!","review":"To this date April 23rd, 2008 my great wish is still that one day someone will release She Beast, The Ghost, Castle of the Living Dead AKA Crypt of Terror, The Sorcerers and The Long Hair of Death in their correct aspect ratios and with a decent crisp transfer with audible sound. This is in reference to the Alpha DVD release. The Movie gets 3 to 4 stars from me personally."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"Love Barbara Steele, hated this movie.

Also want to see him go on tour again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great - more of the same","review":"I'm disappointed with this CD. It's more of the same from Yanni. He's doctored up his old songs and is re-selling them, again. There are a couple of nice tracks. The remake of Vivaldi's 4 Seasons in \\"Storm\\" is interesting. Overall, I would not recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yanni Live Again!","review":"It seems so long ago that I listened to and watched Yanni's Acropolis and Tribute albums that I was beginning to wonder if he'll ever come out with a new live album. This is it! This is the disc I've been waiting for. The sound quality is excellent, and mind you, I'm an audiophile freak. It says it was captured on 125 channels of digital audio and I'm not surprised at all. I hear it as though I was center stage at the Mandalay Bay in Vegas where this concert was recorded. The intensity of the music and the great melodies of the old and new tunes can be heard very vividly and I must say, all the musicians on the record are quite simply some of the best in their respective fields.I'd highly recommend this disc to all Yanni or non Yanni fans and I can't wait for the DVD version to be released which will showcase probably the best concert event release of 2006.p.s. hopefully this disc gets released on SACD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Skims through the topics, very vague!

Recommended to anyone who enjoys history and/or archaeology; not for those who own power crystals and regularly commune with Atlantean spirits. Excellent work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly good","review":"All in all, an entertaining read. They do spend a lot of time debunking Hancock, but since he is at the forefront of the Antlantis/aliens line of thinking, I found this aspect of the book to be satisfying and entertaining. My one caveat is that in the \\"Star of Bethlehem\\" section, they quickly dismiss the possibility that Mathew could have simply invented the story on the basis of the fact that many people who may have known Jesus would still be alive. Really?! How many of these people witnessed his birth? Isn't it the most logical possibility considering that it's the only gospel that tells this story and that it plagiarizes several other myths? I think the authors are simply being kind to the religious minded readers with this weak argument. But I suppose that's to be expected. And the rest of the book makes up for it.If you enjoy this topic, Jared Diamond discusses Easter Island and the Mayan collapse quite well inCollapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Duncraft triple-tube bird feeder","review":"Good design for letting the smaller birds eat without interference from larger ones or squirrels.

BE careful if you order, it is very misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate for 9 year-old","review":"This book was purchased to start a discussion with my 9 year-old daughter about her body. I was shocked that this book was titled as a \\"Book for younger girls\\". The images and illustrations in this book are very unnecesary; girls sitting on the floor looking at their parts with a mirror, and bare chested girls talking about their periods!!! It had too much information on tampons and sex and I did not find it helpful at all. I'm still looking for a simple book to introduce my daughter to puberty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Embarrassing, but a great tool.","review":"When I first got this for my daughter, we talked about a few things. Then I left her to the rest of the book for herself. We're pretty open, but she's only 9 and I didn't think she was quite ready to talk about [...]. But she might read about it and be \\"in the know\\"However, we recently had an incident that made me feel this was a good purchase. My daughter went running downstairs screaming she needed her book. She found it and furiously was looking in it for something. I asked her later that evening if she found her answer. And she said she did - and we talked about it. So at least she's using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I am disappointed in the talk of inappropriate topics in the book\\"","review":"I bought the book because it was highly recommended by Amazon customers. Well, little did I know that there is talk of masturbation! Yes, it is 'normal' and yes I will discuss this when the time comes. But an 8 year old does NOT need this information right now. In my opinion, this book should be for older children who have had the sex talk NOT 8 year olds!!!!! Also, the book talks about how the vagina responds to \\"sexy feelings\\" and produces lubricant. Way TMI for this age!!!!!!!!!!!!!Buyers, be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"ready set throw this book away","review":"too descriptive. uncomfortable. unhelpful. awful. will not read it. i found ratings from a colleger. it says on the cover for young girls. not at all happy and will NEVER buy a book by lynda madaras again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little too much detail in spots, but overall, good book.","review":"I bought this book for my 9 year old daughter. We read a little bit together, and then I skimmed the book, and she read a bunch on her own. The book is well written for girls in the 9-11 age range - I wouldn't go much below the age of 9, however, without being very selective of what the child reads (there is a brief discussion, for example, about masturbation and orgasm, which I think is a bit *too* much for a book of this level). All in all, I think it explained the changes of puberty in very plain language that a young girl can understand, and it's set up in a way that encourages discussion - although again, sometimes it suggests discussing things with friends, which I find to be a poor recommendation considering the age and topic. I do think my daughter came away with a solid understanding of what puberty is and what physical changes are going to take place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ready, Set ,Grow","review":"I bought this book for my nine year old daughter. This book is informative and not too technical or too mature for her level. We are reading this book together in steps and talking about it. It's a great choice for a young girl who may be a little embarrassed about the changes she is starting to experience or not starting to experience yet . I'ts great for self esteem, because it lets girls know they are all normal just different.It's a good book !"},{"rating":"1","title":"hate it","review":"I'm a Christian and I really hate movies with cursing this one is in the trash.

On the positive side, the typos are of the obvious kind and easy to spot. Unfortunately, they show that very little attention was placed on proof-reading. Also, I found that new concepts were introduced with little of no explanation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive, uneven, and full of poor grammar","review":"This critique isn't so much about Mssrs. Chand and Talbot as it is about Apress. The quality control used in the publication of this book was atrocious. The book was obviously rushed to print (come on guys, you're new to a market with some tough competition, so use your spell checkers and hire professional proof-readers with experience in technical publications!) The writing style is too conversational and colloquial, reading more like an undergraduate end-of-semester project report than a professional reference text. Properly presented, the approximately 850 pages of information could be reduced to about 600.That said, there is a lot of good information here. The authors have tackled some tough subjects (the section on creating custom data providers was especially helpful, but their treatment of the currency manager could have been more in-depth). My advise, however, is to wait for the second edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"Don't even try to buy this book at a bargain price like $5. I bought it at BargainBookCo then have to throw it away. I wonder where all those 5 stars raters come from. I loveApress books but definitely not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good content, very poorly written and edited","review":"Disorganized and packed with grammatical errors, spelling errors, and confusing or downright nonsensical sentence fragments, this book is incredibly difficult to read. An example, from page 13: \\"Using XML, it's easy to program XML files...\\"That said, this book does have some interesting content. Were it not for the total distraction of the poor writing and total lack of editing, I would have enjoyed this book quite a bit.I'm extremely disappointed, as I generally find that APress books are of very high quality. Avoid this book; there are much better titles available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I can't put it in words how disappointed I am with this book; it's a complete waste of time. I've heard the rumors about M. Chands author capabilities, but now I know for sure: he can't write nor does he know anything about the subject he's writing about. I have bought plenty of Apress books in the past and I am more than satisfied with most of them, but this one goes straight in the bin where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupidity at best","review":"Looking over the reviews as I always do for a book I consider buying, I came across the authors extremely stupid review in which he actually gives his own work a 5 star rating. How can anyone do that? Okay, next thing I'm looking at is the way he tries to complain about other reviews; get over it and deal with it. I don't see other authors doing that. It's very incompetent and furthermore the language used gives me very poor hopes for the authors abilities to write in a competent manner. No way I'll buy a book from this author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have","review":"This book has been my best guru in learning the ins and outs of database programming and ADO.NET.

No American holiday receives more attention in school and yet on Thanksgiving day, we tend to ignore the history and spirit behind the celebration.Bleier provides a concise history to go along with a Thankgiving meal ceremony. There is also plenty of extra \\"inspirational material\\" to draw from.I think kids will take to this companion guide to the meal and the ceremony will reinforce what they have learned in school. Especially for kids (particularly those who have no interest in football), Bleier's book will surely add fun to the feast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior book!","review":"If you were able to read only one book on workplace violence, this is the one. In fact, even if you are a practitioner who has read several, this should still be on the must read list. This is the most substantive and insightful book on the assessment and management of targeted violence that I have seen - bar none. It takes a rigorous look at the assessment process and then provides helpful information related to vulnerability management, law and ethics. Included is a very workable assessment tool that can (with the recommended training) be effectively applied in the workplace.The second edition also includes new information, including coverage of ATAP's model threat assessment (RAGE-V) guideline.

He even gives the formulas for the correct mixtures of paint. The book is an invaluable source of information for anyone wishing to paint waterfowl carvings."},{"rating":"2","title":"intermediate difficulty: good as an exercise after Ruben cube","review":"If you know how to solve Ruben cube, and more importantly, how to find a solution to Ruben cube, this puzzle is much easier. Still it can take about half an hour to come with a complete solution. So it is a fun. The common thing it shares with Ruben cube is that both are about finite permutation groups. Searching for a solution usually starts with repetitative application of a fix permutation, which would equal identity. Then perturb the permutation a bit to get a simple generator of the group.If you have not touched Ruben cube, this can be served as an introduction to brain teasers based on permutation groups.Forget abstract mathematics in the game. It is still enjoying. But people may lose interest after unsuccessful attemps without \\"theoretical\\" guidance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Landmark Novel","review":"This is the first book to feature a brain being kept alive outside its body. Now, if you think about that, there have been several stories to use that idea. You can thank Curt Siodmak for that.Donovan's Brain is a really good read, besides. I read it in two days, and that is pretty fast for me. Every free minute I had, I picked it up and continued the story. I think that says a lot.Now, I'm not saying it's a great novel. It is not. But it has that one aspect that all good novels should have--grip. This story gripped me and I constantly wanted to know what would happen next.This book was written in 1948 but it feels as if it were written today. If you are a fan of science-fiction (or of the Orson Welles radio play that was made from this, as I am), I think you would enjoy Donovan's Brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Space Dung...","review":"This absolutely horrible movie concerns a spaceship full of men and women on their way to Venus.

I kept waiting for some of the threads to tie together or the motivation for ANY of the characters to be developed but it never happened. This book would have benefitted enormously from some editting and feedback, it reads like something published by a vanity press because no real publishers would bite.

The explosion of suburbia over the past 50 years has produced a generation struggling with the norms of it's own culture.Ms. Gaines' \\"undercover\\" work in producing this book is superb. She socialized with a group of teenagers to learn about the culture that seems so odd to outsiders, and seems so destructive. She however does not have a \\"cold, scientific\\" style -- rather she becomes part of the group honestly. She does not pretend to be one of them. She treats the subject with respect, love, and an open mind.The result is truly a rich picture of a culture most people never see or frequently don't understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont even bother reading","review":"I grew up in Bergenfield, knew the \\"burnouts\\" as she called them and was shocked at how Miss Gaines took the facts and twisted them for her own profit, she never spent more than 1 day in town, I never heard of her prior to this book, what about the real story?

Just another worthless adult making money exploiting the children that were unable at the time to speak for themselves.Well done Miss Gaines, hope you sleep well at night........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow look at this subject.","review":"I was really disappointed with this book. I was hoping the author would spend more time talking about the individual characters, and draw some conclusions and ideas from this -- instead she was just constantly throwing out reasons for teenage angst based on her _personal_ experiences.

I am still waiting for things to pick up and some sort of story or analysis to appear.Donna rambles about her \\"rebelious\\" youth as a \\"rocker\\", interjecting anecdotes of her own in a thinly veiled attempt to show us how much she understands the youth of the late 1980s. Or maybe she just didn't have enough material and interest in an autobiography.Donna sensationalizes the reality of growing up in suburbia and does so under the guise of trying to help the kids she is writing about.Donna is like your high school guidance counselor: talking at you while you dart your eyes around her office looking for a distraction until you are no longer in her presence."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this is still in print!","review":"I can't believe this book is still in print. It reads like a flow of conscientious and is based on faulty research skills. There are numerous erroneous statements that reveal much about the author but little about the teenagers of Bergenfield.

I've had my eye on this pair of boots for some time and finally decided to make the purchase a couple months ago. They arrived quickly and I was able to break them in within a few days of general everyday use. I typically walk 2 to 3 miles daily over rough terrain. These boots keep my feet comfotable and stabalized. And they are good looking boots. I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend to anyone looking into durable, comfortable and stylish footware for everyday use and moderate to heavy applications.About the only thing I can't attest to is their durability because I have only been using them for a couple months. I have owned other pairs of Danner boots and they have lasted years with another pair I've owned now for nearly 5 years. I expect these boots' durability will be no different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danner","review":"I love these boots. i have been wearing this style for over 20 years now and wouldn't buy anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serves a Purpose","review":"This book is Academic. Don't expect to read it in one night, because its full of facts and can cause your mind to wonder. It is not \\"Lord of the Rings\\", but a Business book to learn.It is factual and a must for those who need/want to understand the collection of consumer information, stats, cost control, and inventory control. Great for Accountants, retailers, and businessman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative But Slow And Not Entertaining","review":"Naturally, one wouldn't expect a book on the history of the bar-code to be particularly entertaining. This doesn't even manage to fulfill my lowest expectations. Still, the content is valuable for an understanding of how standards come about, and also some tidbits on the future applications of barcodes. I read this for a class I took on information technology and policy, and there are a host of far more interesting books on similar subjects that I would recommend before this. I suppose this is supposed to be an exclusively academic read, so perhaps I'm being too harsh. Then again, the content and writing was too simple and accessible to be very esoteric--so maybe I'm not. Whatever. Regardless, don't buy this book unless you're wildly interested in the history of the bar code. If you are, see a shrink too."},{"rating":"2","title":"thoughtful","review":"This book would be a great addition to the consciousness of someone who a) works with dying people as in hospice or in other ways, or who knows someone dying, b) is interested in lucid dreaming as a way to develop a conscious approach to dying.

Panzeri is a good overview of the Little Big Horn Campaign. It is written in the traditional Osprey style and in addition has excellent maps showing the troop movements.The theme of the book appears to be the multiple mistakes made by Custer and his men, espically Major Reno, that led to the destruction of his cammand. The chief among these was over confidence. In this vien, the book is very good. This is a worthwhile read for one who wants to know the basics of an American battle where it is often times difficult to seperate fact from folklore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Haven't read the book yet, but expected something less flimsy looking.

Literally 120 times longer than any other stuffed toy they've had. Normal stuffed toys cost approximately $1-$2, these range from $4-$8. Economically it makes great sense.My ONLY complaint (I don't care a fig about the squeaker, incidentally mine does still work) is that the eyes of the frog were gone in about 20 minutes.

I ordered this furry friend from Amazon & it arrived today 01/30/12 & I gave it to her. It was an instant hit & I was so relieved. Not even 5 mins later it was destroyed & there was fur all over.

I'm giving it a 4 because I don't think it would hold up to all dogs and you need to still watch over them while they play with it but there's no denying it's lasted longer than everything else. One thing though is you should wash it fairly often after a short amount of play the hair on the doll gets matted from slobber and when it dries it feels really prickly.

The multiple story lines (somewhat reminiscent of the old \\"Hill Street Blues\\" scenario) along with the high-action scenes offer something for everyone.

The only complaint I have is that the show doesn't have any customed villians. Well one that is on the island. But the green arrow is only as good as his villians and he needs more radical villians.

No anger, no outrage, no affection, no enthusiasm, just \\"I'm a nice guy\\". That's still leagues better than what everyone projects, which is angst and fecklessness. It's hard to care about any of them.A few of the story lines are pretty good, others rather stupid, even if you accept the premise of a comic book world.

I also feel it could use a stronger underlying plot that spans the many episodes to provide a strong framework to support the ongoing plot of \\"taking down people in a book\\" - what happens when we run out of people in the book for example?

Interesting that the hero doesn't have super powers and he doesn't call himself Green Arrow. I like that he simply paints his face for camouflage to better hide half of it in the dark of the hood, and doesn't wear a lone ranger mask. Very different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded my expectations!","review":"I wasn't expecting much from this show. While I love the movies based on comics, the TV shows haven't done so well. This one excels because of the character development. Who knew? Character development in a comic?!? Arrow is a conflicted human being who is trying very hard to work out his issues. He doesn't always get it right and he pays a high price from time to time. A hero who fails, see what I mean about character development? The supporting characters are well rounded also and over time the viewer begins to feel that they know and either like or dislike these people. The action is also good and the plot lines are interesting. Although it is a show with violence in it; it does not contain the horrible graphic violence a lot of shows today do. I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show","review":"This show has a great story and plot with a great cast of actors.

The authors make good use of sidebars with thought-provoking bits of literature which are scattered throughout the overall history.

It did have an intriguing story-line, but the synopsis was very misleading, for there were no real enemies trying to ruin things. It also didn't have near as much detail and it skipped from one event to another and from one year to another.

Had the bible been written by Moore in the first place, Chistianity might still be a force, rather than the less funny joke it has become via the efforts of the ultra right conservatives.

Well, I decided: I better check it out! From the moment I read the product description online, I knew I was in for an awesome ride... well; i'm here to tell you--I was not disappointed! From the stupidity of the angel, to Joshua's love of irony, this book keeps you rolling from the beginning to the end. Warning: it is not meant for little kids! There is a lot of adult humor in it, so know your tolerance before you read it. Other than that, this book is a winner, and I can't stop re-reading it! It is the first thing I read from Christopher Moore, and know I'm buying all his books! Definitely read this! It's non-stop fun!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A few funny moments, but it's definitely been done better.","review":"While there's some funny stuff here, Moore is not in the league of Christopher Buckley or Monty Python when it comes to generating laughs, or in the league of Gorman Bechard's \\"The Second Greatest Story Ever Told\\" when it comes to religious satire. Moore's book is way too long, with the humor running thin before the half-way mark. (It really is a struggle to finish). I can't recommend, even to fans of his other books. Life is just too short."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Stars for Vonnegut, Adams, C.S. Lewis, \\"Nice Try\\" to Moore","review":"An excellent premise for historical fiction, yet Moore seems to have missed the essence of Christ's character.Where did Moore go wrong? He stayed true to the Gospels and dismissed the rest of the New Testament books, on the premise that \\"Josh\\" could not have known them. \\"Josh\\" though was is and always shall be, according to Gospel John.Kudos to Moore, however, on integrating what is now known as Eastern religion into Josh's understandings.As for a recommended read, try \\"The ScrewTape Letters\\" by C.S.

It's not even \\"freshmanistic\\". It's just childish and poorly written. I should have picked up the signals I got when the author seemed to think the name Biff is funny. True satire should be cringe-worthy and close enough to the real thing to make you wonder if this was, or at least could have been, a plausible account. Instead, it's just badly written crap, that's not even sitcom-level funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Moore, Please","review":"Make no mistake, I thoroughly loved Chris Moore's previous novels and own them all. Have read the others a few times and they don't pale with re-reading. BUT Lamb is simply too lame.It reads as if it were written by a manic sophmore trying desperately to make bad jokes and succeeding. Moore can be terribly witty and absurdist, but in Lamb he's dragging his [posterior] for jokes. Sorry, Chris, but this is drek.What's happened to your sharp sense of humor? Why is this written as if you were lazing in a hammock and giggling over your own \\"cleverness\\"? Huh? Whatever you do, DON'T WRITE A SEQUEL!By the way, it has nothing to do with the content or irreligious tone of the book, I'm fine with that, but the style just simply sucks wind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frat-Boy Humor is right!","review":"If you have the entire Beavis and Butthead series on DVD, this is the book for you. If you were first in line to see Dude, Where's My Car?, you'll probably enjoy LAMB.I, however, am not a 15 year-old and found little to be amused by in this story. I picked it up because I believe nothing deserves a good spoofing as much as the bible but was disappointed to find the author obviously straddling a fence: wanting to poke fun at Christianity without angering a single soul, a difficult feat even when attempted by a more skilled writer. Maybe if he had just gone for the jugular without worrying whose toes he might step on, he wouldn't have had to resort to juvenile Tom Green type humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lamb is Lame","review":"What constitutes effective delivery of discernable humor in this book to some and not others...like me...is puzzling. I thought the attempts of humor fell flat.

It is fast paced and fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative, intelligent, tries too hard","review":"- Liked the imaginative way of looking at the human side of Jesus.- Felt very forced after midway as if the author had 5,000 penis jokes and felt pressured to squeeze in every one. I get it, OK? Sometimes overusing a gag kills it.- A very intelligent writer, might introduce different religions to the beer pong crowd who might not ever have the urge to investigate something deeper.- Very funny in parts- I was a bit disturbed about Biff's treatment of Mary. Mother of God aside,as a female, any friend who has a crush on your mom and brings it up all the time and hits on her would be considered very gross in real life, not endearing at all.- The book could have been cut in half, would have kept the originality and humor without getting forced and tired."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE CHRISTOPHER MOORE'S BOOKS!","review":"I am absolutely in love with Christopher's Moore's books, I can't wait to read all this and sit there laughing while I do so!

You know... as a conversation starter. Chris Moore's story of Biff 'n' Josh gets better and funnier every time I read it, and it has me constantly scouring the net and my local bookstores to see if he's written anything new.

Wish there were more stars to give. This is one of my favorite books of all time. I have read many of Moore's books and always enjoy them. I really get into his humor. LAMB isn't for everyone, like the very static religious, who could get offended, but I was rolling in the floor laughing out loud. Moore is a solid writer for his genre and with this one has hit a home run!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first part of the book was great....","review":"... but the second part seemed rushed through. I think this might be because Mr. Moore figured that most people who would read this already had a good familiarity with the Bible. I'm very so-so on my Bible, especially New Testament, so I found the hurried pace and somber tone (yes, I know it is a somber subject) of the second part to be completely off-kilter with the first parts. Disciples and Apostles were added so fast that none of them seemed to develop any personality.That said, I love the first part. The idea of Jesus having an ordinary side and exploring his childhood is great. Also, showing the obvious parallels between eastern philosophies, Judaism, and Christianity, while showing some of the absurdities of each is a great touch.All in all, I would recommend this book, but with this warning: Don't take it too seriously. It is a humorous novel, not a religious codex, or an attack on Christianity. Lighten up people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lamb Review","review":"I love this book. It makes me laugh out loud.

I'll never get over Biff learning the Kama Sutra... especially some of the positions that he invents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Irreverently Funny","review":"Christopher Moore delivers an irrevernt, often laugh out loud account of Jesus (Joshua)and his best friend Biff when they were kids. Many humorous situations interspersed with biblical and historical references make this book well worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Read it in Public","review":"I read this book mostly on the train, commuting to work. I laughed out loud so many times, I got used to all the heads turning to see who the nutcase was. But I couldn't put it down until I finished.I must admit I was concerned that it would offend me as a Christian, but Christopher Moore was very respectful of his subject matter, and the relationships between the characters were as touching as the writing was humorous. If you don't think this book is funny, you're a corpse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful and fun!","review":"I couldn't put it down! The scene in the garden, where Joshua first encounters the procrastinating angel, had me laughing so hard.. and then, every time I thought about it. Biff and Joshua are typical boys, growing up and venturing forth in the world. Biff knows his buddy is special and he's always there to cover Josh's back, to encourage and protect, and to discuss those things universal to young men. It's a fun book you'll want to share."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It kept me laughing all the way through.

I was able to overlook the fact that my college library had this book in the juvenile section of the library - there are an abundant amount of curse words and several semi-sex scenes - and the fact that Joshua (aka Jesus) did not perform the miracle of multiplying bread and fish with the help of God or raise the little girl from the dead and just enjoyed a decent, humourous book about Jesus' childhood and ministry. I was constantly reading sections of the book to my room mate (I don't think she found them quite as humourous, having not read the book herself), laughing out loud no matter where I happened to be reading the book, and telling anyone I could about what Biff did that day. Thanks Mr. Moore for a wonderfully entertaining book! I loved his afterward in which he explained himself...great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Easily one of my top five favorite books of all time. Hilarious, yet with a message.

With this book (Lamb), I became hooked (I then read Fluke).There are a lot of excellent authors out there today, each with his or her own personal style (that match that of another author). I really enjoy Christopher Moore because he seems to have a style of his own. I would read this book again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Brilliant. Moore manages to pull this off in a way that is not offensive to anyone. Very good read for an airline trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biff is great!","review":"Christopher Moore does a wonderful job in developing characters. You will love reading about Biff, Joshua and Maggie and their adventures. Joshua's inability to lie, street-wise Biff and the Kama Sutra, and so many other details really make this book enjoyable. Blasphemous? I can not imagine someone thinking so. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite simply a good read.","review":"OK, I admit it. I loved this book. Looking for Great Expectations? Or a profound, life changing tome... you might want to look elsewhere. Then again, I have to admit, I found this book compelling. See, if you believe as I do, that God does indeed have a sense of humour, and quite honestly, look around sometime if you don't, then you might find some life affirming things in this work. Please, if you are a believer, take no offence at this next statement, as it's honest, and simply my take... but this book made me care about the character known as Jesus... far more than the Bible ever did. We all know where this story ends, but I still found myself emotionally impacted by the events... a rare feat, mind you. Some, if not most of the humour is quite silly... but then again I think far too many of us take ourselves far too seriously. A good story over all, and one I'd highly recommend to my friends... even the one's who think too highly of themselves. Live. Love. Experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best.","review":"I laughed, I didn't cry, then I laughed some more. Probably the most entertaining book I've ever read. No, it didn't make me think or cause me to examine my life or contemplate anything other than laughing. It's funny and entertaining with absolutely no hidden messages or agendas. I've read all of Moore's books and this is his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody should have a friend like Biff","review":"Christopher Moore has been a recent favorite of mine beginning with \\"Bloodsucking Fiends\\" and the sequel \\"You Suck.\\" Next I tackled \\"Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal.\\"At the time of this review I haven't yet completed the book; perhaps fifty more pages left - but rarely has a book made me chuckle or smile as much as \\"Lamb..\\" has.Christ's childhood pal \\"Biff\\" is resurrected 2000 years later to write about the many trials and tribulations about Jesus and Biff himself in the early years. Biff is that sarcastic friend whose heart is in the right place but his thoughts are, well, not. This book is easily one of my favorite books of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is made of pure amazing.","review":"Okay, if you could take amazing in its purest form and squish it into the form of a book, it would look exactly like this masterpiece. So. Goddamn. Funny. To those who complain about it being inaccurate and an insult to Jesus: chill out and lighten up. This isn't a biography. It's a comedy, and among the best I've read in a long time. Great material for Speech and Debate, too, my next Humorous Interpretation script is coming out of it. Amazing book. Buy it. The power of Biff compels you."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"I started it but didn't care for it so didn't finish it.

Funny, well written and thought provoking. Some text was trite nevertheless a good read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus: the Missing Years!","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time! Yay Christopher Moore!Anyone who has any interest in Christianity should find this book hilarious! Moore clearly knows his Christian and world history then and now. His treatment of Jesus and the people who worship him is outrageous and irreverent and strangely loving at the same time. I'm an athiest who went to Catholic school (I LOVED it) and while I don't believe a word of it, have a great appreciation for all things Catholic, especially Catholic humor (the movie DogmaDogma (Special Edition), the play Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You.Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All You and the Actor's Nightmare: Two One-Act Plays) I also appreciate a big dose of skepticism, and this book delivers on all fronts. Moore is such a great writer that this is a PERFECT BOOK! This new Bible edition is sexy and great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A romp through religious irreverance","review":"Hilarious and irreverent, yet with nuggets of wisdom.

I was extremely satisfied with Lamb. In fact the roller coaster ride of Joshua & Biff's adolescent journey through the eventual Holy land was laugh out loud funny & unthinkable! I felt I was really able to connect with Biff as he represents many qualities/archetypes of many friends or individuals that have crossed my path in life. As I dissolved further into the period story of Moore's I began to really believe that 'yeah that could of happened' or 'NO Way! that's sooo wrong yet sooo plausible!' Nuff said. I dig!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak high school writing assignment","review":"Poorly written. Attempts at humor are sophomoric and, worse yet, not funny. I tried and tried but just couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh is for Messiah...","review":"I got really bored with this book unfortunately. It was okay at first with some of the punchlines that I laughed out loud at, but then it really started to peter off for me around page 116. I just got to the point where the story was really starting to drag with the toilet humor, and I hate to say it, but I just can't finish it.I am a huge fan of Tom Holt and Terry Prachett, and I was really hoping for something like that, but unfortunately this book just didn't have the same wit as the two aforementioned authors.I'm willing to give Mr. Moore's books another chance, but this one I really tried to like and I just couldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"This book is absolutely terrible. It's nearly comparable in awfulness to Chuck Palanuik's Damned. The humor is obvious and contrived. I appreciate dry humor, but this isn't even entertaining. The sad part is I usually enjoy a Christopher Moore book, but I hated the fact that I owned this book so much that I immediately deleted it from my reading history on iBooks so I wouldn't have to remind myself that I spent hours of my life reading it. I felt pity for Christopher Moore knowing that he actually spent a great deal of time and effort researching the history behind this book. Let me add that in no way, shape, or form am I religious or upset about the fact that he is writing a fiction story regarding the Bible, this review is solely based on how unentertaining and idiotic this book is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might have made a funny short story","review":"A few pages of interactions with the angel were funny. Other than that, really not worth the paper it's printed on. I really, really wanted something funny. This wasn't it. Old jokes, sad humor, lots of dull sex and weird violence to make you forget the book is worthless. If that's your thing, go ahead and read it. If you'd like something witty, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glimmers of wit but gets old quickly","review":"That pretty much says it all. It's like a fusion of \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" meets \\"The DaVinci Code\\" meets \\"The Simpsons.\\" The best parts were with the angels. I especially liked the angel who discovered T.V. and wanted God to send him back to Earth as Spiderman. The book is researched and pleasantly irreverent, however, so not a complete bust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its just not that Funny","review":"I read this as part of a book club, and it just wasn't that funny. Its the bible a la 12 year old boy humor. Yes, there were funny parts, but it got old after a while. I didn't know anything about the story when I started reading. Once I figured out that it was a retelling of the bible story, with some gaps filled in, the story became rather predictable. And the humor got repetitive. Its an easy read; I just wish I had spent my time reading something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighthearted Satire with some Depth to it...","review":"I flew through this book pretty quickly, as its lighthearted and colloquial style of relaying ancient events kept the pages turning.The book's layout was inviting, and so was the content. A high degree of familiarity with the Bible and its passages is not required to enjoy the book and its references.Moore deserves a good deal of credit for his clever approach to filling in the more sparsely recorded years of the New Testament, in a way that is fun and edgy while not being disrespectful to anyone's beliefs.Thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable romp through biblical times","review":"Loveable characters, sacralicious story. The best parts take place in the holy land, we (and the son of god) spend a bit too much time trekking through Asia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lamb","review":"I love how Chris can take a heavy or serious topic and breath humor into just like real life where joy and humor is found side by side with tragedy and grief. I recommend this to everyone especially those that take life to serious. I look forward to reading more of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading","review":"I'm almost sad that this book is fiction. I always liked imagining that Jesus had a best friend by His side throughout the majority of His life. I could go on in a lot of detail, but I fear the response of fanatics from both sides of the spectrum, so I will just say this: Read this book if you, like me, imagined that there was at lease one human being who didn't want anything from Jesus; he or she just wanted to be His friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"thoroughly enjoyed","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The tone is conversational and the humor is refreshing. I had been looking for a fun book and this one delivered. It is similar in some ways to the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy or to say nothing of the dog. I would consider this light reading but there are some valuable take- aways."},{"rating":"2","title":"STARTLINGLY FUNNY, DEEPLY SPIRITUAL","review":"So maybe the fictional story of the first 30 years of Christ's life as told by his 1ncorrigible sidekick Biff migh not be the path to spiritual enlightenment, but maybe it is. This hilarious tale had me laughing out loud repeatedly, and rooting for Joshua (Jesus) right from the very beginning. Not only did I find myself laughing until I cried, I also finished this book feeling like a true Christian - This book gave Christ more humanity,than anything I had ever read before, it made him more lovable than I could ever have thought possible. I felt through my tears of laughter that this was someone I would want as a friend (or course loud-mouthed Biff seems to resembly my friends more closely). I can't recommend this book enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Laughing","review":"I believe I have read every one of Christopher Moore's novels. I can honestly say that he is the only contemporary author whose works cause me to laugh hysterically outloud. And yet, his is not frivolous humor. It is thoughtful, dementedly, wildly surrealistic humor with a bite and with a point.Many might consider \\"Lamb\\" a work of sacrilege. I disagree. Surely Jesus had a sense of humor, and surely he had moments of lust, everyday angst and carnal curiousity as depicted by the 21st century Gospel according to Biff.Moore is a national treasure. Lamb is his most thought provoking and \\"deepest\\" work yet. And next to \\"Bloodsucking Fiends\\" it is his best, for my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angels, Professional Wrestlers, and Kung Fu","review":"This is the funniest, most intelligent book I have read in ages. Thanks to C. Moore for a sentient, empathetic look at the craziness that is humankind and their story. Details of Christ's life from the point of view of his childhood buddy \\"Biff\\" (Levi) demonstrate simultaneously Moore's grasp of the Bible and of the absurd and human. Biff is a very believable guy, and though filled with some pretty raw stuff, this story has a ring of simple plausibility due to the great characterizations. It is worth reading for the adventures, or for the humor, or for the people who populate it... any of these could be enough. Bravo, Mr. Moore. You ARE nuts. (And we love it.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorites","review":"i am a huge fan of mark twain. i think if he were alive in todays world, this is the satire he would be writing. i actually had to put the book down to get a rest from laughing so hard. i also enjoy it because unlike the bible, the characters are not one dimensional. great book. do not miss this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny indeed","review":"I have briefly interrupted my reading at page 100 to reiterate here what so many other reviewers have stated. This is laugh-out-loud funny. Well done Christopher Moore. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny as all get out!","review":"This book is not for the easily offended...and one has to remember it is fiction, not based on some secret scroll that Chris Moore found.Beyond that, Chris takes us on a theoretical ride of how Christ's life could have been and how he responded to various situations that formed his human mind set.I really do not want to give much away, so I will leave it as this. If you can stomache the DiVinci Code and not let if upset your faith (because you know it is fiction!!!!), then you will be ok with this. It is brilliantly written, smart, funny and complentative. It will lead you to go \\"Huh\\" at some points and laugh at others. All in all, a nice break from all the heavy reading I have been doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irreverent, bold, and hytsterical- You know, it's like bacon","review":"I love this novel, and so do the four hundred or so friends to whom I have given or leant it. Hands down, this is Moore's best book thus far, and I adore all of his books, with Fluke coming in second. There are certainly people who may be offended by the irreverence, but this book actually led me to study The Bible more in depth and it absolutely affirms my belief that God has a sense of humor. Starting with the killing of the lizards and their healing, right up through learning, through Biff, the joys (and required healings) of the brothel, to my favorite, the discovery of coffee, this book is refreshingly funny and obviously not meant to be taken too seriously. I don't often belly laugh reading a book, but this one just cracked me up. The book is very much, as Joshua says throughout, like bacon. If you don't get that joke, you must read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"I'm a Moore fan and had high hopes for this book, but my hopes were not realized. Moore pussyfooted around the story of Jesus, but was so careful and reserved with his humor that the end-result reads like a weak \\"Life of Brian\\" with the funny parts removed. Add to this an afterword apology for the potential affront he may have offered some readers and you have quite a letdown of a book from an accomplished comedic author. Moore can do better and has proven it in the past (when he does not need to be concerned about insulting established institutions). So, give this one a pass or borrow it from a friend and wait for him to get back into the groove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be entitled \\"Lame.\\"","review":"It's hard for me to believe that a major publisher such as Harper Perennial thought this novel was worthy of publishing. The basic idea that Jesus has a wise-cracking best buddy maybe would be funny as a short story, but in the hands of Christopher Moore, the joke becomes tiresome after the first chapter. It just goes on and on and on. Moore just doesn't have the comedic talent one needs to pull off a book-length enterprise of this sort. In addition to lame gags, he relies on profanity and sex to shock the reader ad nauseum. Ultimately, it's an example of Christian apologetics dressed up in the garb of puerile hijinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny! Made me laugh out loud.","review":"Christopher Moore was hilariously funny this time around. If your not easily offended by anything that goes against you personal religious beliefs you'll love this book. It made me laugh out loud at times. The concept of trying to explain what happened to Jesus before his public ministry was excellent. Putting all belief systems aside and reading the book for what it was made it and enjoyable ride. Biff was everything good and bad about people as a whole and made the book what it was. I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more from Christopher Moore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Hilarious","review":"I feel sorry for anyone who is too self-righteous to read this book. It has to be the funniest book I've read in years! In it, the life of Christ is retold by his life-long pal Biff. In the Bible, much of Christ's life is unaccounted for. For what reason? So Christopher Moore could write this book! God definitely has a sense of humor, and would almost certainly be pleased with this book. And while it is entirely fiction, there are parts that, due to ambiguity in the Bible, just might be true. For example, when God moons Moses because nobody can see the face of God and live, but he could maybe look at his back side. Hey, it could have happened.....the Bible never said it didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching Subject","review":"All the praises the author receives for writing a well researched, biblically informed book can't hide that fact the book was down right entertaining. I really appreciated the fact that while the book was humorous and didn't hesitate to poke fun at some of the aspects of life and society at the time of Jesus it never belittled Jesus or his faithful followers. Now, it is true I don't offend easily so saying I wasn't offended won't mean much but I don't enjoy the mean-spirited and this book was anything but that. It was bound together by affection, the affection of the author for his subjects and the affection of Biff for his best friend - Jesus H. Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call me a freak, but...","review":"I wonder if Judeo-Christianity felt it when this author stuck his thumb up its [...]. I thought this book was a hoot, and adore its \\"hey man, this is how it really happened (wink wink nudge nudge)\\" approach to the life and gospel of Christ.I reccomend this book to anyone attending seminary..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meek.","review":"Exactly the kind of novel you'd expect from an author who thinks Biff is a funny enough name to carry you through the first 50 pages. After that, you're pretty much on your own, wishing the building would collapse, a flood would wipe out your library, or, by chance, you'd bought a funnier book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont' bother with this book","review":"The book started out pretty clever, but about 3-4 chapters in, it just became vulgar. I actually bought 4 copies for friends and then returned them, as I could not give them to my friends to read since it was so raunchy. Don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I'm too old","review":"What was up with this book? It just annoyed me so much. I couldn't finish it after a few chapters. The characters and situations were not funny nor did I feel sympathetic towards them. Therefore, it was time to move on to another book.Perhaps at 38 I'm too old to read this book. Nah. It just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out good...","review":"I purchased this book blindly because it sounded interesting. As I read I really like the book, and I thought it was going to be an awesome book. And it was at the beginning then things changed. I don't want to ruin the story but as soon as the boys started learning lame Chinese stuff and then the Demon, ewwwth. I put it down. I am not into the Chinese stuff at all, and I completely loath scifi stuff. I think a lot of people will like the book, but it just got stupid to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"This book is crap. I've never read a book I haven't finished until this one. The only reason I got as far into the book as I did, which was about 3/4 of the way, is because I'm in a book club and felt I should finish it but just couldn't. If you believe in Jesus Christ at all, don't waste your time, it's offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"If I wanted to be assaulted with F words, I'd pick up the latest bestseller. This book was disgusting. Now, I don't think there's a Christian alive who hasn't wondered what it must have been like to be with Jesus during his 30 unchronicled years; I certainly have pondered that question myself. I was hoping for an imaginative and humorous exploration of the possiblities that might have presented themselves, but what I got was tired drivel loaded with humor on the level of a 5 year old. This book was horrific. Normally, I'd pass this on for someone with different tastes who might enjoy it, but this one went straight into the trash can along with old coffee grounds. I hope the coffee grounds weren't offended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw it away","review":"Not impressed one bit. It was on the ridiculous side. I thought that it would be clever, at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd, Boring and too long audio","review":"I was so bored after the first of 6 audios that lasted over an hour that I stopped listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff","review":"I assumed that since this book was supposed to be a \\"Gospel\\", that it at least would not have any foul language. Obviously, I was wrong. Because of the foul language, I didn't even see much humor. I read four chapters, but couldn't waste my time reading any more. I would obviousely never buy another of Christopher Moore's books.I\\"m sorry I wasted my money and my time. I would have given it zero stars, but you didn't have that choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal","review":"This book was for my grown daughter , who was recuperating from a operation. I wanted something amusing and charming and well-written and this was perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lamb","review":"In the book Lamb is about Joshua's (Christ) childhood with his best friend Biff. The book is Biff's version of the gospel and him telling about what has been happening to Josh. The book is funny but it's not making fun of Christ so you don't need to worry their. Its talks about all of the things that happen during their teen years and what things happen to Josh as he is on his way to be Christ. It's written by biff when he died and is taken by an angle and is taken to a hotel room to write his story. That's only one of the things that make it funny.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes comical stories. It's not making fun of any religion at all for religious types. Anyone that has doubts that this will be a lousy story should read it. I had the same doubts until I read it, it's a very good book once you start reading it. I would give it a B only because it's got some bad moments when they are just talking, but other then that it's a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Most Hilarious Review of Jesus' Hidden Years","review":"Christopher Moore skirts the edge of blasphemy in a novel that presents a new gospel written by a proverbial screw-up. It is pure fiction but portrays what easily could have been. It makes Jesus, the child, one burdened with gifts he had yet to understand and the all too human Biff, his counterpoint in reality. The book is a hilarious page turner with frequent belly laughs from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Messiah and miracle worker with a sense of humor","review":"Moore created a tough challenge for himself as a comic writer by putting a fictional spin on the life of Christ, especially the years between His childhood and ministry that are a wide gap in the Gospels. Yet he succeeds brilliantly in giving the iconic Messiah and miracle worker a human personality with a trait some of His most dour, so-called followers centuries later still lack - a sense of humor. The number of grammatical errors and occasional factual goof (in his epilogue Moore refers to the Book of Revelations, instead of Revelation) are disappointing. Yet, overall, his research is meticulous. For me, the narrative stalled in the middle - where Moore has the Messiah in the Middle East learning Eastern philosophy from the three wise men. Still, \\"Lamb\\" is memorable and thoroughly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tooo funny for words!","review":"Are you tired of all the depressing news in the world today? Well, now you can escape for a while by reading Lamb:The Gospel According To Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal. I was leary about purchasing this book because of my staunch Catholic upbringing. However, I trusted the Amazon reviewers and once again was rewarded with a fantastic read. Christopher Moore is my kind of nut case. His imagination is incredible and this book was almost impossible to put down. I have already ordered another one of his books and will most likely read every one that he has written. It feels so good to laugh...thanks Christopher!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely bloody fantastic.","review":"This is the best book I've read in a long time, and I read alot of books. It's hilarious, well-written, and the characters are very well developed. It's appealing whether or not you're very familiar with the Bible, and although some of the parts are mostly entirely fictional (i.e. when Jesus goes wandering off to the far reaches of the world), they provide a very rational, albeit hilarious, explanation for what he does in his lost years.Moore researched this book very thoroughly, and it shows. It's an interesting and absorbing read from beginning to end, and I guarantee it will make you laugh out loud at least once, granted you have a sense of humor about religion. I'll tell you what I tell all my friends: READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A 'divine' comedy...","review":"When a noted biblical scholar recommended this book, I knew I had to read it. All I can say is \\"Thank God for biblical scholars!\\"Locked in a hotel room by the angel Raziel, Biff writes his gospel of Jesus, from his unique perspective as Jesus' life-long pal and sidekick. As Jesus travels throughout the Middle and Far East -- learning what he must learn to understand and accept his fate as the Son of God -- Biff tags along to avoid hard labor,to keep Jesus out of trouble, oh, and to pickup chicks. Oh well, 2 out of 3 ain't bad...LAMB is probably the best Bible-inspired comedy since Monty Python's film LIFE OF BRIAN. Irreverent, thought-provoking, laugh-out-loud funny, and even touching, Moore has written THE biblical \\"buddy film\\" book (ROAD TO REDEMPTION anyone?) that every fan of great humor needs to read.It may not save your soul, but it would be a sin to miss out on all the fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten Stars for LAMB","review":"This book is laugh-out-loud funny. Christopher Moore just keeps getting better. Although I know very little about THE BIBLE, LAMB is one of the most entertaining books I've ever read. It would make a stupendous Christmas or Chanukah gift. I know that when I re-read it, I'll be laughing out loud again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long winded but worth the ride & read","review":"First of all, I will say that I'm not religious. However, if this is what it's supposed to be, then maybe I should reconsider. Blasphemous? Maybe, but an enjoyable and truly inspired read nonetheless.I laughed some, but it was also a story of true friendship, through thick and thin; doubt and belief. As others say, the ending isn't a surprise, but the way it's lovingly told by Biff, puts a human and believable face on the events leading up to the finale.Can't wait to read the sequel! A movie wouldn't be a bad thing, either, but I doubt it could be made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad to see Catch again","review":"Though I didn't think this book contained the wit held within this other books (Fluke, Practical Demon Keeping), I did enjoy the fun read.I thought that his rendition of the antics of these childhood pals, captures young boys and their behaviors, before they become dignified icons.And I was happy to see Catch again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny.","review":"This was very funny up until Moore's take on the passion story, when it gets serious. I especially liked all the things Biff invents: matches, cream in coffee, sarcasm, etc. I also like it when he tries to fool Joshua (Jesus) by citing non-existent scripture, like Amphibians 6:5, for example, and Joshua, of course, plays the perfect staight-man. Moore obviously did his homework on this amusing tour of major world religions. I prefer a long, satisfying denouement and Moore's is rather abrubt, but the book was most enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Lamb","review":"Christopher Moore brings forth a delightful slide of the story of Jesus, as told by his best friend Buff. Very funny, interesting explanation of the \\"lost\\" years of Jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"Christopher Moore is a genius! He has a great sense of humor. The book made me laugh out loud several times!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny","review":"I just couldn't get in to this one. Moore's other books are awesome. I wasn't offended by the subject matter, it just wasn't funny to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Read...","review":"I was raised in the Christian Church, I worked as a minister for 5 years... and I have to say, I still like this book. It was very humorous and made me laugh out load a few times. I can see where it could be offensive, so be warned... but, if you are looking for a book to read to be entertained, this is it! It is a very easy read and can even help fill in some \\"gaps\\". Now, the information may not be correct in filling those gaps, but it is great to read Christopher Moore's thoughts on these events. Great book, had a blast reading it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!","review":"I have just gotten into reading Christopher Moore and this is my favorite novel of his so far. I was laughing out loud and rarely do that when reading books. This book is hilarious, clever, fun and I give it my highest recommendation. I've also read You Suck, Bloodsucking Fiends, Bite Me and A Dirty Job and they are also excellent. Off to read more Christopher Moore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nailed it!","review":"Best Christopher Moore book out there, and that's saying a lot. Moore is a major talent and all of his books are laugh-out-loud, but in Lamb he took the totally original and highly ambitious concept of putting a twist to certain sacred history, and he nailed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ugh","review":"I have this terrible habit of being unable to stop reading a book once I've started unless it is just God-awful, irredeemably bad. Sometimes that is more painful than others. This was one of those times. Slogging through this book has been a nightly sentence.I take exception with the idea that this is funny, insightful or good. In a nutshell: a new friend - Biff - is inserted into the life of Jesus, and we learn what happened during his previously undocumented years. Guess what? Biff has modern sensibilities and a filthy mouth. Isn't that hilarious and original? No, not really. And that's it. That's all the story has going for it. One cheap trick that has been done before and better.I read Moore's latest book Sacre Bleu, and I didn't hate it. It wasn't a truly great story, but it was readable and infinitely clever. Aside from the fact that both stories focus inordinately on sex, I would not think they are by the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5","review":"Most the characters had the very same personality, speaking with the same indistinguishable sense of humor etc. No individuality. Some of the humor was too stupid.To sum up, the first quarter was bad, second good, third bad, forth OK. The obsession with sex became obnoxious real quick. I wasn't impressed. Seems if you are going to take on such a big subject it should be given more thought and care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not amused","review":"I am a christian that could not get my head wrapped around a spoof on Jesus. So this was a waste of my time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT MOORE'S BEST","review":"I consider myself a fan, but this is not Christopher Moore's best book. In fact, this is his worst. It kind of runs out of steam about half way through. His earlier works have been breezier and swifter reading.LAMB is the life of Christ as seen through the eyes of his best friend Biff. Moore adds a lot of humor not found in the Bible. Jesus alternately killing a lizzard and bringing it back to life, and Biff lusting after Mary. Apparently, the mother of Jesus was hot. Unfortunately, after the bits of humor played out, the thing starts to get a bit tedious.Enjoyable, but I can't help thinking CM could have done more with the material, given his particular slant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Strong Enough to Carry Long Book","review":"I am very interested in the academic Historical Jesus. This book was chosen because of its catchy title and premise that Jesus had normal friendships, which I do believe. If this were a short essay, I'd be happy. As the book continues, the sarcasm's cuteness wears off. Another observation is that one must be well read in the canonical gospels and tradition to understand many of the jokes. A certain person is attracted to a purported gospel written by Bif, Jesus' closest childhood friend. The author certainly did his research and is well-versed in Christology and the historicity of Jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely a MUST READ","review":"There is too much I can say about this book, so I'll keep this short...I read a review for THE LAMB when it first came out and decided that I had to give it a read. THE LAMB is wonderful. Every page had me laughing out loud, very loudly. What more can I say? If you want a book that is clever, well researched, brilliantly funny, thought-provoking, and even a bit touching, READ THIS BOOK! If you are looking for something else, get over it and read this book anyway. If you think this book would offend you, definitely read this book (and find out for sure).No matter what your expectation, I assure you, you will be pleasantly surprised. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I want Moore!","review":"Had been eagerly awaiting Christopher Moore's latest book, especially after hearing just a bit about it. (With a title like this one, it had to be good...). I'm only halfway through Lamb now, but am amazed - it is even better than expected! His writing has continued to grow, as has his ability to develop complex characters. His wicked sense of humor, satire & absurdity shine as always. Lamb is similar to what might happen if \\"Dogma\\" was filmed by Tom Robbins on his way to the Forum.....but better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous Book So Far from the Truth It's Sad","review":"This is a ridiculous book so far from the truth of what Christ's childhood could have been like that it is sad. I thought this would be a humorous book that I could laugh through, unfortunately it was so off base that I found it offensive. If you actually know who Jesus Christ is, this book it not something you want to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny x 345","review":"This is seriously one of the best books of fiction that I have ever read.Some extreme Christians may be extremely offended at the ...possible sacrilegious element. Although, I really have to say as a non-extreme Christian that this book actually made more sense of my religion for me.This book is beyond funny, and really does make you think about the various religions. It's well thought out and flows very nicely. It also doesn't take Jesus/ Joshua off a pedestal, but gives you a better understanding that he really was a person before the end. A person with friends, family, a life and interests. But, of course keep in mind that this is a work of fiction. Although, that isn't hard... Because of Biff, who is such an original character idea.I say, It's a great read. **** & 1/2"},{"rating":"2","title":"Biff enlightens","review":"While one needs an open mind to read this book, it is still thought provoking. What if Jesus...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chris Moore give us Moore!","review":"I love this guy, his books are well researched and absolutely side-splitting.They are on the edge of being sci-fi, but they are mostly just fun.This story is great for anyone who can take a bit of religious humor. It is definitely not for the uber-religious person who can't take a joke about the big J.C.I'm enjoying it thoroughly as I always do a good Christopher Moore book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great nothing Moore to say!!","review":"i bought this special edition Lamb only after i bought the paperback read it and loved it!! i do suggest a good sense of humor regarding religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book, and this is the best edition to give","review":"This book is funny, thought provoking, and makes beautiful and articulate statements on the nature of faith and religion, while poking fun at both at the same time.And if you are going to give it as a gift, this is the best version to give."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Christopher Moore","review":"Ranks up there with Coyote Blue and Fool. If you know Mr Moore's books, you've probably already read this one...or you should. If you don't know his books, get to know them. One of my top ten favorite authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my fifth copy","review":"Every time I buy a hard copy of this book, it walks away with friends and family. So I downloaded a digital copy and now it's all mine. I read it a couple times a year, when I feel like laughing hysterically. It's not for the easily offended. But if you have a wicked sense of humor, this book is for you. Biff's character has a mouth like a drunken sailor, and there are no holds barred. But he has a sweetness about him, and a true and deep love for his best bud, the messiah. I have to limit my reading time at work, as I may wake people who are asleep down the hall with my cackling."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book!","review":"This book has an unusual premise that may offend some people. It is written to be humorous and not offensive, and humorus it is. Had me laughing out loud many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This is by far the funniest book I have ever read. I was raised Christian and although I don't subscribe totally to those beliefs anymore, I find the subject matter very interesting. I thought this was a really original premise and a wonderfully told story. I didn't want it to end. I became sad as the inevitable death grew near. One feels very close to Josh by the end of the book and it was really hard to say goodbye. I thought the commentary on modern life thru the eyes of the angel was hilarious and insightful. Everyone should read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest book I've ever read","review":"One of the few books that had me continually laughing out loud throughout. A wonderful story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, smart, irreverent without being disrespectful","review":"I am not a Christian, but I also am not interested in bashing another's beliefs. I laughed out loud throughout this engaging novel. This book puts a spin on the whole \\"Jesus thing\\" that portrays him as divine and human, with VERY human friends. It also gave some interesting insights into the apostles and the culture of the times. Dont be turned off from this book because you are not \\"into\\" religion. Also, dont be turned off if you are. There is something here for both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lamb is absolutely delicious","review":"While I should not be admitting this since I am a pastor... this book is very, very humorous! If you are able to enjoy a wonderfully strange mixture of dark humor and slapstick comedy you will greatly enjoy this book. If you are of the religious bent (as I am) and are not afraid of being found out and burned at the stake for heresy when others discover you have this book, you will be impressed that most of Moore's theological and biblical references are accurate, although reworked in the most bizzare of fashions. If you are not of the religious bent, it doesn't matter because the book is fiction (I hope so) and wonderfully strange fiction at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satire At Its Best","review":"This is my favorite book in the last year (and I've read about 80). It's creative, dark, funny, poignant. If you ever wondered what happened to Christ during his teenage years and early adulthood, look no farther. It's the best explanation I've heard so far, and is apparently loosely based on currently documented but not well-publicized theories. Not meant for the easily offended when it comes to playing with religious beliefs. This was the first book I read by this author and immediately ran out and read all his others, including his new Fluke, but this one was still my favorite of them all. I've recommended this book to everyone who asks for a recommendation, and those that don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite book","review":"This is the funniest book that I've read in as long as I can recall. My wife was sick of me reading it aloud to her, but we're still together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lamb Special Gift Edition","review":"I love this book for how it incites great conversation and it is a welcome addition to my small collection.This is one of those books that really gets people talking. Conversations range from the story itself, to the historical truths or lack thereof, the religious implications, and now its look.I really enjoyed reading this book the first time around when I would find myself laughing out loud when I would least expect it, and most recently with this edition where a friend thought I was laughing about something in the Bible itself.This new edition was a great idea, with only one flaw: It can be difficult to hold open because it is bound tightly. I'm afraid of causing too much wear to the spine of the book, but in retrospect I guess that would only add to its charm of looking like a Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!!","review":"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!!! Christopher Moore is unapologetic in this satire about the childhood best friend of Jesus Christ. Brilliantly written, brilliantly researched, and brilliantly funny!! Did I mention that Christopher Moore in brilliant?? The amazing thing about this book is that as funny as it is from cover to cover, and as tongue in cheek as it is from start to finish, Christopher Moore also manages to find real heart and a true character connection at the end that is moving. One of my all time favorite books. Well done!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What you didn't know about The Messiah","review":"If you liked Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaimon then you will like Lamb. The writing style is very similar. Bif and Joshua have many adventures (and a few misadventures) during Joshua's education to become The Messiah.Fisher Stevens did a decent job with his voice characterizations. With the amount of characters in this audiobook, I thought he might not be able to pull it off. I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely a fun listen on a long commute or working out at the gym (if people don't mind the occasional LOL)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I heard so much about this book, that I decided to give it a chance - and found this special edition. I was very impressed with the storytelling and the weaving in of all the jokes and \\"facts\\" we all know and grew up with when learning about the Bible. But, to add in a side trip to visit the Three Wise Men, China and an appearance by the Yeti!!! Now, this is a true adventure not to be missed. I laughed a great deal at the subtle and not so subtle jokes told within these pages.I have to say that Chris Moore does fill in some gaps in Jesus' life, so who knows - it could have happened this way. What would be funny is 20k years from now this book is found and added to the Bible as a true Gospel...people in the future may not understand humor and think it's for real..lolRead this book, it's very entertaining and you might actually learn something too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark and Gloomy Photographs","review":"The picture on the cover can be considered one of the better photos in the whole book. The first few pages of the book appears promising. However many of the photographs starts to take on a dark and gloomy feeling especially those with a S&M theme. The different shades and tainting of the photos only add to the gloomy feeling.A few of the models in the book are fairly attractive and the photographer is able to bring out their beauty in a erotic and suggestieb manner. However almost more than half of the book contains photos of S&M and that may be the downside of this otherwise promising book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eros-free erotica","review":"It is difficult to imagine an erotic photography collection being neither arousing nor artistic, and yet this is exactly what China Hamilton managed to achieve in this less-than-memorable composition. I can only pity these obviously beautiful models presented in such an unappealing fashion. If there is a hidden message here, I failed to see it. My recommendation: stick to the higher calibre artists; Sieff, Newton, Kroll, Kloster, Dahmane, Stuart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased","review":"The typographical and grammatical errors make your teeth grind, the factual content (including geographically) is appalling, and the generalizations about small town life are enough to make anyone who grew up in a small town want to scream. The author's attitude is that he is the only one capable of understanding why April did what she did and that the verdict was justified.

Director Craig Lahiff's delivers a riveting murder mystery based on a true story circa '58. Max Stuart (David Nqoombujarra), a transient aboriginal male working for a traveling carnival is arrested, beaten and charged with the brutal rape and murder of a little nine year old white girl.The murder case falls into the lap of a struggling young lawyer named David O'Sullivan (Robert Carlyle). As the evidence in the case is gathered and examined by the novice attorney it doesn't take long for him to discover the difference between white man's justice and its prejucicial application to the black man.Great performances by Robert Carlyle, David Nqoombujarra and Charles Dance as Roderic Chamberlain, the prosecuting attorney.Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cheryl","review":"shows how prejudice was and still is alive. another one of those movies that should be seen by all. another thumbs up for Robert Carlyle"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"I saw Maynard twice live, and I also own the DVD \\"Live from the Top\\".

It is very secure yet easy to remove.However, it is really annoying when it keeps popping off the window while I am driving. I am using it on a side window with the mount resting on the dashboard.

Walking the same streets the author had. Lining up the same shots at the same historical locations. Standing in the exact same spot that the pictures had been taken almost a century before.

The action is superb, and the acting is wonderful. Sonali Kulkarni shows her vivid emotions brilliantly as a torn mother, and Sanjay Dutt makes you believe that he is actually the character, and not just an actor. Jackie Shroff is a pro at being a shady villain, which not many Bollywood stars can do, exception of 'Road' with bombshell newcomer Payal Rohatgi.

It trivialises and cheapens the Kashmir conflict worse than a Hollywood studio would, and that's really saying something. The performances are over the top, the musicial numbers are totally out of place here, and the message is simplistic and insulting.

My childhood memories held such fond impressions of Bruno Kirby' character and the water skiing scene and Bob Crane's girly screams. Now I see some hilarious editing (the teens are filming dad from the boat but the family movies play back long shots from a neighboring boat - you know what I mean!). I enjoyed it long enough to view it again years later, loved the story, but packed it up the next day to sell to another. Enjoy the visit to the past!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For die-hard \\"Hogan's Heroes\\" fans... and no one else!","review":"For those whose only exposure to Bob Crane is \\"Hogan's Heroes\\" (or one of those \\"home movies\\"!) this mediocre Disney \\"comedy\\" is worth checking out. Col. Hogan is a straight character, always wise cracking, always sure of himself but not much depth. Crane's character here is a bit of a wimp with an efemminate scream! Crane doesn not exactly give an Acadamy Award performance here (the recycled Partrage Family script doesn't inspire) but it does prove that Crane could play someone other than Col. Hogan with a little versitillity."},{"rating":"1","title":"love camp 1","review":"was not quite what I remembered. Some nice T&A, but that is it.

Roma Ligocka does write about the Holocaust, but she was a very young child, a toddler, during that time and her vague, fragmentary memories of it take up only a few chapters of the book. The rest of the book is about her growing up and her adulthood as an artist. I didn't find the book all that interesting, and I thought Roma liked to promote herself a lot, talking about how beautiful she was, etc. Interesting detail: Roma's cousin is the famous film director Roman Polanski, and he's one of the major characters in the early part of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book of vanity","review":"I have read hundreds of books about those who survived the holocaust but this is one book I cannot recommend. Although you get a glimpse of what life during the holocaust may have been like, you unfortunately get too many glimpses of a woman who thrives on vanity. Throughout the book, Roma time and time again stresses how pretty she was and how many men wanted to marry her. Roma is a woman who you cannot come to care about as she cares so much about herself but not in the way of her survival but instead her looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rough Reading","review":"After reading almost every book in the expanded universe, I have come to expect a clunker every now and again, and once in a while, something wonderful, like Star By Star, Traitor, or the Zahn stuff. Unfortunately, this could be the worst expanded universe novel ever, right up there with Darksaber and The Crystal Star. Lame plot, lame characters, terrible dialog. It was truly a chore finishing this novel. It felt like a rough draft in severe need of revision. There was no development in Obi-Wan at all - his name could have been interchanged with another Jedi, and it would not have made a difference to the story. The best part was the afterward - the author seems like a nice guy and a good person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing, awful story","review":"The Cestus Deceptions was by far the worst Star Wars novel that I have read. I am not often disapointed by expanded universe novels and own nearly all of them, however; this novel was a supreme disapointment. Poorly written and horrendously paced, the author showed no grasp of any of his characters (especially Obi Wan's), with many of the characters displaying the same attributes as the others. The clones were feminized, various non-sensical metaphors were reused repeatedly and the plot was implausible at best. Do yourself a favor and skip this book as well as any other by this no talent hack."},{"rating":"1","title":"chick-lit","review":"This book has one huge flaw. The over-the-top humanising of a clone-trooper. The author kept building on this theme until the nauseating Chapter 67, which had me reaching for a vom-bucket.There should be a warning sticker on this book - \\"chick-lit\\", because it is literature for chicks. Whoever gave this guy the keys to the \\"Star Wars books\\" kingdom should snatch them right back from him.

I won't go in a lot repeating what others have offered, but I will say that the book showed an entirely different Kit Fisto than I had hoped for. Instead of a quick witted intelligent Jedi, we were delivered a brooding, boring, out of character individual, who hardly displayed his skills with the lightsaber against one of the super villains of the books and cartoon series.For those of you who are now into the Star Wars books, do read the reviews. They are worth your while in helping you select the best in the many Star Wars novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is nothing more then a rip off","review":"First off I would like to apologize to those of you that take the time to write these reviews, I didn't read them before I bought this book if I had I probably would not have.This book is a not very well written short story with a lengthily Q&A; with the author about his next book which is probably another stupid short story and long Q&A; about his next stupid book I won't know because I will never buy another book by this guy. If I want a short story I'll buy a comic book and not pay over $7.00 for it.If the publisher wants to print a short story or a Q&A; with the author they should do one and or the other not together and pass it of as a book to con $7.19 out of my pocket"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even though I am a HUGE fan of Star Wars, I didn't like it.","review":"This story takes place in the Clone Wars. The Clone Wars was my favorite era in Star Wars, so I thought I would like it, like Shatterpoint, which I liked.I have to be honest in saying that I hated it. The author dragged everything out, and I wish he would have just shortened it and taken out all the drecriptions of everything. It seemed to go on and on about small details that really didn't need to be mentioned.

It was an interesting read and the characters where very interesting. I would like to see if any of them reapear in other EU books. It also left open another possibility for a book about Yoda. This is well worth your time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"8 out of 5 stars!!!","review":"This novel, starring jedi knight's Obi-Wan Kenobi and Kit fisto, as well as an ARC trooper and Assajj Vantress. is one of the best novels among the plethora of reading material in the Star Wars universe today. Focusing mainly on Obi-Wan and the ARC trooper, this book sets up the mystery and intrigue of an old detective/spy movie (just like Lucas did with Episode 2) while keeping heavy on the lightsaber action. We also get an in depth look at the clone soldier's personalities that has been (purposely) lacking in other titles.Ventress fans, here's a treat. Kenobi fan's, this is what you've been waiting for. And Fisto fans,(any one else think he rocks?) you'll find this highly enjoyable!

He is up to speed with writing a very good novel with great characters. I especially enjoyed the background material of the clone troopers. I do not know if any other writers have used this before or this is something created by Barnes, but it is still good and made me want to know more about the troopers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cestus pool","review":"It is, by far the worst Star Wars book I have read so far, and I've read quite a few. It turns perfectly cool things like ARC Troopers into soap-juggling sensitive nice-guys. I am not joking. The ARC trooper fell in love with somebody who was on the same slave ship as Jango Fett. Do yourself a favor and stay clear of it. Instead, buy Republic Commando: Hard Contact by Karen Traviss. A MUCH better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't buy the whole storyline","review":"I can't really say much of anything good about this book.

The plot line was fascinating: stolen artifacts, a mysterious woman, a lying deceitful father, a murdered mother, sudden wealth, and three sons seeking the truth. I could hardly read fast enough to take it all in. However, I did think that the ending fell a little flat. I guess I am used to books having an exciting climax at the end. This one didn't. The mysterious happenings were explained, and that was that. It was still a highly readable and interesting book. I will look forward to his next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious translation to ebook! And I mean atrocious!","review":"I had just finished reading a Freedman hardcover book, and I wanted to read more Freedman. So I went on Amazon and purchased This book. I am sure that if I had read the hardcover or paperback version I would be giving it between 4-5 stars. But I NEVER imagined that I would be paying more than my normal outlay on Amazon's excellent selection of ebooks, for a book that is absolutely full of every sort of grammatical, spelling, missing words, indecipherable words etc.I had better stick to the .99c and 1.99c books - but NOT a single bargain book has had 1/10th of the mistakes (let alone 1/50th)!Does nobody in Amazon review an ebook before it is put on sale?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guess I almost stand alone....","review":"I really enjoyed this book! I had it around for some years, and never read it. Part way through it, I looked at the reviews it received on Amazon, and I was surprised that it did not receive that many stars. I did not read any of the reviews because I was enjoying the book, and I did until the very end. I will agree that it had its weak spots, and the ending was not all that spectacular. There was little character development of Diane, who was not all that great a character, and seemed to use her sexual charms to get what she wanted. I liked the interplay between the three sons, who seemed to love their parents,and could not understand what was going on with their dad. I would recommend that you give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I gave up on it after a few pages because it was overly idyllic & overly descriptive about mundane things that were in no way central to the plot. It felt like I was reading filler material. This is made especially glaring by the fact that the first few pages are *supposed* to captivate you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kill me now","review":"In this book you will find a staggering slow plot, inane and contrived dialogue, flat boring unbelievable characters and a completely unsatisfying (anti)climax. This is the first book by this author that I've read and I don't think that I will try any of his other offerings. I'm only thankful that I checked it out of the library rather than spending any of my own hard earned money on it. I'd love to have back the time I wasted reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An editor, an editor! My kingdom for an editor!","review":"What you have here is about 60 pages of material stretched out to 498 pages. I can't believe I actually read the first 350 or so. It's as if Freedman and his publisher colluded to create a massive waste of time. The story is set up early and then goes nowhere for an eternity. Finally, when you can't stand the pointless descriptions and stagnant plot, you might be tempted to skip to the end. Unfortunately, at this point, it becomes clear that the author never intended for you to figure anything out until you had read about 400 pages. The ending is not only clumsy, but of a very \\"deus-ex-machina\\" nature; that is, there was never any reason to suspect the true culprit except that there was never any reason to suspect the true culprit. (Yes, I know that sounds redundant, but then the whole novel is an exercise in repetition. My sympathy if you paid for the hardcover version.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much angst; too little action","review":"To date, I have read all of J.F. Freedman's books and wish I had quit while I was ahead. This is like wanting to remember the dearly departed as young, healthy, and appealing instead of puny, wasting, later years. I hope the author returns to more likeable characters and more thrilling plot.

Next to Conceptions 1, Women was the most disappointing in the set - there were only 3 or 4 images I liked in the entire volume. The book mostly contains images that look like seventies sci-fiction paperback cover art. I wouldn't have guessed Royo was the artist, particularly when I look at some of his more astonishing pieces from recent years. If you're new to Royo, get Secrets, Malefic, Visions and III Millenium instead - they're absolutely spectacular, and better illustrate (no pun intended :-) why Royo has earned such a loyal following."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delighfully full of good things...","review":"This DVD is full of delightful ideas for a spooktacular Halloween.

My immediate reaction, was \\"un-neutered ferret and male cat spray\\" For those of you fortunate enough to have never smelled either, let me sum up in one word...YUCK!!! I thought the scent would improve after a bit, so I walked around, sniffing the pulse points of my wrists, hoping against all hope that after a few moments, I would be able to utter an \\"ahhh\\". Sadly, no such luck. The scent never improved and I couldn't wait to get home to shower. However, I decided to wait it out, still clinging to the hope the scent would magically improve.

Lynn and Harrold have created an extraordinary volume: it gives very specific useable advice about options at the end of your or your loved one's life, yet is filled with remarkable poetry, photos, and anecdotes to have an emotionally positive impact on readers struggling with these issues. It is not a book to buy only when the end is near; it is something people should look at because it so directly handles an issue we think about most of our lives. Alot of fiction and non-fiction proports to be uplifting when it comes to dying; most of it is simple-minded and useless. This volume just knocks the socks off other \\"death\\" books.

The plot concept was interesting to me, but the movie is so implausible, that I ended up stopping it well before it was half over. Implausible even for a ghost movie? That's pretty implausible.

For the older students I have used it too describe the hidden cultural tension that exists behind the sport.

This book should be suggested and/or mandatory to all middle school and junior high students. This book teaches a valuable lesson of respecting others whether they are like you or not. Overall a great book * * * * ( 4/5 star)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give a Boy a Gun","review":"\\"Give a Boy a Gun\\" is a great book. Gary and Brendan are two suicidal teenagers who get bullied every day by football players and kids on the restling team. These boys attempt to reenact what happened at Columbine. Other than Gary, no one was killed in the shooting scene. Gary shot himself and Brendan ended up in a mental institution for the rest of his life. This was definately one of the best books that I have ever read. I sincerely think you should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep guns away from kids!!!","review":"Two boys with the same interests and are a little different from everyone else. Well in this town in the book \\"Give a Boy a Gun\\" by Todd Strasser that won't pass. Just because they don't play football or atleast go to the games they are made fun of at school by the kids who do. Brenden and Gary are both interested in the same things like gory games, guns, drugs and alcohol. The guns part doesn't come in until later though. Also the other thing the two have in common is that they are both picked on at school. They both get so fed up with it. They get guns from neighbors houses and booby-trap a school dance. Then it all begins what they do at the dance and how it all turns out. To find out this information i will leave it up to you to read the book and find out. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"give a boy a gun review","review":"Give a boy a gun is a book about two guys named Gary and Brendon who hold Middleton High School hostage at one of there dances and try to get revenge on all the people who made there lives miserable. The author tells the story like a reporter and get's everyones side of the story. Overall this book is very chilling and very real. There is always people like Sam who don't like people that are different so they think it's cool to make fun of them. But there will always be people like Gary and Brendon who want to take out those kind of people and that's what they try to do in this book. Overall i liked this book very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"Give a boy a gunGive a boy a gun is my favorite book that I have read this year. it is about these two boys that are bullied in school until 10th or 11th and they finally snapped at their high school dance. They shot teachers and students and scared the life out of them by shooting everywhere. The way this book was written in kind of a documentary jail interview kind of thing. And I really liked it. I give this book a 5 star rating. It shows at least 9 different points of view in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read this book because I had read the books about the 2 girls killed in Columbine and had thoroughly enjoyed them. I was vastly disappointed. This book was so boring and written very poorly. It was like the author couldn't make up his mind about whether to make this book a novel on nonfiction. In short, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched & Skipped","review":"The CD had so many scratches on it, would not continue to play even one CD, and when it did play, it was jumbled.

It was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've ever read.","review":"Strasser has almost no writing talent whatsoever. His characters are flat and stereotypical and the entire book is meant only to push his political agenda. I recommend reading a book with actual character development and real emotion, not written by someone using events and the lives of teens to preach an agenda through heavily manipulated facts. Strasser is a snake at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give A Boy A Gun","review":"I thought this book was a good plot line and everything you could think of. But those stupid article type things.

Give A Boy A Gun was by Todd Strasser and it was in diary form and it had 208 pages in it. There was a lot of action in the book. The plot was awesome it made me feel like I was in Brendans body. Brendan Lawlor and Gary searle were in high school and got picked on and beat up a lot because they werent afraid to be a little bit different. The book explained in great detail about what happenen at the dance when Breandan and Gary held a lot of students hostage.I couldnt put this book down because of all of the little details Todd Strasser put in the book. After reading Give A Boy A Gun I want to read more books by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Moore is missing a member of his writing staff.","review":"This book is so full of twisted facts and flat out lies I almost vomitted. Apparently everyone who rated this book above 2 stars either is completely inept at noticing propaganda or agrees with Strasser's BS. Strasser definatley stole a page out of Michael Moore's play book on this one. What better way to twist facts and impose and agenda than using the murders of school children and exploiting their suffering."},{"rating":"1","title":"By a stupid liberal, for stupid liberals.","review":"Here we go again. A liberal tries to subtly state his case and covince others to become advocates against guns and the second amendment in general. Lies. Manipulation. That's what this guy's resorting to. Don't you people know a gun can't control someone, influence their actions? \\"Give a boy a gun.\\" The title implies the weapons themselves convinced the boys to do evil things. That's the problem with you liberals. Just because something's a weapon, doesn't mean it has to kill, or harm. There are many sporting, defensive and recreational applications for guns. Guns don't kill people, losers with guns kill people. \\"Give a boy a gun.\\" Ha! This book is the embodiment of an idiotic principle. Just a way to rally anti-gun advocates. Foul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give a Boy a Gun","review":"This is the best book that I have read in a long time.

I had planned to buy a Warriors jersey so I checked it out before giving it away. The quality is nice and I ended up buying one with similar quality. The Swingman version is a nice medium between the Authentic and Replica versions. I found Replicas to feel and look cheap while the Authentics are very nice but too expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but pay attention to the documenation","review":"I read this book a few years ago and was impressed with the history and documentation. However the author includes a chapter on how the College of Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church is really a coven of satan-worshippers. The other chapters have footnotes and ways to corroborate. The \\"cardinals\\" chapter had nothing. (This sort of thing can turn away people from continuing to seek out the truth when they find an obvious statement of prejudice in the middle of it). Read the book but use it to follow up with more reputable resources."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most important books that anyone should read","review":"If you want to know who is controlling the world, and what they are planning for it; then you should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright for one AA battery!","review":"This is a great flash light, it just need a single AA battery. It's also very good, cause it will turn to red if the battery is low. I use re-chargeable battery with it, what makes a great combination that saves my pocket!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit unhappy","review":"This is damn near a wonderful flashlight.But not quite.The thing is, this is a tremendously bright flashlight on the main setting, and the red led is very useful if you want to use it close up without being blinded. It's also VERY lightweight, and comes with a decent belt holster.However, mine is malfunctioning. Within two weeks of purchase, it got stuck in signal mode. It still basically functions, it's just obnoxious to use.Also, the pocket clip is terrible. It's poorly designed and poorly fitted. The tip of the pocket clip doesn't flare out enough so it's rather difficult to clip to a pocket, and there's several mm of clearance between the tip and the body of the light. Retention is very poor, and it functions more like a pocket hook than a pocket clip.LRI's warranty is fairly good, and they said they'd fix/replace the light and fit a new pocket clip, but I am unable to send it back at this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for astronomy!","review":"Finally. A solid, well built flashlight that has VARIABLE output for both white and red light. With one button, you can control the intensity of the red light from dim (to preserve night vision) to fairly bright (to clean up your setup site without ruining night vision for others around you).Also, the white light is VERY bright, but also adjustable in intensity, again with the same one button.And, finally, it comes with a lifetime guarantee. I can't imagine a better buy in a compact flashlight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Wish I could give it 6 stars. The best small flashlight out there. Incredibly bright and built well. I would say that the company and personal customer service is even better. My son had one of these first, broke the bulb (his fault), and the company replaced it. When you call in an actual person answers the phone and politely takes care of business like the old days. Very, very nice! One of the best products and companies I've dealt with in a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good - But older model?","review":"I am overall pretty impressed with the product for the money. However I'm pretty sure I recieved the older model other reviewers have discussed. Also holding it up against another 100 Lumen light I have it is not that bright. The thread on the one I received also is not great and when screwing the battery compartment closed sometimes the o-ring pinches and bulges out a little - if this was something I had to do a lot I'd be pretty annoyed - fortunately it's good on batteries.Don't get me wrong this is an EDC light for me and I'm using it a lot. I like the switching mech especially the straight to red (main reason I got it) option by holding the button down. It also is definately waterproof as I has tested this - just make sure the o-ring is seated properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off alert!","review":"Beware: the picture on the box is a still of Anouk Aimee in Jacques Demy's 1962 \\"Lola\\". The disc is a transfer of a 1970 film of the same name with Charles Bronson - as, in fact, described in the synopsis below for more careful shoppers than I was in a moment of haste. Even if the Bronson film is the one you want, get a different transfer. This one is blurry and awful in every way, including no menu, let alone any other features. So: a false-advertising image for a woefully substandard (other) product. I chalk this one up to experience - which I pass on to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this made into audio book","review":"I can't imagine why anyone would publish this book in audio format. The story is told in first person and the character telling the story is an incredible whiner. The narrator makes a worthy effort at trying to put some spine into his voice but the author has created a spineless, insecure, overweight character who snivels throughout the book.

One of those albums you can listen to the whole way through and be satisfied at end. I'd classify it as alternative rock. So if you like Beck or Matchbox 20, Flynn's your man.

Starship Troopers, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, The Green Hills of Earth -- all brilliant classics.Stranger in a Strange Land is the most boring SF novel I've ever read, though. In this book, NOTHING HAPPENED (sex excepted). Starship Troopers begins with the line, \\"I always get the skakes before a drop,\\" and doesn't stop moving until the last page. The Moon is a Harsh Mistress is an enthralling, exciting war story, too.In Stranger, people sat around and talked. Sometimes they had sex. A few people got killed by magic.NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS BOOK. Read the above mentioned Heinleins; not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have ever read.","review":"This is absolutely awful. It has some interesting tidbits and political/social commentary but they are too few and far between. I don't know what Heinlein was thinking when he wrote this. It's long, dull and boring. I can see why some hippies thought it was great because it basically preaches that all of manking will be 'saved' through free love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dull, dull and stupid","review":"I can't believe I managed to finish reading this tripe. Basically as others have said, the first half was an intriguing idea. The second half however shows what a simplistic world view Heinlein had.The Plot: Basically martian man begins a Scientology/Branch Davidians cuasi-socialist-cult where everybody melts into one entity and becomes happy by freeing their mind and having sex, lots of sex. Who gives a (blip) anyway. All this is explained in long-winded conversations where one idiot makes a comment only to be refuted by an all wise sage, and the sage is never wrong.Boring, boring, boring as hell. If Heinlein had any sense of irony he would have seen that martian man's cult was utter stupidity and would have made fun of it in the last half.Don't buy this book, get something that matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, Dated, Marred by Chauvinism and Prejudice","review":"It's easy to understand why this novel made a splash in the 1960s (before the advent of \\"free love\\") and its harsh criticism of many contemporary religious practices is astute and rings true. But \\"Stranger\\" generally seems very, very dated, the dialogue is atrocious and often painful to read, and Heinlein's disdain for women and unflattering asides about gays, Jews and Muslims is indefensible. \\"Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's at least partly her own fault\\" one of the lead characters, Jill, explains to Mike (the Man From Mars). Really? Perhaps if Heinlein's mother, wife or daughter had been raped, Jill would have felt differently. \\"Stranger,\\" written in 1960, hasn't aged well at all and, especially in its 60,000-extra-word \\"original and uncut\\" version, must be viewed today as a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"Alternate title for my review comes from the female protagonist Jill, one of the \\"girls\\" in Jubal's merry household. \\"Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault.\\" p.s. thanks to the reviewer who revealed the ending - now I can quit this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts great, falls apart","review":"This is a review of the uncut version. This story begins very well, and develops as a very intriguing sci-fi thriller, with an unusual sense of empathy.Half way through Part 3. though, it veers into a strange psychological treatise on sexuality, religion, family and cult life and Part 4. is hopelessly meandering, unreal and verbose. I regret reading the uncut version as I'm sure the editing made for an improved version with more focus.It seems as though the author put the book down for a prolonged period of writer's block and when he finally came back, the story went way off course. He should have opted for some swift interplanetary warfare for a much better ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"seriously?","review":"The 1950's gender archetypes are probably the most interesting part of this story. I wish I was Jubal, Front!To his credit, through the character Jubal, Heinlein offers some very thoughtful philosophical musings. However, this book (esp the last third) was really hard to read. Painful, actually.The bottom line is that I cannot \\"grok\\" it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am a very satified customer.","review":"I am pleased to do business with you . I recommend you to anybody. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing I can say is know your statistics","review":"This book was 4.5/5 when last I checked. There is no possible way that if you polled those readers who have read many of Heinlein's other books, or Hugo watchers, or those readers who are scifi specialists with specific tastes -- cyberpunks, techno buffs, socio-political buffs, other-worlders, etc., that you would get past 3/5. Caveat emptor: this book has serious potential to annoy unless you know you like Heinlein's FULL range of novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not have finished except stuck on a plane.","review":"I picked up the book because I was interested in the premise, but reading the book drained any interest out of me. If you can get past the sexism (one female character says 90% of women who are raped are partly responsible) the story is OK. But once it dives off into the religious end forget it. Heinlein has some good ideas but there is so much else to trudge through that I could never suggest someone else read this. I think I read in one review it was one of the few best pieces of sci-fi. If it is I'm giving up sci-fi. Go read Asimov or Gibson."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Way to Treat Women or Maritans","review":"I was very disappointed in this book and I couldn't wait to finish it. I was tempted several times to give up in the middle, but I read so many positive reviews, I wanted to push on to see what I was missing. I conclude that I am not a fan of science fiction, although I love the movies of the 1950s. I found the story line (plot) to be rather confusing. There was too much philosophical preaching and innane comments by Jubal and his cast of players. I felt sorry for Michael and wished more of his character had been developed. The book was very long and jumped to places that didn't make sense to me. Much of the language and attitude toward women is completely unacceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"More then anyone would Suspect","review":"I think it takes more then two times of reading this to understand it... If you think you understood this book the first time you read this your wrong. There is two things in science Fiction, Plot and SYMBOLIZATION. Plot is easy Symbolization makes you wounder and understand more. On every page of this book there was a symbol or a moral... I en courage you to read this until you wear down the pages It took me six times... how long did it take you? There is no reason to disagree with me. If you haven't read this book in three years you need to read it again. Look I dont even know the half of the morals in this book... Stranger in a strange land really is a strange land to the normal human and even the smartest human."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it before it happens !","review":"In many books of Heinlein, religious aspects of life are presented.

I didnt care for the second part as much, even though I agreed with quite a bit of it, it still felt preachy. I can handle that type of deal better also, when it is more subtly woven into the fabric of the story. This was just handled a bit heavy handed.Still I can see why it is considered one of the all time greats. This is a must read for anyone who is a real hardcore fan of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stranger In A Strange Land","review":"This is possibly one of the most unique sci-fi/fantasy books that I have ever read. This is coming from a 15 year old who read this book for an English assignment. However, despite your age, sex, etc... I can assume that if you like sci-fi, this will be a find for you. Through Mike and Jubal, Heinlein paints a web in which you will question life as you know it. You will begin to 'grok' new meanings in society and of life itself. I would definately recommend this book to anyone, as long as you don't mind decently sad endings and don't get too uptight about religion. I shall leave you with one of my favorite quotes, \\"Waiting is.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Proselytizing...","review":"I am a fan of Heinlein. Really. I loved some of his other works. But I purchased the audio version of Stranger in a Strange land and found it to be tedious in the extreme. Endless preaching about the glories of \\"Foster,\\" free-love and sex with many, many, available, willing young women (its amazing how these nubile women seem to fall all over the male characters. And the women are all completely unjealous of each other. Where are the harems of men for the female characters?) This novel read like a Gor book. Where is the action? And I don't mean that sort!I also really hated the narration and the monotonous voice the narrator used for Michael Smith. He sounded like a little boy.Overall, some of his other sci-fi is better than this. This book was nothing more than a soapbox for Heinlein to preach his personal life philosophy. I might be able to overlook this, if there was an actual plot as well. Unfortunately, no such luck.

I didn't like it the first time and like it even less now. I have read all of the books by Heinlein and I feel this is his weakest one. Oddly, it is his most popular book with the masses. Less about SF than being preachy and trying to explore sexual mores. I remember this being controversial in the 70's, but it is not even shocking by todays standards. I think it is the frnak discussion of sexual attitudes that has kept this book popular for so many years. Highly recommend you don't read this until you have read the authors many other wonderful novels.

It presents a great concept, but the story is just so poorly crafted. It is VERY sexist, the prose is stiff, and the plot is dull.

I can only praise Heinlein for including the \\"intelligent conversation\\" which takes place after the press conference, where there is a great explantion on why the English language is so difficult to learn. The whole story is just very odd. Do read it though.

Everytime I read it something new emerges to fascinate me and compels me to revaluate my life. This is \\"the book\\" every man, woman, and child in America should read"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ FOR ALL HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE STUDENTS","review":"I was first introduced to this book by my father. This is one of his favorite Heinlein novels. It took me a while to completely understand the meaning, and I'm sure future readings will further enlighten me. I was struck by the unconditional love and kindness exhibited by V.M. Smith in the book. I found his innocence to be delightful. The bond that he shares with Jubal Harshaw by the end of the book is one that everyone should have at least once in their life. This book is a must read for anyone to learn about love, tolerance, patience, and the essential goodness of humanity. It restored in me the idea that not everyone is evil and maybe...just maybe... there's hope for humanity after all. Heinlein was a master at forcing his readers to stop and think what he wrote"},{"rating":"1","title":"it just didn't excite me","review":"This book did not excite or interest it. I got about halfway lost my place and didn't feel like going back. Main problem was that I just didn't care about anybody in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"an overrated, overly cerebral mess","review":"No, I didn't like 'Stranger in a Strange Land'. The story of a human raised on Mars returning to Earth to teach us all love and compassion is, well, almost too sappy and dull for words. To be fair the premise is good, and the book starts off rather nicely. But maybe one hundred pages in the author seems to dispense with any character development or action and simply has endless touchy-feely free love narratives. Honestly, upon reflection I really found this book to be rather awful.Bottom line: a bogus science fiction classic. I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the edge of boredom","review":"A frustrating book, in that it was not a page turner but just interesting enough not to put it down for good. I was on the edge of boredom throughout. Creating interesting, believable aliens is a great challenge for science fiction, which the author finesses by using a human raised by aliens as a central character. Some readers apparently see in this book a philosophical depth that escapes me. I only see it as mediocre entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Heinlein","review":"This is one of the most overrated \\"classics\\" I have ever read. What is Heinlein's trip with pontificating old men? I read \\"I Will Fear No Evil\\" and the \\"old man\\" character sucked in that book, too. The meaningless banter between all of the characters throughout the entire story was really tiring. I was told to read this book by many people, and I am sad to say that this\\"classic\\" really disappointed me. Its not that I find the novel sexist, it's just that, after a while, the story just seemed really stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Re- Reading An Old Favorite","review":"I am in the process of re reading one of my favorites from years Ago. It seems new to me again as I forgot so much dtails of the story.It is funny how Mike, Man from Mars learns to relate to Earthlings, and how the comunications take form.I sure like Heinline, he was before his time, like ayn Rand (Atlas Shrugged)So I wwill pursue my grokking for tonight!!! Thanks Amazon"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"It is a classic. I enjoyed seeing how technology has changed in the last 50 years even religion and social behavior such as smoking.I have read this book several times since the first time I read it in 1970."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite novel","review":"Heinlein has taken a lot of flack for his view of women, but I consider myself a feminist, and believe his advocacy for women remarkable, particularly for someone born at the turn of the (20th) century. This is simply my favorite novel of all time, so I just had to have it for my kindle. The wry commentary on religion, sex and jealousy, government, advertising and mob mentality, all contained in an engaging tale with intelligent, interesting characters still seems fresh and relevant today; the idea of a Martian Civilization may seem far-fetched, but considering that this was written in the early 60's it still strikes me as prophetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyped and overrated","review":"I was sorely disappointed in this book, after hearing about it so much. The religious and philosophical ideas all sound rather contrived and unbelievable. The characters are cookie cutter and unbelievable, and are trapped in the pre 1960's gender expectations. The dialogue is terrible - Heinlein tries to make his characters sound clever, but the result is disappointing and unrealistic. Above all, Heinlein tries to shoehorn all his ideas into the book, and it ends up reading like \\"Heinlein's Greatest Hits\\" - look at me! I'm Robert Heinlein. Look at how smart I am!I finished this thing and tossed it down the bin right afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sci-fi classic? Hardly!","review":"I have just about finished this book and I am having immense trouble getting through the last few pages. I, like many others, started reading this book because of its \\"Classic\\"-ness. The following line from the newest Ace version of the book was spoken by Jill, a major female character:\\"Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault.\\"What the heck is that?!?! How could ANY responsible author write such trash?!?! I almost put the book down...into the garbage can, but for some reason I didn't.This book is horribly dated and just oozes chauvanism out every pore. Even the strongest females are weak and subservient. It is disgusting reading a supposed sci-fi author who has been canonized by so many putting out trash like this.Why don't you just give John Norman the Nebula or Hugo while you're at it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"When will we realize that sex is not love?","review":"First off, there is no question that Robert Heinlein could write. He wove words together masterfully, and one has no doubt what Mr. Heinlein was trying to convey emotionally, politically or otherwise. The issue I have with \\"Stranger ....\\" is Heinlein's continual insistence that sex = love, not just part of love. Let's face it, a series of philosophical conversations can be quite stimulating to the mind, but do not create the loving bond between two people any more than a political debate between two presidential candidates. Equally, a series of sexual encounters simulate the body, but does not create this loving bond. There are many other complicating factors in love that one book may not be able to explore alone, like patience, kindness, not self-seeking or proud. Others will disagree, but I did not get the sense that this factors where given importance in this book on utopian love."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"I have had this book for a while but never managed to pick it up and read it until now. I am glad that I did. it is a facinating look at the life of a human without any human influence, a blank page, set to discover his humanity and affect ours. Yes, the dialogue is a bit dated and you do come across some rather labored passages. But the story itself is absolutely groundbreaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"vastly over-rated","review":"Stranger than Robert Heinlein's protagonist is that anyone takes this author seriously at all. Clearly, this is Heinlein's best book, but that is saying very, very little. If you haven't read Heinlein and you think for some--strange--reason you ought to, start here: then stop. (Okay, 2 and 1/2 stars.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak story, naive backdrop","review":"I'm not much of a Heinlein fan, and finally read this book for the first time since it is a 'classic'. In a word, it's dull. While The Moon is a Harsh Mistress at least has an entertaining narrative style and protagonist, Stranger is told in meandering third person. The book cascades from one small-and-easily-surmounted challenge to the next (only the first of the book's five parts has any real tension), with plenty of implied sex along the way. Heinlein's presentation of female empowerment while still treating them like sex objects is creepy. And as always his notion of free enterprise and the self-reliant man is naive at best, self-serving at worst. Smith's adjustment to his human heritage is the book's high point, although it doesn't wear well 40 years later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disapointment...","review":"Having heard so much about this book (even in the cover its dubbed as the most famous sci-fi novel of all time), I was very eager to read it. But I must admit that it wasn't what I was expecting at all. You can divide the book in two. The first part being VERY interesting, but the second part is ... well let's say that I understand why this became a 'classic' in the 60's, but now it just seems a very naive, sexist novel. If you really want to read a sci-fi classic, better stick to \\"Martian Chronicles\\" or \\"I Robot\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking and entertaining","review":"The book does an excellent job an examining modern day society and putting it in terms an alien would understand.The ideas that the alien brings are interesting and decidedly cheery on a better planet. While the book maintains a steady pace of things getting better the book had an awful ending. The only reason I didn't rate it lower on that account was that I'm not sure if the author was trying to make a specific point about death that I just don't understand. Either way I think someone else could and the book is certainly worth your time.The audio-version is great as Jubil literally makes the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It starts out challenging, but becomes \\"mushy headed.\\"","review":"Heinlein is at his best when he is presenting new ideas with hardheaded logic. That is what he does for about 1/2 of this book. He is sharp, somewhat cynical and clever. However, when it comes to Michael Smith and his new way of living, all sharpness and hardheadedness vanish, self deception takes over, and he espouses a nutsy and naive view of relationships that is so far removed from the real world that the Heinlein of the first 1/2 of the book would tear it to shreds. I have even heard it said that the second half was satire and that Heinlein did not mean it to be taken literally. However, the first part of the book is good enough to justify reading it. Arguing with the foolishness of the second part is good exercise for the mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never could see what the fuss was about.","review":"I thought that this book was, at best, mediocre. It is written more or less at about a 9th grade level. The characters don't act like real people, and they are all given to long windy speeches about all sorts of things. The characters are all given to going off on windy, whiny recitations of Heinlein's beliefs on this or that subject. The \\"Jubal\\" character in particular never shuts up. I wanted to shoot him by the time I had finished the novel.Although this book has gotten considerable acclaim from certain quarters, no doubt due to its counterculture message, I personally found it to be a bore. Heinlein has written other, better novels (e.g. Starship Troopers) which offer superior alternatives to this one.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grok in fullness","review":"I love this book. Smiths thought patterns were fasinating. It has the human race pegged. This is by far the best book I have ever read. A must read to everyone. Even if you don't like the book, it will change the way you grok the world"},{"rating":"1","title":"strange...","review":"At first, this book seemed intreasting, but as it progressed it turned dull. It also had some weird themes that were very 60's that I couldn't relate to. It became to preachy, which RH doesn't carry out very well. I wouldn't recommend reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bubble burst","review":"As a youngster in the late 60s, early 70s Heinlein was my muse....until I saw him speak at the 92nd st.Y in NYC in 1972 or so. He was asked why he wrote \\"Stranger\\". His reply? For the money, of course. He was tapping into the spirit of the times..free love, communes, etc. To his detriment, in my opinion. Ah well...life goes on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick of ''Grok\\"","review":"The repetition of the word \\"Grok\\" and \\"Groking\\" made me wacky. \\"I Grok You\\", \\"That's Grok delicious\\", \\"I feel Groky\\".

Sure there are some great concepts but what I would've loved to have known is how much influence this book had on Hippie culture in the 60's. That there would've saved me some time and frustration reading what ended up being one of my least favourite books. Sure my review is quite biased and the book does present some wonderful ideologies but maybe it just hasn't aged well. I still respect the hell out of the book because of how brave it was an how little it held back but I really didn't enjoy it. Sorry, I'm glad most people did and I won't deny its importance however be warned that you may still not like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect for polyamorous misanthropes!","review":"If you think that sex is the greatest achievement of the human race and that the human race is doomed to failure, than this book is for you. Plus, there is so much more:1. It's not really science fiction.2. It is chock-full of pointless conversation.3. It's okay to kill \\"dumb\\" or \\"bad\\" people.4. Organized religion is evil.5. Women exist just to serve men.Plus many, many more great ideas.And, if you act now, we'll send you the uncut version, wasting even more of your time!Order today!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grok it","review":"This story is as relavent today as it was when it was published.We live in a society where moral values are dictated by authority. We are told that things are bad or evil, even if they are unharmful to others.Like much of Heinlein's work, this story is very strong in the first 75% and loses some steam in the end, where he injects the plot with bizarre developments and handwaving. However, the anti-establishment theme resounds many years after putting the book down.Pick up this book, and read it, and keep reading it until you grok it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was glad to be able to put this one down","review":"Wow this book really dragged on. I found it really tedious, and almost didn't bother finishing it. I've read a lot of SciFi and his seems to fall in the pulp area. I read and enjoyed starship troopers and figured I'd give this one a try as it is supposed to be a 'classic'. I was really disappointed.The characters all just mill around this central god like figure with very little direction, feel for the rest of the world, or reader interest. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Do a search on a different author, there is lots of better books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking and amusing ...","review":"I read this book when I was 15 and now, four year later, I find that I still sometimes think about it. The dialogue was exquisite and the ideas, perhaps because of their deviation from most of anything I knew about at the time, made me think a lot more than any other book.This is definitely a classic that must be read, making you re-examine everything from religion, to morals, ethics, and everything in between. But since a life not examined is not a life lived, this is the perfect book to think about those things many of us take for granted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stranger in a Strange Land","review":"I just reread this -- 35 years after I first read it in high school! It still holds up. Even those too young to really understand the hippies culture will be able to 'grok' Heinlein's underlying message. The sweet Valentine Michael Smith becomes the worldy wise \\"Mike\\" in a strange coming of age story that will captivate you from page one. Highly recommended for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more...","review":"I could say that this book has dissapointed me. I expected more.I tried to finish it, but I didn't make it. Soon it became rather boring although the story seemed to be promising in the beginning. Pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science Fiction?I don't think so,but-","review":"I was truly impressed with the insights into humanity given in Stranger In A Strange Land.The insight into laughter is truly thoughtful.The idea behind what and who is truly God might be hard to grok at first,but it can really hit home.The book is highly reflective as social commentary and insight into humanity-but the science-fiction element is relatively insignificant.This is a very good book nontheless,and does what good science fiction writers do...use the science-fiction premise,but provides fascinating human interest while doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Ideas","review":"While the ideas communicated in this book are fantastic (far beyond what people expect to find in things like the Celestine Prophesy and 1984, and Stranger combines these into one)RAH is overly preachy at times, and lets himself explain the ideas a little too much. I personally prefer books where the essence comes across through the action and hidden in the diaglogue instead of it being explained (such as Brave New World.) Still, the concepts are good enough that this book deserves a 9."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Grok or not to Grok that is the question.","review":"I read this book in the company of one of my best friends back in the 60's. Times and ways of living were different then. Gentler. This book agreed with my life stile then. Stranger in a Strange land is how I feel now. The world today is crueler then ever. It would be nice if this book could be regroked by the new generation of the '90s. Thankx Heinlein! grok on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Books In One -- Too Bad the First One is Better","review":"The first half of thisbook is marvelous, with extremely entertaining characters and a suspenseful plot. Sadly, Heinlein is so intent on expressing Michael Valentine Smith's worldview that the second half of the book describes Mike's attempt to found a church based on hippy ideas about free love and the like. The premise is fascinating, but the end is so preposterous that it really degrades the entire work. I don't challenge the worldview (although I don't agree with it), but I am dismayed by the simplistic way in which Heinlein executes it. A good book, but not nearly what it could have been. Of course, I have not read the shortened version -- I have a feeling the editors were correct in the beginning"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't catch my interest","review":"The title was interesting to me, but the book did not capture my interest.

When I gave away my special copy, I bought this as a replacement, only to discover that it was the abridged version. So disappointing, as that was never indicated in the item description at the time (this may have changed since then). If you want the full version, look closely before you buy.

As with any great Science Fiction [this is the rare hard fiction variety], paradigms dissolve to explore humanity, spirituality and other topics on levels normally taboo to mainstream minds.

The original \\"Strangers\\" is a great book, influencing a whole generation. The \\"restored\\" material in this version slows down the story, and its blatant sexism and dialogue are very offensive, dating the book. ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guess I've outgrown it","review":"I loved this book when I first read it as a teenager, and again as a young adult. I have read it now for the 3rd time and I had to push myself to finish. It is true what other reviewers have said about the sexism, I don't know why this did not bother me so much in my youth, but now it is just embarrassing.I thought the philosophy was so deep before, now it just seems silly.Spoiler alert: Mike finally learns how to laugh when he discovers that the essence of humor is pain this is an important step in his personal development and I think it's wrong. I can think of many instances where I have been doubled over and in tears with laughing at jokes or stories that include no pain or humiliation. Another theme in Stranger is \\"how does one define 'man'?\\" Here it's like Heinlein is trying to be profound, but really he just dodges the question. Maybe I should not have read it a 3rd time. My list of favorite books is one shorter now."},{"rating":"1","title":"read the first half","review":"The first half of the book has supsense and suprise. It explores themes and gives an occasional new angle to things, even years after it was writen. Which is a major achievement.But you better stop at page 208, when they have made the president of the world the one to manage Valentines hugh inheritence. After that point nothing much happens, and that it takes Heinlein about 200 pages to write that as well...And then of course, there are those things Heinlein is unincorrigible disenchanting in: having again (!) an old man with a series of beautiful young women adoring him; being able to be a homophobe in a book advocating sexual liberation; perceiving the women at best in indigestable paternalistic way.On the whole this second part of the book gives the impression of being a disappointed old mans day dream. You could easily substitute \\"day\\" with \\"wet\\". But I don't want to be offensive, so I don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Science Fiction. Boring. Couldn't get through it.","review":"Robert A.

These powers, as of page 333, are not explained. There is hardly any conflict in story, and the conflicts that are presented are written with little skill or passion. Smith dispatches enemies in the action scenes by making them disappear without effort. During negotiations, Smith's lawyer steamrolls the opposition. Most of the prose is spent on the author's pontification. At this point, I'm cutting my losses and shelving the book. I'm going back to Asimov to read some real SF."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexist!

The portrayal of women really bothered me (*lots* of references/jokes about cooking dinner & sex).Portrayal of a free-sex society was interesting.Several negative mentions about gay-ness, and while I should write this off to the atmosphere the book was written in, it still really bothered me.Dragged a lot. Obvious ending. Frustratingly over-powered alients, in terms of plot.Sorry if my review offends anyone for whom this is their fav book :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing \\"Classic\\"","review":"As I lifetime reader of science fiction I expected to love this book. Perhaps, being a noted classic, I expected too much from it. Honestly, it was all I could do to keep reading. The incidents throughout I found to be juvenile, predictable and extremely slow moving. It could be that sixty years of progress in the genre of science fiction has made this story seem old and all too familiar. For many of us old movies do not have the same \\"punch\\" that modern ones have. We have different expectations now. The same may be true with books.But it was more than plot that troubled me. I found the style of writing too weak to catch my interest. I still become captivated by the mood set by eighty year old stories by H. P. Lovecraft. This book by Heinlein did not captivate me in any way. Sorry, but I cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not understand this one","review":"I am a HUGE fan of Heinlein and currently in the middle of re-reading his entire collection of writing. I absolutely love most of his works, but I just do not get this one. I find it bizzare, convolutted and twisted.

If I were shallow and had no exposure to the world then perhaps this book would move me as it apparently moved others. I found it tedious and bizarre with little bearing on reality.

I would pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A product of its times?","review":"Someone told me a little about the premise of the book: a man who was raised by Martians comes to earth and navigates our culture here. That sounded like it could be really interesting. I found out it won a Hugo Award, too, so that sealed the deal and I bought it.Turns out, this is just sloppy writing. What a waste of a great idea. The Martians and their society were the best part, but there was precious little of them seen in the book. It was all about monologues about religion and angels talking about Earthly assignments. Oh, and lots of sex with attractive, submissive women. This book made me dislike Heinlein both professionally and personally due to the gratuitous pontifications. I can't believe this is a sci-fi classic.If you are still interested in this book, borrow it from the library before you decide to buy it. I will never be tricked by another book that won a Hugo Award again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever?","review":"This book is a must read. Enough said. If you like Heinlein or not, you need to read this. It is one of the most original, and well written books I have ever read. This is one of those books that will make you truly think. It questions everything about the world, and makes you question it as well. I really love this book, and I would have to say its the best book I've ever read. Definetly worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read.","review":"This book is not for everyone.If you have iron-clad religious and social values that are cast in stone and you can't tolerate new viewpoints on these, don't buy this book.If you'd like to look at our society from the outside viewpoint of a man from another planet, even if you have to re-evaluate the way you look at things, you will enjoy this book inmensly.This book was ahead of it's time when it was published and I dare say it's still ahead of it's time today. So take your time with it and read it carefully. Read between the lines and absorb it all. You may have to read it a couple of times to see all there is to see...If you are going to read only one book this year, read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started off good","review":"The first couple of sections are very good. Of course, you have to suspend disbelief, but this is easy as long as you just redefine mars as a planet in another galaxy or something. Science proved wrong alot of what was written in this book. Stereotubes? The were TV's then. Like a good reader though, I can suspend disbelief and believe that people call the TV a stereo tube.Some where in the second or third section the book turns to complete crap. It becomes Heinlein's reactions to religion and philosophy. Most religions are blasphemed and free love orgies run rampant. The way Mike makes things just disappear has me worrying about the environment and I really don't see what humans are doing know as that damaging. Did I mention this book is sexist. Women are nurses, strippers, secretaries, rites of passage in new religions. The purpose of women in this story is to serve men, even sexually. (...) But every man realizes that this is just a male fantasy.Read something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, articulate analysis of what it means to be human","review":"I was surprised and impressed with the depths to which Heinlein probes fundamental questions about what it means to be human. By asking big important questions from the perspective of someone completely unfamiliar with humanity, Heinlein gets right to the difficult topics and does an excellent job of probing them without getting too bogged down in academic argument. Very insightful, and the story and characters do not seem dated or jaded in any way. It feels as though it could have been written just last year."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best American novels of the 20th century","review":"I do not believe I could possibly review a masterpiece of a literary genius that was Heinlein. It is a novel that should be mandatory reading in schools, among the most worthwhile few days of reading one can have. The book classifies as science-fiction in much the same way one would classify Shakespeare's Midsummer's Nights Dream as fantasy.. It is, as usual with Heinlein, the message that matters not the scenography.Read it, you will enrich yourself. And finally understand that 'grok' word people been throwing around the Internet, since its inception. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A blueprint for left-wing religious cults","review":"The underlying message of this novel is that life is too awful to deal with logically. To be happy, a person has to invent a more pleasing reality and evade any contradictions or aspects of it that can't be reconciled. Lacking the imagination and intellectual discipline to devise such an alternate reality, many early readers sought a place within left-wing religious cults, most infamously the Charles Manson family. Stranger in a Strange Land was the Manson family's blueprint and bible. So influential was Heinlein's work to the cult's development that one of its members adopted the peculiar nickname of one of the novel's main characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Too Bad For Children/A Sci-Fi Primer","review":"A very silly, very simple book with no challenging ideas.

Overnight, the opinion of the possibility of life on Mars went bankrupt:http://mars.astrobio.net/news/article332.htmlLooking past that little idiosynchrocy, the book starts off interestingly-enough, but begins to bog down in the later parts; which, may I dare say, involve a lot of sex and religion (maybe these issues were shockers in 1962, but they are somewhat of a bore 40 years later). So, what we end up with is a lot of pointless religion and sex, finishing with Valentine committing a pointless suicide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"If you're a Heinlein fan and haven't read Stranger, this is definitely a must read. If you haven't yet read any Heinlein, but are interested in doing so, I'd suggest starting with something a little lighter such as Starship Troopers, or even one of Heinlein's juveniles. Stranger is unique, as Glory Road also was, in that Heinlein never wrote anything else like it. It's a good read, get's a little wordy sometimes, but very interesting. I read the uncut version. I had a feeling of impending doom creep up on me about 2/3rd's of the way through, that I just could not shake. Read the book, and you to will \\"Grok.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-time favorite","review":"Question authority. I first read this when I was nine after consuming most of Heinlein's juvenille literature. It seriously warped my religious paradigms and general thinking. It's a wonderful look at ourselves culturaly, theologically, sexually, intellectually, and politically from a totally alien point of view.I have read this book more than any other piece of fiction and will continue to do so. The Fosterites vividly remind me of what I do not want to become as a Christian.\\"Man is the animal that laughs.\\" Do you grok?"},{"rating":"2","title":"we are all strangers","review":"Heinlein's novel about a foreigner, in every aspect, who comes to Earth from distant Mars and discovers both the joys and the sorrows of humanity is incredible. The plot takes the reader on a journey into the very depths of what makes us human. Philosophy, religion, sexuality, interpersonal relationships, love and more are explored down to the most minute detail. This book almost acts as a mirror into which the reader finds themselves looking after reading this masterpiece of contradiction of meanings and persecution of the truth. It is a pool of water that reflects all the horrid and majestic aspects of how man functions, a pool of which we must all drink deeply. Like no other, Heinlein ventures through the very fabric of human society and the cause of human emotions. Never will you examine your fellow humans so closely after reading this, and you never may again. I grok that you yourself will drink of the water, but not now. Waiting will fill."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Stranger\\" encourages reading between the lines","review":"Some of the things in this book are a little outdated...if not somewhat questionable in a realistic sense (as is communism which looks good on paper but has no practical application) but this does not detract from the brilliance of Heinlein. \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" is a wonderfully told story about love and the beauty/tragedy of humanity. Heinlein's use of archetypes makes this book easy to relate to and, ultimately, a timeless treasure. I had read this book in highschool and it is still one of my favorites. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the sci-fi genre but craves a more \\"philosophical\\" plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest work from one of sci-fi's greatest writers.","review":"I read this originally back in 9th grade, when my English teacher had us choose any book and then do a book report on it. I'd been into Heinlein for a while, reading many of his shorter novels, and decided to give this one a try. I was completely blown away then, and still am today, at this book. The philosophical ideas and the religious concepts presented seemed the deepest thoughts in the world to my 9th grade mind -- but these are mixed into a great story that kept me reading more. It's works like this that have kept Robert A. Heinlein in my mind as one of the finest authors of science fiction, and one of the greatest of the 20th century."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't grok it.","review":"Stranger in a Strange Land seems to be Heinlein's personal soapbox for airing his unresolved conflicts about religion, sex and the world in general. Maybe it was revolutionary 40 years ago, but it doesn't hold up very well. It's the Playboy Philosophy meets the Jetsons, filled with WWII and '50s slang and references. Heinlein doesn't talk to his readers, he talks AT them. I'm guessing Heinlein's ideal woman was a really hot overgrown highschool girl rapturously listening to him pontificate. And why do I have the strong impression Heinlein had to be the smartest guy in every room he entered? A strange land, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealized Potential","review":"\\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" started off full of promise, but after about a hundred pages or so it descended into sophmoric \\"philosophy\\" about the nature of love and intimacy. I hate to sound snobbish but this novel is not literature, it's simply popular genre fiction masquerading as a book that deals with the human condition. The premise was actually pretty great, but apparently there was no editor, (for this book really only needs to be half as long), and the \\"message\\" overtakes the storytelling. This will probably be the last \\"science fiction\\" novel I will ever read, and I'll go back to reading what really constitutes literature: Nabokov, Dostoevsky, Baldwin, Kafka, O'Connor, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some people will do anything for money","review":"UGH!go ahead and write to complain. I like hearing from other Heinlein fans. (No I'm not being sarcastic)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy-Handed and pedestrian","review":"This book starts off reasonably interesting, and I had hoped to read a book rife with futuristic politics and personal hubris. But it soon degenerates into a rather mundane diatribe for or against religion--it's hard to tell--and, while I usually enjoy such books that discuss these issues, Heinlein doesn't pull it off effectively. Heinlein seems to spend the first third of the book being interesting, then switching to soapbox mode. Such methods do not a good book make.Still, the characters are reasonably intriguing; the three girls and other workers who live with Judal are more fleshed out, in my mind, than Valentine Michael Smith or Jill.This would be an excellent read--if it were about 200 pages shorter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please read an earlier Heinlein","review":"This really is not a very good Heinlein book, probably his second or third worst depending on how you like \\"I will fear no evil\\" and \\"The number of the beast\\". Of his later books only Friday and The Cat are good unless you are a die hard Heinlein fan (which I have been for 30+ years). I just reread Stranger hoping I was too young when I first read it, but it seems even worse now.Stick with the early Heinlein adventures and save these weird ones for later."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I literally had to force myself to read last half of the book. I don't understand how the old NT story can be considered as a \\"one of the best sci-fi books\\" just because Jesus is spiced up with origins from Mars, sexy and has telekinetic abilities.I am sorry I wasted my time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stranger in a Strange Land","review":"Engagingly written, but incredibly chauvanistic and terrifyingly homophobic. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't hold my interest","review":"I only read this book because it is \\"one of the greatest science fiction novels of all time\\". I don't think so. I liked the characters in the story, but it just went on and on... I could not keep reading after the 500th page or so, it did not hold my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"first half o.k. down hill after that","review":"This is the first Heinlein book I read. I really enjoyed reading it at first. The philosophy started off making lots of sense and the story was entertaining. However, halfway thru the book the story line gets rediculously stupid and the philosophy deteriorates to something out of a Barney episode. Still an o.k. read."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT one of the greatest science fiction novels","review":"This is one of Heinlein's more embarassing efforts. He was clearly pandering to the free-love atmosphere of the 60s. I loved and read all of his books as a teenager. I have re-read many of them and have come to see that his thinking was often one-dimensional and predictable; patriarchal and pro-war. However, he had a very creative mind and no matter how bad his books are, they are still readable, and they are definitely better than Star Trek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start then all downhill","review":"I was excited when I began reading this book, but after the abduction of Ben Caxton, it took a 90 degree turn and never came back. Beside the needless minutiae of the narrative, it just shifted from a caper to a religious hodge-podge. There is a good reason no one has ever tried to make a movie of this book. It would be horrible. There are much better books out there worth reading and I found myself just reading to get through it as I felt I had wasted too much time on it as it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding Charles Manson 101","review":"I first read this book while in college, around 1970. It was one of my favorites back then. It became even more fascinating when I read, somewhere, that it was read by Charles Manson as a \\"how-to\\" bible. (Manson's bizzarre story does parrallel this in many ways.So, if you want to get an understanding of where Charles Manson got his inspiration, read this book.Re-reading it was still fun. 30 years had erased most of my memories of the details, so it was a fun read. But this time it didn't feel quite as smooth, and it felt a bit too overtly didactic and preachy. I don't mind a story with a message. but this one comes on a bit too thick sometimes. Of course you get the same thing from loads of other authors. Overall, this should be considered one of the all-time classics of Science fiction, with the Foundation Series, Ringworld, 2001, to name a few."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"I found this book quite enjoyable, and the contents very original. The points that I found it fell short were the following: It wasn't clear on how Valentine Michael Smith came to acquire his talents other than his unusual background on Mars, and the author was somewhat vague on how he actually passed his knowledge onto others. Otherwise it was a very thought provoking book filled with passion. It left me filled with interest from its many implied possibilities about the potential of man, which I think was the intent by the author to convey. It's overall a great book for any Science Fiction fan and it is completely different from the everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, hard to put down","review":"I really enjoyed reading the book. Especially watching Mike grow and mature. I liked hearing the different viewpoints of religion, but I didn't go for the whole sex cult deal. It might have been a tad interesting, but that's not because I agreed with it! Over all, this is the first I've read of his works and I'm impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"this was the only time i can truly say a book changed me","review":"this book, along with heinliens other books, \\"i shall fear no evil\\" and \\"time enough for love\\" were truly the only peices of literature that i can say changed me, my philosophies and my life. and im only 15"},{"rating":"2","title":"SIASL RULES!","review":"I myself am a personal Heinlein fan. I have read all his books. Stranger in a Strange Land is a classic book to be treasured for all generations. It makes people think for themselves, and not fall into the system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off great but...","review":"I absolutely was hooked for the first 2/3rds of the book...But by the time I was 2/3rds of the way through I was getting very tired with the author on his soapbox beating up organized religion. Heinlein's preachiness (sp?) is the same reason why I didn't like Starship Troopers. The author doesn't know when to stop and realize his point is taken.Granted I read the unabridged version so some of the content others wouldn't have been burdened by I did get burdened by.I was disappointed because I felt the beginning had lots of suspense and intrigue but then the book eventually took a turn towards seeing see how a person can \\"restructure\\" (degenerate is a better word) their moral behavior in an immoral world.Therefore, I didn't love the main characters by the end because there wasn't anything left to like about them.My two cents worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"...despite ugly flaws","review":"I liked Stranger in a Strange Land. I guess I take the bad with the good. Many people have written about the sexism, homphobia, and overbearing machismo of Heinlein's writing. I couldn't agree more. These flaws make it difficult to recommend this book, but I still do. What Heinlein does is ARTICULATE his ideas. He does this extermely well, making him more understandable than many sci-fi writers. Heinlein uses Jubal Harshaw to help make concrete sense of Mike's ideas, which are,(admit it), more sophisticated than \\"free-love->sexism->fascism!\\". The essential point of the book is easy to grasp, and although the pretense and arrogance of the author aren't much fun, any strong minded person need not feel threatened by these problems. The book is good for it's ideas more than its execution. Give it a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent","review":"I really enjoyed the first 2/3 or so of this book. It was entertaining, thoughtful, good-old science fiction. But then the book suffers a huge shift in tone. You just shouldn't introduce angels and a bunch of pseudo-religious nonsense that far into a book. To me, it was about as jarring as switching from third to first person in the middle of a novel. I can't help but wonder if Heinlein wrote the beginning and the end of this book at different times."},{"rating":"2","title":"really smart","review":"What i enjoyed most about this book is how much it's made me think about interpersonal relationships. It let me the reader see how our culture appears to alien eyes. I found it fascinating and very enteraining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"This book fails to dig deeply enough into any aspect. If Heinlein is trying to showcase the philosophy (and the taste offered is interesting) he needs to focus on it instead of just giving us glimpses. If Heinlein's trying to entertain us, he needs to have more of interest happen. If he's trying to explore the characters we need to see *inside* them more.My impression from reading this book is that someone had taken a great novel, cut a thin slice from it, and published it separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"How is this book the greatest selling Sci-Fi novel?","review":"Of the Sci-Fi books I have read (and this is including the 60+ pathetic Star Trek novels I have read) this is one of the worst. One half of the book is an interesting Sci-Fi action adventure. The second half is basically a dime-store Harlequin romance novel. I think that what happened in the second half of the novel is that Heinlein decided that it would be better to appeal to the newly rising sex-crazed pop-culture of the 1960's, than come up with a creative ending. Yeah, it is great to think that sex is one of the greatest things in the galaxy, but if it is, my god we have some problems to face up to. I really hated the fact that Heinlein made the main character be a combination of Jesus Christ, a golden retriever, and Don Juan Quixote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the original version, not this crashing bore","review":"It's impossible to give any version of Stranger a 1, but this comes close. Years after Heinlein's death, his widow agreed to allow the unedited manuscript to be published, proving once again why there are editors.This is a slow, plodding read mainly due to the much expanded pontifications of Jubal Harshaw. Cynicism only works in small doses, and 10 page off-topic rants will dull the story for any reader.Judging from some of the reviews here, this is the only edition some people have read. Pity. The original book won the Hugo and is a first-class novel. This is a poor first draft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stranger In A Strange Land","review":"This isn't your normal sci-fi novel from the 60's. It isn't little green men coming out of pie shaped tin cans, asking in broken English for the nearest leader in the vicinity. This book creates it's own philosophy of big money society, and our culture in general. It holds a mirror up to our faces and says, take a big look, and get your priorities strait.For a book written in the 60's it's incredible modern (I had some trouble with it's sexiest male characters but...) it had a sophisticated ring to it.Before you commit to this book you must realize that it's going to be very involved relationship, and you won't want to break it off, it's a big let down when the book ends, and you realize that there is no more to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adolescent fantasy, adult themes","review":"Stranger in a Strange Land was and is Heinlein's most controversial work. It was written at the beginning of the end of his career, when his protagonists were created using cookie cutters. Still, for its assessment of religion(s), Stranger had no equal in any literature, before or since.Read as a story, Stranger is a tale that gets started on the right track but ends up following a tangent into adolescent fantasies about sex, riches, and hedonism. Read as an analysis of religion, the story remains a classic social commentary by one of the more capable commentators.If you want moving science fiction, read Heinlein's The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. If you want one of the novels that moved science fiction, read Stranger in a Strange Land."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks!","review":"Empowered by a keen awareness of a pantheistic universe, our hero creates a utopian cult that engages in sexual orgies and cold-blooded murder. Goodness is doing what you want, love is essentially selfish, and humor is another word for nihilism. No thanks! For another (better) take on the encounter between innocent Martians and humans, try _Out of the Silent Planet_. For real love, try _Les Miserables_. For insight on humor, try _The Screwtape Letters_."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is this??","review":"When I saw this I couldn't believe my eyes. Two legendary figures on a music CD. Chico Marx, the piano playing Marx brother and Desi Arnez the Latin rumba king! The music is vintage and such a find. I never saw or heard anything like this before. A theme dinner was in order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of choppy","review":"I thought this book could have been put together better. It's not terrible, but could have been a lot better. Nia Sebastian is a workaholic. She puts her all into her career and tries to put out of her mind the love she had for Brett Faulkner. Brett Faulkner enters her life after five years going by. Brett unexpectanlty rekindles the romance they once shared, but things are interrupted when Nia's mentor and close friend is suddenly murdered. Again, it's an interesting book, but you will get lost if you don't pay attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewer in that this book was hard to follow. The storyline jumped around a bit. The scenes never connected, which in turn made me feel disconnected from the book. I couldn't get into the story and finally I just had to hurry through it to get finish with it. It's not a bad book, but there have defintely been better ones by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"KOHLER K-3183-NA Undertone Extra-Large Undercounter Kitchen Sink","review":"The sink was exactly as was stated in the description.

This author did just that--she wrote them down! Quick and an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extraordinary gift!","review":"I bought this book after reading a review someplace else and was so glad I did. It's just a lot of fun to read, in fact, I've found that since I finished it I'll pick it up and flip through it because it always brings a smile to my face. It's full of ordinary things from the author's life, but it's those simple, every day things we can identify with that makes it so fun. And while it looks like it's a book for young women, I think it can be enjoyed by men as well as readers of any age. It also makes a wonderful gift, especially for hard-to-shop for people on your list."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think the author should write a full memoir..","review":"I wish the author would consider writing a full length memoir using some of the themes--or even one of the themes--in this book. It was fun to read and a bit upsetting to read as well. A good amount of different topics with a common theme through out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I got this book because it had many positive reviews. I don't get it though after reading it. It feels more like a novelty book than a \\"real\\" book. There are some clever parts to it, but I don't think I'd buy it if I knew it was more of a novelty item than a real book in which a story of some kind is told, autobiographical, fiction, whatever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book about nothing","review":"People who don't like this book are the same people who didn't understand Seinfeld.

However, there are some of us who find it less than funny, and annoying in a sort of cutesy sort of way. Perhaps this website has more of an interest in this book than other books. Some have noticed that for some reason, every negative review of this book has disappeared from this website after about one day. That's not very ordinary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only A Teeny Tiny Bit Clever","review":"I wouldn't really consider this a book...it's a collection of random thoughts and observations, the better ones realistic and relate-able, the majority just filler to complete a BOOK.

I saw this book in a pile of advanced reader copies and decided to give it a try. I had never read anything by AKR before, so maybe I wasn't used to her style. The encyclopedia idea was interesting, but unnecessary. Some of her entries were funny, or at the very least relevant so I could say \\"Yeah, that makes sense.\\" But a lot of it was purely dull, as it was about her childhood or how much she seems to adore her husband. I wasn't interested. What I don't understand is why she bothered to get this published instead of just reading it to her family and friends- because it seems to me that was who she wrote it for.Anybody could've written a book like this. Maybe not with as much flair and writing ability, but things have happened to everyone. I feel that Amy should now read my autobiography, since I'm no more or less interesting than she is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better after the NPR interview","review":"I am now inspired to consider yet another approach to memoir writing, although I am not likely to actually do the work! After listening to the NPR interview with the author this a.m., I realized how important it is in this multi-media world to capture the attention of as many readers as possible before they lapse into a pointless cruise through the latest releases. So, here's what mine will be like *if I do the work*. The format: a telephone book! Each vignette will be devoted to a person who has entered, departed, lingered, overstayed, or not as yet passed through my life. Addresses and last known phone numbers? Maybe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"While there were few fleeting moments of humor, overall it felt like the author was just rambling her way through the \\"alphabet.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful, and why not?","review":"As a writer who teaches memoir workshops to \\"ordinary\\" students, I will be using this book as an example in my classes. Given our celebrity-driven culture, I often have a hard time convincing would-be writers that their lives really matter, let alone are worth recording on paper. Books like Rosenthal's may not compete with literary essays or memoirs, but they serve a purpose and should not be discounted. \\"Encyclopedia of an Ordinary Life\\" will give others the courage to record the quotidian moments of their days, and there's a lot to be said for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"WANTED to like it...","review":"I'd heard about EoaOL during a recent book club discussion, and it sounded like my cuppa tea -- positive, uplifting, something I'd enjoy. And, at first, it was. I liked the author's lighthearted observations and appreciation of life's simple pleasures. Then, it was like, ENOUGH ALREADY!!! What was initially cute and quirky soon became really boring and trite. I understand that the book's about an \\"ordinary\\" life, so maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree here??? Either way, I found myself hoping that, at some point, there'd be more substance, more take-away, more \\"this is what I learned\\" blah blah blah... but, unfortunately, no dice."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real disappointment","review":"Disappointment of the year. I was quite excited about Krouse Rosenthal's book, but perhaps ordinariness is indeed simply too dull to write about (Tolstoy nailed that one at the beginning of Anna Karenia). Her style is choppy and disconnected, which, she mentions, has never endeared her to editors. It never endeared her to this reader, either. Short as the book was, I was unable to finish it--a rare problem for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this look into the things that make up the modern existance","review":"This quirky, fun little book is all about Amy, the author. Structured like an encyclopedia, with entries on all kinds of topics, Amy's encyclopedia entry covers everything from parking tickets to toast, the deep to the mundane. It is charmingly written and is surprisingly amusing and fun to read.My only complaint is that the structure of the book is such that I didn't really want to sit down and read it for more than a half hour or so, because there isn't really a narrative flow. This would be a great book to keep in the car for those moments when you have to wait for someone or kill a few minutes at a time.That said, the idea is so innovative and it is so charmingly carried out that I'd definitely recommend it. I enjoyed it all the way through, and the way she made the mundane things of life so interesting, gave me some new ways of looking at the mundane things of my own life."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this get published?","review":"I did not, I confess, finish this book, although I did try. I just kept wondering how Amy Krouse Rosenthal (and , more importantly, her publisher) could have thought that anyone would be interested in reading this book beyond the first few pages.It's a great conceit, but isn't the author still supposed to have something interesting to say? I thought perhaps it was me - I'm a bit too old to be impressed by bloggers and their blow-by-blow descriptions of their lives - so I gave the book to a friend who is the same age as the author. Said friend has good taste and hated the book, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Ordinary","review":"A bunch of tidbits about the author's life in alphabelial order.It was exactly what the book claimed to be.I guess I expected the book would give me a new purpose in life or something, but it didn't.And there were some funny parts, and parts where you think to yourself, 'wow, I do that too!'.But overall, it just didn't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this if you want to know why you should not purchase this book.","review":"Ok, I bought this book based on the recommendations I had skimmed over on Amazon. I can barely turn the pages any longer as the book is beginning to feel like an unbearable reading assignment. I can understand that Amy Krouse Rosenthal would like to believe that after she dies someone will remember her. (The small idiosyncrasies that make a life, etc.) That's what your children are for. What could have been a wonderful and innovative idea turned into a stale, mind numbing read. All of the small clever thoughts you have are not original and perhaps should stay right where they began.. in your notepad."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...?","review":"This book does not make any sense nor does it serve any purpose. It's not not even remotely entertaining! I recommend \\"The Meaning of Life\\" by Bradley Trevor Greive instead. It's inspirational, funny, and so very clever (unlike this book)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I- Interesting, Surprisingly Quite","review":"I came across one of the \\"purposefully left books\\" at a used bookstore in Chicago. I knew nothing of the book but (I have the hardcover), loved the cover and unique half-book-jacket, so tossed it into my basket. Quirky and surprisingly quite interesting, it was a great book to read in short spurts of time. Sometimes it's easy to think that ordinary life = boring. Amy proves otherwise- that great fun can be had with the seemingly mundane. Amy certainly celebrates it, and her creative take on the little things in her life makes for a memorable memoir and one I'll be passing on to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I saw an interview with the author somewhere, don't remember where, and she seemed so interesting and her description of the book was, too. So I ordered it, not knowing that in a few months I'll be taking a scrapbook class based loosely on her book!It's almost stream of consciousness in alphabetical order.I especially liked when she pointed you to another entry; it was fun to go there, read it out of order, and then return to where you left off reading!She simply entered a few words, a few sentences, a few paragraphs about different ideas, situations, events: Wallet, Stolen, for instance...It was fun to read and a quick read, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the partial image of a ghost of a story","review":"I am a simple man. And when I read a story, I would like to have the entire story before me, and not be forced to go to the internet to find the rest of it!!!!!!!This volume, incredibly, omits the third and final chapter of \\"A Jolly Corner\\"! It was an intersting experience, accidentally, because reading it without the last chapter made one confront the basic construct of the tale. It seemed incomplete after chapter two, but complete after chapter three. What was the missing element? The female character of absorption and empathy. So, I am glad that the compilation is a complete disaster, as it forced me to confront what this particular short story is really about: female human-ness vs male ego driven self-delusion.\\"Washington Square\\" is the only truly great work in the collection.

I also could not get a handle on how it can be applied. This is not a practical guide to Eclipse. It is more about Eclipse's internal design which for most people is a waste of time. The online documents are more useful.Note the book is also out of date. I tried to follow some of their sparse examples, but I quickly realized it's a waste of time because I have the latest Eclipse 3.11 installed and the examples were for Eclipse 3.0 and the menu options and API have changed.

He shows that everything accelerates implying current misunderstanding of time. It seems that matter moves faster inward and that knowledge brings its parts closer so accelerating everything. We build trains, airplanes, rockets, Internet, etc. and somehow everything goes faster. For insights in this mysterious universal acceleration you may buy also Eugene Savov's Theory of Interaction the Simplest Explanation of Everything - showing that matter moves faster inward in a 3D-spiral way and so it becomes denser inward, dense enough to curve, reflect, create and emit or engulf light. You will be most surprised to find out where this universal acceleration leads us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fast Enough","review":"Gleick's slim little book about the quickening pace of...well, everything...turned out to be surprisingly tedious. The book's main drawback is that it's nothing more than a collection of loosely related anecdotes: how airline scheduleing software optimizes plane routes, how call switching programs handle zillions of calls, how movies are compressed into MTV-like bursts, how modern audiences can't sit still for a full symphony, etc. (If lists like this actually interest you, you might like \\"Faster\\".) While there are plenty of discreet observations of quick \\"stuff\\", there's almost no analysis to speak of, no discussion of the implications of this increasing quickness or speculation on where it might ultimitely lead.The writing style is largely glib and ironic, offering the reader little substance to chew on.

The only limitation is it does not tell the street name - but it really does not matter to me (I just turn left in 100 feet). It had one free map software download included. Unfortunately, I could only pick North America or Europe software, and not both. I chose the North America - since I would use it more (it took awhile to download even with fast internet connection).

Garmin won't even reply to emails requesting additional information on the unit's capabilities.So you'll pay better than a hundred dollars for a highly capable electronic device and--if you're the curious type--you'll spend a fair amount of time wondering how to make it perform its tricks.For my money, I'd rather have a well-written manual.

The mapping is great and points of interest are good, but rememeber that Italian locations are not always translated the same IE; \\"leaning tower of Pisa\\" is actually \\"tower pendentta. The other thing you never want to do is hit \\"shortest route\\" when in Italy!!! You will end up driving curvy mountain roads and maybe end up on a goat trail.

For twice the price of my dead unit I found an item that was incomplete, harder to use, and didn't have features that I considered extremely useful.I call it incomplete because to register the unit you need a USB cable that is not provided--after much frustration I discovered that the USB cable sent with the Tom Tom worked with the Nuvi.Two extremely useful Tom Tom features that are not on this Garmin are the map-correcting feature and the 'demo' feature. The demo feature allows you to 'test drive' the route at high speed with actually moving--the unit does the turn by turn as you watch. The map-correcting feature allows people to add/change/delete map items (like Gas Stations) on the map and upload them so others can download them for free without waiting for a new map to be published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go for newer version","review":"My older GPS behaved as nuvi 255 though it was marked as nuvi 250.

There are good maps and it finds reasonable routes. Recalculating works OK too. But if you know that it can perform better you will likely prefer improved model.BTW: we looked for some places in Czech Republic (Europe) and it looks good even though Garmin writes that the map coverage is not complete.

That was at a time that gas prices was well over $3 a gallon, so we felt that we most likely paid for the Garmin with the gas that we saved with it's route calculations.I only gave it a 4 star due to one small flaw we have found. Twice, we have programed an address and when we arrived at our destination, the business had moved. I am not sure how often business places are updated, but that was somewhat of an annoyance. The Garmin did take us there, the information just had not been updated from the business...we went to the old address instead of the newer one that opened about 8 mos. ago.Otherwise, this is a great product and was a fantastic price from Amazon.com.

Third, it has a slightly better display. Finally, it mounts on the window a little more easily.

It does get confused soemtimes, especially around large highway interchanges where you have parallel roads and multiple exits. The single biggest complaint I have is the touch screen keyboard. Garmin... PUT A QWERTY KEYBOARD INTERfACE!!!!!!!!!!! Typing in locations using an alphabet interface absolutely sucks!!!! I have looked for a way to re-confgure and try to change it but could not find any options to do so. As others prior to me have commented, the documentation is really marginal. Garmin if you are trying to save print costs, at least put something a little more in-depth up on your website.

Typing in an address (whether it's in Italy, Denmark or Washington D.C.) is fast and accurate. It's preloaded with a suitable amount of points of interest.The screen is incredibly clear and the instructions are easy to follow. The relatively small size of the screen is no problem at all.The navigation worked very well, no serious problems have been found. I've tested it in the US (east coast) and in Denmark (Europe) no problems anywhere, only a slight dificulty in accepting a high occupancy vehicle lane in the middle of the road (the computer figured I was going in the wrong direction!) but that was no problem in pratice.It's a simple, foolproof navigator that works well; not many fancy extras but who needs that? Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin 270","review":"This is my second Garmin unit, first was the 330c. Both are great units and user freindly and accurate.

GPS directions were confusing in 30%. Sometimes GPS advised to exit highway just 80 km before destination point or just was showing car off road between mountains. Once we made a complete loop following directions and had to start over. The most curios case was on the one lane old bridge when GPS pushed on us to make u-turn immediately but was agree to drive straight ahead another 30km just one minute later ...Finally, my Nuvi 270 died in 40 days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Nuvi 270 - the species continues to evolve","review":"20 months ago I bought a Garmin 330 c. I was amazed at the simplicity of the user inerface and the map info that it contained. It was clearly superior to Tom Tom and Magelian products that my friends have. In Quebecs's remote Gaspe Penninsula it detoured us onto 12 miles of logging roads when the primary route was closed and took us accurately tword our destination - Matapedia. Downside of that unit was time to find satelites. This new unit is slimmer, finds and keeps satelite links better, and contains all of North America and Europe for half of what I paid for the old unit. What I gave up is 20% shorter battery life (still 6 hours) and external volume control. My daughter gets the old one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nuvi 270","review":"I bought this nuvi mainly because my wife is from Germany and I always have a terrible time navigating around these towns. I didn't want a unit that I would only use for a few weeks a year when we are in Europe so I sought out something with a database in the USA as well.This is a simple unit. It doesn't upload traffic or current construction delays. It doesn't play music. It doesn't bluetooth. It doesn't play videos. It doesn't wash your socks. It just navigates and it does it very well.We travelled all over Germany, over to a small town in Poland, back to northern Germany, over to Norway (and all over the country), and then back to Germany. It found everything without a hitch. It even found these obscure little dirt roads in the wilds of Norway. Took us directly to airport terminals and ferry terminals.

We kept having \\"Fatal Errors\\" which required a complete reset, so we returned it to Wal-Mart. We bought the Garmin Nuvi 275 and have been completely happy with it. It seems to be much more user friendly. The menu system is much better. We used it extensively on a recent vacation to California. The only thing we miss is the text to speech which the Navigon had. The Nuvi talks but does not pronounce the street name - it just says \\"turn left\\". We bought the 275 because it has Europe maps built in and we plan to use it on trips to Europe (it will be wonderful over there!).Overall, we are very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"We purchased this Garmin because we were going to take a driving vacation through parts of Canada. It worked beautifully and we would have been lost without it. It was necessary to update the software when we first received it and it took a very long time -- even with a high-speed internet connection. The one thing we aren't really happy with is that it can only be updated for about 3 months -- after that it can't be updated for free. With the speed with which companies go in and out of business, and the way roads change, etc., it will become outdated before too long. However, the price was very reasonable and it works like a charm!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Nuvi 270 3.5 inch portable GPS Navigator","review":"I bought this item for my husband for his birthday and it does every bit it says it will.

It was reliable, except for when we started our trip in a city. The device had a hard time finding the satellites when we were in the city, so not helpful in getting out of or around the city. Otherwise, when it did have a signal, it was mostly correct. Although, when we would alter our route, it was stubborn about recalculating based on our new route and wanted us to go in its original calculated direction. To much recalculating, recalculating, recalculating, and re-booting to make it recalculate properly. These frustrations aside, we would have had a hard time without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the money","review":"It is worth the money, have found two roads in North Carolina that have been open for two or more years that are not on the Garmin.

While it has no documentation, it seems fairly easy to use. Since I haven't gone yet, I'm unclear how it will perform in Europe BUT I already have a major gripe that it has no way (as far as I can tell, and the enclosed documentation gave no help) to plan routes before you arrive in Europe. I was trying to plan distances from hotels and restaurants, to museums and cities, and while you can see a detailed map of these foreign locales, there is no way of plotting a route!!! I cannot find a way of entering a starting point!!! This is pathetic!!! Even Yahoo Maps on my Blackberry World can do this.

Sometimes it gets confused about where I am but that's usually only in the beginning. Make sure you give it enough time to acquire satellites if at all possible. I like how you can set Home in the favorites so it only takes a couple of presses instead of a lot of fumbling around to get home. I highly recommend the Garmin nuvi series. Amazon has them for an untouchable price currently. I have no doubt they'll go quickly. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value for the money","review":"The Nuvi 270 offers both U.S. and European maps and the opportunity to update one or the other is included in the price. We have used the device in the U.S. and while it occasionally gets confused when you stop for lunch or gas, it is easy to restart when you get back on the road. It got us to the door of everywhere we programmed, even if we would not have chosen that route. For the money, highly recommended.

After looking into all the Garmin models and reading reviews I decided that I need the Garmin 200.

I found this one the 270 which has additional maps for Europe, which I do not need, but ships at a lower price than 200.Here are my pros:1. Simple barebones GPS unit2. Good routing3. Small and sleekCons:1. Slightly expensive than the Tom Tom but this one has better routing than the Tom Tom which has some problems in my area.Bottomline:I would recommend the Garmin nuvi 2xx series.

Normally, I would have gone through the trouble of printing maps off of Google however, I decided to purchase a 270 instead. Amazingly Amazon was the best deal out there. I orderered the GPS, a charging cable and a bean bag type mounting kit. If you are planning on using this in rental cars, the garmin bean bag mount is the way to go. It packs flat when you remove the stand and never slid from its spot on my dash!So, how were the maps? To tell you the truth, I was a little apprehensive to buy a Nuvi because I had such a good experience on my last trip to the UK when my rental car came equipped with a TomTom. The nuvi 270 work like a charm and also has maps of the USA to boot!I highly recommend this unit, it's not much larger than a deck of cards and I pack it in my laptop case when I travel so I always have it handy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninformed","review":"This GPS will get you to where you are going, but this was the first one i have bought so i didn't know what i was looking for.

My lovely wife Stacy is often skeptical of gadgets and has a very good sense of direction. She usually navigates as I drive. The first time I used my Nuvi 270 with Stacy in the car, she became very quiet and even sullen in the passenger seat. Seems there was a \\"another woman\\" in the car who was providing direction instead of her. I think she was jealous! Now I use it seldom when Stacy is on board, and Stacy has adopted the other woman's voice when she says, \\"In point one mile, turn left.\\" or \\"You have arrived at destination on right.\\" So, be forewarned. Otherwise, the Nuvi 270 works fine and gets me where I need to go almost as efficiently as Stacy does."},{"rating":"2","title":"US AND EUROPEAN MAPS","review":"I bought this because it was about the lowest cost way to get both US and European maps in a compact, travel-friendly package. I am not displeased. It does basically what is it supposed to do. I was able to download and install the latest European map update free through the Garmin website and it worked like a charm. Considering the steeply discounted price, this is a great product dollar for dollar. Be aware that it does not have all the features of more expensive models, but the GPS guidance works and the maps appear to be as accurate as the built-in GPS in my Honda, with maybe just a slight bit of lag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great here in the us and europe","review":"I bought two, one for me to use here in the us and the other for my brother to use in europe. I think it is very precise, very easy to use and best of all very cheap as it has the europe map integrated (which was a must for me as I travel to europe every now and then).

But that is not why I gave it 2 stars I would not care if she was all black or latin or ect.... I gave it 2 stars because you can not change a comic characters orgin this much and still think people will come and see it. Granted Catwoman has changed over the years but somethings have always stayed the same She is a catburgler with no super powers.

Anyways it is going to be better than the Batman movie with Catwoman because this movie is only about catwoman and as always it tells how she came to be the catwoman. Halle Berry is excellent for this movie and so is Sharon Stone. So it might me a good movie.Catwoman was a worker at a company that makes skin lotion but when she uncovered a dirty secret, she was thrown off the balcony and was killed. Somehow the cats brought life in catwoman again and gave her strenght, agility, and better sight. This is the story of Catwoman.

I'm sure the director Pitof would like to know.Positives: Halle Berry has one of the prettiest faces and figures in film today. You'll probably watch the movie from beginning to end for that reason alone. Benjamin Bratt is terrific as Tom Lone, police detective and love interest to Patience \\"Catwoman\\" Phillips and Frances Conroy (Ophelia) provides some much needed depth and occult mystery to the plot as the historian and guardian of the Egyptian Goddess Baast and the \\"Secret Society of Catwoman.\\"Negatives: Sub-par special effects, silly plot and a little too much S&M; motif in the choice of costume for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"greatly inspired me (to write a review)","review":"At a time when comic book movies have actually found some substance, \\"catwoman\\" is clearly a step--a plunge in the wrong direction. I was rooting for Berry, and was hoping for a good action flick, it is a comic book movie after all. What I found was sorely disappointing on various levels.To begin, the movie does not even come close to following the comic book ethos but more importantly it is so predictable and cliche-riddled it makes it barely watchable. I found myself flinching at various ill-directed scenes. The French director, a self described \\"master of digital photography\\" is clearly confused on how to re-make an ultra-hip urban catwoman. The cheap attempts at substance, like explaining the empowerment of women through catwomen in history is almost laughable if not so insulting to one's intelligence.

Really, she was following in the steps of the lovely Michelle Phieffer, Eartha Kitt, etc. These women were sexy as Catwoman and they were vicious. More importantly, they seem to do it effortlessly.

That's a big no-no, especially if you're a nobody.

It's definitely a girl power flick. It was fantastic to finally see a female super hero/ heroine type in her own right, not an appendage to a bat. What's up with all the negative reviews? Perhaps it intimidates people or maybe they are too stuck on the original to move on, whatever the reason the critics are WRONG!

I had low expectations going in, because of the bad reviews, but I was pleasantly suprised. Halle Berry was terrific as Catwoman. She was sexy and confident, moving and walking just like a cat. The leather outfit and the whip were both wicked fun. Sharon Stone was the perfect villian. A great blend of beauty and the beast. Benjamin Bratt was a very nice addition with his great smile, smoldering eyes and his kind, softspoken manner. This movie was taken way too seriously. It was meant to be fun and lighthearted, a fantasy. Some of the dialogue was a bit cheesy, and the digital animation could have been better, but overall, it was a enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catwoman smells like three week old cat litter","review":"You know the movie is going to be good when you want to watch the special features first. Every critic said this movie was awful and for once the critics got it right. From start to finish (and you are waiting for that finish), this movie stinks worse than kitty litter. With that said, it does have a great documentary on the history of Catwoman and how she has evolved in the comics, tv and movies. I am a comic fan, but that isn't why I hated the movie because I have always loved movies more than comics. I hated the movie because it was God awful and should have never seen the light of day. Why Bratt took a role in this thing I have no idea. Maybe he just wanted some screen time with Stone and Berry. I don't know how this movie got made, and I just pray we won't have to see Catwoman 2: Back in the Litter Box.

Catwoman is a dark character, not a camp, badly scripted joke. Her outfit is ridiculous - as if she could jump around with that horrific ensemble on \\"certain things would pop out\\" not to mention she has four ears. I am so glad that they changed her name from the comic book character Selina Kyle which I as a huge Catwoman fan loves. Michelle Pfeiffer played the role of Catwoman perfect in Batman Returns, to think that anyone would even try to step into her stilleto's is a joke, but this film is just a complete insult to the audience. It gives us cat owners a bad name. Halle berry should definetly be put out with the kitty litter, in the end I wanted Sharon Stone to whip out an Icepick and kill her. Do yourself a favour and watch Batman Returns if you want to see the real Catwoman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critics don't know anything at all...","review":"This movie was by no means AMAZING, but it was entertaining. I expected it to be terrible from all the negative buzz it got from critics. It really wasn't all that bad. Sure, the graphics could have been better, but I've watched pretty much every single movie that has been out for rent recently and it stands out as one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halle Berry deserved a better screenplay","review":"The screenplay ultimately sinks this film. While the Catwoman mythology had promise, it never really takes off, and so we're still left wondering why Patience Phillips (played by Halle Berry) actually earns the title of Catwoman in the first place. It might have been best to make Patience Phillips more psychologically complex--i.e. have the Catwoman transformation affect her in a supernatural, but also disturbing way (as what happened to Selina Kyle in the Batman Returns film). Alas, viewers are treated to cardboard villainry, and lifeless supporting characters. Too bad for Halle."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Word: Bad","review":"The only redeeming quality this movie has is that Halle Berry -- slumming after her Oscar win -- looks utterly hot in her leather Catwoman outfit. Beyond that, this movie is just bad. The plot is hackneyed and the acting is less than quality. I don't know if Halle Berry did this movie for the money, but she \\"acts\\" as if she did. Berry's performace has none of the passion or tortured psychology of this classic Batman hero/villian. The rest of the cast is laughable at best. Sharon Stone proves once again that she is nothing more than a pretty face (and even that is questionable these days); Benjamin Bratt was totally miscast. The producers of this film had the opportunity build upon the excellent portrayal of Catwoman by Michelle Pfeiffer in Batman Returns, but fail miserably. This movie doesn't even compare to the campy performances of Julie Newmar, Lee Meriweather, and Eartha Kitt in the 1960s TV show. Skip this movie, it's just not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat Litter!","review":"This movie had some of the worst special effects I've ever seen!

Avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than I had hoped","review":"When this was first released on DVD I thought that it was going to be another tease the men with a scantily dressed woman. Out of boredom I decided to watch it as I had seen most of the other comic book movies. To my suprise it is now one of my favorite movies. The work that they did on cat movement and Halle's work in mimicing them was a treat to watch and it was a rare treat to see an ancient religious belief treated with respect. I also liked the way the treated the duality of what a woman can be if she chooses and her right to choose. I have recommended this film to all I know who like me are pagan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halle Berry rocks as Catwoman!","review":"Don't listen to the bad reviews! This movie rocks for three reasons. 1) It's as exciting an adventure movie as Indiana Jones. 2) Halle Berry puts on an awesome performance and shows why all the guys love her. 3) The story isn't completely about a superhero fighting the good fight, but there are some good twists to it. It tells a good story that everyone can get something out of. It's better than any Batman movie. The dialogue is well-written as well. Don't judge the movie until you've seen it.

Not because the acting was sub-sub-sub-par. Not because the special effects were weaker than my old N64s. Because they took what was, at best, a supporting character in the Batman mythology and ran in completely the wrong direction with it. What was so wrong with keeping the character a loveable thief? People love anti-heroes. or did you think portraying a black woman with extraordinary gifts stealing would be misinterpreted? Not if you balanced the human drama right. Selena Kyle will always be Catwoman. She was a hooker in her youth, a thief as an adult... but she took care of those around her and saved people from the worse elements that lurk in Gotham City. Now to the general audience she's simply a bad joke. Way to go, D.C. and Warner. No wonder the geeks were screaming when you started production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well....Halle Berry Is In It!","review":"The only GOOD thing I can say about this film is that Halle Berry is in it and that's about it. Not that I am much of a fan of the comic book character but the director took some serious liberties in revamping the character. It's basically NOT the Catwoman from the comic book. The villainous just seems to be a boss whose having a bad day at the office. And the battle with Catwoman seems to border on the goofy. This is great film for the MST3K treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Fans of cat woman would be disappointed. I like cat woman but this movie is awful.

Look, I have absolutely no problem with the main actress having darker skin, Halle Berry isn't that bad of an actress, but the MOVIE is what I have a prob with! The story-line is WEAK!!!!!!!!!

Why didn't she just turn in a jar of the stuff to the authorities or a newpaper organization??? But Berry does look good in her suit. I'll give her that. Stone looks good, though her acting is less than steller. But it looks like everyone agrees that the number one problem with Catwoman is the script. Was this written by a first time screenwriter? Save your money. I caught it on a slow cable night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining, mostly silly and pointless","review":"Unlike X-Men, and to a lessor degree, Spiderman, this film failed to take a comic book character and impart endearing characterization. For some reason Hollywood often forgets that story is supreme, it doesn't matter how cool the characters are.Most of the dialogue in this flick was corny or cliché and pretty predictable, and to be frank, if you want to see gratuitous shots of Halle's boobs, get the movie Swordfish. Nothing here made her character believable or really that sexy, at least in my opinion, and while I think she's a beautiful women, it's hardy enough to base a movie on.In the end, this may be worth renting and watching once, for the curiosity factor, but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother...","review":"If you are a fan of classic comics (as I am) you will want to see this movie just to satisify your curiousity.

Then it only gets worse in the end.I loved both SPIDERMAN movies. I liked both X-MEN movies, DAREDEVIL was ok, and even the first two BATMAN films wern't bad.This is more like the BOMB of the HULK.

Particularly, when they seem to have all the hype, and fall like a big watermelon. Halle Berry truly proved to have all the hype, but falls flat on top of her feet and on her face with Catwoman. To be honest with you, I wasn't even impressed with this knock-off to the Batman franchise that has held well for years. Especially putting Catwoman as a heroine, instead of the popular villianess from earlier in the Batman stories. It really wasn't appealing at all for Halle Berry to take on this role in my eyes. She was much more like her super-heroine character Storm in X-MEN and X2, but not here. This is one I strongly suggest you don't see. Wait until the next real Batman sequel to hit those theaters over this junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that bad of a movie.","review":"Eventhough it completely goes against the Batman Catwoman, if you look at this film as an outside entity, then it really isn't that bad. I had my misgivings about the costume, but in this city, in this storyline...well it does work. Halle is serviceable as Catwoman and Sharon Stone is just plain embarassing as a washed-up model. I loved the scene where Catwoman was cracking her whip in the middle of that techno club. Scenes like that worked because it was able to stand on its own. On the flipside, the CGI effects were awful. It was like watching an X-box game on the big screen. The CGI cat that \\"re-awakens\\" patience was equally terrible and I was a bit bummed that the cat did not stick its head in her mouth liek the one in Batman Returns. In all, not as bad flick...but the true Catwomen are Julie Newmar and Michelle Pfeiffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure trash / avoid","review":"Look I'll agree that Hale looks great as the cat woman but what one fails to realize is that this movie has no relevancy to the comics. What they have done is twisted the Cat Woman myth to make her some type of Egyptian Cat powered herion.

So? I liked the aspect of having Patience, unsure of herself and shy, kind of seperate from the confident Catwoman and having the two come together in the end. The whole Egyptian Mau history was interesting and I liked having it in there. I also loved her feline powers and the way she moved like a cat; kneading the sheets, leaping about with perfect balance, dropping to all fours, rocking her hips, and having that feline agility. The cgs could have been better, but if you ignore that, you can really appreciate the movie.

I do realise that the original Catwoman was African-American, and that was she a prostitute(so Batman Returns while having the correct name and excellent suit, had the background slightly wrong). I don't see how a movie with a character from the Batman comics can 1) NOT be set in Gotham City, 2) not reference Batman, 3) have the wrong name for the lead character.

This movie started off right with it's brief tease of it's originality with scenes of \\"cat woman's\\" origin, but then got lost in the lack of thought in the story line thereafter. Making this movie very predictable and boring. This movie depended on too many special effects and not enough realism to enjoy the characters. Even the romance scene was lacking the animal attraction and chemistry between the two characters, making their romance a very forgetable one. Although, Ms.Berry is a very beautiful and attractive woman, this movie focused more on her sexual appeal in a cat suit instead of her ability to act. As she uses her whip and shows some skin to draw audiences, mainly of the male species, her true ability as an actress is over shadowed.

This character did not recieve her due in the original theatrical release.Until I saw previews for this abomination of a film.Since Eartha Kitt played Catwoman for a stint in the Adam West-era Batman, I am not bothered by the ethnicity of the character. I am concerned about the apparent 360 of the plot.Selina Kyle is supposed to be a lowly executive assistant who eventually snaps and fights back. Nothing I have seen indicates the production crew is reasonably going to live up to the earlier release. It honestly looks like Charmed with fur and a tail.Halle Berry is a good actress, but I must wonder what made her sign on to this train wreck in waiting.

When Catwoman saw the pictures of famous historical figures in the past, I was cheesed off to see a picture of Empress Dowager Cixi with cats, this is a historical inaccuracy as the Empress was a dog person. Please do not make up things about historical figures to 'add' to your 'movie'.

Seeing how Halle Berry trained for the part made me appreciate the performance. She really does behave like a cat, even though some of those scenes are really stupid. Lastly, the Producers nailed the movie they were trying to make.This is the problem with this movie; if you are going to make a movie called \\"Catwoman\\" using the DC license, then your movie must star Selina Kyle. Shame on DC for green-lighting this pic as a major motion picture.

After that, it pretty much went downhill.I'm not knocking special effects in general, but there is a point where too much is too much. And the ones used to simulate her movement were just too much. Crawling all over the walls? Last time I checked, cats do not possess that particular ability. Her debut in the jewelry store was hilarious. We couldn't stop laughing ... and I don't think that's what the director had in mind.If you're looking for a film with a good looking woman in a skimpy costume or enjoy making fun of movies then you'll be happy with this.

I thought I would give it a chance since I am a fan of Halle Berry. There were so many bad things about this movie that I can't even list them all. The acting by all 3 leads is terrible, especially Sharon Stone who basically made a fool out of herself with this role. The dialogue is horrendous and laughable. Catwomans costume is rediculous, and the fight sequences, especially between Halle Berry and Sharon Stone is just laughable. Why oh why would the people working on this fil think it was worth anything. It's terrible. The only saving grace is Frances Conroy who brings some type of life to her role as the one who explains who Catwoman is. I enjoyed her scenes, and that would be it. I highly recommend watching this film just to see how bad movie making can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Berry thinking?","review":"I'll cover the good points first. Halle Berry did a good job considering the material she had to work with. Why she chose this role, I am not sure. Maybe she knew she would look really good in leather. Pratt was okay considering it wasn't much of a role. He was basically a boy toy (or cat toy?) Stone had a horrible role so I'm will not comment on her acting in this movie. How can you act when you are suppose to have a stone face?The bad points are plentiful. The plot was unbelievable. The dialogue was horrendous. The CGI was unconvincing. The characters were silly. The mythology was laughable. At least Spiderman had a good message: \\"With great power comes great responsibility.\\" Catwoman's message seems to be: \\"Don't stand in the way of an independent woman.\\" Morality is ambigious. Independance is key. Oprah and Martha would be proud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmmmm","review":"Well, I rented it for the same reason as any other red-blooded American male....to see Halle Berry in next to nothing. As expected, that was the best part of it. For the most part, the movie itself bored me to death. As a lame bonus, it had that weird, lispy, French guy from the Matrix that I hate. I like comic book/superhore movies as a rule, but this one I could take or leave.

Well, it's hard to say, except that fans of Halle Berry's ass will not be disappointed, since it is lovingly filmed numerous times from a variety of angles. Needless to say, this is very revealing, from a marketing and target audience perspective. The movie also boasts some of the worst CGI in recent memory, as well as Sharon \\"I'm still a beautiful woman\\" Stone flaunting her own luscious butt cheeks, wearing skin-tight pants as often as possible. Various studio mouth pieces and feminists have blamed the failure of \\"Catwoman\\" and \\"Elektra\\" on the notion that \\"Americans aren't ready for a female super hero\\". Boo-hoo. (They're wrong. We just don't want a female superhero movie that SUCKS.)

Once I installed the SIM card and battery and close the cover, I could not make the back cover open again. It took me at least 30 minutes and had two finger nails broken trying to open it. The upper body of the phone is made of some kind of plastic as far as I can tell and it can be easily scratched. I have not even used it and it already has scratches. Based on my experience, I would not recommend this phone no matter what good features it offers. Of course, if you would never need to replace the battery or install a different SIM card, you could consider this phone.

The first time, the camera stopped working and I was no longer able to take any pictures or view pictures that I had taken. I received a replacement and within a week I had to return the replacement. The second phone would not turn on after a week. I had not dropped the phone and there was no abuse to it. I am now on my third phone Motorola C650. We'll see how long this one lasts.Other than the returns, I do enjoy the features and find it relatively easy to use. If I had not needed to send it back, I would give it 5 stars. It is very difficult to open the back cover. I need to use a screw driver. The reception is good at times.

Nice desing, light weight, good screen resolution, easy navigation.Something bad is that in the Phonebook, you cant store more than one number under a especific name, for example, if you have Lauras home phone, and cell phone, you have to store them separatly.

Kenny Burrell was, and is, the master of this style. His touch, tone and rhythmic placement of notes -- all are immaculate. He is joined by Stanley Turrentine on tenor, Ray Barretto on congas,Major Holley and Bill English -- a perfect group. Lots of mid-tempos and minor keys. Sometimes I listen to the \\"Midnight Blue\\" track over and over. I have transcribed most of it, chords and solo lines -- Fm7, Gm7, Abmaj7, Gm7, etc. It takes me to a different place and time. The recording is magnificent, as if the musicians are in your living room, you are lounging at your table 3 feet away, nursing a Tom Collins . . . It doesn't get any cooler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply-Great!","review":"Having first a strong love for blues guitar, it was easy to love this album. This was also my first Kenny CD, and I've bought many since then. Kenny has also become my overall favorite jazz guitarist and that's from serious competition from Wes, Johnny Smith, Joe Pass,Tal Farlow, and other top players. Kenny's approach is just cool, his tone great, and it's also what he doesn't do that makes him great! This album says it all for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blindingly Brilliant All-Time Classic!!!!!","review":"The pairing of Kenny Burrell and Stanley Turrentine makes for music that is as hot as a fire cracker! Without a doubt, some of Kenny's finest moments are found here. Stanley Turrentine lends his talent to cook up those grooves.The opener, \\"Chitlins Con Carne\\", is one of Kenny's best-known sizzlers. \\"Soul Lament\\" is both gently and deeply touching. The title song, \\"Midnight Blue\\" has a care-free and easy feel. \\"Saturday Night Blues\\" features Stanley Turrentine at his best. \\"Gee, Baby, Ain't I Good To You\\" highlights Kenny Burrell at his inspired and awesome finest. There is also a bonus cut, \\"K Twist\\" that was not included in the original album.Kenny Burrell touches music afficienados from all generations. His guitar portrays a subtle exuberance that most musicians envy. Inspired, artistic, and soulful, Kenny Burrell is timeless! Kenny's flawless sound is ageless and color-blind.....his music is world class."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Burrell's best","review":"Kenny Burrell is a great jazz guitarist, but he really shines on blues. This set is a quartet setting with bass, drums, guitar and tenor, and it's all blues in various forms. Stanley Turrentine really shines on this CD, too. If you love great blues, you will love this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midnight Blue","review":"If you happen to be up after midnight, this is definitely the best album to fit into your cd player. Kenny Burrell plays the blues unlike any other guitarist I've ever heard, he's laid-back while still very exciting. The album features Burrell, Stanley Turrentine on tenor sax (this is the best he ever sounded in my opinion), Major Holley Jr. on bass, Bill English on drums, and Ray Barretto on conga. The chemistry between Burrell and Turrentine is amazing, probably partly due to the fact that these two played together on Jimmy Smith's \\"Back at the Chicken Shack\\" and \\"Midnight Special\\". The album is made up of 8 Burrell originals (\\"K Twist\\" and \\"Kenny's Sound\\" are never-before-released tracks) and one standard. The mood that is started in \\"Chitlins con Carne\\" stays throughout all the other tracks, no matter the tempo. Alfred Lion called this his favorite Blue Note session, and for good reason, so pick up this gem right now! rating: 4.5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Blues","review":"Classic blues with Stanley Turrentine on sax.Of particular note, \\"Soul Lament\\", with Burrell playingsolo guitar. \\"Midnight Blue\\", a nice, upbeat number.Burrell has a very nice chord solo on\\"Bee Baby, Ain't I Good To You\\".Both Burrell and Turrentine really cook on theup tempo numbers \\"Saturday Night Blues\\" and \\"Kenny's Sound\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but no match for his 1969 \\"Asphalt Canuon Suite\\" LP","review":"Yes, this is a great cd, esp. the Midnight Blue track. The solo work on Kenny's Soul Lament is also great. However, I must reserve my highest rating to his works on the 1969 verve released \\"Asphalt Canyon Suite\\" LP. That LP is INCREDIBLE, and words alone cannot describe how nice it sounds. Unfortunately, that LP is not released on cd yet :(. And you will have a difficult time finding it.

Now I wish I hadn't--it's too depressing. James Bailey got caught up in the promise of the wave of trendy data-driven learning algorithms like neural networks and genetic algorithms, and the purpose of the book is to gush about them. There's no attempt to place these methods in the broader context of artificial intelligence as a whole, and no recognition of their weaknesses. The book randomly names these methods the \\"new intermaths\\" and analyzes them historically as a radical breakthrough from the traditional sequential, numeric, data-poor human reasoning into the brave new world of parallel, non-numeric, data-rich silicon reckoning. He's partly right about that, but I think it's a coincidence; the book's argument is so muddled that it doesn't reach any convincing conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring, trite example of compu-mania.","review":"Mr. Bailey is another unfortunate casualty of our age's love affair with the computer. Don't get me wrong; computers are very useful things indeed.

I was surprised and fascinated that in most of the cases, the teammates really didn't have a second thought on their fellows' sexual orientations. In my day, about 6-8 years ago, it was very much different. I don't know how much times change where I live, but I wouldn't be surprised if the climate in the locker room is a bit more tolerable for gay athletes.My one problem is that many of the subjects being interviewed were asked that their name be changed or their last name not be used. This indicates to me that they are still very uneasy about their openness towards their teammates and perhaps still a bit ashamed that they came out in the first place. If your friends and teammates do not judge you by your sexual orientation, then in my opinion there's no reason to hide your identity behind a pseudonym.Good read still. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea, but not a very good book.","review":"I give credit to Dan Woog for undertaking such a project and writing this book. Unfortunately, good intentions don't make for good reading. The book misrepresents itself. It's strewn together in a haphazard fashion. Nothing ever gets tied together. The title is a bit misleading as well. I bet many people would see the title and cover (with a half-naked gay porn star in football jersey) and think it is a book about erotic encounters with athletes or something. Well it's not.

DO NOT BUY this book if you expect to be entertained in any way! The book is a boring compilation of coming-out stories, I only read it on the metro, so that I don't get a hard-on... It is probably a good source of information about coming out as an athlete and if there is someone in the closet and plays sports at school or something - this may be a useful read.

If you haven't, buy something else (even the V300 is a lot better than this)."},{"rating":"1","title":"whan they build it thay didnt think","review":"i have purches that phone 2 month ago after i got use to use the sony t610. the sony was keeping my wireless bluetooth wireless device connected just fine but the motorola like to drop the connection and is unreliable.whan the bluetooth is connected you dont have much choices for ringtones, it is eather loud or not loud -- thats the choices.from tine to time the connection to the bluetooth will be lost and i have to restart the phone.also the software is very confusing even for me that im very good with computers.it happent to me that whan i want to dial using voice dialing and i didnt say anything it will dial someone.talk time is very good.the camers takes nice pictures.i have purchase the v600 because of the features but next year whan my contract end i will look for another phone not from motorola."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid phone and feature","review":"If the primary reason you buy a cell phone is to use it as a cell phone (and not for photos, mp3s, text messaging),then this is a rock-solid phone. The operating system and user interface are both good and operate well, the user interface in particular is very user-friendly and intuitive. The photos are fine. It has bluetooth.I dropped it many times, but it still worked fine. Plus it looks very slick too, many people have commented on its cool appearance.The one downside for me is that the phone is a bit heavy. It's not a thin and light Razr."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good phone","review":"In total I had to return my phone 5 times for 5 different reasons.

I am now on my FOURTH V600 and I've been using this phone for 3 months now. Thank god for T-mobile support, they exchanged the phone every time and overnighted me a new one. With any other wireless carrier, owning this phone would be a total disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time! Love T-Mobile, Hate V600","review":"I am currently on my replacement V600 which is now acting up. The first attempt at this and the V600 stopped taking a charge. Sent it back and got a new one. The new V600 is now randomly shutting off, loosing connections, and not recognizing my SIM. T-Mobile is doing what they can to help me as I love T-mobile, but hate the V600. Luckily the V600 is still under warranty so a return is in it's future, and another phone will come to live with me.The pictures I took with it turned out fine, I loved the BlueTooth connections, and when I could use the phone there were no connection problems. The hardware is the problem and I can't or won't waste more time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slick looking but unreliable","review":"I got this as a Christmas present and it was amazing out of the box, but as the months have passed, it has developed annoying personality quirks that make it unreliable. The operating system locks up frequently, forcing me to remove the battery and turn the phone back on. The outside display breaks up and has to be restored by turning the phone off then on. The Bluetooth connection to my wireless headset will mysteriously drop out. The button response is often slow. And the voice recognition for voice dialing isn't very good (I never use it).I have to say the camera is actually its best feature, taking very decent photos and the zoom works pretty well. All-in-all if it were stripped down and made more reliable, it would be an excellent phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"a swing and a miss","review":"It is not a very good cell phone. I actually get to work with dozens of different cell phones every year and this one, as much as I'd like to recommend it because it a US manufacturer and a very well constructed device, is just not very good as a phone. It drops call easily, fails to receive calls reliably, changes ring modes spontaneously, and the operating system is not very pragmatic. For example, the called number history and received call history are each limited to ten numbers, sure it can download and play video wonderfully, but to limit the call history to 10 calls is short-sighted as I personally find that allocation of memory a little more useful. Similarly, the camera is well done, and the bluetooth is a nice feature, but the menu system cannot be navigated with just the directional arrows, expect to have to use no less than 7 buttons while driving to call someone back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly designed","review":"A lot of bugs and problems. I had my phone exchanged 2 times because it kept hanging up on all incomming calls. Come to find out, the case (all cases I have tried to date) make the flip out lid extend to the point of answering if not careful when unclipping from holster, so if your not careful, you will hang up on your call by mistake (now I carry the phone with no case in my pocket). The phone is bulky. The top LCD screen keeps on getting distorted, I have to turn the phone on and off. The phone buttons have a very, very slow responses time and I have dialed the same numbers over and over in a hurry. The buttons on side of the phone are too sensitive, you can by mistake set it on silent mode (this happens ALL THE TIME!). And the most annoying issue on top of all others is that even if you delete your voicemail, the phone still shows you have calls, so you have to delete them manually in the phone to clear the icon. Next phone will be a NO-FRILLS, cheap, SIMPLE phone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Phone on T-Mobile Plan","review":"This is an excellent phone, i've had it for over a month now and have had no major problems with it. The reception has been much better than friends who have other phones on the t-mobile network. I've travelled to Vegas, ATL, Orlando and many other places and have no problems. The battery life is not a problem as i charge my phone each night, but even on the nights i've not done so i've been ok unless i've been on the phone ALL night.The interface is good, but it is a bit slow at times. Even so, this is still a great phone and the deal through Amazon.com is worth it. I seriously recommend this phone to others who want a decent phone for a decent price."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than one of the same phone and still hate it...","review":"I have had numerous problems with this phone. About 6 months after I first purchased the phone I had to return it as it would not allow me to hold a conversation for more than 5 minutes without dropping the call. I am in a great reception area and therefore T-Mobile graciously exchanged my phone.Now I am 6 months into use with the new phone and it's starting to not only drop phone calls after short amounts of time on the phone, but also, the phone does not turn off!!! The screen constantly blinks on and off. The features are good (the bluetooth, and camera) but they do not make up for the horrible experience I've had with this phone. I will never again purchase another Motorola."},{"rating":"1","title":"Known Issues Motorola V300 and V600 series","review":"I used to work for T-Mobile. If you have problems with the phone, call the service center *while* your phone is acting up. Call the 800 # from a different phone. The rep will ask you a bunch of questions. 9 times out of 10 you will get a replacement phone. If it fixes itself while you're on the phone,ask the rep to note the troubleshooting and stay on the line while they notate your account. If the phone acts up the same way again you have a track record and it will be easier to exchange your phone. With the V600 and V300 series, if it starts dropping calls just turn it off and back on again once every 24-36 hours. If you're burning thru batteries, call Motorola if you're past your 90 day window but within 12 months. Remember, if you're nice to the rep they're going to do everything they can to help you, especially if you're to the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not all roses","review":"The official review says things like \\"nothing's going to break off\\" but that's not entirely true. My cover slips off in my pocket all of the time as I pull it out to answer a call. It has already gotten bent and no longer fits as well as it once did.Furthermore, my coverage hasn't been all that great. With a little investigation, it appears that other t-mobile phones receive a stronger signal with all other conditions being the same.Additionally, the phone isn't very responsive. Sometimes when I start to dial a number, there will be significant lag (1/2 to 1 second) before the number, and accompanying sounds, begin to appear.Finally, on the Mac, iSync doesn't work with this phone over Bluetooth. You either need an additional utility like \\"OnSync\\" or purchase the USB cable for the phone and then iSync is supposed to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"not sold anymore.","review":"i have been researching cell phones these past few weeks and finally spoke to a customer represenative this afternoon who told me that the MOTOROLA V600 and V300 will no longer be sold because they were having so many problems with them. buyer BEWARE! hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"A troubling good looking phone","review":"Pros:1.

Unfortunately, I have been disappointed greatly by both.

In addition to Motoral being completely consumer UN-friendly, the phone has serious problems. As you will read in other reviews, the side keys are way too sensitive and will turn the phone to silent if you're not careful. The key response is very slow. It can take over a second for the phone to register the pressing of the key. I've had the phone for about 6 months and the internal screen started to come off and leak some sort of jelly-like substance. My experience with their customer service was, quite possibly, the worst I've ever experienced. If you're looking for a good phone, pass this one up.

This rather expensive phone has lots of features that are difficult you use, flawed or useless. The thing I detest most about this phone are the left side buttons which are extremely sensitive to touch. When placing the phone in a pocket or holster, if you bump these buttons you will change your ring style usually to silent from vibe and ring, rendering the device an expensive brick. I \\"upgraded\\" to this phone and now experience frequent dropped calls and poor reception in areas where I used to have great service. Obviously Motorola didn't do its due diligence in human factors engineering or field testing of this horrible product"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Reliability","review":"I would not recommend this phone. It has plenty of bells and whistles, but suffers from poor reliability and design. The operating system frequently locks up, leading to missed calls. The ring buttons on the exterior of the phone are easily jostled and often change the ring style without the owner being aware of the change. Lately the phone has simply stopped ringing altogether when an incoming call is detected. The event lights work and the caller is identified, but no ring sounds. I have contacted TMobile and will be getting a replacement phone, however my research indicates these problems are widespread within the V600 model. Motorola would have done better to eliminate some of the bells and whistles and instead make certain the phone functions to make & receive calls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad bluetooth okay phone","review":"I run a OSX on a macintosh and would recommend anyone else doing that to stay away from this phone. It will not sych the way you want which generally ruins this phone for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously lacking in important ways","review":"This phone has Bluetooth, a camera, and world compatibility, but misses out on everyday user-friendlyness. The phone \\"operating system\\" has major oversights and is horribly slow, often taking 1-2 seconds to respond to button presses. Moreover, the phone often displays erratic behavior, such as \\"rebooting\\" or hanging up on an incoming call upon opening. One glaring flaw is the recharging process. You would think that plugging a phone in for recharging would allow you to continue to make calls when the battery is dead. This is not the case; apparently the phone only draws power from its battery and cannot switch to wall current when plugged in. Thus the only solution is to recharge the phone before making the call. Don't be fooled by the features, and get a phone whose everyday use is more convenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst phone yet","review":"This is the worst phone built by Motorola. The v300 was much better. A lot of bugs and problems. I had my phone exchanged 3 times. I called Motorola support, and they deny the problems.First, of all the phone is a bit bulky.

Now they charged me $50 for last month during suspension that I never used my service. I talk to the superior and they said that either you pay $50 now or do the cancellation and pay $200.

However, I frequently lose the pairing between the two and have to take the SIMM card out of the phone and re-charge the headset (basically re-booting both of them).

Well done and plenty of information."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but noticed one big anachronism.","review":"I generally enjoy Ms. McCaffrey's works, but the characterizations in this book didn't live up to her usual excellence.The big anachronism concerns the AIVAS \\"turning itself off.\\" AIVAS doesn't turn itself off until the end of All the Weyrs of Pern. The reason AIVAS isn't available to the second pass Pernese is because it is buried under 20 feet of volcanic ash.Regarding 200 year old computers. Why not? A friend of mine has a 20 year old computer that still works fine. I imagine the Federation of Sentient Planets would have better computers than we have now. Especially as no one complained about AIVAS and the Yokahama still working after more than 2000 Pern years."},{"rating":"2","title":"hardcore dragonlover & mccaffrey fan","review":"I fell in love with dragon's after reading the Dragonrider's trilogy. This is a must have for any serious fan of this series. Even though there is no outstanding character such as F'lar or Lessa in this book, it truly does bring the history of Pern to life for me. I look for any book from McCaffrey that may have anything at all to do with Pern or my beloved dragons."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!","review":"I absolutely love the Pern series, but it's gotten to the point where the author is stuck in a rut and running the same material through over and over and over again.... It's been this long. There has been no thread. Uh oh! Nobody believes it's coming again! Time to persuade some Pernese! This was the first of Anne McCaffery's books that took me two tries to get through. This is definitely a book you WILL be able to put down. Repeatedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book of the series","review":"This is one of my favorite books in the Pern series.

Wonderful characters and a good story line make this a definite must have for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dragonlady returns!","review":"I eagerly awaited a chance to get my paws on thisbook. I have always been a fan of Anne's and thisbook is no exception. With her usual easy, taletelling style, Anne takes you back to the days before there were reliable ways of telling a Pass, and details the ideas and people it took to design and install the Star Stones any Pern reader recognizes. Besides clearing up this mystery for me, she delightfully fills in some of the many details of daily life in Hold, Hall, and Weyr. Though the cover was not up to the usual style, the pages inside more than made up for that minor disappointment. This book again showed me the wonderful style of a true author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragonseye","review":"Enjoyed the story; Wondered in previous books about how the dragon riders knew when thread was due.

Do something about it, hire a half-decent artist"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't read very far","review":"I did not finish this book, because I want to continue to enjoy the 6 good books in the Pern world. McCaffrey is not your average science fiction / fantasy writer, but she does make their mistakes. World building should be done quickly and then move on to characters and plot. I know a lot of hardcore Sci-fi readers will disagree with me, but the world/ tech/ magic is just a backdrop for a drama. Think about how many people disliked the 3 starwars prequels. Why did they dislike them, simply because they removed all the mystery from the original three movies. McCaffrey eventually does this with first fall and dragonseye. I will not finish this book, nor read the other book. There is no need to answer questions that would only cause the story to lose it's flavor. When you find out that cinnamon is the mystery ingredient in the chili, it never tastes as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a disgrace to the writing ability of Anne McCaffery","review":"I have read almost every one of Anne McCaffery's books and haveloved all of them very much, but I really really dislikedDragonseye.

It is a custom file that will only search and remember on special \\"CEO/APA AudioBook\\" player ($150) from Brilliance Audio (only current player supporting this format). A standard MP3 player will NOT remember where you stop (14 hour long CD). Fast forward to get to where you stop is very tedious, especially in first track which is 1 hour 26 minutes long. To find your place in the book you must look at location before you stop and remember how many minutes into a track as well as the track number. Beware of MP3 CDs! If they are by Brilliance they will probably be this format.

If your unlucky enough to live in the UK, you'll find that even that is taken away from you.I am sickened by this book- and if you take my advice cut off the cover and put it around a book whose author wrote the back of a cornflake packet. . . . and you'll be much more happier. When I read this book, I found it was _so_ boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did the past history with Pern dissolve?","review":"Reading \\"Dragonseye\\" made me feel that Rod Sterling is alive and well and has taken up residence either in Pern or with McCaffrey. The book makes it sound like its era, 257 years after landing, is only the 2nd Fall to have ever occurred. What about the Oldtimers' and F'lar/Lessa's Fall? Didn't AIVAS eliminate Thread? How did all the Halls and Crafts fall into disuse? Where are/were the Harpers? If this is just an alternate universe/time line where Pern also might have gone, just say so. But this book is a total dis-connect. On a more literary level, I didn't find the characters or the plot as well developed as I'd anticipate from McCaffrey. None of the characters or group of characters were ones that were made very interesting. The \\"plot\\" seemed to be that one greedy, degenerative Lord Holder doesn't believe that Thread will reappear - VERY thin. Hope for better next time!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish and immature","review":"Some writers have it. Anne McCaffrey doesn't. There are many, many storyline possibilities for this world's scenario and none of them are exploited correctly. McCaffrey's style is simplistic and childish (there are better ways to show what someone is thinking than writing, \\"So-and-so thought this\\"). The characters are even more one-dimensional than those on Battlestar Galactica with none of the exciting effects. My advice, Mrs. McCaffrey: stick to children's books. Maybe you'll be better at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful","review":"I read half of book, then threw it away, half thought out books written by hacks do a better job creating characters and story lines,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragonseye: A new look at Pern and it's colorful inhabitants","review":"Anne McCaffrey again recaptures the spirit of the Pernese as they continue their fight to settle and survive on the planet picked by ancestors to become their home. The setting is immediately prior to the second pass of the deadly menace Thread. The people are preparing for this and adjusting to the agragarian lifestyle as the technologies of their ancestors rusts and crumbles. It doesn't meet the extremely high ratings that I would give the Harper Hall Trilogy or the Dragonriders of Pern Trilogy. It does, however satisfy the need within me to get more from McCaffrey. The storyline has many heroes as compared to McCaffrey's tendency to have at least one Lessa, Moreta, or Killashandra. I look forward to reading her next release (Masterharper of Pern) which is already on my bedside table. In fact, I am late for that now. Enjoy the book, I know that I did!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Each trip back paints a more detailed portriat of Pern","review":"I have found myself captivated by the world of Pern since first reading the trilogy The Dragonriders of Pern. From the first flight against the thread to the last I have enjoyed the lives and history of Pern. I read this book while in England and it was published under the title of \\" Red Star Rising\\" , I loved reading about the early years of the weyrs.

Especially, good and evil. But, he is a dishonest broker. He doesn't really engage in a real conversation about values, or morals, or God, or the law--none of it. What he does is mischaracterize or simply leave out anything that doesn't fit his pre-determined world-view. I don't know that he does it willfully, he may be a convinced fool. He may actually believe that he is a Libertarian when even a cursory look at his writing shows him to be a radical conservative. Which is fine, but at least be honest about it.This is a simple-minded book that may give comfort to those who would rather the world be a three layer cake rather than the complicated and various world that it is. But as far as being anything other than a broadside against the Left, it is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"One -Dimensional","review":"Dennis Prager is a radio talk show host who, like many of them, speaks before he thinks. He also, apparently, writes before he thinks as well. His good features as a writer are that he can be entertaining and his writing style is basically easy to read. But, he is not an intellectual or a critical thinker because he seeks answers to questions within a very limited framework. Like any fundamentalist, he knows the answer he wants ahead of time. If you want your conservative prejudices confirmed, buy this book. Everyone else--those seeking a real engagement of ideas, a range of thought, or any accuracy or fairness in Prager's depictions of that which he disapproves, should pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for those Seeking Clarity","review":"This book is a truly great work. Prager writes in a clear and concise style but this should not to be confused with him being simple. One of Prager's great attributes, is the ability to encapsulate his profundity into simple explanations. This book addresses many defining differences between liberals and conservatives, but also explores parts of humanity in general.The book is easy to read, enjoyable, and quite possibly life changing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you think","review":"Well written with good arguments. Prager answers, often with truth, some of society's questions. His essay on the media bias is excellent and Part 4 (Baby Richard) should be read by everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"For thinkers...","review":"Dennis Prager is not your typical talk radio host. His show is more about ideas than anything else.

How wrong I was having now read the book! I believe that Watson wrote this book just to insult conservatives at every chance he got! From the \\"right-wing\\" preacher to the Rush Limbaugh-esque clone who cheers for the deaths of the drug users, I was offended! Watson even portrays veterans and ex-CIA types as nothing more than evil, hard-nosed right-wingers! This book was nothing but insulting, tired trash!

Well, you have ... in better books. One doesn't feel led through this story as much as shoved from behind with the author's hand on your collar with no subtlety or tension.

Oh my!) The book is roughly on the same intellectual level as the movie \\"Die Hard 2: Die Harder\\", only a lot less entertaining.If you want to hear nutty conspiracy theories about evil conservatives, see an Oliver Stone movie.

With a highly original premise I found I could simply not put this book down. The hero of the story Mark Beamon wasn't highly believable but the wit that the author demonstrates in Beamon more than made up for that fact. The invovlment of a former DEA agent John Hobart with a television avanglist seemed a bit of a stretch but it's okay. The story unravels well and the climax comes as a surprise (it came out of no where) and I thought that was great. All in all this book was an interesting and thought provoking a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different sort of thriller....","review":"I read LOTS of thrillers and, after a while, they get to be pretty much predictable.

Read it by the pool on vacation and hated to put it down.Mark Beamon is a maverick FBI agent (picture Dennis Franz) tired of all the crap and politics in Washington. So he accepts a demotion to the Houston office to get away from it all.He is, however, one of the top investigators in the FBI and when drug users start dropping dead by the thousands, Beamon is called in to investigate.The bad guy, John Hobart, is smart and does not (like in alot of books) make stupid mistakes. The cat and mouse between him and Beamon is fast paced and interesting.In other reviews, I noticed some people complaining about product endorsements and people saying \\"Uh\\" alot. Didn't bother me a bit, I never even really noticed. So don't let that put you off this book.I look forward to Mr. Mills next book.NOTE: If this is ever made into a movie I think Dennis Franz would be great as Mark Beamon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I thought the synopsis sounded good that's why I bought the book.Thank goodness I bought it at a clearance sale as it was definitely not worth paying for.I think the author tried to cash in on Tom Clancy's name to sell the book.It's so boring I can't bring myself to finish reading it.I'm a great thriller fan but this is quite awful as the characters are not well developed.The hero isn't even very likable ...the author doesn't bring the characters to life like so many authors do.Don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sophomoric writer comes up with a great plot idea.","review":"Now I aint no pretentious book reviewer, but even an idiot like me can recognize poor character development and lazily researched settings.

I realize that when one is reading fiction, one does a certain amount of reality suspension, but when I came to that Houston desert scene, I was nearly disgusted enough to throw the book against the wall. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the plot. I know this may seem like a trivial complaint, especially to someone not familiar with the topography of Texas, but hey you Phoenicians, how would you like it if you were reading a novel and the author wrote: \\"Kirby climbed to the top of Camelback Mountain and squinted into the glint coming off the Pacific Ocean.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of words- little on creating correspondance art","review":"This is an extremely thin little book.

Then like 5 seconds of silence followed by it jumping into the next song.THIS, my friends, is the nature of live Mississippi blues though. Pinetop Perkins on the piano has never sounded better live. And Louis Myers REALLY does well playing Middy's old leads for like 2 hours straight.Mojo Buford is a serviceable harmonica player but MAYBE a top 5ish in Muddy history. I've never even heard of the bass player & drummer on this and they fall into their own thing in spots that I don't care for.That being said it's in spots & doesn't destroy the album for me.Where THIS album picks up steam is in the song selections. Pee Wee Clayton & Jimmy Reed covers? OKAY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bowed and scuffed up","review":"Some of the old Small Parts inventory is in good shape, some has evidently been around for years.

If I were a teacher I would have my class read this book. I can't imagine going through something like Jeff, the main character, did. Not only did Jeff have to live with what happened, but he also had to endure the criticism of his peers after it was all over. I don't think that I would be able to live with myself after an experience like that. I can completely understand the reason for his apprehensiveness towards touch. Ray, the guy that had originally kidnapped Jeff, is unimaginably horrible. You will have no idea, until you read this book. But the plot through this book is not only interesting and nerve wracking, but it's also a complete twist at the end that I never would have expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Depressing","review":"I have no complaints on the author's style, grammar, or character development, but I found the subject matter dark and disturbing.

I found it disturbing and without much merit. It seems the author's only goal is to desensitize to the subject of abduction and sexual molestation.

If the intent is to scare, prehaps it succeeds at that, but a good story---YUCK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disturbing Book","review":"When Jeff Comes Home is a very disturbing book. How anyone could write about a MAN raping a kid BOY is disgusting. I felt uneasy throughout the whole book and was shocked that Jeff partly like being raped by the same sex. He never said that, but he thought about it and covered for Ray, and did actions he did with Ray. I do not recommend this book, but if you are going to read it, be prepared and emotionally ready. If you are under 14, you probably shouldn't read it. This is an appalling book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book from All Angles","review":"The first thing you realize when reading this book is that Jeff has problems. These problems to us seem stupid. Things like paranoia over being watched in the bathroom. Not only that but its founded paranioia. Not just something stupid he thinks might happen but did. EVery parent's worst nightmare. Their child dissapears.Then amazingly he comes back. But it isn't the same boy that was lost two and a half years ago. Its a diffrent child with severe issues, adn many times people make the mistake of forgetting that.One of the scariest sceans in this was when Jeff was explaining the slap game to his younger brother. The way that the author captures teh hopelss ness of the feeling's Jeff has is powerful.I would recomend this book to anyone. Just about any one. Less you really hate homosexuality in anything. Becasue there is a few mentions of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but only if you are VERY DEDICATED and FOCUSED on learning Polish","review":"Not the best book for beginners.

The author claims to understand the area's inhabitants, both human and animal, and the ecosystem they share. However, he also feels the region's natural resources are at his disposal. The entire book, which perhaps might have discussed the delicate balance of plants and animals, consists entirely of hunting and fishing stories, and poorly written ones at that. The book lacks a plot, or even a hint of excitement. It stirred only disgust at his total lack of respect for the land. Motoviloff, who only vacations in the Driftless region, lacks the experience and knowledge that only years of living in the region can give. The region doesn't need another man to harvest its fish or kill its wild game. It needs a conservationist who understands the land and respects it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY a new edition","review":"You DO NOT need to buy the current edition.

The story built to a final and dramatic climax...but left me feeling: \\"Duh!

Topics mixed all over the place. Confusing. Repetitive. Some sentences just stop halfway through. The real world objects they compare to are a joke.

At night or in a dark room visibility is a lot better.The room where I keep my PC has a lot of natural light during the days, so I've since switched to the Saitek Eclipse keyboard (blue against silver keys) which I can comfortably use night and day.

I was also surprised to find out that ther is a built in USB 1.1 hub in the back, and even further amazed that it supports my iPod shuffle 1GB. This keyboard also has a very wonderful layout, and lights up very well. The lcd screen is a very nice bonus, now I can see the time when I am playing video games that go full screen. This keyboard is also very customizable, with 18 programmable keys per profile, which can work for all of the programs that I can think of.

Just 2 things wrong though. It advertises that it can view how much ammo you have left in a game but only 3 unheard of games support it so that feature is out the window but the fact to change your song so easily and see what its called in a game is cool also with a rotation on the cpu usage and the RAM usage u can find out if u can do bittorrenting and gaming at the same time. SO u can manage how you use your computer better. Then the last probelm is the usb hubs. How they are really conveent but why USB 1.1?!?1 why logitech i thought u were smarter than that.

Regardless of intended function, a keyboard needs to \\"feel\\" properly - tactile feedback from key strokes is the primary criterion for rating a keyboard, in my opinion at least. I know this is subjective, but for me the keyboard just feels too mushy, and key presses are too long.As for features, the display is a novelty, as the games I've played showed only basic data that I could configure on my monitor, and I'd rather keep my eyes on the monitor than look down at my keyboard for that info.The extra row of keys on the left side were useful for several games, and the blue backlighting looks cool.I replaced the G15 with the Razer Tarantula, which feels much more crisp and precise to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't pass the test of time","review":"Great looking keyboard. Unfortunately all it takes is one minor spill and the keyboard is destroyed. That includes cleaning. And don't think you are ever going to take it apart and dry it.

They weren't like DELL, nobody is that bad, but their resolution was to buy a new one from them for 50% off their retail price. shipping was extra.

The keys feel mushy on press, and sometimes even get stuck in the keywell, which itself feels deeper than other keyboards out there. When connected to via usb, the keyboard sometimes doesn't turn back on when coming out of sleep mode, I RMA'ed it to Logitech(who to be fair have great support) and the new one had the same issue (when no other keyboard had this problem.) Lastly, the thing is a behemoth, not only because of the extra marco keys on the left, but because of the poor layout of key placement, which sets everything far apart.

The keys are sensitive enough that you don't have to hammer down on them and the backlit keys make it convenient in all lighting conditions. The programmable macro keys can be useful not only in gaming situations but also when using photo manipulation software such as Photoshop.The LCD display shows useful information most of the time (since not all games support it) and it can toggle between non-gaming info that can make it easier to tell the time, your computer's performance, etc.My only gripe would be the Media Display crashing whenever ITunes does something the keyboard's not expecting.

Oops it only has usb 1.0 extra jacks. There's no reference for what the gaming keys have been assigned to do(little screens on each key like on another keyboard would have been nice). There's that switch to turn off the windows key, but why does a keyboard for gamers have a windows key in the first place. The result is that the Ctrl key is farther out than I'm use to (I've used an old IBM clicky keyboard for years).The included apps are barely useful, there are better mods out there but stuff like a task manager should have been a no-brainer. The screen should have been in color and higher resolution.If you have a working keyboard you can stick with that and wait a generation or two before getting this sort of keyboard.

The subtlety of the telling, the comedy and the characterisations let you know that you are in in the realms of art.Anyway, will some publisher please get a reprint out very very soon, and this well-loved copy of mine is threatening to fall into a fine powder from my periodic re-readings over the years.

The story was very entertaining. Never got boring. It didn't have any real romance, which I like. Nothing that kept you in suspense or left you dangling for more. No male/female interaction that made you feel excited for the characters. But I always look for clean books. I cant stand books that take you into the bedroom. I prefer books written by Jane Austin or the Bronte sisters just to give you my type of taste.

I looked forward to reading these on my Kindle, but the 4 books I purchased all have serious errors, rendering them almost unreadable.Dialog runs together without spacing, making it almost impossible to tell who is speaking, paragraphs run together (and given Heyer's frequent use of paragraphs which are more than a page long anyway, that's painful) and in sections the page formatting (no matter what the type size) consists of a full line of text followed by a single hanging word.I probably won't return the books because of my love of the contents, but I'm very disappointed in Amazon and the publisher, and will check samples of future releases before I pay for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish...","review":"I was excited to read this book after reading all of the positive reviews.

I was happy to have it on my Kindle -- until I discovered that it was horrendously formatted. Paragraphs were inconsistently indented, some paragraph breaks missing altogether -- try interpreting a conversation where the paragraphs run together -- and in two chapters the line breaks were so poorly done that they were virtually unreadable.

A charming, engaging novel about character!","review":"I loved this novel! I had never heard of Heyer, but knew this was a best-seller from CNN news that Kindle readers are downloading everything from \\"Books about a soldier's life in Afghanistan to Cotillion\\". It made me wonder what in the world \\"Cotillion\\" could be! So I downloaded it and decided I needed to expand my world (because I am the type who would read the Afghanistan book), or a bio of Carl Rove, etc!Well, after a teeny bit of patience with the first few pages,I was addicted! I cared about the characters and went on to love this book...the subtleties of the conversations had me roaring! Especially the English/French misunderstandings (Literal vs. Drama) I think I also learned some fine-tuning to improve my own manners from this, as well...and how often can you say THAT about a book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid the error-ridden Kindle edition","review":"Don't be fooled by the pretty Sourcebooks covers--someone did an awful job transferring this to Kindle. It's full of formatting problems, making the conversations extremely difficult to read, which is a shame, since the story itself was very charming and hilarious. The quality on the Kindle version is equivalent to the free public domain book. I wouldn't complain if it were a free book, but for $8 this was absolutely unacceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freddie is the Bertie Wooster of the Regency period.","review":"This is a thoroughly enjoyable read. The dialogue is lively and rich with popular slang of the period, which is sometimes challenging to decipher, but once you do figure it out, it is bright and witty.I especially enjoyed the character, Freddie. I have never read a novel by Heyer before and, I suppose because of the person who recommended this author to me, I expected a rather more serious tone. I at first thought Freddie was just a fool, but soon realized that Freddie is the Bertie Wooster of the Regency period. Freddie doesn't have a Jeeves however, so he manages to become the hero of the piece by rescuing Kitty and her friends from various dilemmas.This book is not a deep read; you won't find the satire, insight, or social commentary of Austen, for instance, but you will have fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Book. Ever.","review":"Love this book. Read it first in 6th grade. Laughed so hard I cried. Love the characters, the humor and the dignity in spite of everything.

I'm pretty skilled with power tools / guides etc. but couldn't get this one to work well. Feed rate was critical for a clean consistent cut. Too much pressure and the plastic arms flex which makes for a crooked cut. Cord was constantly tangling with guide. When bits ran slightly crooked they bound up and broke.

Hogwash is notable for T.S. McPhee's expertise with the wah wah pedal and creative use of the mellotron and ARP synthesizer to round out their sound without leaving their trademark blues base. Clever arrangements, distorted guitar lines, and concrete bass playing flesh out some great songs, especially \\"I Love You Miss Ogyny\\", \\"3744 James Road\\", \\"Earth Shanty\\", and \\"Sad Is The Hunter\\". One of my favorite albums from the late sixties/early seventies, it must be played LOUD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cut the modesty guys!","review":"As all the other reviewers have pointed out, this is indeed the best the Groundhogs have done during their 70s heyday. It was a few years old when I picked it up in a bargain bin in a local dept. store. It is to this day a cherished member of my vinyl collection. With Tony Mcphee's masterful use of mellotron/synth and jangly stratocaster, they placed themselves on the cutting edge of early prog rock. Always a fan of long tunes with brilliant displays of guitar work, 'I Love You Ms. Ogyny' and '3744 James Rd' are 2 top notch examples of what the Hogs are capable of.This lp certainly gives new meaning to the term 'hogwash' I am happy to acknowledge that the band is still active over there.

His style reminds me of Piri Thomas and the story itself reminds me of Miguel Pinero. It is semi-autobiographical which keeps me wondering how much of it true.

The presentation of the characters and the challenging situations are so honest that the effect is as if one is secretly reading another's diary.

However, as an English major, I find her style of writing irritatingly repetitive, and much more confusing than it needs to be. She uses a lot of examples to define concepts, rather than stating them--which would be very helpful. Furthermore, the glossary does absolutely nothing to help the confused student, since it basically reprints the in-text sentence where the vocabulary word appears. I would recommend sending the book to a literary editor who could redo the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The product was damaged.

It took me about half an hour to build correctly. There's no way my son (5 years) could've done this. I doubt whether many kids within the recommended age range of 4-10 year could assembly it by themselves. Once it has been put together, it is impressive. However, the pieces don't lock together really securely so it soon falls apart with play. As the pieces fall off, I have to constantly put the thing back together. If I don't, the kids get bored with it. I've no doubt that some of the many pieces will soon get lost as they fall off and it'll be put in the toy graveyard with all of last Christmas's bad choices. I gave a 3 for durability because most of the pieces are fairly unbreakable (unlike PlayMobil) even though the assembled toy falls apart easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Apart Constantly","review":"This item is horrible. It falls apart constantly. We tried hot gluing and superglue, however, NOTHING works.

However, no matter how you configure them, they ALL fall apart.During assembly notice they do not \\"click\\" as you would expect. Pieces never lock together, even with the bottom \\"base\\" pieces.We resorted to putting all the Imaginext on a table for him to play, however, flat surface, bumpy surface, any surface, it falls apart.PLEASE do not waste your money as we have. Unfortunately we spent approximately $150 on various Imaginext last Christmas. Do not make the same mistake we did.

Compared to other waterfall guides (New Hampshire, California, Tennesse, Michigan, Wisconsin), this book is the standard for which everyone should aim. He included everything you might ask for:* beauty ratings (helpful when no picture was provided) * directions (including maps) * pictures (wonderful collection) * photograph statistics (camera, film, f-stop, lens) * photo tips (places to shoot, things to avoid)I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone interested in touring North Carolina's waterfalls and particularly interested (like me) in taking pictures of them.For New Hampshire waterfalls, buy Doreen Bolnick's \\"Waterfalls of the White Mountains: 30 Hikes to 100 Waterfalls.\\" While not as well suited for photographers, Doreen produced an equally helpful resource to find waterfalls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Add this to your North Carolina vacation tool box!","review":"The purchase of this book marked the beginning of many beauty-filled days of adventurous hiking in the mountains of North Carolina. This book minimizes the wasteful time of searching for these hidden treasures and maximizes quality hiking time. The detail is astoundingly accurate. At times Kevin Adams's ratings of the waterfalls can seem a bit underappreciative, but we feel that this is due to the fact that he has a much broader spectrum of waterfall background. His rating system is consistent, and therefore each reader can determine their minimum hike-worthy rating based on Mr. Adams's opinions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely useful!","review":"My wife and I spent some time last October photographing several of the waterfalls in Kevin's book. As someone new to shooting falls, I found that the book gave several good pointers on how to expose for falls, as well as what equipment to use (eg., polarizer). I plan to buy a copy for myself soon (used a library copy before). It is a wonderful guide for how to find the falls. The only difficulty I had was in finding one that is now on posted land (I still had to ask someone nearby). I went in anyway, and this is where I got my best shot.

Needless to say, it is NOT industrial music. The music just doesn't work with the movie. Any music producer could have a great time choosing the correct music to compliment the action in the movie, but this just seems to be dark/ambient music overlaid on a silent film. The worst part was watching the terrifying carriage ride with mellow, dark, ambient music. It took the terror and dread out of the scene.If you like this movie (as I do) and you like dark music (as I do), the best choice is Nosferatu with the Type O Negative soundtrack. Search Amazon for \\"Nosferatu - The First Vampire.\\" That one uses the music and the movie to their full potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"The REAL Vampire...","review":"NOSFERATU is my all-time favorite vampire movie. Released in 1922, it is more frightening, and creates a far better sense / atmosphere of dread than any other bloodsucker film I've seen. Max Schreck is perfect as the mysterious count. His spider-like actions accentuate his oddly sculpted features. He is Dracula in a way that no one else (including Lugosi) has ever equalled. He is scary! Watch him terrify young Harker. Watch the crew of the Demeter meet their doom. Watch the count's long-distance hipnotic effect on Nina. This is vampirism as more than just a gore-fest or spooky halloween story. This is the tale of a believable vampire in the guise of a man. I cannot recommend NOSFERATU highly enough. Just buy it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different soundtracks make big diffeence.","review":"\\"Disgruntled\\" refers to a previous review and not Nosferatu.There are a number of different \\"versions\\" of this movie distributed by different companies. I bought the Keno version, and the transfer and tint quality are excellent. However, I had previously seen the movie with a pipe organ arrangement and was dissapointed with the orchestral arrangements on the Keno DVD. Not that there is anything bad with the music, it's just that the pipe organ creates a creepier mood for me. I then bought the Image companies offering and am very pleased with the pipe organ soundtrack, though the DVD transfer is not quite as good as the Keno. I would have given 5 stars if the Keno video and the Image audio were on the same DVD. Oh, and the audio commentary is admirable in ponting out the symbolism and stlye of the film. great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampire History","review":"Nosferatu is defiantly a masterpiece because it was the start of all vampire movies.

This DVD isn't even the REAL Noseratu!! In true Cleopatra (\\"producers\\" of this DVD) form, they changed the whole movie. They changed all the subtitles and words on the screen to make the movie more appealing to Cleopatra's own fans. They even made up their own credits and everything. The vampire in this movie is Count Orlock, but Cleopatra went in and decided to rename him Dracula. How can anyone gripe about the music, when a bigger travesty has been done. Who cares about the music when they changed the whole film !! I don't mean to sound pretentious just because I know the original movie, but I just want to warn people that if you want to see Nosferatu, then do not not not go anywhere near this re-creation. I feel so ripped off."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"I have seen this movie in VHS format, and if you are a fan of CLASSIC horror of the Bela L. type, then this is a compliment to that genre, BUT it is very European (and subtitled).

Maybe it's because I'm a classical musician, but the score renders this otherwise great film unwatchable. It's jarringly modern and busy and often doesn't fit what is happening on the screen. I've seen many silent films both on tv, online and in person as we're lucky to have an original silent movie house in town that still plays them with the original organ and sound effects, nothing has been as bad as this reworking.If you want to see a great classic vampire movie with a proper score, check outVampyr."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first and the best","review":"In my opinion it is perhaps the creepiest vampire movie ever made. It arrived at my doorstep in perfect condition, like it was promised and I was pleased with it enough that I have viewed it three times already. The effects are alittle grainy, because it is an old movie, but it does not take away from the overall effect of it. The movie is silent, but the music added is more than enough to keep your attention going. I wholly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys older films or are interested in the history of the vampire genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story? Spectacular !!, Quality? POOR...","review":"Pls note: I comment this on Alphavideo studio version I bought.The story & cinematography is - of course - spectacular as I expected (don't be hesitate to have one). Nosferatu is great for its eccentric form.But, let me tell you 'bout how the disc going in my player. first, the the disc go smoothly, but at 3rd chapter (of 4 chapter) the disc begin to go slow and jump to next frame frequently. Chapter 4, I almost can not see the movie as it jump more and more worsely, and finally I CAN NOT SEE ANYTHING. Did I buy pirated stuff???I tell you this never happen on my other DVDs bought from Amazon before. ... I don't know if this is the right stuff or not, but I'm really NOT satisfied..You'd better look for other studio version. Beware the kind of mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"A curiosity but hardly watchable.","review":"A renowned and influential work of movie history that manages to tell the story of Dracula at a sufficiently vibrant pace. Since the story has been done so many times since, it is entirely predictable to the modern viewer, and the melodramatic pantomime of the day causes what was once a very frightening film to seem rather comical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preview it before you show it.","review":"I bought this for my SciFi class. We read Bram Stoker and the reward was supposed to be this film. It was like giving kids liver for dinner then rewarding them with canned spinach. Everyone was so disappointed. I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. The history of the film with the lawsuits is really interesting and the clips you've seen are wonderfully scary with brilliant make-up. The problem is that there is a month's worth of boring between the good stuff. Fast forward or the students who expect CGI will fall asleep if they stay in class that long. Bela Lugosi is a much better bet. For a silent, Metropolis is much more compelling even to those CG fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Dracula Movie!","review":"This is by far my favorite Dracula movie. It was not copyrighted and was ordered to be destroyed in 1923. It didn't happen for many copies. This is a great movie and it would have been a tragedy to lose. Way back in the day when 8mm home movie projectors were in vogue and my mother was a public librarian, my brother and I used to take the 8mm version of the movie and play and play it again. We loved it and I continue that infatuation with the movie to the day. This is great DVD version with tinting, wonderful music and a wonderful print. The extras are terrific too. I'm glad I got this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of people missing the point","review":"I feel like people are writing this review as if the \\"Gothic Industrial Mix\\" was meant to replace the original music accompaniment.It's fine if you don't like it; but the point is to watch this movie to whatever suits your fancy. For me, this music created a scary realm, at times trance-like, but genuinely spooky. I appreciate the old tracks, but sometimes it's hard for me to un-hear the old timey music and slip into a horror. This mix does that for me.It may not jolt you like heavy metal might, or make you jump, but it hijacks your mind and forces you to get inside this world. With the old film--the jump cuts, the lighting, the frame rate--it is truly creepy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap package good movie","review":"This movie comes packaged in a cardboard case with little snappy things that broke as soon as I opened the case. That part stinks, but otherwise, I enjoyed this version of the classic horror movie. I appreciated the soundtrack for the movie as it was all wonderfully creepy pipe organ music and it sounded really clear and nice and loud. The film wasn't as grainy as I was expecting it to be, even on a large screen TV. Overall I was happy with this purchase and thought it was a good addition to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply near to the perfection...","review":"I buy this edition from Italy,because here doesn't exist a DVD edition of this masterpiece...I am really impressed by the realisation of the disc,wich content interesting extra materials and the movie restored in exceptional way with two very interesting audio-tracks more adapted to the movie atmosphere and a very nice animated menus...Really gourgeus edition..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you Ready for a Treat","review":"Before Bela Lagosi put on the black cape to play Dracula, Max Schreck played the vampire (under the name of Count Orlock.), and he has remains the scariest vampire ever to be filmed. You have to see this movie to fully understand what I mean. The man is extremely creepy.The story is the same as Dracula but it is told differently. The location is changed to Germany and there are very little sets. Most of the movie is done in locations that were landmarks back in 1922 so that there is a more realistic feel. The best scene when Count Orlock is traveling by boat and the mates mysterious become ill and die. I actually jumped when he finally revealed himself.This movie is silent and is accompanied by either an orchestra or organ music. I suggest the orchestra although at the slow point you'll wonder if they were playing while watching the movie. During the scary parts they were right on the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE MUSIC IS HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"WHY OH WHY did Kino chose to use 2 equally horrendous Synthesizer tracks for the background of this beautiful amazing inspiring film?

I am a fan of classic horror and there is no greater originator of classic horror than Nosferatu. Here we have a version with an updated score consisting of three minute fragments of not nessisarily heavy metal gothic music but just overall errie sounding. I liked it. As far as the movie goes I've read that there are better coppies out there but unfortunaltly I have been unable to find one where certain parts are not cropped. Still, a teriffic movie even if Barbra Strisand had done the score which might actually be scarier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nosferatu","review":"This film was okay.

It's a million times more atmospheric (scary and eerie) than anything they can make now. 1921 may be a very long time ago, but this is still one of the best films ever made. Period. -In any genre !. It holds up today, and it always will, I'm sure. It never seem to lose any of its power; in fact it only gains with time. In many ways, the movie is very much like a vampire itself. -It may look worn, but it never dies. Just think what we would've missed, had they really destroyed all the copies back then. By the way, why is this version only 64 minutes long, when there's also a 90 minute German version in existence ?."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, terrifying, beautiful","review":"The original Dracula movie, Nosferatu is quite possibly the most frightening film of its genre. This film is also the most intelligent of the vampire movies. It does not rely on gore and sex to intrigue the viewer, but instead presents the audience with a sense of darkness and fear that can only be attained through the exploitation of our own fears, however irrational those may be. It reawakens our childhood aversions to dark scary castles, bats and other things that go bump in the night. In short it is the ultimate gothic film: dark, sombre, and beautifully terrifying. Anyone who enjoys intelligently frightening movies should most certainly take the time to see this one. You wont be disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"SIMPLE: ALPHA VIDEO VERSION STINKS","review":"Hello?

The 1920's interpretation has it's time-stamp, which is unique, unrepeatable, unreachable at any other time ...Adding an industrial mix sounds to me just like a poor wash-pan-attempt of a couple of people, to parasite on a classic.

DO NOT buy the one with the tinted green picture of Nosferatu coming out of a coffin with the bloody pink font. This has horribly incorrect title cards, Count Orlock is referred to as Dracula and there appears to be missing scenes. Just a big waste of money. Don't get the cheapo version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An unusual \\"Work of Art\\"","review":"The earliest version of \\"Nosferatu\\" is a wonder to see. It is silent and somewhat broadly acted, but the sets and soundtrack are wonderful, which seems to make the film more melodramatic (and more like a work of art than a film). It is hardly scary, and sometimes humorous. But it is an undeniable classic that demands serious attention. Nosferatu was certainly scary in its time, and not the least by Max Shreck's bald head and bat ears. I do not feel it right to have physical appearances reveal someone's true character, but it actually helps the film!One problem to watch out for is that is almost always daylight. Dracula sleeps during the day, and it is better to be familiar with the story before seeing this film, because it will save much if not all confusion in that area.All in all, this Dracula film is almost completely unlike any other Draculas and is highly recommended for classic film buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"We are not thinking of the music, rather the FILM!","review":"I want to refer to some of the other people who wrote reviews for this: While I realize that the music is part of the movie, it is NOT the focal point! It is the visual stimuli that the movie gives off. There is a movie coming out in 2000 that is a takeoff of this, I reccommend the movie for halloween parties and to get frightened.

The soundtrack is not done accordingly to the movie - the songs are just classics, and most of the time, they are really cheerful, which totally ruins the mood of the film. The titles don't fit on the screen, so you miss the last line of most of the titles, plus the first and last words on either side of the screen. I do not recommend the Timeless Video version. I found myself not enjoying Nosferatu as much as I should because the quality of this tape was so terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate Edition","review":"This particular DVD edition of Nosferatu is an excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film's mood. I'm not sure when this \\"score\\" was \\"written\\", although it is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film. Nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the film. With this edition's music, I got confused at times between what I saw and what I heard, and the whole thing became an unaffective joke after a while.

In fact some of them didn't screw together at all, even after trying different combinations.Overall I wouldn't purchase this stand. I'm not sure if I received a faulty one or if they're all constructed the same way. My advice would be to save your money and purchase one with higher quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"This is a poorly made product and it is not worth the price. I wasn't expecting much as I know djs tend to shell out a good $75-$100 on a laptop stand, but I feel that I got less than what I paid for. This is very rickety and will bend easily. It wobbles quite a bit even if you have it set to lower heights where there is more overlap of the metal and therefore more reinforcement. I would not recommend this product unless you are on a super tight budget and feel you need one. I don't think I will return it as I have nothing to replace it with at this point. Also my laptop almost just fell out of it which inspired me to get on here and write this review. I had to catch it, the front of the stand has barely high enough lips to hold my laptop. (I have an acer aspire 5250)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont bother, spend your money on another item.","review":"Dont bother, spend your money on another item.

However, judging by the book, these are very shallow reflections.The book does wrong to Buddhism's deep insights and philosophy.There's nothing in the book which you haven't heard before: Be kind and good, accept life,be generous, etc. To me, almost nothing inspired, just old cliches about the spiritual life.And of course, don't expect any practical advice, like meditation techniques.Maybe this book will help total newbies to get acquainted with Buddhism, but still there are far better books. One can try for example Ajahn Brahm's books, for an inspiring stories and just a good laugh.Those famaliar with Buddhism- stay away, because you're likely to get bored!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for nerds!","review":"This is the third collaboration between Alex Ross and Paul Dini, and again it's just in time for the christmas market. This oversized tabloid format really shows Ross's skill as a painter off and the writing is always sensible and accessible. Basically this is a book that comic geeks can read and that children can also read. The art from this book will be auctioned off for charity, so buying it is almost like giving to charity.

I guess the Captain's compassion only extends so far. The sick kids in the story are bringing tears to readers eyes at the same time they gloss over other forms of abuse. The god of empathy was obviously forgotten when these authors revisioned Shazam!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holey Moley!","review":"Captain Marvel deserved his own great story and this is it. Fortunately, for all us SHAZAM fans, Alex Ross has brought the character back in a big way - first in Kingdom Come, and now here. The only drawback for Cap fans in Kingdom Come is that the Big Red Cheese is mostly a pawn of Lex Luthor throughout the book. Here he has own story where he can be the hero. These oversized volumes by Dini and Ross can be quite touching at times. Here, the Captain visits kids at a hospital and befriends an abused child.The art by Alex Ross is spectacular as usual - especially at the beginning where young Billy Batson visits the Rock of Eternity and the old wizard tells him, \\"Speak my name!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Power of Hope\\" is definitely an appropriate title","review":"I'll admit that this book wasn't entirely what I was expecting. The artwork by Alex Ross was fantastic, just as expected. I learned more about the personality of Captain Marvel than I had hoped. However, I was expecting more of a comic book, like Ross' Kingdom Come series. Instead, I found the story geared more towards children. It is a tale of hope, as the title suggests and it is a powerful story that I would have no problem reading to young children. Don't buy it and expect a knockdown drag out fight. Instead, expect a wonderful parable about a boy with super powers helping other children who ends up learning something about himself in the process. And this is coming from a cynic. If I ever have children, I'll be sure to read it to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Came together with my lamp.","review":"You could purchase these at any DIY store.

Having read the reviews I decided to buy the dvd, now I feel cheated. The jokes are weak, his inaccurate depiction of Africa and his off-the-mark African accent were more annoying than amusing. Jamie was crude, disgusting and even more disappointingly, not funny at all. He will look back at this and feel acknowlege that it wasn't his best performance.

Vulgarity does not mean hilarity, and I have seen many comedians who have not attained Jamie's success, yet are smart and witty. And look at his creative title; I Might Need Security.

SHOWBIZ, the bands first album, is remarkably diverse and intricate. Kicking off the CD is \\"Sunburn\\", and one can not ask for a better opening track. Every track on here is worth the money. \\"Muscle Museum\\" and \\"Fillip\\" prove the emotion and passion that is rooted within Matt's voice and the bands overall talent. Other beauties such as \\"Falling Down\\", \\"Cave\\", and \\"Overdue\\" round out the exquisiteness of such an album. I cannot praise this enough! Muse is without question one of the best bands today. You will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Briliantly Muse","review":"This is one of the best CDs i've heard. What makes it particularly marvelous is the fact that it's a debut album. It doesn't happen often that a debut album is very good. But Muse have made a superior one. All of the songs are just great. Particularly, Unintended, Muscle Museum, and Uno are simply fantastic. Although this is just their first album they have already moulded their own style: wonderful falsetto, great contrasts (e.g. in Uno and Showbiz), and amazing piano sections (e.g. in Cave, Fillip). This is one of the best CDs of punk alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover does not look like the one shown in the picture","review":"I'm giving it at 1 star rating to this product because I bought it as \\"NEW\\" with original labels, however when I received it I noticed that the labels shown in the picture were not there, plus the wrapping looks homemade which tells me this is not a new product which is what I paid for.

If you like good, funky, twisted music then this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Next Best thing Since Radiohead","review":"Ok, first of all, they aren't exactly radiohead (although that wouldn't be a bad thing), that's just probably the best comparison for a band like this with such a unique sound. It is probably the best cd I have bought in a long, long time and there isn't a single track I don't like. I would tell you my favorite song, but they are all so different and apply and effect you in different ways at different times. Each song just has its own sound. Matthew Bellamy (the singer) is outstanding and incredible. I suggest this cd to everyone I know and can't wait for their next album. Buy it, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I'm not sure if I dare to review 'Showbiz', just in case I don't give it enough credit. It is the best album of 1999, and probably the best since 'The Bends' or 'The Holy Bible'. The album never fails to amaze, from 'Sunburn' to 'Hate this and I'll love you', taking in such masterpieces as 'Uno', 'Cave', 'Muscle Museum', 'Showbiz' and 'Fillip'. I was anticipating the album from the moment I heard 'Uno', and it has not disappointed me for a second. You shouldn't be wasting your time reading this anyway; you should be ordering 'Showbiz'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drawn in from the beginning","review":"I have to admit that I was drawn to Muse at first because I thought they sounded like Radiohead, but after buying this cd and listening to it many many many times, I'm finding new reasons to name Muse as one of my top-five favorite bands. The music is fantastic and all the songs have something a little different to offer than the one before, so playing the album isn't like listening to the same song over and over. I like Matthew Bellamy's voice, and his range is amazing. Definitely a good cd worth your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"If you like Radiohead, I really suggest you buy both these band's CDs. Imagine Radiohead slightly heavier and with the addition of pianos in a couple songs like \\"Sunburn\\" and \\"Cave\\".

However, I find Muse's Shobiz to be a fairly consistent album and the band itself musically talented. You will not find the typical CD formula here, where 2 or 3 tracks are radio-worthy and the rest of the album is fluff or \\"filler\\" material. If you find yourself enjoying the sample audio, you can expect the same quality on all tracks. I hesitated using the term \\"radio-worthy\\" to describe Showbiz because these tracks will never ride the American airwaves. The only downside to Showbiz is that it's one of those albums you tend to get bored with if you listen to it too often. However, I just dusted mine off and am currently enjoying it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Rubbish!

Sure, Muse got great songs (STockholm, Butterflies) and their latest album was good. Yet, they got filter songs. O, and i think \\"STockholm Syndome\\" KINDA sound similar to \\"Paranoid Android\\". I guess they're compared to radiohead cuz they like makin \\"whining\\" noises ( eg. creep)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good album","review":"This is a good album by one of the best bands around. I love Muse and this album is enjoyable. If you are new to Muse, I would suggest you start with \\"Absolution\\" or \\"Origin of Symmetry\\", as they have a more immediate effect. Showbiz is a good album, but it took me a number of listens before I really got into it. It is still my least favorite album, but that is only because I absolutely love their more recent releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"Showbiz is Muse's debut album, but it's definitely one of my favorites.

I don't know if the lid simply has a better seal than other plastic storage containers and zip-top bags that I've tried in the past (I've double and triple bagged to no avail), or if the metal disc embedded in the lid actually does absorb the oniony odors.All I know is that it works, and I have one less thing to worry about in the kitchen. Toss your partially-cut or chopped onion in this container, snap on the lid, and burp it. The size and shape is perfect for holding an average-sized onion or half of a large one.

Some missing scenes include teenaged Cathy's affair with her school-teacher, and his subsequent suicide, and Charles' and Adam's experiences as young men, before they met Cathy. (If you look closely at the video box, you can see still photos of several deleted scenes).

After reading the book and seeing the Kazan version (which follows only the last of three generations covered in the novel), I can say that this version is the most faithful to the novel in its scope and in its exploration of the full depth of Steinbeck's philosophical idea. The concept of man overcoming his sin nature passed down from father to son, from generation to generation, cannot be fully realized by covering only one generation, as the Kazan movie does. If I remember correctly, the score was taken primarily from Copeland's Appalachian Spring, which fits perfectly with the tale.

The family goes through many hardships, such as an illness throughout the family and a temporary blindness occurring. They think all is over when a twist of fate turns their spirits around.This book has a great storyline with well-developed characters. It has some tougher words which makes the book an older children's novel.

In his writing, Thom gives simple yet profoundly helpful and practical tools for helping us face fear, explore it and then do something to help us move beyond it's grip on our lives. One of the most helpful distinctions Thom makes in the book is the one between neurotic and healthy fear. He shows how neurotic fear can cripple our lives and what we can do to face this kind of fear and work towards responding to it in a wiser way. Facing my fear has been a major part of my healing process and now I have an even bigger tool to help me as I make the leap from what I've known myself to be into a bigger, fuller and more expansive \\"me.\\" Anyone traveling on their path with intention can benefit from such a practical, helpful guide like Embracing Fear!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor died in 7 days use.","review":"I noticed the fan started to sound funny after about 6 days of steady use, so I took unit apart for cleaning.

I tested this with many DVDs and had the same bad result. Annoying.3) The battery is way too bulky for a portable. All these companies should show their units with the battery pack as well before you buy them.

Although I'm not from the DC area, The scene that I grew up in outside Philadelphia was heavily influenced by bands such as Bad Brains, Minor Threat, Ignition, Fugazi, Embrace, Jawbox, Shudder to Think etc... It warms my heart to see my favorite bands of all time and the political and social ideas that went hand in hand with the music being given the same kind of reverence as the bands that changed the world for my parents in the 60's. Thanks to Mark Andersen and Mark Jenkins for such a fantastic book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Posturing","review":"Anyone who goes to a Fugazi show (in DC) knows that the first 5 minutes of it are going to be taken up by Mark Anderson passing off bumper-sticker quotes as deep political lecturing and flogging for \\"Positive Force\\", which may be doing some good for the community, but has surely cramped the musical scene. He's insufferable. If you haven't had the misfortune of seeing him live, you can read his book which is a couple hundred pages of political posturing dressed up as the history of DC punk. The book is nothing more than unrelenting praise of Fugazi and self-serious [junk] about politics. Worse than being inane, Anderson's politics are BORING. No one cares, guy. DC - and the country - are doing better than ever no thanks to his and his friends luddite and reactionary (dressed up as \\"progressive\\") politics."},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown but bought it since it's about harDCore","review":"I suspect most people bought this book just because it is about Dischord and the DC scene, and we like the idea of a cool looking book format about the scene. But this book is, overall, a letdown.Like the author himself, this book is a bit of a bore that seems to glorify certain things without driving a sense of vitality at all. The details can be cool but often times are tedious and painful to read. Let's face it-- no one from outside the scene would find this book tolerable at all.I am not going to debate what bands were/weren't included. I just found the book to be long and, ultimately, slightly a downer. Disappointing. Steal it from a friend then give it back-- you'll see."},{"rating":"2","title":"The enlightening life experience of ONE Somali girl-child","review":"I read this book because I am studying Psychology and it is the focus of a personality assessment piece I am to present. I found 'Aman' to be an easy read, but a pleasurable one. For those who choose to criticise her story, I would put to you that Aman did not presume to explain her story as that of EVERY Somali woman, but of her own life experience. Furthermore, I have been educated in the fact that not EVERY Somali woman is as dependent on her husband as I once presumed. I thank Aman for teaching ME a thing or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started good, but trailed off by midway","review":"I have worked quite a bit with Somali refugees, and have established friendships with several individuals. I picked this book up in hopes of understanding more about the background of the older individuals I encounter (same \\"age\\" as Aman). The first third of the book I really enjoyed, and I think, learned much from. From that point onward, it seems to become less and less representative of \\"the general\\" experience or \\"a typical\\" experience. Though I cruised through the first part, by midpoint my interest was dropping off quickly, and I had to convince myself to finish it. If this is one of the better books to read about Somalia or Somalis, it is only because there are so few contenders."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that distorts the whole truth of somali women","review":"Not a good start for anyone working with Somali people as the book distorts the whole truth of how Somalis treat \\"their\\" women.This was a girl who at her young age, fell in love with an Italian boy and slept with many different men mostly Italian settlers while roaming around Mogadishu's red lights.

Not anymore.It's made of metal, so it seems pretty sturdy. Also, the tube pre-amp sim in this makes your voice sound about 10x warmer.Cons:This thing feedbacks like a mother. Don't be afraid to learn how to use the noise gate, and please make presets so your settings don't get lost.Headphone port seems kind of movable, which it shouldn't.So basically, if you want a less expensive way to get your vocals the way you want them too for a show, go for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Recording Studio Engineer","review":"The effects will work well for someone in a live band, but if you are looking for a device to record with in a studio, you may want to look at the \\"Digi Tech Live Vocalist 3\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best vocal processor out there","review":"There aren't many to compare it to but this is a great piece of equipment.

At a low volume the quality is fine but when I turned up my PA at all i got a high pitched hiss that I could not find a way to get rid of (even when is bypass mode).

The new one worked for just under a year and then began to lose time. Thinking again that it was the battery, I replaced that again and a few days later it was 45 minutes slow again. The company says they will fix it but I have to pay for all the shipping charges. I'm not too happy with that (for one, I live overseas and they won't return the watch to me overseas) since it is the fault of their defective product.

I kept the book as it was one I felt would help me long term and I liked it, but once working in electonics, I find it really wasn't useful. Most of the problems I see on a day to day basis were never addressed and the methods I learned in graduate level classes were much more powerful.I do wish more students had the underlying knowledge of electonics, so many engineers these days don't know why or how semiconductors work!The way I saw the book is that it teaches one how to drive a car by exlaining the gas pedal, the engine, the transmission, the tires, and the road.

However for a mid-level book it's pretty good and people should not judge the book harshly if their professor assigned it for a beginners class-it's not the book's fault but the professor's. I had struggled with many bad mid-level books and so I know this book does a good job compared to many. I originally had the first edition.

Beware of words like thus, obviously, etc. which are used as an excuse to not explain things.

So please don't tell me there isn't enough space to explain \\"everything\\". In other words, if you're a student that likes to memorize rather than understand what's going on, then this book is for you, because the authors fail to inform. And there is plenty of material for you to memorize. The problem of not getting enough EE students to emphasize on analog circuits is partly due to poor textbooks on the subject.

This book contains too little examples and all of the examples are too easy compare to the exercises. This causes many students to have a difficult time understand the practical concepts. The books has so many errors on the examples. This also makes beginners to be fustrated and it is very time consumming trying to figure out what is wrong while learning at the same time...

HE is the best author out there better than anyone else in terms of Analog Design. Use all his references as well. Without a doubt the best, better than Gray and MeyersGray and Meyer Book:Jacob Millman Books:Designing Analog Chips by Hans Camenzind: This is what the IC world is all about!! 20 dollars. Not much analysis, but is all intuition.Check IEEE Journals for real circuit examples, and see if you can figure them out that is best idea, you can sample circuits on PSpice."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre title","review":"This book does a good job covering the basics of transistor operation and basic amplifier configurations. There are a few other sections which are done well, but beyond that, the text is not a very pleasant read. Not enough examples is one issue. Some topics, such as oscillators, are only briefly covered, without any particular worked examples. Sometimes authors state that they are making an assumption, but fail to provide reasoning.In short, this one is ok for beginners, and it does it's job half decently, but I wouldn't recommend this as a reference, since it's not in depth and explanations are lacking in many places."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre book at best","review":"Sedra and Smith's book is at best a cookbook of formulas and diagrams with no real explanation of the material presented. It's the textbook used at the University Of Manitoba and sadly used at many other universities. The book is a big disappointment for someone like myself who loves electronics.There are some great books on electronics, \\"Art Of Electronics\\" by Horowitz and Hill, and \\"The ARRL Handbook\\" but my pick for the BEST book on LEARNING electronics is \\"Electronic Principles\\" By Albert Malvino. This is the best book on electronics, bar none. Find this book on Amazon.com, read the reviews. The only negative review is that it is overly geared for beginners. A weakness like that is the books greatest strength. But I use the book on the job daily! Then buy it, read it, and you will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Live In Venezuela I\`m studing engeeniering","review":"I study in the most important university that there is in this country, there in may carrer suggest me to buy this book. The Proffesors are very glad using this excellent book. I have one suggest to anybody that like electronics to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad book","review":"I owned this book, 4th Edition, from my previous courses in EE. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't recommend this book to undergraduate students if they really want to nail down in Microelectronic, which is based on the facts -- this book is very hard to understand from the authors explanations beside the exercises solutions and solving techniques. I feel very regretted that I owned this book because I could have another book better than this one in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Micro Book","review":"The book was delivered very quickly and the only problems with it were the ones in the description when I bought the book.

I do wish the solutions in the back would be more organized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive Review of MCAT Science","review":"As an Australian doing a very similar medical admissions test, I found these books pretty comprehensive in their review of necessary science knowledge. In fact sometimes they were too detailed (e.g. the non-organic chemistry went into some unnecessary detail)!The diagrams are A1 quality and text well-written.Notwithstanding the above I wouldn't say that the humanities parts of the exam are covered well so don't buy the package thinking it'll be everything you need to score well on the MCAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exam Krackers are the best!","review":"For MCAT prep, this set of books is worth every penny. You won't find a cheaper method of studying that is so highly rated. The package actually contains 5 seperate books so its easy to take one or two with you as needed. I highly recommend them to anyone preparing to take the MCAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Books","review":"There is no better set of books than these. They give you all the info you need with little jokes and pnemonics to help you remember the information. Other books give you lots of filler that just wastes your precious study time, while these books give you just whats tested on the mcat. I also recommend the audio osmosis cd's that go along with the books. They are great to have in the car or just to review the material when you get tired of reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shipment of MCAT","review":"I was happy in how I received it and arrived quickly. I am happy with the company I bought from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly fun for kids of all ages!","review":"I found this book to be too full of information to be a comfortable bedtime book, but my four year old son didn't seem to mind my skipping the words and just ooh-ing and aah-ing over the illustrations with him. My son also preferred my reading of it over his father's, because dad would get so absorbed in each page that he would forget to turn the pages! My son especially loved being able to know the names of all the parts of the jets and incorporated his new terminology in his play. This book is a definite must in any household with little pilots!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cold soup","review":"Vichyssoise soup from Amazon (same store as Gazpacho soup) is good.

Jan Karon has such a talent of writing in a way that makes the reader feel they personally know all the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their weakest, but understandably.","review":"Understandably, because this is a collection of non album / early singles. Most of which are severely hampered by lo-fi, muddled sound.

I don't want her to be scared of reptiles or amphibians just because they aren't fuzzy. At first, she was a little scared of the tree frog picture, but now she's much better and it is her most favorite page, because she likes touching the sticky pads of the tree frog page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the touch and feel books","review":"The touch and feel books are great for older babies and young toddlers. My son has been interested in these books since he was about 9 months old (currently 17 mos old). I really like the Wild Animals book because all of the textures are very different. My son's favorite is the sticky pads on the frog. Besides the frog there is a lion, dolphin, lizard and koala bear. There are not many words on the pages so it is able to keep my son interested without getting bored. Two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Still Sits on the Shelf","review":"I bought this for my son because I'd heard children go through a phase where they love feeling different textures. Maybe that's true, but he never got into this book at all.

What I'm finding is that when I pick the measuring cup up, the sides squeeze (DUH) but the stuff spills, oozes or falls out of the cup before it can become a convenient spout. I think the product works well for use as a holder for amounts of ingredients but not as true measuring cups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile and fun","review":"These measuring cups are great quality and colorful.

Although not so distant in time, the book transports the reader to a lifestyle where the close relationship of a family is necessary to survive the natural elements.Gary captures this personal piece of American history in a way that keeps one feeling as though they have been transported back in time.This is a book that is so full of emotion - bringing both frequent laughter and tears to the reader - that it is extemely difficult to put down before finishing. Whenever I started to be amazed at the hardships on the ranch, a story within the bigger story caused me to burst out laughing.The book is unique and very much worth reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Time to Relate","review":"In his book, Rivers of Wind, Gary Penley, introduces his grandfather calledDad, as a person that every reader can relate to and remember fond memories of their own grandfather. Dad was a man with integrity, the ability to keep his word just on a hand shake, instilled hard work and the love of God. These characteristics were evidently passed on to Gary Penley and his brother, George.As I read this book, I could easily relate and feel a connection with the memories of my own grandfather called George. I remember the strength that he demonstrated through the lean and hard times which made me who I am today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"I grew up in South East Colorado so I was very interested in this book and I really enjoyed it.

I'll stick to other brands in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might not work well for some burners","review":"These CD's are made for 32x but my burner will only burn them at 12x. It could be my burner but I have bought cheaper CD's than these that have worked perfectly with my burner. My advice is to only buy one pack first to see if they work with your burner."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Rebate !","review":"I bought this item becouse of the rebate.

Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I picked these up for a song (after rebate) and the quality of these Tiawanese made CD-Rs is very, very poor. Some of the CD's had pock marks and scratches on the surface right off of the spindle. My CD-R burner wouldnt burn them at 32X - I had to drop down to 16X to make them work.I suggest using them for copies of CD's for the car stereo/jambox/portable and making backups from the computer. I wouldnt trust them for anything you want to keep for a long long time. Yeah they may be cheap but you might feel ripped off when that ProMedia CD-R you made last summer stops working."},{"rating":"1","title":"32x, Don't believe it.","review":"I've been shopping amazon for years now and this is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review. This product does not cut the mustard. Using a CD burner that has burned and continues to burn many a CD, these things weren't readable at 32 or 16, and I've had some failures at 8.

The highest recording speed I can burn this with my CD-R is 16x. I don't understand why this is happening? It clearly states that I can record up to 52x but seems like all my CD burners can't burn higher than 16x.When I use other better brands, I can go all the way to 52x without any problems. I think this brand is cheap generic. I am gonna just give them to the next door neighbor's kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too weird and winding","review":"I suppose \\"weird\\" is the best word for this book. I'm not sure whether it's a commentary on ultra-right wing politics, a memoir of the Pinochet era, or a criticism of the literary world. Maybe it's all three.The narrative is hard to follow at times. The digressions seem pointless for anything other than setting a mood. Maybe I can't understand it because I'm not Chilean, or didn't live under Pinochet, or because I'm not a poet. Who knows? I'm glad it's over."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tough read- not worth it","review":"Boring beyond belief, at least half of the book consists of endless, rambling conjectures about what may have happened to the narrator's heroes, friends and friends of friends during the Pinochet regime. The \\"realism\\" in the book consists of one vulgar scene after another sprinkled with bathroom profanity. If you can parse its pages for the (somewhat unrealistic) plot, the action has a couple of suspenseful moments, but the ending feels inevitable and unsatisfying, to say the least. The process of figuring out its message is tough - definitely not worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the best","review":"This remains my favorite Bolano novel. While it lacks the heft and cumulative impact of 2666, the plot is clearer and the events more telling. Instead of the thousands of murders that actually happened in both cases (Chile and Ciudad Juarez), here he focuses on a few specific crimes, which retain their nauseating horror. Also, here we have an actual villain, which helps bring the evil of a corrupt system into focus. How to choose between poetry written in the sky by a military pilot and a book hung on the line like so much laundry? Bolano may have been the most fertile author on earth while he lived, and we are lucky to have all of his books. But for me, this one delivers the more powerful, sublime, and terrifying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted a few months","review":"It only \\"telescoped\\" for a few months before something in the inside won't grab the pole anymore.Poorly made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I ordered this pole for my pool because it was the lowest in cost I could find. They tend to be expensive. When I received it in the mail, it was packaged in paper wrap. Paper wrap, really? The metal on it was all dinged and dented and looked terrible. I returned it, and amazon refunded me the pole cost, but not the $20.00 shipping I had to pay to send it back. All in all, I had nothing and paid $20.00 for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Create an Oasis With Greywater","review":"This book is amazing! I can't believe how much information is presented so clearly with so little paper. It is packed with advice and tips for every possible situation, easy-to-read graphs, photos, and a full list of references. Ludwig writes in a clear, conversational style that makes even the most complicated projects seem fun and non-intimidating. It's obvious that Ludwig is an expert in the field, but \\"Create an Oasis\\" shows that he is also an excellent teacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"The title says it all. I got very little out of the book, certainly not worth the time to read or what I paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best investment","review":"I got these clippers in 2009 when I began to cut my hair. 15 dollars per week can run 60/month to look good. This clipper paid itself off in 2 weeks, as I keep my head nearly bald, but very very close shave, I'd say maybe .5 or .25 at the barber? I have been using this on average once every week for 3 years, and the quality has not gone down one bit. I have only re-applied the clipper oil once, but other than that, no other changes were needed. For the price and reliability, I would easily say this Wahl Clipper is an essential investment for those who cut their own hair. It is very easy for me to use, cuts close, and never hurts the user, even with the guard off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nishabd is a Great Movie!","review":"Nishabd is great movie.

Fully half of the tracks have been augmented with additional background vocals, synthesisers, and effects. Worst offense? The original vocal recitation of \\"The Making of Midgard\\" has been turned into a sort of \\"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\\" rounder, totally obliterating Calvert's eerie presence. What a shame.

So I ordered it and I did it from just a brief description. There were no visual images. I rarely buy anything sight unseen. It was a gem. I thank the folks who put this exhibit together. We need more exhibits and books on Woodland Indians. I have an old B&W photo of the blouse that was in this book.

Fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metal Lunch Box with Disney \\"Cars\\"","review":"I encouraged my son to buy a metal lunch box this year because I was so tired of trying to clean and disinfect the plastic ones he's used over the past several years. (The plastic absorbs smells and I have vowed to avoid them in the future.) The \\"Cars\\" lunchbox seemed to fit our needs, as my son loved the movie. I decided to splurge for the $9.99 cost because we had searched many other places and this had not been available. So far, so good.But here's what I hadn't counted on:** The lunchbox is quite small, even for a kindergartener. We will have to cram the food in and pack the thermos separately.** The $9.99 price was bearable, but the additional $5.99 in shipping fees put the cost of this over the top. I forgot to think about that when we made the purchase, so the mistake was mine.My overall assessment: This purchase was a mistake. Cute, but not big enough and too costly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great reference","review":"This book is almost all a student of economics must have in order to face international economy with solid basis. However, it is only a first approach and it would be useful to consult other good texts like Appleyard & Field\`s or even the Krugman ones which is quite elemental. If you try it, you won\`t feel disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Fun Mystery","review":"I'm hooked on this series. The sleuth, Helma Zukas, is a librarian in the public library of the fictional town of Bellehaven, WA. Although a complete amateur she is unwittingly dragged into a murder investigation by the murder victim himself.The murder victim was done to death by a paper spike in the women's washroom at a Native Cultural Centre. He was the curator of a collection of rare Native Indian books. And his death brings in Helma who takes over where he left off and then some.Quite a clever story really.And Helma's side-kick Ruth is fun. The characters of Ms Moon, Eve and other caricatures of the library world seem all too familiar to a public library patron like myself. And the Native Indian characters are quite decently drawn. I liked Young Frank, Audrey and Juiliana.Really a good mystery.Besides, I've never seen the Vancouver Public Library in a mystery before and in the Raven's Dance it gets a cameo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic writing and character development","review":"The story line was okay, but there was almost no character development. I felt like the whole thing might just have been an edited version containing only first lines of each paragraph, because there was so little to flesh out who these people are and why they relate to one another as they do (or don't). At least the book was free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reads","review":"I have now read all the books in the series--great light reads--fun for a rainy Sunday afternoon with a hot cup of coffee--"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, enjoyable read.","review":"The sun never shines on this book, literally. The weather is dismal, Miss Zuka's job is rather dismal, but the plot shines. It is obvious that Jo Dereske, the author, is an ex-librarian, as she gets the library details correct. I'm a school librarian, and found it interesting that she got her Dewey Decimal number right, the precise cataloging needed right, and even the possibility of a special cataloging system for specialized collections right.Ms. Dreske also got the Native characters right, along with the pseudo-Native characters right too. The Raven, a trickster from the Northwest, is explained well, as are the details of the museum.I enjoyed the story.

In this book, I sure never thought \\"who dunnit\\" \\"dunnit.\\"Read it for an enjoyable, easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professional Power Tools For The Fine Artists","review":"This book contains valuable information and advice for the artist starting a professional career. For those that have been actively engaged in pursuing opportunities, there are a number of procedures that the book suggests and clarifies. I purchased the 2002, 3rd edition of the book. Since then, due to the internet and digital photography, the criteria regarding submittals, portfolios, and follow up procedures have changed. I'm not aware of a newer edition - some of the material in the 3rd edition is outdated. For current guidelines always contact the source you are applying or marketing to.The book provides examples, statements, bios, press releases, etc., and gives protocol suggestions.I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good hard copy book but dismal on Kindle","review":"I have the hard copy of this book and love it. I was thrilled to see that it is available for the Kindle and immediately purchased it so that I could always have a copy with me. However, there is no table of contents and the book's index isn't \\"clickable\\". Essentially this leaves this electronic copy of the book nearly useless. This is a huge reference book and without a way to navigate its practically impossible to use. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Bible Study Tool","review":"Bullinger's is an excellent Bible study tool. The book is balanced and has a long history of use in the Christian community. I bought it to replace an older copy.This book is for Bible teachers, Pastors, and above. It is a bit involved for anyone not involved in deep, continous study of the word. It is not an \\"easy to read book.\\" It is more like a dictionary where you can look up passages or specific figures of speech and see how they are used in the Bible.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"This is an encyclopedic volume on figures of speech. I know no other book that deals with the subject matter so completely. As to there being no active link table of contents, well that is why there is a search engine in Kindle.

It is the major reason for using eBooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the e-version","review":"I was very disappointed in the e-version of this product, all the sentences and paragraphs are run together so that I found it very difficult to identify the material I was looking for. I may try the printed form next after I can save the money up, but I thought I would try the e-version since it was only 98 cents...and believe me, I got exactly what I paid for. If I could get a refund for what I received, I would, but its not even worth the hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame eBook Format","review":"Bullinger's is an excellent reference guide to classical rhetorical devices in the Holy Bible. This eBook format, however, is abysmal. Not only is there no table of contents, but footnotes and text are mashed together without separation so it's impossible to appreciate the individual verses that Bullinger selects. The search feature doesn't help make this mess any more readable. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly formatted, don't be shocked!","review":"The original book is excellent and PDF files are available on the internet. Unfortunately the Kindle edition is not formatted and there is no electronic active index to get around. Footnotes and various heading numbers and letters are all squashed into the paragraphs making the work almost impossible to read in places. It took me a while to realize that a footnote was inserted in the middle of the a paragraph and where the actual text picked up again!Hopefully someone will take time to make a useful kindle addition.

If you invest the time, it can be of some value, but it has no table of contents, is poorly organized, and the index is a waste of paper, because its page numbers do not correspond to the pages on this edition. For example, 'Apparent refusal' is discussed on page 962, but the book has less than 700 pages!It is too cryptic to be used for leisurely reading; its index is unusable and it has no table of contents.

The plot is ridiculous -- we're supposed to believe that a bunch of kidnapping monsters who torture their victims are here to \\"help\\" mankind? The government and military are portrayed as pure evil, coldly killing people left and right to maintain the conspirary. (How original.) The aliens are made out to be some sort of Machiavellian matchmakers in the mold of \\"Stefano\\" from \\"Days of our Lives.\\" I had to laugh at when they set up an affair between a married man and his boss to accomplish their \\"goals.\\" Overall entertaining but not in the way the author intended, I'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible","review":"Quite possibly the worst book I have ever read. I had to force myself to finish it, and it was painful. The first half of the book, though not especially well written, does almost promise a good story and a thought provoking conclusion. Neither are produced. I wanted the book to be good, but alas. It is written like the plot of any current ridiculous action TV show - nuff said.Give it a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"incoherent mess","review":"Pretty much everything about this book was very poorly done--the characterization, the supposed science, the plot, the descriptions, etc. Did anyone even edit this mess?

I could not put this book down, and was not disappointed at the end - it was PERFECT. Outstanding book and I recommend it especially to those that have also had encounters in their lives. And great, too, for those that just like good science fiction - but there is more than fiction here, as anyone that knows Whitley's work will realize. Read between the lines.

Usually we listen to XM radio while driving, because it assures us good, solid and steady reception. However, this time we purchased the audio book \\"The Grays\\" and listened to it the entire way. It was one of the greatest experiences we had. We found ourselves completely taken by the story. Normally Science Fiction isn't our topic of choice, but now we've been converted. We look forward to taking more trips with audio CDs in hand from Mr. Strieber, and others. We also hope that all of his titles will be converted to the audio format too.If your taking a road trip or just like to listen the audio CD is your best bet. It made our 16 hour trip interesting and quick. You won't fall asleep behhind the wheel listening to this title, and thats for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fiction book for sure!","review":"I read the first quarter of this book and put it away. The talk of the kids on the alien exam table seeing there own skins hanging in front of them turned me off. Dont feel its realistic, I think he tried to make up a story to sell books, I was hopeing for something a little more factual. For those of you that read communion Strieber seamed to think the alliens where friendly the ones in this story are down right demonic, communion was supposed to be non-fiction. This one I think is Strieber trying to make a buck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, front to back","review":"The character development was totally anemic. I was over halfway through the book and realized I didn't give a flip about anyone in the story, as I never got to know them.The only time the story kind of hits a smooth point, is when characters are alone, either reflecting or thinking to themselves. If you get two or more people talking at once everything gets scattershot.And the military scenes were simply laughable, as was about 90% of the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"The only reason I purchased this book was that it was suggested as a prequal to \\"2012\\". The two books have nothing to do with each other. It is written by Whitley Strieber who claims to be an alien abductee. There was so many muddled story lines they were to keep track of."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Grays","review":"I have an hour and half commute to work everyday to and fro.

It sounded good there and decided to check it out.Really good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started off good...","review":"The only previous work of Strieber's I had read was \\"Communion\\" 20 years ago. Truly spine tingling.\\"The Grays\\" seems to be a fictional account of something Mr. Strieber himself had gone through, but on a grander scale.The story starts off really well and is definitely a page-turner, but after a while, it just seems to fall flat. The ending is rather ambiguous and quite a letdown. By the time all is said and done, the reader doesn't really seem to care what has happened or what will happen to the characters of the story.The book also seems to be a sermon disguised as a work of fiction by Mr. Strieber as to what HE believes these \\"aliens\\" to be and why they are here (if, indeed they are even here at all - I am a true skeptic).All I can say is that I read a lot. When I finish one book, I pick up another. If a book is good, I may read twice more. If it's REALLY good, I will read it once a year or so. \\"The Grays\\", however, I read once and will probably not read it again ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Streiber has lost his talent","review":"Years ago I really enjoyed Whitley Streiber's novels. Wolfen, the hunger and Warday I found very compelling. Unfortunately these days I think he needs to find and pay attention to a good editor. This book's story wanders around his alien agenda but very few of the characters seem more than just cardboard. I found the 'resolution' to fall flat as well. Worth a buck or two to kill time in an airport but not much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot","review":"I like Whitley's stuff. But this one wasn't his best.

I could care less."},{"rating":"2","title":"He has done it again.~","review":"This is a great read. It gave me goosebumps and I had to leave the light on in my bedroom when I went to sleep. Not only fiction but knowing that much of it is based upon what the author claims to be truth is even more facinating. Well worth the price. !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Your Time","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Destiny's Song. The characters were so believable. Zay was one of a kind, this man knows how to love, too bad he is only fictional. It would be wonderful to met someone like Zay who is for real. Destiny was cool and I could relate to her. The storyline about an abusive boyfriend was so real for me.. I also love her friend Jacq it would be great to see her in her own story. This book is a must read. There is humor, suspense and drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quick Read that Combines Suspense, Romance, and Humor","review":"I read this book in two days and found it to be enjoyable. Not my usual genre, but I liked the characters, with my personal favorite being Jacq. I liked the two guys/one girl conflict in the story with one nasty man lingering in the background, and the reader knowing he will show up eventually. The song lyrics Ms. Louise wrote added a lot to the story. The final song lyrics she used at the end of the book were perfect and really contributed to what I found to be a satisfying ending to this novel. If you are looking to pick up a romantic read that will warm your heart on a cold, winter day, I recommend Kim Louise's, \\"Destiny's Song!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul Mate","review":"Kim Louise introduces the Allgood family to us by introducing the most diverse family member the handsome Xavier Allgood who is the multiplatinum songwriter and signer.

Do you really need a COMPLETE set!","review":"'The Complete, Fully Illustrated Works, Deluxe Edition' of lewis Carroll's works may actually be more than you really want. While three of Carroll's works, the two Alice fantasy novels and the long poem, 'The Hunting of the Snark' are major classics of English literature, Carroll wrote an equal or greater amount of pretty dull stuff, primarily the two 'Sylvia and Bruno' novels, which I have never been able to finish.My suggestion to all but the Carroll scholar and people who want to see his logical works is to buy the annotated versions of the two Alice novels and the annotated 'Snark', all annotated by Martin Gardiner. This way, you are also guaranteed of getting Henry Holiday's illustrations for 'The Hunting of the Snark', which are not in all 'Complete' collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good language book","review":"I have started my Chinese studies from an other language book during a language course, but after a time we have changed to New Practical Chinese Reader, which was far more better. Maybe those who have studied English as foreign language like me agree that this is a good book. Its main story is about some students studying in Beijing, and the lessons are about their life. From the very first lesson there are enjoyable conversations and useful phrases, so we can have the impression of a rapid progression which is important for guarding the motivation. The lessons have good structures and a good balance of texts and exercises, each lessons contains model phrases and explanation for the stroke order. It is easy to follow the instructions. There are not too much new words in one lesson, so one can manage to study them lesson by lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"One criticism of an otherwise excellent series","review":"I have been studying this series in class and privately for 3 + years now, and I am currently in book 4. The only wish I have is that I find the use of mainly a caligraphy-type font, while visually attractive, makes learning the characters a little harder, because many web sites, and newspapers use a different more \\"square\\", block style font. For me, it makes learning the characters harder, because one is more likely to run into the other style font on public signs ( I was in China for 20 days last summer) and in newspapers.So, if I were to redesign the book, I would mix up the style of the fonts to help the student get used to learning the characters as they appear in a variety of fonts.Otherwise, this is probably the best set of books for learning with a teacher or in a class. Also, the DVDs are excellent and well worth getting along with the CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whatta Voice!!!!","review":"When I was a kid in the late 60's I saw Terry Reid open up for Ten Years After at Fillmore West and it was the best show I've ever seen. Reid opened and closed the show, and walked out with the audience and sang in the streets with us at 2 a.m. I listened to his albums and was enthralled by his high, plaintive sad voice for years. I was amazed to see he was playing a little club in LA a few years ago, the Coconut Teazer, and I got a chance to have a beer with him and tell him what joy his music brought me. The last I heard of him was about 1992, when he was in an all-star band kind of thing with Joe Walsh. I guess he was living in LA for awhile. Yeah, don't listen to moron critics who put this guy down, he's one of the best singers who ever lived. Thanks for your music, Terry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth waiting for!","review":"I must of come close to buying this record a dozen times or so back in the late sixties. I had really enjoyed Terry's first release \\"Bang Bang\\" a lot. But everytime I went to buy this one there semed to be something else released that I wanted a little more, and my weekly allowance precluded the purchase of more than one album at a time. So I didn't hear this magnificent music until about a year ago. This is one of the all time great Brit-rock albums. Terry's singing and playing are leaps and bounds above that of his debut, and his songwriting is also stronger and more assured. There are no turkeys here either. \\"Silver White Light\\", \\"Mayfly', and a cover of Donovan's \\"Superlungs\\" are tracks that modern day lessers like Blur and Oasis can only dream about achieving. Don't wait 30 years like I did to hear this amazing talent. Get it now and get it good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch!","review":"After several months, I can still say I love my Hamilton watch! Was very difficult to find a watch under 40mm (today's watches range from large to ridiculous large). This watch at 38mm is perfect! Keeps very accurate time, and I very much like the stop-watch capabilities; the style gives it a retro look which is also very clean & easy to read.

There is something to like about all of their records, but Goo is the perfect amalgamation of sweet, subtle melodies, uncomfortable dissonance, driving beats and shimmering waves of distortion. \\"Dirty Boots\\" opens quietly, then crescendos into a charged rocker. Lee Renaldo's \\"Mote\\" is the aural equivalent of a windtunnel, and will part your hair - why doesn't he write more songs? The tense \\"Mildred Pierce\\" teases you into thinking it's an instrumental, then bursts into beautifully unadulterated chaos. More song-oriented and less jam-oriented than others, this album along with Dirty make up part of my \\"desert island\\" collection. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel it!","review":"Normally I can't stand the reissue but when it comes to Sonic Youth, you gotta let it slide.You have the record in it's remasted entiretity along with all the B-Sides from the \\"Goo\\" era of Sonic Youth.The liner notes are a nice touch.The Gem here is Disc 2... The demos of the songs that make up Goo. To see what the songs started as and to what they became is an amazing listening experience. What you want to do is listen to the demo and then the actual album version from Goo back to back and check out the care and craft that Sonic Youth goes into making a record. You hear these rough recordings and you get to see behind the curtain.

Drs Brooks and Winbery (the latter was my professor in college) show the reader how words change when placed in conjunction with other Greek words (all languages do this to a degree). This frustrates the early reader of Greek because when he comes to a word in the text he does not know, he will look it up in the lexicon but then won't be able to find it in the lexicon. Brooks and Winbery show *why* he won't find it. Even better, they tell you how the word \\"changed\\" and how to recognize the original word.A careful study of this text will dramatically improve the reader's knowledge of Greek and decrease his dependence on the lexicon.

Ravi is spectacular, Alla Rakha is unbelivable, especially on his solo, and the interplay between them at the climax of Raga Manj Khamaj is breathtaking.The three songs on the disc are not snippets, the shortest being over 8 minutes, and they require intent listening to appreciate, but it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Travesty In Blue","review":"A.

And this product is the worst purchase product I get so far.I bought it for my daughter's closet and wants to train her to get her own clothes in the morning. Idea of doubler is great, however this one's quality is way too poor. The metal contruction is very low quality, there are sharp edges/corners everywhere that make it not safe for kids room.Also, I am very hesitate to use it in my own closet. My silk blouse or sweater might get ruined by the sharp corner of the metal.So it end up being useless. I did not even try to return it due to a review of a previous buyer's return experience.Eventually I went to homedepot and bought a wood rod of 1 inch diameter and some safe plastic/rubber band to make one closet doubler myself and hang on the original hanging rod, which looks a lot more decent in the closet, and being a lot more stronger and very safe for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly","review":"I was very skeptical when I was purchasing this item.

Solution found. This is exactly what I needed - it does the job, it was under $10, I didn't have to leave the house to search stores for it, and it came with free shipping. Bonus that I could \\"assemble\\" it myself, it's so simple. It's a great, simple solution for the purpose that I need it for.Addressing some other concerns from other reviews I read:1) Sharp edges. I wouldn't say any of the edges are sharp. Probably not pleasant to rub against, but nothing that is dangerous or would snag clothes or hurt someone. Sometimes it's possible to worry too much.2) Top rung not having enough room to hang clothes. For hanging baby shirts and baby outfits this is not an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"This does the job, however the rod in my closet must be lower than \\"average\\". I had to raise up the lower hooks and now my shirts rest on the rod, I'm thinking the tanks in the picture are short as it is a bit deceptive. The metal is fairly sturdy, although the directions say 30lb maximum. Some purses have a lot of hardware on it so I woudln't recommend hanging heavy ones on the hooks (which are a bit small). I might give mine to my nice who can put it in her dorm closet and double her space. She's a size 0 so her shirts arn't as long as mine which would make this ideal for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"Just did an extensive remodel/addition to an older ranch house and ran out of moolah before doing any closet work.

I'm not sure what product they used to take the product's picture, but it couldn't have been the one that I bought!! Since I waited to use it until after the return period had passed, I'm just going to warn others from buying this garbage. I was fooled by the high ratings that just about everyone else gave it. Learn from my mistake, and DO NOT BUY THIS product. Sadly, this was my second attempt at getting a double rod in my kids' closets. The first attempt was made of plastic, and it amazingly lasted a year LONGER than this one. I put TWO, seriously, just TWO pieces of kid's clothing, and shirt and a pair of lightweight pants on it, and it fell to pieces. Even worse, I bought two of them, so I tried again. The second one was bent right out of the package, so I was completely hosed. It wouldn't even stay together at all. <Sigh> What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!!!","review":"DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON HANGING YOU SHIRTS ON TOP.IF YOU ANYTHING BUT A SIZE SMALL THEY WILL NOT FIT UP TOP.

Skirts, ladies shirts, pants (folded over a hanger). It is definitely worthwhile for my side of the closet, but my partner's Men's L & XL shirts reached the floor or got in the way of the bottom rung regardless of configuration. This is far better than other \\"doublers\\" I have tried, just be sure to measure the height of the bar you'll be hanging it from if you have particular clothing hanging needs.The metal construction seems durable and is able to hold quite a bit of weight. There was some rust/fade spots already showing through the chrome plating, but you get what you pay for and this is an inexpensive solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"This product is terrible - avoid. It isn't customizable to different heights - not enough anyway to make room for anything but very small clothes on top - short skirts perhaps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well in my daughter's closet","review":"I got this to put in my 4 year old's closet. She was pulling over a chair to get at her clothes. I hung this up and put her clothing on the bottom bar. Now she can pick her clothes without help and without climbing on any furniture. Additionally, I can put off season clothes up top and double the storage space in the closet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"This was very flimsy. The picture must be of toddler t-shirts as most of my clothes won't fit in it without hitting the bar. I have a doubler in my son's closet that was much more substantial. I didn't think this was worth the money. In the future I wouldn't pay more than $5 for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price and worked as needed","review":"Not much to this little device, but it was the right price and did the job. I love that the bottom bar can be set at different levels depending on how high or low you want it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will work for kids.","review":"Okay, look at the picture. Notice anything? Very small items hanging from the top rack. I wear 2x clothing and my wife is a size 4. She's tiny. Neither of our pants or shirts would hang above the lower rack or not drag the floor from the bottom rack. It does work for our 6 year old, but we have toy racks in his closet, and so we are sending it back. It got 2 stars because it was sturdy metal that won't sag with weight on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"In theory, this looks fantastic. And once you put it in your closet, it also seems like a great idea. And it is a great IDEA, but its a pain to actually use. The way it is made, it is very wobbly and doesnt stay in place. Basically, you have to have it just so, or it gets wonky, moves around and sometimes even falls off the rod. It would be great if the top and bottom actually screwed together making one rigid piece. But bascially the bottom rod just lays into the bottom, and it just shifts constantly.There are better made versions of this out there. We ended up chucking this and getting one at another local store. Because again, it is a fantastic way to get more space out of your closet, and especially good for kids clothes.So I gave it one 2-stars because this version stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"computer straps","review":"I put these on my TV and they are very easy to install.

I have returned 2 of these phones, and the 3rd one they sent to me doesn't work either! The handset buzzes when you talk into it, the time and date randomly stop working, now I can't dial out. I give up! I am looking for a new phone. After returning 2 of them I have no more time to invest returning the 3rd one and will throw this piece of junk in the garbage! I have avoided RCA products because of past trouble with their TV's, and this phone confirms me NEVER purchasing another RCA product again! DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great phone. It's going back.","review":"This is a well designed, attractive phone with nice features like separate headset and speaker buttons. Unfortunately, as other reviewers have noted, sound quality is only fair to poor. Frankly, I'm surprised that RCA would put its name on such a low quality instrument. I'd gladly pay more for a high quality home office speakerphone, but I haven't yet found one. I do not recommend this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interference is a huge problem...","review":"I've got to admit that I liked this phone quite a bit for it's functionality and design. For the most part, the phone worked quite well...when it was working. Unfortunately, as mentioned in the other reviews, interference seems to be a huge issue with this phone. Data activity on my Blackberry Curve (T-Mobile) kept causing this phone to go crazy. It would simply erase all of my addressbook entries and the settings. I've tried calling RCA/Thompson about it, but they don't seem to think that it is an issue with their phone at all. They had a few suggestions for me, but none of them seemed to have fixed the problem. I tried all of their suggestions on 2 of these phones.I'm going to have to pass on this phone for sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CRUEL STEVE","review":"I love Steve Martin. I think he's a brilliant, witty, philosophical and totally entertaining writer. I guess that's why I was disappointed in this book.

Steve Martin is not known for logic, he is famous for being so hilarious. Now once you put your normal brain aside, read this book. It is truly brilliant and hilarious. I picked this up at a local book store for 5 bucks, and I was glad I got it. This is a really good read and a must have for any Steve Martin fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Things Not to Be","review":"In my opinion there is no funnier book than this if you either picture him reading it or read it aloud as though you were reading a classic work of literature to a group of people. It is the uniqueness of this book from anything Steve has done and really from anything else that make it a classic itself.This is a collection of short stories with equal parts philosophy, comedy, and nonsense. You need imagination and some wit, but these are qualities that fans of Steve Martin are likely to possess."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book truly reshaped my view of the world!","review":"In fourth grade, while my classmates played kickball, I sat by myself on the swings and read Steve Martin's \\"Cruel Shoes\\" (heck - I was always picked last anyway!). From the first time I read about \\"The Day the Dopes Came\\", I was an instant fan. Martin taught me to look at the world from an absurdist perspective. I no longer cared what my classmates thought of me! They're all a bunch of turds anyway (see Martin's \\"Turds from Turdsmania\\" article). Bless you Steve!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of Steve Martin","review":"I love Steve Martin's stand-up and movies, but his writing is hit or miss for me. Neither jokes nor stories, Cruel Shoes is a collection of abstract incomplete thoughts that don't amount to much more than a couple flashes of cleverness. On the other hand, it takes a slow reader like me 30 minutes to get through and it is available used from $1.29, so if you're a Steve Martin fan and you want to check it out, you don't have much to lose.Just when I was ready to write off Steve Martin as a writer, I picked up his two most recent books (Shopgirl and The Pleasure of My Company) and liked them a lot. The Pleasure of My Company is actually funny, and Shopgirl is interesting without really being funny. I would recommend those instead of or in addition to Cruel Shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pictures of Martin and text written in the typical absurd style of Steve Martin","review":"This book contains a lot of pictures of Martin at a typewriter looking sad, disillusioned and suffering from a creative crisis. It also contains a series of short pieces written in the usual absurd Martin style. The title comes from a clerk at a shoe store who coaxes people into buying \\"cruel shoes\\", shoes so bad that they make your feet bleed.Sometimes even the titles are absurd, as in \\"Sex Crazed Love Goddesses\\" which is a story about a boy going to the store to buy stamps. There is nothing other than that in the story. \\"The Boring Leading the Bored\\" is about a meeting of logicians and metaphysicists where things go extremely wrong. Absurd and occasionally hilarious in the Martin style, this is a comedy book unlike any other."},{"rating":"2","title":"a few words on steve martin's CRUEL SHOES","review":"with CRUEL SHOES, comic Steve Martin showed the world that he was more than a guy with an arrow through his head. this book is a collection of short stories released during Martin's extremely popular \\"white-suited, wild and crazy\\" stand-up routine phase. the cornerstone of this work is the piece that lends its name to the book. in it, a sadistic shoe salesperson hocks his painful ware on finicky cutomers, who, in turn, love the tremendous pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lowbrow and Dumb","review":"I like Steve Martin but this book is just plain awful. Lowbrow and extremely stupid in both it's concept and delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible! -- unless for new readers of Self Help Psych Books..","review":"This book is great for a person who's never read a psychology book. Maybe for the self-help newbie this is a great book that will let a person feel all warm and fuzzy but I was looking for something better. Original thought and clarity are missing and the numbered mottos at the back remind me of political slogans - simply slogans. It feels like the author took his clinical notes, changed patient's names and popped the stories into a book. The book's organization is not clear. It feels like one chapter rolls into the next. As I read the kindle edition I fast forwarded at one point... My suggestion..save your money, buy a used one that's hard-copy or pass altogether. Definitely a disappointment"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspiration for Women in MMA","review":"This movie is Great! It gives me a perspective of what goes on for women in and out of the cage.

It ocmes with a hardback, album sized book with awesome artwork by Patrick Woodruff. the music in this CD is mellow, flightly and synthesized. Like I said, the book of art is well worth the price of this. I picked it up one day in a record store for $50 because I thought the album cover looked so cool ... that was back in 1979 in Great Lakes while in the Navy. It was a great investment. Mine is vinyl! I will get the CD eventually!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ageless concept, more than just art or just music.","review":"Having the record(now unplayable), the tape (likewise) the digitally remastered CD brings back the clarity, atmosphere and the talent of Greenslade/Woodruffe into sharp focus. For a twenty year old project (made in 1979) the music has not aged, the artwork still ground breaking (though now in a 5 inch reduced softback with the CD) and the concept can hold with the best of the PC games now in vogue. PC game music it is not, more of a twinned art form that will lift the spirits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the companion book too ...","review":"For those of you who enjoyed the art in the LP format, rather than the minuaturized version in the CD - the art was repackaged in an expanded edition called \\"The Second Earth: The Pentateuch Revisited.\\" And of course, you can get it heare at Amazon (I hope the link works...)http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1850280436/102-6544991-5512126?v=glance&n;=283155&n;=507846&s;=books&v;=glanceIt makes a great companion to the CD version, and ignore the one review posted, it has nothing to do with the Biblical PentateuchEnjoy!Randy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spaced Out","review":"This is AWSOME. I give it 4 stars - but that's only for the book. Patrick Woodroffe is a well known illustrator of cook covers for Michael Moorcock. The first portfolio of his I ever got was \\"Mythopoeikon\\". He also did the cover for the Greenslade album \\"Time and Tide\\".The music howere is a curate's egg. Good in parts. Those parts that are not so good, luckily are smaller than the better pieces.Greenslade came via Collosseum, forming his own band then vanished. This is certainly worth getting BUT....yes you knew it was comming. There is always a BUT. I would suggest that if you get this then try as hard as you can to get a vinyl version. The book illustrations are fantastic. A CD booklet would not do them justice.You could accuse Greenslade of being over pretentious on this album and creating noodly, electronic music of a dubious nature.Definatly worth the money, if for the book alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another page-turning saga from Danielle Steel","review":"Comprehensive page-turning saga that is definitely one of Steel's better stories, although I have started to read all of them.

A few of the songs are more pop-y and I don't think the style suits her. All in all though, she still has an amazing voice and I'm glad i bought this."},{"rating":"2","title":"She Just Keeps Getting Better","review":"I bought this one expecting a letdown, especially after two superb efforts in Nue and En Toute Intimite. Pleasant surprise - Lara did it again. This time with different musical arrangements and great songs that depend less on the power of her voice and bring out her full array of talents. Lara laid one egg on this album - Les Homericains. But the rest of the eggs are all golden ones. I especially liked La Lettre, Ave Maria and Speranza (she's part Italian, so maybe that explains...).

Yes, the inside of the case has ripped lining in a few places and a sticky hinge. Yes, the case is dented all over on the outside. Yes, the locks REALLY suck.But I knew all that when I bought this set. The other reviews will say the same. I still bought the set, knowing this, because for me, it doesn't matter, and it's way more fun to play with poker chips than it is to play with coins. For less than $30, what more can you ask? The chips still work as poker chips. Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Product","review":"The chips are not all that good. There are few which don't have smooth surfaces. They have some edges that you can see for products that are not very well finished.Also, the case was broken when it arrived. Most of the partitions had all come off. It might have been because of mishandling while shipping, bu the packaging was definitely not good either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chips OK, Case is TERRIBLE","review":"The chips are just ok. If you don't know what you are looking for in a poker chip you probably will not notice the uneven cut or feel to these chips. The case came dented and some of the rivets were bending, with the case cracking around them. This case was advertised to \\"last a lifetime\\" - yeah right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon can't get this to my door without it being damaged","review":"I ordered this poker set and the trim pieces on the case were dented or fell off. I sent it back and Amazon sent me a replacement. The replacement arrived in even worse condition. This time the case had a hole in the corner so big you can see the chips. Hey Amazon, try bubble wrapping this item before putting it in the box. A little crumpled paper doesn't protect it. I'm sending this back and getting a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just don\`t buy it","review":"i give this product one star because it\`s the minimum, terrible product, the chips where dirt, the briefcase was broken, becaus it\`s not aluminium it's like corrugated cardboard with some paint. the briefcase came with the dice space not the blinds space.

Aluminum case came with a dented frame2. Interior of case looks very cheap3.

The chips are the important part and they sound good. I would have preferred chips with more pronounced ridges for stacking, but these don't show any of the color variations or visible insert issues that other reviewers have noted. The case is nice. I had to bend a couple of things back into place, but still an excellent value. The cards are good for solitaire, and get the point across that the case is designed to carry everything you need for a poker game but the table. I wouldn't hesitate to take this to the neighbor's house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!","review":"I can't believe how heavy this set is! I thought my roommate ordered something when I picked up the box and found it was my poker set. Love the clay clinking noise of the chips, great quality carrying case. The cards are cheap, so what. Buy new cards.Definitely the best deal on poker sets with amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Do not buy this set. The price looks good, but you get what you pay for. Mine arrived and looked good at first, but it became clear that the case is absolute junk. There was a hole in it, I assume from where a screw was supposed to be. Although it looks like metal, it's actually cardboard, inside and out! The painting on the chips is inconsistent, and the whole kit smells like cigarette smoke. If I wasn't hosting a big tournament this week I would have returned it. Absolute garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for the price","review":"Poker chips are nice...pretty good value for the price...the case is decent...not extremely sturdy but does the job...would recommend thisproduct.."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"this product is poor quality the paint is sloppy and the chip weight is wrong I'm keeping them because I don't have time to get more very displease with this product"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not received yet","review":"I am still waiting for my purchase and I have thus not received it yet, so can not review the item.

I relied on some of the discussion I saw that stated the VHS version contained the deleted scenes not available on DVD. There should be some mention by the seller what version he is selling otherwise the buyer may be purchasing something he or she does not want.

I was excited when I saw the \\"deleted scenes\\" section on the back of the dvd case because I was lead to believe that these were the scenes deleted from the director's cut version and place on the back side of the disc. I was very disappointed that the deleted scenes were from the original movie (original release). These scenes are essential to the entire telling of the movie. My recommendation: DO NO PURCHASE THIS MOVIE ON DVD! - at least not until a new version with the \\"deleted scenes\\" replaced back into the original format, but I won't hold my breath for it to happen.

When the movie first came out on video I ran out and bought it. Man was I upset. They had cut most of the scenes I had seen in the theater. So they came out with a Directors Cut VHS... Beautiful. Figuring DVD is the wave I expected the cut scenes to be in the movie. No... as an add on. How hard would it have been to just put them in the movie.

If you need some background while you do something else, it's okay. Don't be upset that I don't own this SciFi movie. I saw it when it was originally released at the theater. At that time I thought the graphics were great, but it just didn't grab my attention and hold it. I didn't mind going to the lobby for a soda, popcorn, hot dog, nachos, restroom, check out movie posters, make a phone call,... The problem is the story got to wrapped up in the lawnmower mans psyche. That would be okay if it was thought provoking, but it is mostly graphical halucinations and sexual innuendo. Not that illuminating into the characters motivations. One thing stands out in this movie. Some great early CGI. If you feel the need to see one of them catch this one, the second is much worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy crap, this is one awful movie!","review":"This is only one of 4 or 5 movies where I actually walked out in the middle of a screening. I saw it as part of a double feature at a budget theatre and still I felt that I had been ripped off, it was that bad. I respect Jeff Fahey's talents as an actor, but he should be ashamed to have his name attached to this piece of crap, as should Stephen King (although I guess he really had very little to with this movie's production).The world would be well-served if all prints of this movie could be destroyed.

Essentially it's the Frankenstein story updated for a more modern generation, but it also makes a statement about technology and how it's development could possibly bring about our own undoing. The cast is very good, the effects are rather remarkable and this DVD transfer looks excellent. The only qualm is in regards to handling the missing scenes as DVD 'extras' rather than include them in the picture like the superior VHS director's cut.

Unfortuanately, 1 star is as low as I could go.In this version, Dr. Angelo did not think of using Jobe because of his unfortunate accidental meeting with the violence crazed chimpanzee. The priest ws not so evil that he sold Jobe to Dr. Angelo for a donation to the church (and therefore deserve what he got). Jobe did not absorb hundreds of CDs learning the violent history of mankind and then decide that maybe he needed to protect mankind from itself.

Two excellent actors take a stab at an interesting concept -- computer aided learning. What went wrong? A horrid script. Some lazy writer turned this into a boring romp through goofy computer- generated vengeance. The physical effects (or physical components) are simply horrible. This is yet another technophobe flick, and it amazes me that so many computer-philes approve of this drivel. It is as bad or worse than those retarded god- complex star trek episodes.

However, I was very disappointed at the lack of scholarship and knowledge the author presented. Information that has been know to and practiced by music therapy for years was presented as if the author had discovered a new profession.Music therapy is the prescribed by professional music therapist that undergo a great deal of education, training, and clinical experience. The author is not a music therapist. I was disappointed at the author's pretend expertise on a subject he is not well educated in.I recommend that anyone seriously interested in the healing effects of the drum, check out some of the great research and literature out there by REAL music therapists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't recommend it","review":"I got this stroller in late 2009 and I didn't know what I was looking for, so I thought lightweight would be best for a jogger stroller. However, who cares if it's lightweight because this stroller is hard to use. It is:-hard to fold down/close-very uncomfortable for baby (my son always cried sitting in it, finally I put a blanket down for him to sit on so he could bare it)-the cup holder is too small. This SUCKS for someone who wants to put a water bottle in it for jogging! Now I put the water bottle in the bottom basket, but I can't reach it when I'm jogging.-uncomfortable straps for child, that are also hard to use and adjust- no drink tray for babyI seriously recommend not buying this. It's even been discontinued on their website, along with all their strollers designed like this. They now design their strollers without all the things I just mentioned probably because nobody liked them."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT jogger except...","review":"This is a great jogger for it's price.....It's lightweight and folds easily and was easy to assemble. All three wheels come off quickly so it can be packed into smaller trunks or spaces. The seat is roomy enough for a good sized/older toddler and the hood gives adequate coverage. It moves along great while speedwalking/jogging but does pull to the left a bit...though not enough to be a huge bother. The only cons: the slight pull to the left, the cup holders are pretty much useless, and the harness system could be designed better. The straps aren't padded and the strap/loop that the belt straps go though at the crotch is very short. All in all, I'm happy with the jogger and would recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"This video was far too short and simplistic","review":"By the time I was settled into watching the video it was over.

Cyborg never says , \\"Boo-Yah!\\" in these books and is a Major in the Serious army (there is no serious army, that is a figure of speech!, acts a little like Robin in the show, and only plays video games once, and that is when all the boys are playing.

The Panini maker now seems to be at the highest temperature because everytime I plug it in it begins to smoke (yes, smoking with clean plates on it...so it has to be pretty hot) after only two minutes. The adjustable temp was a great idea, but it seems to cause problems for a lot of people.

Ours worked great for 6 months and then the top element stopped working. Upon further inspection after taking the unit apart, it became readily apparent that all of these units will eventually fail; it's just a matter of time. The wire used is simply too small and the heat that builds up will quickly take its toll on the cheap components inside. The unit is actually pop-riveted together to keep the average homeowner from knowing what's under the hood. Unfortunately, it's so poorly constructed that it's not worth attempting to repair the burned up parts.

The book is well written, and the characters were pleasing, although I thought Faith was not being true to her character as presented in earlier books in the series. Agatha Christie used to say that a mystery writer must play fair with his or her readers. All of the evidence and the clues must be laid out for the reader to try to solve the mystery before the author resolves it. To do otherwise is to cheat the reader who has invested time in reading the book. No reader had a chance to solve this mystery unless by sheer guessing. Once the murderer is revealed, the reader realizes that it really could have been anyone, and all the clues have meant nothing. I was very disappointed, so I will think twice about getting any of her new books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unpredictable Ending","review":"A little slow moving however, but would never habe guessed the ending.

It will probably be the last. While the premise seemed interesting, the book is overdrawn and one of the subplots is highly unecessary. There is absolutely no suspense whatsoever.

Called Nextar cust svc, they said it was defective. So I sent it back to J&R and asked for a replacement (because I really, really, hate how my MP3 wires get tangled in my gym bag). So the good folks at J&R send me a brand-new replacement and I'm very excited. Charge and set up, then find that on/off button is broken (i.e., no way to turn it on or listen to ANYTHING).

I tried tying them together on the back so that they would be close to my head, otherwise they are like 1cm away from my ears;so uncomfortable! Sound quality is not bad and it has easy control buttons. But of course you cant see whats playing and you cant choose an order of playing.

The book comprehensively assesses all primary sources hitherto used by Stauffenberg's previous biographers, plus many additional sources which the author himself found. Hoffmann's previous books, among them 'THE HISTORY OF THE GERMAN RESISTANCE, 1933-1945', and 'HITLER'S PERSONAL SECURITY' serve as a foundation to this work which, all told, spans 30 years of scholarly research. As the depth and breadth of this study eclipses any other attempt to date, its conclusions are unassailably judicious.

The title song, \\"Subway,\\" and \\"Baby Baby\\" are about as good as Valenti's songs get, but most of the rest is either forgettable (\\"Spindrifter,\\" \\"All in My Mind\\") or junk (\\"Long Haired Lady,\\" \\"Good Old Rock and Roll\\").

Standout names in the band are John Cipollina on guitar, Dino Valente (also known as \\"Chet Powers\\", writer of \\"Get Together\\") doing lead vocals, David Freiberg also on guitar, and Nicky Hopkins (SF's pianist of choice) on piano.

I felt the atheist in the one showwas exposed to one kind of christain faith.so this athiest , if looking at say, the catholic or Protestant faith, may assume all christianitybelieves in the same things.

They still smelled awful, really nauseating. I wouldn't be able to use them on food, especially not to stir delicately flavored sauces and the like.

I use it for ESL teaching as well as for native speakers developing their writing skills. The book is also well designed, with spacing that makes the text friendly and accessible rather than daunting.

This book will make anyone who reads it think of themselves are someone they know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here comes the social Commentary","review":"This book is a lot of fun. Totally different from Baker's Company books, it is a mix of fantasy and social commentary though really it's fairly light on magic sorcery, what we have is magic/mystical destiny. One the plus side it's funny as hell, showing a deft sure touch for dialog and situation that Baker is a master of, on the minus side it doesn't really flow like a novel. More like three long short stories, GOOD ones, but very distinct."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spare fantasy tale of two odd families","review":"I picked this up cheap (free, if memory serves) for my Kindle, and it turned out to be one of the best low-cost pieces I've read. Baker creates an intriguing world with both fantasy and steampunk nuances, and populates it with a gaggle of interesting characters loosely organized into 2 unusual families. The book is really 3 individual but interconnected stories, and each is worth a read. The protagonist, known only as Smith, begins the tale as a man shrouded in mystery, and each subsequent tale adds pieces of information to his backstory, until in the end we discover his true heritage and he is faced with a monumental choice. Baker writes cleanly, with a nicely descriptive but spare style that fleshes out the story only as much as is necessary without bogging down the reader with unneeded clutter. I would definitely recommend this one - it's worth a read by anyone with a taste for good fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"The Kage Baker excels at creating societies and characters that have the complexity and compelling reality of today's news and yet are full of the exotic color and flair that marks the best speculative fiction. I found this to be full of fun, wit and comic irony. I would definitely recommend it, and hope she continues work in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amusing diversion.","review":"Anvil of the World is a very pleasant, lightweight fantasy. Fans of Baker's Company series will enjoy her continued homages to cinema and her knack for humorous twists, although they may miss the bittersweet edge of the previous series. Her new protagonist, the aptly-named Smith, is hiding from a past he would prefer to forget when he is volunteered by his cousin to lead a caravan from Troon to Salesh. Adventures ensue, of course. Most of the world and fantasy elements (demons, planes, gods, green humans that strongly resemble grouchy elves) appear to have been expropriated from a tipsy late-night session of Dungeons and Dragons. The book's weakest section is the end, where Baker introduces a serious spin, and possibly an excuse for a sequel. Those who enjoy humorous fantasy will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Added to my list!","review":"I read a lot of science fiction as you can see from my reviews over on Audible: everything from Niven to China Mieville to Abercrombie on the dark fantasy shelf, and some Scalzi thrown in for kicks and giggles. So, I was delighted to find a new voice that fits in there somewhere, near the crossroads of reality and epic adventure. Pendulum opens with a strong hook, but it was the heartfelt characters that kept me reading and how well the very different points of view blended into the narrative. Good read if you like sci-fi.

In this collection, three major themes are explored: Carruth's coming death, his marriage to a much younger woman, (and her fate after he is gone) and the cancer of his adult daughter. Carruth weaves these themes and others into a series of poems which, although outwardly simple in terms of language and style, really penetrate the mysteries of life and death. Of course, death is the main character here, but Carruth is rounded enough in his view to see redemption everywhere, especially in death's nemesis, love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sufficient Rock Music","review":"Perhaps Neon Handshake shines a bit brighter than this album on many levels.

Enna Burning is a gorgeous tale, and though The Goose Girl could easily stand on its own, I really enjoyed hearing more from Enna, Isi's stubborn, tomboyish best friend. I loved how Shannon Hale changed her voice slightly to match Enna's rougher, less refined personality. Enna's journey is just as refreshing and inspiring as Ani's, and the ending is satisfying.

Though the reasons for her actions were convincing, I wasn't entirely comfortable with how often Enna chose to do what she knew was wrong.

I popped them into my camera, took photos of the sunrise which took all of about 30 mins and looked at the battery life and it was already depleted 50%! Needless to say I have about one more shoot of battery life so I'm using it sparingingly. All I have to say is you get what you pay for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with retailer","review":"The batteries were opened when they arrived, not worth the hassle to return.

I dont recomended this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find a different brand","review":"OK, this is about the worst battery I ever used. I bought a couple of dozen from a reputable supplier with a 10 year shelf life. By the end of the first year whatever was unused had little battery life.

They didn't work at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Product awful seller","review":"The batteries are fine, the seller is a thief!!! They charged me $1.47 for 3-packs of batteries and $23.+ for shipping ??? you do the math. I could have just walked into a store and bought them for that price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"These lasted two charges. I mailed them back for a replacement, which took months, and those failed as well. Wait for a more reputable company to make this type of rechargable. Otherwise, you can find them for as little a $1 each on ebay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off!","review":"Although the product is as advertised, I did not know until after its purchase (because shipping was bundled with another item) that the shipping costs greatly exceeded the cost to purchase a similar item at regular retail price at any store. I am disappointed with Amazon that each item's cost and shipping is not itemized BEFORE actual purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same price, worse performance","review":"I bought the Ultralast 2-pack as a filler item. Out of the box, one cell measured 100% on myZTS testerand the other one measured 80%. Not acceptable, AND hazardous to use in 2-cell lights (the weaker battery can burst and start a fire).It is not hard to find Energizer, Duracell, Panasonic, or Rayovac CR123A batteries online for about $2.00 each. Or even off-brand Titanium or Battery Station for $1.00 each. But every cell from these manufacturers shows 100%, in my experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain lousy batteries...","review":"I bought several packages of these to use in a smoke detector. I was tired of running out to the store for a new Duracell every few months, and at half the price, I figured, if they don't last quite as long, what's the harm?As opposed to the Duracell, which lasted six months in my smoke detector, I have had to change these batteries once every 3-4 WEEKS. Judging from the number of positive reviews, perhaps other devices are better matched to these batteries, or possibly there's just really poor quality control. Either way, I wouldn't recommend these to anyone for any critical application."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR USE IN FLASHLIGHTS","review":"Package bears a sticker saying 'NOT FOR USE IN FLASHLIGHTS.\\" Of course, you see this sticker only *after* the item has been delivered. Funny that Amazon pairs it with a flashlight... My Duracell 123's do *not* carry such warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Not for use in flashlights\\"","review":"I bought these for a new LED flashlight back in Jan 2010. Upon receiving the batteries, you will see a simple note haphazardly taped to the package: \\"Not for use in flashlights.\\" No mention of this limitation on the Amazon product page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Date Batteries from Amazon","review":"The reason these batteries were so reasonable is that they expired several months before they were delivered. And there is no way to contact Amazon other than to return them which would cost as much or more than the cost of the batteries. There should be some other way to get Amazon to replace them without having to send them back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very short battery life","review":"I got these to replace the batteries in a flashlight I purchased last year. While I forget the brand of the original batteries, they lasted for nearly six months of low to moderate use, plus a few more months in storage. Under similar use patterns, this product lasted less than one month. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"fine replacement for the price","review":"Brand name (starts with a D) costs twice as much as these 3v batteries. So i got two packs. They seem to work just as well as the brand name batteries and last just about as long. No big noticeable difference. Satisfied with the batteries.I was concerned these were PhotoLithium since I'm using them in a LED/Xenon flashlight but they seem to work just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T RENT THIS, IT IS NOT THE WHOLE SEASON!","review":"Beware! I rented this and it is not the whole season. It is only episode 1 and 2! I did enjoy it, but am giving it 1 star to keep people away until Amazon fixes this mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool","review":"The Tyde are a band that has been kicking around in LA for a while. They have a huge UK following. I have seen them play with Brian Jonestown Massacre. In fact, they are doing a big tour with BJM this fall. Now we have the third album. It sounds a little like Beachwood Sparks and Frausdots, some previous side projects for this group. On this album we have some brothers in crime, like Conor Deasy from The Thrills, and Mickey Madden of Maroon 5. One of the best songs is \\"Brock Landers.\\" Listening to this album again, there is few weak moments. It may be there most accessible yet. Halfway through it becomes more like Spiritualized. Another favorite of mine is \\"County Line\\" which is almost like a Canned Heat song. The James Figurine remix is pretty interesting. This is a pretty cool record. I lived in Southern California half of my life. I never surfed and barely know how to swim. With this album I can imagine what it is like being out there on a wave in the sun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Didn't I Know This","review":"I was amazed by the amt of information on our Black Founding Fathers and their role in the Revolution that I was never taught in school.

All Democrats, for example, are pushers for abortions, especially among blacks. It is, or so it seemed the author was writing, the Republican party since the Civil War has been the party for the less advantaged; it has been the party that supported civil rights etc. ALL Republicans support the sanctity of human life. NO Democrats do.

It is very much a book only about African American history. If you were looking for something more middle of the road that shows the flaws that our kids learn in history class these days, this book is not for you. It doesn't exactly \\"set the record straight\\". It merely amplifies what we are forced to hear about everyday. Overall a disappointing read for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading waste of paper","review":"After reading other reviews, I was looking forward to an informative account of overlooked Afro-American contributions to American history. What I got was a pro-Republican pro-Christian anti-Democrat diatribe.This is not an attempt to \\"set the record straight\\" - it's propaganda and a complete waste of time and paper.I very rarely throw away books even if I disagree with the author, but this is such trash that I threw my copy in the recycling bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous view of history","review":"Barton is a bigot and has singularly done more to poorly influence my Texas State Board of Education than any other man alive. Do not buy his book. Do not encourage this injustice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading at Best","review":"I was totally mislead by the title of this book. It is an opinionated work be the author. It uses a proud section of American citizens to flagrantly advance the self serving opinions of the author and attack our constitutional right to privacy, religious choice, and is a gross misuse of our heroic citizenry. Had the author stuck to history and set the record straight for Blacks and Whites it could be useful. However to use it as a political and religious platform to set out his political agenda is at best disingenuous! I would return the book as \\"not as described and misleading\\" but I fear it might be sold to some other unsuspecting soul. So.... I will trash it instead.

EXCELLENT READ"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"This reads like a propaganda piece with some truths mixed in. I was hoping for a history of black leaders and heroes of our great country. I know there were numerous black founding fathers and heroes and this book does touch on them and contributions of blacks through the years but this is more about how they were stamped out of history and who is to blame. Not interested in a blame game book. Gives us the facts please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Setting the Record Straight: American History in Black & White","review":"Excellent source of information. Read this book if you want to learn formerly unknown facts about the founders of our country. Should be required reading for all students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad but true","review":"This little book was very interesting. Could not believe the democratic abuse of blacks and started to check all the information on my own. Very sad but true. Learned so much about black history. Obsviously written by a conservative but well worth the read"},{"rating":"2","title":"American History Never Told","review":"This little book is quite heavy in true American History that for some odd reason we were never taught, especially in the public school system. Shame on that system for erasing precious American History that elevates a race of people to equality in all respects. Black Americans should be furious and demand reparations in all history books immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truths that need to be heard","review":"I've been a student of history all my life, and was blown away by what I learned in this book that I've never elsewhere seen before.It is a rapid read, and one you simply must share with others. Understanding the truth of race relations will build a better \\"united\\" view of the United States.You will be enlightened by this book.I will warn there is a political bias (but one based entirely on the facts - facts carefully glossed over and hidden these days. The praises heaped on segregationist/KKK wizard/U.S. Senator Robert Byrd after his death is a prime example of glossing over these facts.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good history, but far too partisan.","review":"The historical context is very interesting, and certainly filled with facts that I was previously unaware of (and glad I am now aware of). However, the book becomes cumbersome to read because it quickly turns from what should be about black history into a \\"democrats are racist, republicans are not\\" essay. There are far too many jabs at democrats to give this anything close to an objective feel and almost makes me think the title should be \\"Democrats hate black people\\".It's a good book for showing some American black history, but feels too partisan to make it as enjoyable a read as it should be. There are likely much better options for a quick black history lesson from the Revolutionary War through the 1960s (though I don't know of any, so if you do feel free to let me know)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book the Democrat Party Must Hate!!!!!!","review":"Great Book! I like most with a Public School education never heard of Most of the People in this book and I find it sad that this part of our History has been rewritten and obscured But then again I can see the reasoning behind it, If you can't Victimize a people how can you Control them."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"This is a great book.

Now I'm debt-free, I have a healthy IRA, I just bought a house, and I'm working on starting a business next year.It's not that the book does everything for you; it's just a good, easy to understand tool for anyone who's sick of being broke and feeling helpless.

They're logical, solidly researched and well written. I got this book as a graduation present and am apalled that a woman would actually write such lightweight fluff and try to pass it off as good financial advice. The only substantive thing in this book is the overabundance of exclamation points! I believe that women can make great strides financially but not with inconsequential books like this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent first work","review":"In general, I found this book to be an excellent primer for those in need of an explanation of the various instruments of personal finance. Despite what else you may read in these reviews, the text is well written and the chapters are logically organized. While it may not be helpful for finance professionals or for those with overly delicate sensibilities to misperceived pedantry, my mother, sister and friends--both male and female--found it useful. I commend Ms. Goodman both for her work on this book and for tolerating those who would criticize from the sidelines. I eagerly look forward to reading her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three thumbs up!","review":"This book is great. People who think it talks down to women don't get the joke (and they can't seem to spell condescending). Goodman's book has lots of useful information. And what's all this about the author being old? Don't put her in the grave yet; she's only about 35 and with her wit and creativity, I'm certain she could run circles around you bitter 25 year-olds writing these ridiculous reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Author Gives Out-Of-Date Advice","review":"Like having your great grandmother try to tell you about financial markets based on the crash of 1929.

A horrendously written book, with no substance but with an overabundance of exclamation points !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Valley Girl Gives Money Advice, For Sure!","review":"It's very hard to take this book seriously. The author talks down to the reader by using overused cliches and excessive punctuation, especially exclamation points! Growing up my daddy always told me \\"only take money advice from people who can express themselves intelligently (this author sure doesn't) and be sure to check out their motives\\" (apparently this book is written by a woman trying to pass herself off as a \\"valley girl\\" which would make my daddy question her motives).

As a man I am stunned that anyone would pass this condascending book off as being good for girls. No one would ever try to sell a book like this to boys and I'm sorry I bought this for my daughters.

It really did show me how to invest my hard-earned money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good information despite some cheesiness","review":"Initially it was a little hard to get past all the girl talk, but I found that this book really does have some good information. It pretty much teaches you the basics. It doesn't get very in depth, but it allows you to become familiar with investing concepts. I knew virtually nothing about investing before I read this book. But I feel like I now have a good basic knowledge of investing, which will now allow me to read other more advanced books on investing. I would recommend this book for the beginner just wanting to get familiar with all their different options and investing terms and ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I had had this book when...","review":"I wish I had had this book long ago when girls were simply expected to let guys handle the money business.

I recommend it highly. I especially liked Goodman's deconstructing of various investment pages and her on-line research recommendations. If you need a 'friend' to help you take financial control and give you some good advice...Goodman is a good choice. If you are already a financial pro or take these thing very seriously...this many not be the choice for you.

When I was just out of school I just couldn't be bothered with investing. If I had a little extra cash, it didn't go to a 401k, it went to beer and cigarettes. After reading this book, I'm starting to realize how much that stuff cost me...Ouch, were those beer bottles made out of crystal!Anyway, this book puts many terms and concepts into language that's easy for me to understand. I would enthusiastically recommend this book to recent graduates and other blissfully ignorant people like me.I must admit, I used to be embarassed by how much I didn't know.

It actually worked great...until, one month later, one of the adapters broke down. Funny thing is that neither Amazon nor Netgear could give me a feasible solution to exchange the faulty product. Now I have to send this thing back to the US, so they can declare it faulty and give me an exchange (or a refund). Amazingly, Netgear has a tech support in Buenos Aires....that, of course, cannot take part in this claim, because the item wasn't purchased in south america.Bottom line...if you don't live in the US, don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"I live in a very old house with lath and plaster walls that give my wireless network fits.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised, with certain conditions","review":"I was able to get very usable (solid and high bandwidth) connections with these units.Performance will depend heavily on how your ac lines are wired, though. For example, I did not get a usable connection on outlets in the basement or top floor that faced an outside wall. (The connection would get slow or drop out entirely.) It may have been the circuit that those outlets were on. Moving to a different outlet solved the issue.If you have a situation where you can't run a hard LAN line, these units can be the next best thing... and way better than a wireless connection, too. I'm able to reliably pull an HDTV stream, and consistently getting low ping's on games."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works Great","review":"My wife always uses my computer and screws it up playing games, I have to re-boot to get it back on line. So we had an older decent PC which I hooked up in another room for her. I had the cable company install a WiFi modem but it had a very poor connection, so I tried a larger booster antenna and still no luck. I researched on line and decided to try the Netgear XE103G. It is the greatest thing. You just plug one unit into the wall socket and plug in the supplied wire from the modem to the xe103 wall unit. Go to the other computer plug the xe103 into the wall socket and hook up the supplied wire from the wall unit to an input port on the 2nd computer, run the software CD in each computer and Bam it workes great. This was so easy and a great achievement for me I decided to write this to help others like me. You probably will need the XE103G which has the 2 units as a kit as the single pak can be used to add a third computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as Advertised","review":"This product is great.

But I must say I am simply amazed at the power of their art, the clean clear and gentleness of melody and counter point. This is Rock and Roll not Bach Partitas, so shouldn't it be reckless and \\"noice\\". On the contrary, After hearing their fine efforts on the Heartbreak CD, the progress to Mutter is simply amazing. Comparing the two, Mutter the more mature, more deliberate, more inventive and less \\"in a hurry\\" then Heartbreak.I most admire the base lines, classical string treatments and melody inventions. More so because I was raised on Rachmannoff, Lizst, Brahms, and Copeland. There is a classic sense in this Rammstein music. It will bear watching for many years.Also, pardon me for being 55 years old but I find many good things in their lyrics and style and listening to this \\"...will not infect your soul and cause the country to lose the war\\". Quite the opposite... :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CD from Rammstein yet!","review":"I've been a fan of Rammstein for a while when I heard they were working on a new CD. I waited for nearly a year for it to come out. I bought it the day it was released. Listening to it in my car on the way home, I was awestruck! Rammstein had evolved into a musical monster! Now there are guitar solos and complicated drum beats! The guitars are featured more and Till's voice is erie as ever! It is by far the heavist, most musical Rammstein CD ever! It is my new favorite. If you have any intrest in hard rock, buy this CD.

Of course some will refuse to accept this disc but it is most surely a disc worth listening to if you are a Rammstein fan. The crunching guitars are not quite as evident, but this album is well worth the wait. Ich Mich is one incredible song, along with Hein Herz Brennt, but there isn't a dud on this disc. If you are a Rammstein fan, GET THIS DISC! And if you are disappointed, then you are not a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely the BEST Rammstein cd","review":"I bought this cd last July after someone I liked said Rammstein was one of her favorite bands - and now I know why. \\"Mutter\\" is the cd that started my whole German rock/industrial phase. It's worth every cent.The most memorable songs on the album are Mein Herz Brennt, Links 234, Feuer Frei, Sonne, Ich Will, Adios, and Mutter. This album is pure quality and just as catchy as any American industrial album. Give it a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"All I have to say is that this CD is amazing!! I seriously thought Sehnsucht was going to be their best album and that it would all go down hill from there. When Mutter came out I admit I doubted it until I heard it and I was blown away. If you like any Rammstein, you must not be without this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rammstein- Mutter","review":"Rammstein comes backs with yet another AMAZING CD for a follow up after their world hit Sehnsucht.

Spectacular. Fantastic. All can be used to describe Rammstein's Mutter. They spent a year mixing this disc alone and it was well worth the wait. This is a truly landmark album that will shape the future of metal and hard rock. I have been unable to stop listening to this album since I got it. They have raised their sound a band to a new level and significantly progressed since their first release. The use of new instruments, Till Lindemann's singing style and their lyrics all contribute to an amazing listening experience. If you like music, buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freddy Mercury meets Metallica","review":"With respect to originality and sheer poetic intensity, I consider Mutter to be one of the better Rammstein projects. Typical 'Tanz Metal' with overwrought drama, great rhythm and good lyrical sense. Lots of crowd pleasers. Rammstein songs tend to repeat themselves with respect to the rhythm and singing; there are 3-4 motifs that can be identified in almost every R. piece.Still, these guys are cynical and tongue in cheek, they mock us with them rainy graves, cold moons, demons screaming in the darkness:\\"Der kalte Mond in voller Prachthört die Schreie in der Nachtund kein Engel steigt herabnur der Regen weint am Grab..\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk about an opening!","review":"To tell you the truth I really don't know hich I prefer Reise Reise or this album but this cd has one song that makes it stick out more than any other Rammstein cd:\\"Mein Hertz Brent\\".

The rest of the album is also quite good and easily one of Rammsteins best if not the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"No no no","review":"I don't like Rammstein.

People get so fascinated by the smallest S***. They think it sounds fascinating because of the german language and how the guy sounds, ok then lets break it down. This singer couldn't hit a high note if his life depended on it and he is not singing he is just talking, wow what talent, then guitar player has no idea of melodic and/or musical theory thus making everything that is guitar sound so dull and boring, that is also why half of the bands today that claim to be hard rock or metal suck. And the rest of the band speaks for themselfs. Unlike everyone else i don't hear soemthing like a german voice in mainstream wanna be metal and think wow thats awesome sounding, instead i break all the musicians up and judge them on talent like it should be and you guys should try it sometime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice!","review":"Rammstein has done it again! This CD does more than just continue the legacy of songs such as \\"Du Hast\\" and \\"Engel\\". It also extends into new territory while remaining faithful to their old sound. One doesn't even have to know German to love this CD! Just the emotion in his voice helps to convey the meaning of the songs. From the kick-your-teeth in beat of \\"Adios\\" to the slower, more dirge-like \\"Mutter\\" this CD is great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another perfect effort from Rammstein","review":"These guys are amazing. This is their third disc and every song is great on all three discs!!! In addition Wilder Wein on the live album and Das Model and Kokain from their recent single are all awesome. They can't do anything wrong. Although not as Apocalyptic as Trent Reznor, they rock the house like no one else. They are Ministry one notch up. They can stand up to MM.Their is absolutely no way any fan of pop music (not only metal or industrial) will not like this album. All the songs are stupendous. Links rocks. Ich Will bangs. Mein Herz Brent and Mutter are classic.Till Lindemann is a genius, no doubt. The bandmates are great musicians. The synchronization of the guitars is something to behold. Don't waste anymore time without this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rammstein's best yet","review":"Mutter is the refined product of Rammstein's 10 year career. It way better than Sehnsucht and Herzeleid, much more refined and operatic like. I hope the next effort is even better.1. Mein Herz Brennt- 9/10 (One of my fave openers, lots of energy)2. Links 2 3 4- 8.5/103. Sonne- 11/10 (Best song on the CD, and my favorite Rammstein song.)4. Ich Will- 9/105. Feuer Frei!- 8/106. Mutter- 9.5/10 (Awesome song)7. Spielhur- 7.5/108. Zwitter- 8/109.

I started out liking Sehnsucht first, then reverted to the darker sound of Herzeleid. I hung out for Mutter and finally got it, and to be completely honest I haven't played Herzeleid since.This album is stunning. It is art. It is poetic in its compexity and eclecticism. It destroys all perspective and draws you in. Rammstein have dropped the almost techno like pop sound of Sehnsucht for a more varied and beautiful opus.Mein Herz brennt is first off the mark, a sweeping, driving, velvety display of their growing talent. Bonus points for the orchestra - it creates an awesome atmospheric effect. Ich will addictive in its arrogant, blatant disregard. A very sexy track. Mutter is both beautiful and gratifyingly funny. Spieluhr is the catchiest tune here, put together very nicely. The album closes with a haunting poem, Nebel, which leaves you mytified and wondering.In short: get this or miss out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pinnacle of their work thus far...","review":"Wow! This one is going to be hard to follow up! I saw them live three times, once on the Mutter tour and they are truly a spectacle to behold and sound awesome. Very true to their finely produced studio work.The CD...Every song on here is likeable at the very least. I liked most of Sensucht, but this blows it away! Very compelling and great replay value! I continue to listen to it over and over again. It will be hard to take out of your CD player to be sure.They've done something wonderful these crazy Germans...They've created a new blend of music and to me, it's some of the best out there. Catchy, heavy, and thought provoking. Not to be missed! Catch them live when you can, you won't forget it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Das Is Good Ja!!!","review":"This is probably Rammsteins Best CD!!! I loved their other ones ,E.G. Sehnsucht, Herzeleid, and Live Aus Berlin, but this one shows them for lack of a better term as more mature artists. With songs like Mein Herz Brent-My hearts broken, and Feuer Frei!-Open Fire! I mean Damn!!! they're so full of energy!!! and life!!! One of my favorites Rein Raus-In Out is a great song!! and once you've seen the lyrics to Zwitter-Hermapherdite translated you'll get a good laugh!!There is only one song on there that i wish was better and thats Nebel-Mist its not that i don't like it its just that it is a little slow even for me!! overall this CD is an awsome purchase!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"die beste","review":"I purchased this disc while on a trip in stuttgart and listened to it on the ICE train from Stuttgart to Konstanz, gliding through the sunny valleys of south germany.

I was just amazed by these guys. They don't sound like those silly alternative bands from the U.S. This is what Rock should be today!These album delivers. You don't understand a word but the language ( German ) itself take you to a new musical dimension. The best track is for sure Links 2 3 4 with troops marching out as a background and powerful vocals that you will start thinking this guy is some Kaiser wanna be.If Scorpions hadn't go Pop they would sound like Rammstein today."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Mutter\\"","review":"Couldn't wait for this one to come out!! \\"Spieluhr\\",track seven is a good example of where this band is headed.

Pick it up today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait!","review":"Superb! Rammstein made us fans wait, and it was well worth it. They have produced a harder and faster album to their previous ones, but Mutter still contains that distinct Rammstein sound. Congratulations to Khira Li for her input, it works very well. Mutter has only been released in NZ 24 hours, but I've thrashed it so much that I had 'Zwitter' playing in my dream last night! I like the magnet attachment thing, and the plastic feel to the lyrics booklet. Hopefully it will last longer than paper ones. Well done Rammstein, a masterpiece to be proud of!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First half is good","review":"Whats the deal with the 5 star reviews here? This is not a 5 star album even if you are a fanboy. 1-6 is good solid stuff, but the rest of the album is quite repetative and boring. ALot of very boring and predictible riffs and drumming. I know that they are not a technical band but I could easily snooze through most of the songs they aren't too creative. I am a fan of their other albums though because those ones are better written than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"Although this manga in future volumes has it's moments, it's not very good. It was written and published after the anime had started. This is not the original story! For fans of Katsu Aki's works (Psychic Academy, Futari Ecchi) This was one of his first manga. The art is pretty average, the plot has very little to do with the anime. The Characters, except for the names, act Very differently. Personally, i disliked this series quite a bit. For a manga that sold only decently in japan (and if at all, only because it had the Escaflowne name), It's a wonder to me that they licensed something so... ick. Then again, with the exception of a few titles, tokyopop loves to license lots of these obscure manga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!","review":"If you're considering buying this book because you liked the anime, DON'T! The story is, in my opinion, massacred in this manga. The characters are childish and they seem to be trying way too hard to be \\"cool\\". The overuse of slang is laughable, and the artwork isn't nearly as well drawn as in the series. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"An overlooked classic - everybody needs one!","review":"A great album, particularly the song Without Expression. I bought the LP in 1970 and have always loved it. Bought the LP initially because the legendary San Francisco radio station KSAN (or was it the also legendary KMPX?) used to play a live recording of Reid doing Without Expression that was brilliant -- even better than the studio version -- but it was never available on disk to my knowledge...Even today (30 years later) I would still love to hear that live version again. Anyone else ever hear it? Any info?

It's the kind of Hindi film that you can watch over and over and still laugh ! This also was a great film for fashion - loved the outfits very contemporary - and I admit, anything that Salman Khan wears looks Fab but he was on point in this movie. The music ( I now own the soundtrack) is great and the dancing equally so - this movie is pure entertainment and if you are a SK fan...then you will see him at his best: funny, well dressed, dancing his arse off, and entertaining the audience. The salute to Hip Hop is hysterical...the rendition of \\" You're My Love \\" makes me laugh everytime I see the music video or watch the film. Govinda is great and as always his comedic timing is impeccable. Sajid-Wajid really went all out on the music !If you're looking for a light fun Hindi movie - this is it !"},{"rating":"1","title":"A copy of Hitch","review":"This is a copy of Hitch where Salman Khan plays the role of Will Smith. Katrina Kaif plays the role of Eva Mendes, and Govinda is the Indian Kevin James. There is not much difference between Partner and Hitch except that Partner is a Hindi movie, and therefore a little Indian Masala (Spice) is added to it in the form of some hilarious comedy. Raj Pal Yadav's character of Chota Don is very funny.Since this is a Hindi movie, it extends a little longer than Hitch. If you have seen Hitch and loved it, I would suggest not to watch Partner because Partner comes nowhere near Hitch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged CDs","review":"I bought this book on audio cd. Two of the five discs were unable to be played. The purpose was to play in my vehicle for a 90 min commute one way to work. It was not my CD player, as I was able to play the other 3 cds, and all other CDs I own functioned properly.

I would recommend this book to anyone that loves to read romance at its best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This is one of Ms. Howard's best books. As far as I am concerned she is one of the best there is. All her characters come alive, are strong and very memorable. I read this book through the night till I finished and it was a week night. Didn't care. The hero is a typical alpha male and the heroine is a woman of strength. I liked the way Faith stood up to him and gave back as good as she got. That is why this book worked so beautifully. If the male had just been a macho jerk and the female a doormat, this would have been awful. However, they balance each other very well. The chemistry between the leads was amazing. I only wish the ending had been a bit more elaborate. I would have liked to have seen some conversations about family history not repeating itself,fidelity and trust.But all in all, a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Howard book.","review":"I don't know what it is about this book. Gray was such a jerk, but Howard writes the story in a way that you understand WHY he was a jerk and you like him anyway. The hero and the heroine (Faith) each carry so much baggage that it was refreshing to see them get past it. Many of Howard's books deal with people who are damaged by life's experiences. In the real world, few people can get past such trauma, but Howard shows the grit and determination in her characters that make overcoming their damaged psyche's believable. Also, as a fellow southerner, it is refreshing to read a story set in the south that is not full of stereotypical caricatures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Linda's best","review":"First chapter was excellent and I was thinking I'd found another LH great. This book could have been half the length. Dragged redundantly through the characters same thought processes until I could have recited them in my sleep, I have not seen a story where the characters mused over their problems so often. Though the characters were strong, they were brought together by one element - sex, which really doesn't hold a story together as well as deep abiding love, earned by overcoming adversity. Too bad really, because it could have been so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply wonderful","review":"Wow. This is the first Linda Howard book I have ever read and it certaintly won't be the last. Amazing story, great plot line full of subtle twists and turns.

Ever.","review":"I must first admit that I am actually a pretty big fan of Linda Howard. I am in the process of taking my keeper shelf digital. So in fact there are some Linda Howard titles that I have enjoyed enough to actually purchase twice - first as a hard copy and now years later as a Kindle edition. So believe me when I say that After the Night is really quite shockingly bad.I wish I could give this no stars. The \\"hero\\" is simply hateful. And the \\"heroine\\" is dysfunctional enough to take his emotional and verbal abuse for love. Reading this book is like watching a teenage MTV reality show of kids who think they are in love. Awful. Part of me questions if Linda Howard really even wrote this novel. If she did, perhaps she wrote it when she was in high school and dusted it off years later when she need to fulfill a book contract. No offense, high schoolers."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO stars!!!!!","review":"Did we all read the same book? Well the book I read was awful!The \\"hero\\" Gray was an absolute bastard, with no redeeming qualities.

I disliked her when she gave into him.Didn't like the book, wouldn't advise anyone to read it. Sometimes I wonder if I'm reading the same book as others, or maybe I have really different taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT As Good as It Gets!!!","review":"I have to say that I was disappointed with this book. This is not the kind of romance I enjoy. It was vulgar, the hero was crude and the heroine enjoyed it.

I also guessed how the ending was going to turn out so not much suspense there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whew! Pass the Ice Water!","review":"This is my first Linda Howard book.

I dont see where this book was that good. I brought it based on the other customer reviews and the excerpt was promising, but the plot was silly. I skimmed through the book after she grows up and still understood what was going on. The reason why everybody thought this book was so great was because of the love scenes, but a good romance shouldnt be held together just on sex scenes alone. I thought that Gray was not that witty and poor Faith was just lovestruck through the whole book despite his abusive taunts. This will be my last Linda Howard book."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow....","review":"I usually love Linda Howard, but wow. I know im gonna get blasted but... the last thing i ever wanna read in any book is the suffering and death of a child - ESPECIALLY IN A ROMANCE BOOK. What kind of woman would ever want anything to do with a guy who allowed a child to be treated like that? HE watched as two innocent children, crying and terrified in the middle of the night while being thrown out of their house,and did nothing. This ruined the whole book for me, and he never even said he was sorry. Not sure it would have made a difference anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern Hot Romance","review":"Absolutely loved the book. This is the Linda Howard that I love and miss. Lately her books are very, very, boring but this tale of two star crossed lovers is absolutely amazing.

This novel has a lot of elements, murder, mystery, frustration, unrequited love, sex, and the love scenes were strong where it was not to trashy just absolutely seductive. All in all purchase the book it is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linda Howard is great.","review":"This is the 4th book of Linda Howard's I have read. If you haven't read a book by her, boy are you missing out, she writes such strong characters. The minor problem that I had with the story was a little bit of the connection with the h/h. But what I do like about this is the \\"girl goes back to home town\\" story is a little different. Now, I had to read this book for a book that made me think of summer, and let me tell you there were some SCORCHING scenes involving the couple in the summer on the front porch, the courthouse bathroom, and oh the kitchen table. All in all, I enjoyed it, just missed a little bit on the connection, not enough to no read this book!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"my first linda howard","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews and also the story line sounded interesting.I will not go into the plot since other reviewers have done that. I will say that I didn't find this book romantic at all. Having the hero mouthing four letter words to the heroine while they are making love doesn't seem terribly romantic to me. I guess I'm kind of old fashioned.Aside from that I thought the plot was flimsy and the story line involving his sister and his father's best friend was disgusting.In short if you're an incurable romantic and love poignant, sweet romances look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"tawdry","review":"If there were a 0 stars rating, this book would get it. I thought it a waste of paper. And yes, I ADORE Linda Howard & devour everything she writes. This one, I could barely read. I found it impossible to relate to the heroine and the hero - and I use those terms loosely! The \\"hero\\" was just plain mean; the \\"heroine\\" lacked pride, backbone, and common sense. Where was her brain? No, don't answer that. Maybe there are \\"characters\\" like them out in real life, but if there are, I don't want to read about them. The relationship (and again, I use that term loosely) between the two main character is tawdry, abusive, demeaning, twisted, and just plain out sick. Let the psychiatrists read the book and try to figure out the warped minds of the characters. The majority of the reviews raved about the \\"hot\\" sex scenes. Those scenes left me \\"cold\\" because there was no loving, no romancing, no sharing, no caring, no giving, no uniting.....as my title indicates,to me it was just plain TAWDRY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"Bought this because I love Joe Walsh and this is his very early work.

I ama Christian who teaches adult Jewish studies courses including a 22-weekcourse on antisemitism. In my opinion this is antisemitism at its worstby an author with a Jewish surname. (I personally question if it actually written by a Jew - if so I'd say he has a great deal of self-hatred).The Jews represent less than 1% of the world's population and never havehad much more than this. To believe they (as victims of non-Jewish persecution for more than 2000 years)have done all this violence to non-Jews is ridiculous. They've spent most of their history hunkered down infear.This book will accomplish nothing but fan the flames of antisemitismand is disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Video Quality","review":"Terry White has an excellent reputation as an InDesign trainer so I did not hesitate in purchasing this. After viewing, my own opinion on this particular training vehicle is that the beginner would be totally lost even though it is being marketed for the Beginner/Intermediate. The video quality is so out of focus and so fuzzy that one can barely make out the screen shots, regardless of whether it is played full screen, or 100% as recommended or even quarter screen. The video tech support site states that this is something we have to live. I didn't pay good money for fuzzy! Had I seen the DVD prior, I would not have bought this. If you really want to learn InDesign CS2 and for about the same price, I would go with the Lynda.com's Adobe InDesign CS2 Hands-On-Training which uses the Apple Quicktime movie format (if you don't mind looking at Windows screen shots) and an excellent book which covers much more as opposed to the slim booklet that comes with Personal Seminar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another WINNER!","review":"Yep! I call \\"Photoshop CS - Creative Studio\\" as another winner from Peachpit Press! Although a strong basic working knowledge of Photoshop is required to make the best use of this book, even a novice would benefit from the hundreds of time saving tips, shortcuts and appendices. The creative exercises are clear and concise. This is a real \\"nuts and bolts\\" sort of recipe book... no dry or unwanted \\"humor\\" to wade through, just a LOT of real INFORMATION! (This is NOT an instructional book for Photoshop, but a creative supplement). As an \\"intermediate level\\" user of Photoshop CS, I found this publication to be an extremely valuable creative resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sense Of Place","review":"I expected a more classical collection than this is.

Great condition. Very fast postage. Item was fairly priced although postage was a little expensive. But overall very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"just not enough here","review":"This book feels incredibly incomplete. The author has an intriguing idea and the plot sounds interesting, but ultimately both the story and the characters are barely developed. This entire book should be condensed into half the pages and included as part of a larger story. It does not stand on its own and unless you are a huge fan of the author or love greek mythology I would not recommend wasting your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderfully entertaining","review":"The preceding customer review and the Booklist review summarize the plot very well, so I won't repeat what they've said. I'll just comment on what excellent adventure and mystery the novel offers. Who are these children? Why are they being held prisoner in a boarding school? WHAT are they?Highly imaginative and suspenseful, this novel is what a fantasy should be (and very few are): an intriguing situation, a dangerous threat, and wonders of the impossible that are made real. I enjoyed every minute of it and am waiting for the conclusion with great anticipation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent writing with a minor annoyance","review":"I agree with other reviewers that this is excellently written. John Wright gives a (to me) very convincing impression of a teenage girl who is also an ancient four-dimensional Greek goddess (or demigoddess, or something). However, I must mention how annoying I find it that the dialogue of these teenagers, raised in Britain, given a very old-fashioned classical education and almost completely isolated from popular culture, is colloquial American (up to and including the phrase \\"go figure\\"). This is also interfering with my otherwise great enjoyment of the sequel, which I'm reading at the moment.As a disclaimer, I'm a New Zealander with a master's degree in English language and literature who reads a lot of British and American fiction, and is married to an American, so I am much more aware of this than most readers will be. Your mileage, as they say in the US, may vary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strangely disappointing...","review":"I found this book at my local library. The story sounded interesting, as a few other reviewers noted, like an adult Harry Potter. The book's narrator, Amelia, is a teenage (?) girl who's really not sure about her age or why she and her 4 fellow orphans are the only students at their school. Amelia suspects that there are secret powers and mysterious worlds just beyond her grasp. I enjoyed the first 100 or so pages, but when the author starts to reveal the true nature of the children and their keepers, things start to go downhill. Wright now tries to give all the background information - and there's a lot of it - to explain Amelia's world and why she's at the school. I am an avid reader and I really struggled to get through the remainder of the book. Too much historical background and explanation really brings the tale to a standstill. Though, I'm curious to discover Amelia's fate, I do not think that I'll be reading any more books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"multi-dimensionally dissappointing","review":"Beginning the book, I was nervous that the different qualities of the children would turn out to make them one more version of mutant superheroes. But the opening is good, appealing, atmospheric. And the book builds well at the outset, developing characters with mystery and interest. Then we encounter the ancient gods who speak smart-aleck and the relationships with the \\"young adults\\" becomes only puerile and lascivious. Ponderous physics speculation became the high point. I got halfway through; I see other reviewers say it ended on a cliffhanger. I will not waste more time with it. The sexual mores especially were disturbing, the lack of a world with any interest just depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLAVE GIRLS OF GOR in 4-D","review":"I enjoyed this cleverly constructed fantasy with mythological themes, but am troubled by the domination & submission storyline for the (four-dimensional!) female protagonist, which from the evidence of this first volume is really nothing more than SLAVE GIRLS OF GOR in a PG-13 mask."},{"rating":"1","title":"My most disappointing album of the year","review":"1. I LOVED Toby's first release, \\"Little Things.\\" Such innovative songwriting, beautiful lyrics and melodies - some songs made me cry!2. I think Toby has a BEAUTIFUL, soulful voice.THEREFORE...3. I excitedly purchased \\"Bird on a Wire\\" without listening to the song samples first.DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE!The melodies on this album are OK, not as catchy as I'd hoped, and Toby's voice sounds fine. But the real flaw is the lyrics - they are so bad that I feel ebarassed listening to them. Really unoriginal. The sentiments expressed by the lyrics are so trite and simplistic. Lyrics on love stay as shallow as \\"Nobody wants to be alone.\\" This just feels like overproduced pop for middle-schoolers.I would return this album if I could. I'll probably just give it away - this isn't how I want to remember Toby. Stick with \\"Little Things\\" and hope for a better future release!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toby, where have you been all my life?","review":"I guess \\"not born\\" since I'm 55, LOL! I don't know which CD of hers I like better. I got this one first and listened to it almost continually so went back and bought Little Things and I'm stuck on it now!

I had never heard of Toby Lightman before this, but now I absolutely love her music. She has a strong voice that's easy to sing along with - kind of bluesy, kind of rock & roll, sometimes mellow and sweet.

Because of the limited time available to me while visiting the area, I thought I follow someone else's experience. The photos and relevant information were excellent. I know some reviewers complained about the heavy use of filters and enhancers on the lens but that did not alter their actual and intended beauty. The area provides for so much contrast within each and every frame that the use of split-density, enhancing and polarizing filters are almost necessary in order to coax every bit of depth and detail, particularly in digital camerars. The information is very detailed and I am planning to check out its accuracy this June."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"This is a very helpful book when photographing Teton and Yellowstone.

This is the absolute best one. Do not look any further if you are a photographer. Every point and time of day is noted.

No guarantees yours will be as good, but mine were superb and without this book I would never have gotten them.This was the most valuable asset on our trip. Got some of the best images ever.

Rather than a true tribute to Shepherd, this book is for the most part a showcase of pretentious work that should never have been published.

One drawback is that the instructions make it sound like installation is a 10 minute job. Realistically, you should probably plan on a good hour to remove the distributor from the engine, do the conversion, and reinstall and time the ignition. If you plan on doing a coil too and want to run a 12V lead to the coil you'll have additional time to think of also.

But the DVD release is flat-out terrible! The film was shot and released in a widescreen format (1.85 specifically) but the DVD release - for the US market - is 1.33 pan n' scan. Particularly annoying, as the international release is apparently in 1.85. The DVD also has no extras of any kind - it barely even has a menu! No commentary track, no choices of audio format, no subtitles in any language, not even so much as a theatrical trailer. As much fun as this movie is - and it's a lot of fun - the disc almost isn't worth the bother, because it's impossible to watch it and not be constantly reminded of what a poor job Artisan's done in presenting it. I shudder to think how bad the DVD for Kill Me Again is going to be (it hasn't arrived yet) if it's been done by the same people, with the same lack of care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Movie, Horrible Transfer","review":"Okay, I'm biased to this movie because I took a seminar from the director and consider this one of the best neo-noir movies ever made. I'm writing this review to comment on the DVD quality. For some reason, the DVD aspect ratio is 1:33, your standard pan and scan, but I know the widescreen version exists because John Dahl showed it to us at the seminar. This movie was shot in 1:85 and should be presented in the original format. I also agree with other reviewers who state the transfer needs remastering. The contrast was very flat compared to the what I remember which I can only account to digital compression (although I don't know enough about the transfer process to say for sure). Here's hoping a widescreen remastered version is eventually released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Body Heat","review":"The Last Seduction, a descriptive title, aptly predicting the plot line of this \\"thriller,\\" weakens the prelude to a grifter-mission-impossible. Surly the producer might have conjured a jazzier title.Linda Florentino is pretty with clothes on or off, one of those tall slim Hollywood gals with augmented lips. She talks tough and dirty, outdoing her men toys in the saddle, so if the viewer wants some steamy stuff, okay, ya got it. The problem: the plot is unbelievable. A good thriller, take Body Heat for example, gives you the steamy romance and a plot device that doesn't intrude. If the mechanics of the swindle are forced, well, we have only Florentino's next hot scene to look forward too.Weirdly, Bill Pullman, the smarmy medical student turned pill pusher, Fiorentino's hubby, shines up the plot, keeping it \\"real\\" when he is on the screen, which is not often. A little humor goes a long way in a tragedy. Just ask William Shakespeare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ditto!","review":"I can only echo the sentiments above.

If only it were as easy in real life! One example of this bad writing, for those who have seen it, is the scene where she asks a black man about a certain racial stereotype.Good films hinge on out-smarting people. Not-so-good ones need people to be stupid. THE LAST SEDUCTION might be worth seeing on cable TV; it was made for cable, and that is where it belongs.

(If they tell you that their best was \\"It's Hard\\", run the other way).At the time I write this review, 8 people gave this one star. 8/400 people. Wonder what kind of music they were looking for; obviously not powerful, moving rhythm and blues!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The live Tommy CD is a plus, but...","review":"For those who are looking for an improved-sound version of the 1995 remaster of Live at Leeds, I would say there is no detectable sonic improvement here (the sound is fine on the first disc). For Who 'completists' the live performance of Tommy is of value (the second disc). Beware, however, the playing is a bit rough. The remastered 1995 Tommy is, in contrast, all studio recordings, but magnificent in terms of sound quality. The Who was one of the greatest live acts ever (for those who missed their 1965-1973 prime). It's a shame so little (other than the original Live at Leeds set, and much of the Isle of Wight set) maintains this high quality showmanship. Also, beware of the DVD Live at Kilburn...the sound is excellent, and the video very good, but the band puts in a sub-par performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep, Heavy R&B","review":"The Who was an enigma with a psycho-genius at the song writing front. In other words, Pete Townshend is well...Pete Townshend. He is leader, guitar god, poet, drive, focus, chief cook and bottle-washer of one of the truly great rock bands of all time. They used to hold the Guiness World Record for the loudest concert. Their music is raw, heavy yet pop-ish, silly and at the same time deeply serious. They are pure English with some heavy American R&B; influence. John Entwistle (along with John Paul Jones of Led Zep and Jack Bruce of Cream) is the quintessential bassist. Rogery Daltrey's vocals are phenomenal and are an instrument in it's own rite. Keith Moon, arguably the best drummer in rock history, is fanatical; playing in series of riffs and is mesmerizing to watch.This is an excellent live album. Do NOT be fooled or taken in by bad reviews. The cd is essential along with the primarly essential 'Who's Next'."},{"rating":"1","title":"if u didn't know any better","review":"If u have never ever heard the original Live at Leeds ,a six song sonic blast of power unlike anything you'd ever of heard before.

It sounds nothing like the original CD, nothing like the remastered/expanded CD, and nothing like bootleg version which happens to sound incredible. Everything has been smothered in watery noise reduction. There is no air around the instruments. The vocals (especially on the Tommy portion) sound like they're being sung through a tin can and string. Pete Thownsend and his cronies may think this is acceptable, but I don't.

On hearing just the first few notes it was clear that this version doesn't sound as good as the 1995 release. I bought it for the extra tracks but I have to say i'm very disappointed in it sonically (the 'blanket' effect over the instruments & vocals from the Dolby Noise Reduction is immediately obvious) and I agree with the other reviewers who complained on that point. This version doesn't have nearly the 'ass kick' soundwise of the preceding 1995 release. I'll be looking for a copy as well of the 'Live At Leeds Complete' CD and listening to my 'old' 1995 version instead of this one. Maybe Pete will take the cue from some of these reviews and 'do it up right', both in terms of the completeness of the show and the sonic issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cd marvel","review":"I'm not particularly impressed by CD releases of old stuff. But having seen the Who twice at Tanglewood in Lenox Mass about the time of Tommy I can vouch for the feracity of their playing. Heaven and Hell they opened with in one show and I always wondered why it wasn't released. After seeing Entwistle with dual Sunn amps and a Fender bass I was led to buy a 2000S and Precision myself and played for quite a while with this combination. They had it right back then and even though the openers were BB King, Jefferson Airplane, Jethro Tull in either venue,they remain the greatest live band in my mind. Just watching Keith Moon do a rim shot and blow his stick into the air and catch it on the way down without blowing the song was worth the price of admission for me. This album brings it all back."},{"rating":"2","title":"The shape of who's to come","review":"This record markes the start of what was in my opinion the Who's best period up until Who are you. Anyway the old vinyl version was great and then we were confronted with the cd, then another extended version, then this one. OK it is great but if you have already bought it 2-3 times you knid of find it less funny. If you do not own the other versions this is a clear 5 star record however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blistering - The Who at their best!","review":"The Who is generally acknowledged as one of the greatest live bands in all of rock. This album proves that assertion to be true. Live at Leeds rocks through and through, from the burning opening \\"Heaven and Hell\\" to the final cut \\"Magic Bus.\\" There are so many moments of searing power and raw energy that it's hard to remember them all. The anguished, furious reading of \\"Young Man Blues\\" is worth the price alone. But the fact is there is not a single bad song on this disk. And the banter between songs is priceless.Need proof that Keith Moon is the best drummer in rock? That Pete Townshend is a genius? That John Entwistle is rock's most inventive bassist? That Roger Daltrey's pipes are among the finest in all of rock? Then look no further than this gem. Highly recommended for Who fans or people who want their rock to actually ROCK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Live Album from the Greatest Live Band","review":"The Who is in my humble opinion the greatest live band ever. Every track on this CD seethes with raw power and unparalled energy that threatens to melt the listener's speakers. From Pete Townshend's blues riffs to Roger Daltrey's howling voice the band captures the very essence of what a live rock show should be. The highlight tracks are \\"Young Man Blues, Magic Bus, Heaven and Hell and My Generation\\". Each song is fast and furious, powered by the human tornado, Keith \\"The Greatest Drummer Ever\\" Moon.Every time I listen to this CD I am just in awe of the power and speed that Moon exhibits, thank God John Entwhistle was there to serve as a anchor with his rumble bass to hold the band together.

This is the greatest live album ever. It will never be topped because there will never be a rock band as good as The Who in 1970. If there was someone out there who never heard rock and roll before and you wanted to show them what rock and roll is then you give them Live at Leeds. No questions asked. This is as good as it gets. Anybody who knows anything about hard rock music will tell you that this is one of the greatest albums ever. The Who were never better and every song is great. The sound is raw and nasty and must be played loud. I dont know what else to say except if you dont own this then there is a chunk of your life missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Who","review":"This is the Who CD to own - and make sure its the Deluxe Edition. The remastering is unbelievable (in fact so are all these Universal Deluxe Editions - brilliant). The first CD is probably familiar to fans and in most cases these live versions are far superior to the studio versions. Those who think Led Zep, Balck Sabbath etc invented heavy metal have a listen here !But the real suprise is the Tommy set. This blows the studio version away. The live version has Pete firing on his electric guitar and the band rock.I would recommend this over the latest 2 CD Who collection as representing the definitive Who."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!","review":"Don't bother with the concerns some reviewers have about the expanded/revised CD content or with what they've done to the sound. This is quite possibly the best live Rock album of all time. The expanded song list for the remastered CD is fantastic, as is the sound. Obviously, the playing and singing are unbelievable.

If you like the early who then buy this. Around the same time they played The Isle Of Wight I have not yet listened to that concert but I know for a fact that Live At Leeds was better and longer. If your a Who fan then buy this Deluxe Edition if your not then I suggest you dont buy this yet go with something else like the new Who's greatest hits CD I also wrote a review about that CD if you want to check it out.

Like any live Who album, except the Royal Albert Hall, it's a wonder these gods, I mean musicians, can create such an unbelievable sound. Quite honestly, this is the best group of musicians ever put into one band, and when let loose, you get Leeds.

Thankfully, this is one that does. Recorded at Leeds University in 1970, this is certainly one of the Who's best live efforts. Keith Moon's drumming is such that no one can match. And I think the added tracks are a real treat. They are only further evidence that the Who is a great rock band. The CD opens with a great version of \\"Heaven and Hell.\\" This is followed up by favorites such as \\"Substitute,\\" \\"I Can't Explain,\\" and \\"My Generation.\\" For me the standout of the album is a terrific version of \\"Summertime Blues.\\" I also recommend the Isle of Wight CD or DVD.

I still feel that excitement everytime I play it. The re-release not only offers more songs, but provides clever and amusing banter from the bandmates in between songs. I actually find myself wishing that I was there to see the whole concert! If you think that The Who rock on record, then you will love listening to them live!

The Who were a great live band in their heyday. Full of both energy and sonic wallop, they were perhaps the greatest early heavy metal band, even if their studio albums didn't sound like like it. Stripped of the fussiness of Pete Townshend's studio perfectionism, the band flat out rocks live. Recorded in 1970, \\"Live at Leeds\\" still counts as one of the greatest live albums ever. It is also a sad reminder that rock music just doesn't have this kind of power anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling!","review":"There are people in this world who can fool just about anyone. That is what stands out from this film. It took the Dr. quite some time to discover who was tormenting him, her friend never caught on, and at the end, she won. One always hears of mentally sick people not taking their medicine . . . the physicians who expect that the medicine will be taken should be locked up. They are professionals and should not be fooled. A very good movie, which is credible and is terrible in what it has to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A COMEDY","review":"SPOILER Review: I'm not quite sure why this movie is listed as a comedy, it is in no way shape or form funny. It is a thriller/horror and as one other reviewer stated more like Fatal Attraction, however without the satisfing ending. The movie is well acted and I was \\"in\\" the movie, so much so that I absolutely hated Angelique. I cannot stand any woman that dates a married man, then whines when he won't spend time with her, and always tells friends that he will leave his wife any minute. And then when you realize that she's just a nutter, I hatted her because she practically ruined that man's life, killing his baby, ruining his career, and leaving him disabled. I think if you can overlook those huge character flaws, then you might enjoy the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie","review":"I wanted to see this movie because I loved Audrey Tautou in Priceless and Amelie, but this was more like a horror movie. Although the structure of it is clever and the movie was well done in the sense that it surprises the viewer, it is harder to watch the more the movie progresses. As I realized what was really going on with her character, the movie seemed sicker and sicker. Her \\"lover\\" the doctor did an excellent job of acting, as did Tautou, but the film is one I wish I hadn't watched and will never watch again. Do yourself a favor and skip this one unless you like films that make you miserable. Going to a funeral would be about the same level of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Ought to be a Crime","review":"To rank this movie anywhere near Audrey Tautou's other flicks (the brilliant Amelie and charming Happenstance) ought to be a crime.One should have their sanity checked.This movie offers nothing of Tautou's charming quirkiness; instead it offers up something that is merely disgusting and depressing.Tautou had a kind of charming mystique going prior to this movie.This movie has succeeded in destroying that mystique."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love it, I love it NOT","review":"This movie was terrible!! My roomate and I rented it because we enjoyed the quirkiness of Amelie and of course we loved the actress, but this movie was awful! To be completely honest, I am only going to recommend this movie to people who I do not like. It was a waste of my time, although I am glad I went ahead and watched it so that I can warn anyone else from ever renting it or buying it. He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not was a psychotic movie with a crazy plot and you shouldn't see it unless you want to torture yourself for over 1 1/2 hours! Although...If you want to have a movie to really laugh your ass off at...this is probably the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aptly Named, Charmingly Deceptive...","review":"My wife picked this one up at the library, in no small part due to our love of Tautou's Amelie performance. However, a few minutes in, I feared that I had been transported into some sort of purgatorial French version of a Meg Ryan romance film. Imagine my surprise and delight when the movie takes a very unexpected twist, delighting me to its thrilling end! A great movie that is very clever in its pacing, directing, and acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twisted!","review":"I loved this movie. It was clever, psychotic and chilling. This movei made me question my own perceptions, as the second half made me reflect on the key thing I missed in the first half: that we never see Angelique and Loic together.

C'est ? ne pas manquer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love is a bed of roses: Not!","review":"The opening credits and the first half of this French film lead us to believe that wea re in for a bit of fluff, French style. The wonders of love/exhilaration/infatuation/madness...aha....the movie bifurcates! Audrey Tautou is a terrific screen presence as a gifted young artist and her wholly committed love for a cardiologist well-paced by Samuel Le Bihan is a joy to watch. At the peak of a love affair the movie rewinds to give us the other viewpoint of the story. At this point the bed of roses approach becomes very dark and while the film is still excellent, it is not at all what the promos would suggest. Worth a watch in your home. The DVD is a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I found the movie very well written. I don't dare to say more than that since I think that any review I can make would spoil the plot of the film. So I will only go as far as saying that this is a movie that teach us that one should never judge someone by the first impression we get of him/her.If you are one of those who love unexpected endings and plot twists, this movie is a must see.Now a comment about the DVD. I admit I don't own the DVD in question, but seeing the description I must say that I still not find any logic explanation as to why most American DVDs of European movies don't include the additional material that the original European DVD does. In the case of this movie, the french DVD has a commented version of the film by Laetitia Colombani (Writer & Director), deleted scenes and a short-fil by Laetitia Colombani."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone,","review":"But, if you like twists/turns you'll enjoy this. I think this should be seen two or three times to really \\"get\\" it. Of course, Audrey Tatou is as charming as ever, she really has a lot of range as an actress and she's adorable,too. The plot/story is told by all the participants through their own eyes and it would depend on which version you believe. I thought it was different and entertaining a bit confusing, maybe, but that's why it needs repeat viewing. This has French subtitles, which didn't bother me, but some may not like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"The rare '10' movie!","review":"Well done.

Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not","review":"After a first viewing of \\"À la Folie, Pas du Tout,\\" I was thoroughly impressed not by the revelation at the end of the film, but by the brilliance of the filmmakers who would not allow their audience a moment of time to remove themselves from the edge of their seats and breathe a sigh of relief until the credits began rolling. I must echo previous comments in praising Audrey Tautou on her seemingly effortless approach to a character who is very easy to play on the surface, but dramatically complex behind the curtain. As an avid viewer of films foreign and domestic, romantic and thriller, I recommend \\"He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not\\" to all of my friends and now I'm recommending it to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"And then what happened....","review":"Watching the first 20 minutes of this film I was mystified as to why my friend had recommended it so highly.

I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amelie becomes scary","review":"To escape being typecast as cute, Audrey plays a psychotic with a dangerous delusion. The film presents the story to the viewer from two perspectives, with an ending that reminds one of Alfred Hitchcock. Ms. Tautou plays her youthful, sweet smile to great effect, and the viewer is manipulated into compassion - for the wrong person. Even if Audrey Tautou were not in the film, it is worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I still don't have this yet...","review":"I still don't have this item yet... it never came in the mail.

I just finished the book to see if they mobbed him or what.It's OK for scifi, I'm not that discriminating. But I don't understand Maclaughlin's insistence in using such a jerk as the main character. No, I do understand why he does it. I mean, Joe *has* to be that much of a heel to get done what he gets done. But my big question is, Is it believable? I don't think so.

Heavy !!! fuzztone guitar in the vein of George Brigman & Split and SRC, along with Captain Beefheart-esque vocals,especially on the first tune \\"Death Of An Electric Citizen\\" which could have come straight off Safe As Milk,or Strictly Personal.\\"American Boy Soldier\\",although a bit dated is a Zappa-esque Vietnam era parody,that may have even been intended as serious social commentary.But they were English,so why worry about Nam and the draft anyway ?\\"Dawn Crept Away\\" is 14 plus minutes of total insanity that closes this forgotten gem.

Problem is, what starts out as having potential sinks quickly into the mire of writer Michael Crichton's shallow characters and insipid plotting. Despite some snappy dialogue and a wealth of opportunities to tongue-lash the villainess (Moore), Disclosure lacks the tension that this kind of high-tech jousting requires: the virtual reality scene near the end of the film seems particularly tacked on. Somehow I feel hesitant recommending a film that is supposed to be dealing honestly with the complexities of male-female relationships in the workplace, but that ultimately reinforces the stereotypes it claims to be shattering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Book, Good Movie","review":"The book 'Disclosure' by Michael Crichton was an amazing book full of suspense and hi-tech excitement. Intertwining the newest computer abilities (I love the way a big 'E' jumps out when the main character get an e-mail LOL) and taking the subject of sexual harrasment and going the opposite direction, this had movie written all over it. The resulting product by Barry Levinson is good but not great, more like 3 1/2 stars out of 5 if I had the option. I enjoyed it (albeit the movie is a bit dated at this point in time), but it probably could have been a little better, the cheesy score at times doesn't help the movie in the long run. Good chemistry by Douglas (man does he ever get to screw around with the cutest women) and Moore, this is a good film to sit back and take in, even though it is slow at times.**** RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought it to use in a flashlight... came with a sticker \\"not for use in flashlights\\"","review":"bought these to use in my BRINKMANN maxfire lx (820-1025-0) flashlight. the details and images of this product do not mention that it is not for use in flashlights.why can't this battery be used in flashlights?if it can't why wasn't this detailed in the product description or picture?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works in my Davis Weather Meter","review":"I can't speak for the longevity of the charge, but it's been working flawlessly for a couple of weeks.

You will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kaki should stick to her roots","review":"For those of you who love Kaki's acoustic guitar from her first CDs will not find much to like here. Perhaps you will literally see red. The eclectic and original melodies of her first CDs are missing here. This one is way over produced with too much garbage drowning out the one thing I loved Kaki for - the amazing guitar playin. Kaki, please stop singing. Just play your guitar and keep the experimentation out of the public's eye. Tracks 9-13 are about the only good tracks on this CD. The singing is childish and annoying. This is such a dramatic change from anything Kaki has done before. I hope she doesn't do it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kaki goes pop","review":"Yet another inchoate effort from one of the most overblown musicians of her generation.Don't fall for the smokescreen of hype - it's always a red flag for a recording that doesn't stand up on its own merits.I'm sorry, but Kaki is just not a singer. She just doesn't have any pipes. Her voice is thin, weak, and waify. I wouldn't be surprised if the recording engineer used pitch-correcting software to make it sound like she's singing the right notes. Kaki is definitely not a songwriter either. Her lyrics are pretentious. The production is characterized by studio gimmicks, none of which adds anything of substance to the songs.For this style of music, I much prefer Bjork. And for fans of acoustic solo guitar, I definitely can't recommended this CD.Nothing innovative here. Just a weak attempt to go pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"Awful guitar playing. Awful singing. Ridiculous lyrics.A melody would be nice. I remember one time I saw Kenny G, and Michael Bolton was the opening act. It was the single worst musical experience of my life - until I heard this record.If Kaki King is the most important new musical visionary to emerge in 30 years, then surely it's a sign of impending Apocalypse. The truth of the matter is that Kaki King's relative importance in guitar music is equivalent to being the best jazz piano player in the National Hockey League.If you're seriously interested in hearing the cutting edge of solo guitar music, listen instead to the brilliant Erik Mongrain. Kaki King is to guitar music what Richard Marx was to rock and roll.Avoid this CD at all cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure if you'll feel red, but chances are you'll like the music","review":"I was listening to a 'new age' internet radio station about a month or so ago, and it had this song called 'Right After Sidewalk' playing. While it didn't exactly sound like new-age, I was extremely pleased with the music. It was an instrumental with guitar. That's when I discovered Kaki King. This album doesn't feature the song I mentioned earlier (that was part of her first album titled 'Everybody Loves You'), but it's still mostly guitar solos with Kaki using her voice in some of the songs. The songs are very relaxing and soothing, and Kaki's voice adds an ethereal feeling to the songs. She is an extremely talented guitarist and quite a good vocalist too. I'm sure she is destined for even bigger successes. Oh, and did I say that the cover art is brilliant?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I'd never heard of Kaki before this album, but as soon as I saw the album cover I had to give the album a listen. I was sold on the music with the first wash of layered vocals enter in Yellowcake.I don't usually listen to instrumental music, but for Kaki, I made the exception and went back to listen to all her albums. It's not only her technical prowess which is amazing...these songs just seem so fully realized, but never forced. The production is absolutely amazing, and it manages to be one of the most emotional albums I've heard in quite some time.Her voice, whispered and quiet most times, is a perfect instrument to add into the mix, when it is used.Absolutely amazing, and definitely an artist to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent third effort","review":"\\"Red\\" finds her striking out in a new direction, but hey that's a good thing.

If you're a writer who's already pushed to get your work out there, if you've started a semi-successful website or blog, or if you have a semi-successful service- or product-based business, I'm going to guess you already know a thing or two about marketing, e-commerce, etc.As such, this book is too basic. Each chapter was like a good first chapter of a whole book that could've been written with more detail and guidance. I wish the author had taken chapters 7-10 and wrote more about those topics alone, and included more in-depth coverage and real insider tips.Bottom line: If you're looking to dip your toes in the water, this book will do the trick. It's a simple and cursory glance (in the style of ehow.com) at the whole info product field.

If you are getting a book traditionally published or self-published, you may benefit. If your focus is online content, I would keep looking.I feel like the title misrepresents the content. \\"Getting your book published\\" or \\"publishing and marketing your book\\" are more apt. If I didn't feel a little duped by the promise of content, I would probably up my rating to 3 stars.

This is a formulaic romance novel.","review":"It has the required characters and plot movement but it was lacking somehow. I compare this story to a soft drink that lost its fizz. There was nothing sparkling, surprising or delighting. A few times I wished it would be over. The hero is gruff and loses his temper a lot. He meets her and then over a short time, his heart starts melting for her. I would prefer more interesting interaction between them to justify his heart melting. Surely he has been around females in the past that he didn't melt for, so why this one?Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: five. Setting: 1311 Scotland and 1996 New York City.

Elizabeth whined a bit too much and there were conflicting character traits; in the beginning of the book she's a slob, yet the first thing she does upon arriving at Jamie's keep is complain how dirty it is, and then she cleans it! And Nolan's character was a bit too gratuitous... This was a fun read, but ultimately not satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare yourself ! Get Outlander!","review":"OK, the reviews from Cathy and Kim made me pick this one up, and I have to agree with Deborah's review....yuck. Diana Gabaldon has makes this book look as if it were written by a grade schooler. Sorry Lynn, this book completely lacks any real historical detail, the characters are incomplete, and the plot cartoonish. The only real emotion it evoked from me was irritation that Lynn Kurland used the character name \\"Jamie\\" in it.....after almost 4,000 pages of the Outlander series by Gabaldon under my belt (Jamie and Claire for the unfortunate souls who haven't had the priviledge to experience them), I immediately drew a comparison, and Kurland lost miserably. Kim and Cathy, Gabaldon's Jamie is the only one there is! Run to the library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"A complete waste of time. So many people jump through time so often, that the whole concept becomes laughable. The challenge of time-travel novels is to make an unbelievable concept seem possible. This novel failed miserably. Also, the characters were not developed enough, some characters (such as Jaime's brother) just appear at the perfect time with little or no explanation, and for a historical romance, there's absolutely no history. You would be much better off reading Diana Gabaldon's Outlander."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story!","review":"A Dance Through Time is just the 2nd of Lynn Kurland's books that I've read - and now reread 3 times!

The premise of the book is entertaining and the series of adventures which befall the characters are interesting but they are not sufficiently developed. Ms. Kurland makes flat statements and expects the reader to suspend all rational thought and blindly accept the premise that is presented. The shame of it is, if she expanded on the various situations, had the characters live what she is describing, had more dialogue and less exposition, these books could be truly entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"This book was disappointing. I didn't even finish it because it was so boring. Lynn Kurland's other books were very good, but this one ranked very low on my list of good books. The characters seemed implausable and did not fit the usual characteristics. And it was a bit unbelievable that the hero of the book was 30 something and had never kissed a woman.I would not recommend this book. It's a waste of time and money. Definately not worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could not put it down.","review":"This was the best time-travel romance I have yet to read. I shall surely re-read it many times over.

I've read several reviews of Kurland's books and find that the majority of people feel like I do. I even read one review that more or less blasted Kurland for her books being so unreal...COME ON PEOPLE! If you would just read the synopsis on the back of the book, you would realize that they are supposed to be fantasy...not based on true stories. This is fiction at it's best. When you can take historical facts such as the way people conducted themselves and lived their lives in those days, and combine it with a fictional romance and magical time travel, well it's enough to make someone like me wish that it WERE based entirely on fact. THAT, my fellow readers, is what makes a book worth reading. Ms. Kurland...thanks for you wonderful imagination. It brightens my days."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dance Through Time","review":"I have to disagree with Jill on one point. I enjoyed this book very much. Also a Gabaldon fan and waiting for her next book, I needed something to read. I found Ms. Kurland's books easy to read, hard to put down at times and a nice way to pass the time. Though nothing can hold a candle to Gabaldon's Outlander in historical content,and character development, Lynn Kurland's books were all a lot of fun. I'm glad I took the time to read them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"This was the first full-length book of Ms. Kurland's that I read. I had read a short story in Viels of Time about Ian McLeod and loved it so went looking for this one. This story is about Laird James McLeod and the lady he falls in love with from the future, Elizabeth Smith. The story is both sexy and heart-warming. I loved the characters SO much! Another fabulous thing is that the stories continued in \\"The Very Thought of You\\" about Elizabeth's brother Alex and in \\"A Garden in the Rain\\" about James' brother Patrick. I would recommend that you read them all! They are not only sexy but fun and sassy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good to read while waiting for Gabaldon","review":"As an avid fan of the Diana Gabaldon Outlander series of books, I have been bored out of my mind waiting for her next book. Based on the recommendations section of amazon.com I purchased this book as a comparable, and I must say, it is a good comparable. The idea is fairly the same: a woman from contemporary times gets transported back to those \\"simpler\\" times long gone by. I am not far into the book yet, I must admit, but it has captivated me. Anybody who is a fan of Diana Gabaldon will like this book; it's set in Scotland, there's a somewhat parallel story line, and who can resist the fantasy of being swept away by one of those Highlanders anyway?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, another wonderful story","review":"I adore Time-travel books. Whenever I find one I send of to Amazon for it as I cannot get that many in England. Jamie and Elizabeth are brilliant. As soon as you meet Jamie you will fall in love with him. I loved the part of the story when Jamie is talking to Elizabeth's dad on the phone. It makes me laugh so much even before you get to the part. I have read this book about 6 times and I never get fed up with it. This book is a must for any Time-Travel or Lynn Kurland fan. Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst romance I have read this year","review":"I read some fifty romances every year, and this book qualifies as the worst read in 1998.

The romantic elements are quite unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this onel.","review":"After reading the Diana Gabaldon books, I looked for something similar. Lynn Kurland's books are always listed. So I bought one and couldn't finish it. She tells the reader everything rather than showing us the scenery, the landscape, etc. I believe this woman is actually published. My 4th grade students write better narrative than she does. I didn't check, but I'd guess this drivle is about on a 3rd grade reading level. So my advise is: \\"Don't waste your money on this one.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A pale imitation of Outlander...","review":"Like several others, I bought this book because I was completely enchanted by Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. I don't normally read \\"romance\\" novels but Gabaldon blew me away. After reading her books then a 4-part scifi series (the Hyperion saga--another great read) this book was a bitter disappointment. It reminded me exactly why I don't read romance novels. The plot didn't build...the charachters just ended up in situations. Nor was I happy with the charachter development--same complaint. The bright spot in this book is probably toward the end, Kurland's concept of time and time travel is interesting, although not developed enough.This is really a poorly written book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"Ugh! That's what kept repeating in my mind as I read this book. The heroines oneliners will cause your eyes to roll. Without any real character development the only thing that brings the hero and heroine together is the fact that they are of opposite sex. This is a sit-com (a bad one) of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't finish this book","review":"I always like to finish a book but I'm not even half way through and I can't jusify wasting any more time on this book. I'm so disappointed because of all the great reviews but this heroine is just ridiculous. I can't believe them falling in love at all and really, if someone throws you into a slimy bug-filled pit and leaves you there overnight just because he can, is he a hero when he lets you out? I'm sorry, but I don't understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too silly to finish","review":"Although the thought of time traveling to another century to find a the man of your dreams seems appealing, the story was so utterly unbelievable, it spoiled a perfectly good plot!

I liked Dance Through Time so much better! Lynn Kurland's books are funny and enjoyable. This one was no exception. Jamie was a good hero. He was sufficiently arrogant at first and nicely mellowed at the end. Elizabeth was adventurous, yet not too feisty to be interesting.

She went for a walk to clear her mind and dozen off on a bench in a park, when she woke up she was in a forest surrounding the castle of James MacLeod, an arrogant and handsome lord with a very familiar voice.James resisted her as much as he could, but Elizabeth went straight to his heart just as easily as she took over his keep.

It provides an inadequate explanation of the Copenhagen interpretation, and spends too much time on the weird alternatives. The discussion of photons and wave/particle duality is too short for a beginner to get a useful picture of the important issues.The all-too-brief introduction spends far too much time on irrelevant detail, when the short space should have been devoted to quantum fundamentals. For instance, a detailed account of the Aspect experiment is surely totally inappropriate here.The eight physicists involved are probably all the BBC could drum up at short notice. There is no mainstream representative of the Copenhagen interpretation, and the interviews leave you wishing to know what the real big hitters (Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg...) *really* thought about these issues. To find out, you need other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming from the physicists themselves","review":"There are many books on the topic. Firstly, this one is an excellent text which dwells less and less into abstractness and stupid analogies except for such a nature of the theory itself.

I personally thought that it was useless in my breakup and didnt prevent me from repeating a common mistake and call my ex.

Instead, this book teaches us the techniques in recovering from rejection and moving on with the help of a support system. The writing exercises are invaluable and therapeutic.

It was VALIDATING to read about just how much other guys (and gals) like me, feel the way I do. It was also inspiring to know that 'guys like me' who aren't supposed to get their hearts broken.Whether this is true or not... didn't matter. the point is I was validated for feeling awful and feeling ashamed of myself on top of that. The book really takes a dive after about chapter two. The techniques here are out of date, old-fashioned, and hurtful to both parties.

Gideon and his wife Julie excitedly take the trip to the excavation, only to find more than just a skeleton there. Gideon has to dredge up memories of the previous dig at the site when a Mayan codex was stolen by the leader of the dig. A curse left by the Mayans in the Priest's House warns that horrible things will happen to any person who disturbs the site. Little by little the curses begin to happen to the group.

The light works great if the batteries are brand new - however, that level of brightness lasts maybe two mornings. I am very careful to shut the mirror off when not in use; yet, I cannot get top quality batteries to light the thing for more than one business trip before I find myself gravitating toward a light in my room to actually see. It does have a port for an adapter. But, first, it doesn't come with an adapter; plus, I'm already packing charging cords for my phone and computer...it would just be one more thing to forget.

In that sense, it is really good for traveling. But it simply fails because only one of the two mirrors is actually lit. What a poor design choice. Note to Zadro: if you're going to include two mirrors, you should include two lights. I really don't need my face in the regular mirror to be lit from below like some creepy horror-movie face. So I end up: 1.) using natural light (which sort of defeats the purpose of having a mirror with a light), or 2.) tilting the mirror on it's side to use the light from the magnified mirror, in addition to some other light source for the other side of my face. That is a pain. I think if they included a light on the regular mirror, and not just the magnified one, I would give this mirror 4 or 5 stars. Please, Zadro, fulfill my perfect-travel-mirror-dream and light both mirrors."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST mirror ever!!!!!","review":"I travel all of the time for work, and have one of these mirrors for travel, and one for home use.

I don't mind paying a higher price for this mirror if need be...it's SO WORTH IT! Great for tweezing eyebrows and just wonderful for every aspect of applying makeup.

It ended up being a pain. The weight of the mirror would collapse itself when I was using it. The weird design ended up being bad because you cannot maneuver the mirror very well.

However it has a serious flaw. There is a tiny alarm clock that you may not even notice. A couple of years after purchasing this, the alarm battery started going haywire. I could not figure out where the beep of an alarm was coming from in the middle of the night, and finally traced it to this mirror. The bad news is that the battery on the dumb alarm has now been going off intermittently for some time, but it is impossible to replace the alarm batteries. We have tried-- believe me.So it goes off at odd times all during the day and night. I thought it would run out of juice, but it is not doing so. I now have to either continue to listen to the stupid beeping, or discard this mirror and purchase a new, different one-- one without an alarm on it.Throwing it in the trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My wife loves this mirror, BUT","review":"I purchased this for my wife a few years ago. It lasted about 1 year before the glass fell out and broke. It still had the 10X mirror so she used it for another year or so until it died.So, I searched for a replacement, but this model won again, and I purchased another. It died after just a few weeks. I replaced it again, and that one died after a few months of use (after the warranty expired).I wish they would fix their quality control issues.

I just hold it so I can see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought this was the best choice, but I was wrong","review":"I read all the customer reviews for \\"lighted mirrors\\" on Amazon, and this one was given 5 stars by 2 people - so I bought it. The mirror's 8x magnification is really great - you'll see everything up close and in detail that other mirrors won't show you. The lighting is bright and pleasing. However, the quality of adjusting the height is pretty lame. It slides up and down easily even when it's tightened to full capacity. Also, the clock/alarm in mine is messed up. The alarm goes off even at the slightest touch of the mirror, and the buttons are very stiff and it's impossible to program the day or the time (and yes the alarm is still going off all the while). I don't want to buy another cell battery to see if that is what the problem is. I've spent several hours already trying to make it work. I am sending it back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lighted mirror","review":"I just want to say that if you want a lighted makeup mirror, don't waste your money on this one because it has \\"bells and whistles\\". It apparently has an LED clock and alsrm clock, but I could never get it to work. The light does not work, but the alarm goes off every morning at 4am and I am not able to reset it.

To begin with, it wouldn't work at all with batteries. I tried plugging it in, and then I did get a good light. I was disappointed at that point because I wanted to take it on a cruise and use the battery. But because of poor performance with the battery, I had to take the heavy plug on the cruise. The second time I went to use it - nothing! Nothing we did could get it to work. And it was too late to return it. I was so mad, I didn't even want to carry it home. Guess I can use it without any light at all, but that sure defeated the purpose of buying this lighted mirror. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positive Feedback on the Zadro Utlimate Lighted Makeup Mirror","review":"The Zadro Lighted Mirror is a quality product when compared to a previously owned Sharper Image product that cost twice as much.The light adjusts to the amount of light in the room and is adjustable for easy viewing.The light is compact and great for home use. The additional bonus is being able to fold the mirror which minimizes the size for packing in a suitcase. Another great quality is you can either use batteries or the provided supply source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one mirror is lighted","review":"I received the Zadro mirror about a week ago. While I liked the quality of the light, I was disappointed in several ways. First, the height only adjusts a little bit--maybe 2-3.\\" So even the top mirror wasn't really high enough for me to use it easily for makeup application. Second, the hinged style of the mirror was annoying, because it wouldn't really stay in place. Third, only the bottom of the two mirrors (the magnified one) was lit. The top one wasn't lit at all, and that was the one I really wanted to use. Overall, I was very disappointed. I am returning the item today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close Up","review":"I bought the travel mirror for my wife at Christmas. She loves it so much she uses it more than her regular vanity mirror.

However, the aforementioned albums are better than this one. Are the King's resources exhausted? Not at all, but this album, while very good, shows how hard is to keep writing original music after many years of innovation. Simply, there is nothing new to say in spite of this marvelous horror tale, the powerful sound, the great production and the very professional musicianship of the band (particularly Andy LaRocque sounds great here, not mentioning Diamond's vocals and the superb rhythmic baseline). In few words, a very solid work from one of the few classic bands that still are sailing over there with honor.

The plot line was hugely imaginative, the characterisation uncommonly fine, and the style of the whole thing marked Palmer as a truly gifted author. This is a book which, should you read it, you will not want it to end. When it does, inevitably, you will go to the ends of the earth to find the sequel, and, like me, not find it after a ten year search. For some reason Palmer just never got around to finishing the sequel (as far as I know), and this man, who by rights should have become a giant in the world of Science Fiction/Fantasy, remains relatively unrecognised and undiscovered to this day.

Forward, and this stands up against any of their best.Even better news: if you look at the page for his other published book, \\"Emergence\\", you will see that he is still alive (at least as of last year) and has in fact written three(!) new books. The sequel to \\"Emergence\\" was serialized in Analog last year, and is supposed to be out in paperback some time, and the sequel to this book is finished and again theoretically will be published some day.

As he develops throughout this multiphase book, you like him more and more for his resourceful handling of what Palmer throws at him. I'm only sorry that Palmer has disappeared!

Seven members of the Palisades Defence company are on a Eastern European tour. They stop off for a weekend of team-building at a luxury resort, but get lost and find themselves amidst a group of mad killers who enjoy picking them off, one-by-one, for no apparent reason than the fact that they are there. The attempts at dark humor are uneven, at best, and no rhythm of horror and humor ever develops. The characters don't develop either, and we're left hoping that the next kill will be the last, just so the movie will end."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a little bit of \\"Office\\", \\"Deliverance\\" and \\"Lords of War\\"","review":"A multinational munitions company sends seven of their employees to Hungary for a team building exercise.

If this was going to be a slasher film, the real violence should have started a lot sooner--halfway into the film is a little too late and the buildup for 45 minutes just wears you down. On the other hand, there are some fairly funny places in the film. Hilarious? Not really. From what others had told me, that's what I'd expected and was sorely disappointed only to have chuckled in a couple of places.I'd rent this one--on a cheap day. See if you like it, then buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody awful","review":"\\"Severance\\" disappointed me. In my opinion, it is neither especially funny nor suspenseful. A 90-minute slasher movie should not take 45 minutes for the slashing to begin. The characters were two dimensional (uptight boss, stoner, brownnose, hot American) and the film did not make me care for any of them. The villains were forgettable and without a gimmick, and their backstory as either escaped loonies or soldiers who were experimented on was weak and unoriginal. If I had made this movie, I would have made the bad guys a group also on a team building exercise--only their exercise is to kill a bunch of people."},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"It didn't have enough of anything to keep me interested.

While she goes through different case studies, the recommendations are usually the same: go into business for yourself and set up different corporations. There are SO many ignorant recommendations that I just stopped marking them. For example, while you can invest your IRA in real estate using a Self Directed IRA she sure doesn't point out the down side of this such as: if you invest in real estate outside of an IRA you can leverage the real estate (you can't do this if you use a self directed IRA but of course she recommends this constantly: like buying 10 rentals with 6K down each, etc), any profits in an IRA come out taxed as ordinary income, if you sold the investment outside the IRA, it would be taxed at the lower capital gain rates.

There is no value in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I bought this book because I was under the impression that Ms. Langemeier would work with ordinary people like myself - and change their lives.

The ideas that Loral presents in this book are definitely unconventional, but they are also very applicable. Yes, ANYONE can get on the road to more wealth IF they believe in themselves, IF they get a plan, IF they get a team and IF they get into massive action. Just reading the book alone will not do it, but it's a great place to start.I have built a small fortune using the same techniques that Loral presents in this book and I have seen many people inside Loral's network do the same very quickly.

But he puts such feeling into building up each tune - no song of his starts on high emotion - Bobby likes the slow burn, you dig? When I play his music for my friends they think it's someone having a laugh - sort of like comedian Lenny Henry doing his Theo T Wildebeast routine (especially going by the photos in the jacket too - they're in a classic pimp style).

First of all, I had to read this book for school, and though this may have biased my opinion slightly, I just plain found it dull. It had a wonderful beginning, which made me excited to continue, but after that it rambled to the point of dullness. He would go on and on for chapters describing meaningless things making it very difficult to pick up the novel to keep reading. The epilogue was one giant jumble to me. I couldn't understand the language at times, and the theme he was trying to drive home could have easily been described in a few short paragraphs.

Ellison reminds me a little of Joyce, i.e., the writing, prose and style are inventive and, at times, beautiful. However, unlike Joyce, the story goes nowhere and any revelations seem naive. Though the story was/is hailed by many as brilliant, the narrative seems flat and Ellison's characters are mostly realized as overly-broad caricatures. In the end, the novel's premise is fundamentally flawed as Ellison seems unable to distinguish between racism, hatred/distrust of the poor and institutional (religious, corporate, governmental, etc.) oppression.

It is a profound and compelling book about the evolution of a black man seeking his identity--or lack thereof--in the American society of post WWII. It is deeply sociological and philosophical, while packed with lots of interesting characters, stories and action, I will need to re-read more times to probe its layers of meanings and symbolism further. While specific in time and place, with much of the story taking place in NYC's Haarlem section, it is universal in its many messages. A must read, no matter your race (I am not black)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Difficult Book, Yet Beautifully Written","review":"In my many years of reading, I have never come across a book that was written as well as Invisible Man. Although the prose and the language used by Ellison is extremely difficult, it paints a picture so vivid, you think you are actually in the book.It is a striking portrayal of what life was like for people like the main character. It was simply a horrific thing to experience, yet the genius of Ellison has somehow put it into writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary fun house","review":"As opposed to the straightforward social realism of fellow Harlem Resonance icon, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison employs a distinctly allegorical and baroque approach for his portrait of pre-Civil Rights Movement, African-American life, Invisible Man. Mr. Ellison's tale of a nameless, black college student's journey from the constraining South to the unreal black mini-nation of Harlem is a walk through a literary fun house, full of comedic satire, surreal exaggeration, elusive symbolism and almost beatnick-style lyricism. Mr. Ellison certainly shows a flair for absorbing the wretchedness, paranoia and hypocrisy that was abound during this era and reformatting it all into a configuration that underscores its wrongness and absurdity. Invisible Man proved Mr. Ellison to be one of the most striking authors of the Harlem Resonance and certainly the most dynamic and experimental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iwas assigned this book and most books get better b","review":"When I started it was because I was bored.

He goes through various experiences which contribute to his feeling of invisibility. Though the narrator feels he is nothing, his knowledge and insight, which he is constantly imparting to the reader, ensure that he does indeed exist. I recommend this novel to the reader who enjoys African-American literature. It is a long read (more than 500 pages), so you must have patience. Ellison's great descriptions and mastery of prose enhance the reading of this splendid novel. Spend some time, and you will find this book was worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!

This is a masterpiece of fiction. However, it helps to read the book with commentary and notes. The messages of Ellison will come to light this way. Every person living in the US today should read the book. Unfortunately, so many people living in this country are still invisible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the audio cassettes","review":"For the most part, this is an excellent set of tapes. Joe Morton does a remarkable job creating distinct voices and characters throughout his reading, often to the point where I had to remind myself that there was only a single man performing. And of course, the story is magnificent. There's only one problem with this set of tapes: they left off the ending. That's right, tape 11 out of 11 ends without the last chapter or the epilogue. I had to borrow a friend's copy of the book to read the ending. It's a real shame, this could have been an excellent set of tapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aren't we all invisible?","review":"The first half of this book really had my interest. It is well-written and it kept the reader enthralled. Once the narrator joins the Brotherhood the book is no longer a thought-provoking journey which the reader shares with the main character but, instead, becomes a giant soap box on which Ellison stands, pouring out his views on humanity, on prejudice, and on what he sees as the \\"invisibility\\" of the black man. This is not to say what he writes is unimportant, on the contrary it is quite important- and powerful. I felt the book lost everything when it moved, mid-stream, from a novel about the black experience and man's search for identity to a speech-filled tirade on the identity crisis of Black Americans."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read","review":"The Invisible Man is about a man who lost his way after high school and dropped out of college. So he then embarks a journey to truly find himself, but ends up in a situation far worse from where he started from. This book follows the narrator's journey from the South to the cities of New York. In my opinion, this book is mainly for mature audiences, so I don't recommend this book to minors. This book deals with racism, so if you are easily offended by racism, I wouldn't recommend it. If you enjoy existentialist ideals and dark humor, you would enjoy reading this book. Personally, I read this for a literature project in my senior year in high school, and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. For my recommendation, buy this in paperback, because I personally think this book is worth it to read and keep, but not to pass on to your kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invisible Man","review":"In this novel, the narrator , or the main character, struggles with himself.

While in New York City he joins an activist group called The Brotherhood.The main character , who through out the entire book does not have a name, has an internal problem. He is struggling to find himself.A major theme in this book was finding ones self. The book appealed to me in a logical way, it made me think about how many people don't know who they are, even as adults.Personally, this is a book I could have passed on.

There are rumors of a \\"twelve tape\\" edition which *contains* the final chapters, but I see no evidence that the version sold by amazon contains twelve tapes: the ISBN, publishing date, and all other details seem to match my eleven tape copy exactly.

Unfortunately I found this one very dissapointing. (So much so that I chose to leave my copy finished in a hotel room.) There are some choice nuggets in it, but by and large it says a lot without saying much at all. Rather than challenging guys of my age it seemed to just go soft on us, and challenge us to get in touch with our inner boy. I hungered for more. It was also very light on sharp biblical advice - which I'd hope for from these Christian writers. Arterburn is a talented writing who has a very easy-going readable style. But here he felt more like a good buddy that didn't want to rock the boat than the mentor or the coach he had permission to be when I bought his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly Rhetoric","review":"Having read \\"Every Man's Battle\\" and taking away a lot of useful information and techniques, I really looked forward to reading this book. I was disappointed in the first few pages. The writing sounds like a silly conversation. While the style may engage some, it made anything useful the authors had to say non-authoritative. Arterburn's previous book was well-written, well-organized and useful. This book made me feel like he was just writing a book to write another book. There was very little applicable information relative to other books on midlife issues. The bottom line is, if the reader is looking for some midlife direction, this book may provide a couple of ideas, areas of focus, and techniques, but not many. Look elsewhere for advice on the midlife, male topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"This book was not what I expected.

However it is the strength of the \\"Jewels\\" - Topaz and Amythyst Plantagenet - that shines through the drama, intrigue, and love lives of these remarkable women. The authenticity of dress, manner, and historical events gave added interest to this many-faceted and multi-splendored depiction of court life in England during the early years of the 16th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice variety","review":"I liked that the interior of the cards are in color.

One of them makes a stab at doing something meaningful by auditioning for a play. The other 2 just use drugs and have sex all day. The one attempting to get a part in the play is hopelessly bad.

It was glorified gay porn, and not even good porn. I can appreciate films that go to extremes and make artistic choices but this film did nothing of the sort.

I can't say how the plot line was, since I only watched a few minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title of the movie describes itself","review":"Basically, the summary at the back of the case has much more depth than the feature. The characters and plot are so boring and recurring to the point of becoming annoying. The premise was good, but everything was poorly executed. The performances were not believable, the characters where so flat they even lacked unidimensionality and the plot was all over the place. I can assure you that you will gain nothing by watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"My day was \\"Wrecked\\" by sitting through this \\"movie\\"","review":"This appears to be nothing more than a series of unscripted, improvised scenes, a great many of them sexual. Is it supposed to be a (im-)morality tale? Can't tell. Production values are non-existent. The only reason anyone would watch this is for the many, obviously not just simulated, sex scenes. But the characters (and, alas, actors) are unappealing. We get it: they are young; they do drugs; they have lots of sex. But we are given no reason to care about any of these characters. And, I am afraid, even if we did care, the movie is so meandering and poorly made that it would still be torturous to sit through.

Let's cut to the chase. I've had a different harness from Crooked Horn Outfitters for over 10 years. That harness is amazing and well built. What a contrast to the Nikon that I just purchased. The Nikon is uncomfortable and cheaply constructed. If you just need a harness for the backyard the Nikon will do, but if you want a harness for birding, hiking or hunting, do yourself a favor and buy the CHO model. The Zeiss / Swaro / Leica harnesses are all made by this company. They are made in the USA and will last you a long time.I do not work for this company but I love high quality products. Nikon should brand one through them as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nikon Prostaff Binocular Harness","review":"This item was offered as a suggested accessory to the Nikon Monarch ATB 8X42 Waterproof Binoculars that I purchased.

The hook part of the snap is too thick to go through the strap eyelet on the binoculars.Other than that the harness is a well made quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamite harness; great value","review":"I shopped around quite a bit before I found this item. I now have one for every SLR camera and every pair of binos in the house. Why you would want a strap around your neck is beyond me. This item takes the pressure off your neck and prevents the camera or binos from flopping around when you walk. I don't know why these are marketed only for binos, because they are just as useful for cameras. I found several more expensive versions of this item, but this one works great. Nothing fancy--just very functional and a good value. I am delighted with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"works as intended","review":"Keeps the binoculars close to your body so when you lean over they don't swing out away from your body possibly striking something, damaging the binoculars.

JUNK!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Harness was not as shown in the picture.","review":"I bought this harness because of the connecting straps from the harness to the binoculars. I have compact binoculars and wanted the extention straps for a better fit. The set I received did not have the extention straps included. The harness was the same as all the other harnesses I could buy locally for much less money with the only difference being the name on the back. If you are buying these because of the extention straps, you should email the seller first to make sure the straps are included before spending the extra dollars. They were well made, just not the same item as shown in the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anybody measure?","review":"The elastic pieces were not cut to the same length. Therefor, there is an 8\\" difference in strap adjustment lengths. This made it almost impossible, without the help of someone else, to adjust the straps by yourself. The NIKON shoulder pad on one side was not able to pad the shoulder because it could not slide over plastic strap adjuster 'thing'; it had to be 8 inches higher on that side. The plastic clips are CHEAP, to say the least, and using a metal keyring and a plastic connector was also cheap. GREAT idea, but since I bought mine I have seen several other higher quality harnesses. I would definitely NOT recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ash Canyon Hike","review":"I used the harness for the first time last weekend. Steep 6 mile hike. My bino's hung in there just great. No chaffing from a neckstrap. They didn't bounce around. When I pulled them up to my eyes the elastic strap made this an easy maneuver.

Many tracks of \\"The Wild, the Willing and the Innocent\\" were hacked off at the end. It was not editing; the CD was defective. More important: it was not only that CD.

Easy to assemble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I love this stroller. I decided to buy this particular model due to the excellent reviews and I am very happy I did. I liked the low price, and the fact that it's only 17 lbs makes a huge difference in long runs (I am currently training for a marathon and have to do most of my running with baby). The fixed wheel is not too hard to maneuver (it's safer to run with a fixed wheel anyway if you are going at a faster pace), and the storage is adequate for my needs. I usually put a head stabilizing pad or a blanket behind my little boy for extra padding. I highly recommend this for anyone who doesn't want to spend a ton of money on a running stroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for runners or walkers","review":"This stroller provides a smooth, quiet ride for my two month old son whether I'm walking or running.

Everyone knows how to make a bowl out of a record and if not it is very accessible online just like every other project in this book. I also did not like how there were only a few pictures in the book. I have a hard time making things without knowing how they are supposed to turn out.

The base still works as a thermometer, but it just got tired of looking for the signal from the outdoor transmitter. The only way I can get it to work is to remove the batteries from the base...wait, put them back in...it will look for the transmitter for a while and get a reading...then it gets tired of that and gives me dashed lines.I've tried everything, the thing is just broken.

I use the clock and the temperature functions. Most of the time, it works fine. I never use the alarm. The unit is prone to throwing little electronic fits from time to time such as refusing to tell me the outside temperature. The fix is usually to put the two units adjacent to each other for a while. However, yesterday (06/20/08), the inside unit registered 112 deg F at 5 am. It had been 112 outside the day before, but was around 75 at 5 am. I opened the outside unit, replaced the batts (it prefers DuroCells), pressed reset and closed it up. It still showed 112 on the inside unit. I opened that one up, pulled the batts, let it stand for a while and put in 2 new DuroCells. Then I let them commiserate together for a while, and the system decided to work again.

Overall, we can assert that this book is above all a collection of pictures taken from 1933 to 1945, retracing the 12-year life of the 3d Reich through its leaders. The chronological structure helps the reader dive alongside the European people of the 30's into the abysses of the Holocaust. The latter step is reached after a series of thrilling and frightening visual and written testimonies of that period. Laurence Rees accurately explains the mecanisms of the Nazi regime and its policy towards peoples . Beware however, this bok is not dealing with the military aspect of the 3d Reich but packs a living testimony ,through contemporary witnesses of the deep horror of Hitler's killing machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book!!!","review":"This book covers the politics and rise to power of the Nazi Party in the 20's and 30's. It also covers the way in which the Nazis ran the government while in power and during the war. It is a fantastic book that presents all the important details in a fast paced read.

It dragged on and were a lot of characters thrown in there for...what reason??? Just to fill it up a bit??Linda Howard can get anyone hot and bothered, but is it getting routine for her. She has a real talent for the lusty sections, but it has been clouding over a bit lately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best...","review":"When I finished reading this book I had to double-check it was a new Linda Howard and not a 1980s reissue. The reason? It reads like a bad 1980s romantic thriller i.e. 'tough' heroine is as tough as jelly (especially were the hero is concerned), the hero is a macho jerk who spends 90 percent of the time distrusting the heroine and the other 10 percent having meningless sexual encounters with her and, as for the thriller element, there was no real plot or whodunnit element to the story. On finishing it one of my biggest questions was 'why?'. Why was it called a romantic thriller? It's neither romantic, in the true sense, or thrilling. An average book at best, and a poor example of Linda Howard's romantic thrillers, of which I am a fan. Please don't read this book first...instead try these LH books: Now You See Me, Kill and Tell, Mr Perfect and All the Queen's Men.

It was so mind-numblingly boring that I had to stop. There was too much time spent on things that didn't matter. The relationship was nonexistent for the first quarter of the book. I do hope this isn't a shift in her writing. Her last two releases have been disappointments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"This is the BEST Linda Howard I've read, and I've read quite a few of her novels. I loved the psychological points of views of Cahill, Sarah and the killer (who was quite a lethal fellow!). I resonated with the romantic aspects, in terms of expectations. My eyes watered with the determination of Cahill to show Sarah how much he loved her towards the end. I thought the book was well-written and the plot was good. I, too, had a problem though with the \\"make up\\" sex. I thought Cahill took advantage of Sarah's shell-shocked body and demeanor. It was selfish. Other than that, it was a page turner.If you enjoy sex, murder and romance this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dying to please - did!","review":"Can always count on Linda Howard to give us a good story. I liked it very much and read it in one afternoon. Began with suspense and you were on the heroine's side right away.Linda always gets in a few remarks that make you smile and this is no exception. The villian was creepy; the final chapters were a bit of a stretch but I wanted to enjoy the story and I did. There are a lot of Linda Howard's book on my bookshelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept trying, but gave up halfway in...","review":"I gave up reading this about halfway in. I admit I double-checked a couple of times while reading it to make sure that I wasn't reading a book of the same title by a new, inexperienced author. I thought maybe I had downloaded the wrong book due to the poor writing skills. The author included way too many irrelevant details in the narrative (down to the hair color of minor characters, as well as the temperature at various times of the day - all irrelevant to the storyline), as well as many other non-essential (and very distracting) details. There was very little action compared to the plodding narrative, plodding dialogue, and plodding plot; and after plodding through halfway and realizing that a skilled author should've covered all that (and more) in less than a chapter, and with much more oomph and tension, I decided that it just wasn't worth my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT HER BEST!!","review":"THIS WAS NOT EVEN AN AVERAGE BOOK. THE PLOT OF THE BOOK SUCKED REALLY BAD. THE BAD GUY IS AN OLD GEEZER WHO IS A BIG PERVERT AND COMES TOTALLY OUT OF LEFT FIELD.

I TYPICALLY READ LINDA HOWARD'S BOOKS WITHIN DAYS (GOTTA EAT, SLEEP AND GO TO WORK) BUT FOR SOME REASON I HAD A VERY HARD TIME TRYING TO FINISH THIS ONE. IT TOOK ME ALMOST A WHOLE WEEK TO FINISH IT.

I will think twice before I buy a hardcover book of hers again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not believable","review":"I guess this novel would be termed a suspense-romance. There's no real mystery because we learn very early who the villain is. Unfortunately, the villain is one-dimensional.In fact, that's the problem with other characters. They have no depth. Many are stereotypes. The main character is too good to believe.The biggest flaw is that the plot and characters are not believable. The writer is not untalented, but this novel is not entertaining. Definitely wasn't worth my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent if you're looking for sensuality!","review":"If you are one for sensuality this is definately the book for you. The story line is a bit graphic. The premise is that the main character Sarah Stevens is a highly paid, well trained butler who just so happens to double for a bodyguard. She's of course the beautiful, strong willed athletic sort (every woman's basic nightmare), but somehow extremely loveable.Your heart really has to go out to her when her employers suddenly start becoming victims of mysterious homosides that somehow places her as the prime suspect. The real twist comes in when the head detective on the case, Tom Cahill becomes the steamy romantic interest.I will say that it takes Ms. Howard a while to get the duo right to it, but I assure you, once those two go at it, they do it well... and OFTEN!The book has a wonderful plot, a great deal of suspense, and excellent sensuality. I would not hesitate to grab another of Linda Howards books!!! Do yourself a favor and read this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first...","review":"This is my first Linda Howard book. She definitely knows how to write sensual scenes--whew! The story of a woman butler being stalked by an obsessed man is well done. I will definitely seek out other Howard books and look forward to new ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story that I really got into!","review":"\\"Dying to Please\\" by Linda Howard was a romantic mystery that I really got into!I finished this book in one night. The storyline was that interesting!The characters are moving and the plot exciting. The dialogue could have been a little more thoughtout but doable. The plot made up for the less excting conversations shared between main characters.If good romantic mysteries are your thing then you won't want to miss \\"Dying to Please.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait!","review":"For longtime fans of Linda Howard, this one was well worth the wait. After only good novels like \\"Open Season\\" and the collection \\"Strangers in the Night\\", Howard finally gives us a true 5 star performance with this one. I bought it the day it came out and finished it in just a few hours~I simply couldn't put it down! With a fresh perspective on a butler, Howard gives us Sarah Stevens, a much sought after buter who is worthy of her praise. She is strong, both emotionally and physically and fans of a strong and intelligent female character will cheer for her. Her male counterpart, Thomas Cahill is equaly appealing. He is Howard's typical Alpha male, but a believable one who readers will enjoy getting to know. If you liked \\"Mr. Perfect\\", then this one is for you! Don't bother waiting for paperback~you'll want this one in hardback!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Let me start by saying that I have every book Linda Howard has written and loved all of them except this one. I am finding it difficult to believe that Linda wrote this piece of garbage. There really is no story line and if I wanted gratuitous explicit sex I could find other books that do a better job. The \\"heroine\\" doesn't ever want to see the love of her life again but when he knocks on the door, she immediately has sex with him??? PULEEZE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected better too!","review":"Wow - I can't believe all the 5 star ratings on this book. Makes me think I didn't read the same one as everything else. Definitely not one of LH better books. I found the plot to be rather simple and the characters just okay. The sex scenes were a little too explicit for my tastes plus the characters were in lust not love. It will be awhile before I buy another one of her hardcover versions. Reading this book felt like reading on auto-pilot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not up to Linda Howard standards.","review":"I have always enjoyed all of Linda Howards books since she first began writing. Her men are always dynamic and make you wish they were real. This book was an absolute disappointment. The intrugue was great, but the characters, especially Cahill, just never seemed to develop. When I gave it my neighbor, who I swap books with, especially Linda Howard's, I told her to pass it on, I didn't want it back. It was the one Linda Howard book that I would not be keeping in my collection. I hope her next book lives up to my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I usually read the Linda Howard books but find her output uneven. Some good, some not so good. Nothing wrong with the writing per se, but sometimes they tend to the banal. I'm sick of the psycho type killers. I feel this one was written by the numbers. Hot sex, but that's not enough to make a book good. I'll probably pick up her next one, hoping that she'llbe back up to form."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOUR and 1/2 STARS to be more precise","review":"I have read all of Linda Howard's books, and reread several over again and again. This is the first hardback I have bought-I usally wait for the library to get it-and I feel it was a worthwhile purchase. I liked the heroine who is both vulnerable and strong; her job of butler was unique plus her being a bodyguard. The hero, who is MR. ALPHA wonderful (my favorite), is a detective with an attitude, but eventually overcomes his prejudices; he grovels quite well, too. When LH's hero's focus on the heroine, it is with an all-consuming passion.I was disappointed with the portrayal of the villian; he had no substance or depth: he was 'useful' to the plot of the story. Aside from this, I enjoyed DYING TO PLEASE very much. Linda Howard has NEVER disappointed me, and I look forward to purchasing her next bestseller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back Linda","review":"The last book of LH that I read was Open Season, what a waste! Since then I was waiting for a new book, and this one was amazing, it has some boring parts that doesn't have to do anything with the main story, but the book will almost all the time keeps you reading and wondering how it will be in your house a female butler... and bodyguard, the way that Cahill thinks that Sarah is the killer, and the way that Sarah defend herself just LH knows how to write it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dyng to Please","review":"Is this \\"today's woman\\"?

I watched it with my God daughter when she was young, since it was evident even then she would be a part of the popular crowd, and I wanted her to see that she shouldn't pick on those who aren't.However, what I really want to review is the music in the movie. For whatever reason, the soundtrack CD doesn't include the two main songs in the movie (including the one for which Roxy is supposedly famous!). Both those songs were written and performed by Melissa Etheridge. One of them, I Will Never Be the Same, was fleshed out and added to Melissa's ground-breaking career-making album, Yes I Am. The second is a partial song entitled Don't Look At Me. She never recorded it, and this is the only place you can hear it. Both songs are used very effectively in this movie. If you are a fan of Melissa Etheridge, this movie is a must-see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery dead after 2 months - Buyer Beware.","review":"I purchased this watch on July 26th.

As the seasons of her Vermont year turn, tiny details of the changes nature makes in the woods and sky reflect and enhance the human stories she tells. To open the heart of another, one must endure the heartbreak and revel in the joy of each moment, but above all, one must listen. From violent to nearly mute, the voices of Marcia's clients speak to her soul, transforming therapist and patients alike.To relish this book, one needs no formal training in psychology, although therapists will appreciate the companionship of a walk with Marcia Hill. However, anyone who has worked with people and watched them grow, anyone who has ever paid attention to her own cycles of loss and fruition, and anyone who enjoys sensitive, authentic writing will delight in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it would be better...","review":"I ordered \\"His California\\" and I was a bit disappointed. It was okay, but I just thought it would be better based on the reviews that I read. It sounded a bit too commercial for me and like a bunch of extra songs that didn't do too well made into an album. Maybe Im just not a big enough Bobby fan and wasnt able to appreciate it as much as some of his other work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Soujourn of Love","review":"A book of love poetry by Ms. Ve. Ester St. Obria Lyles, deserves a look from anyone who has ever been in love. Because it is one \\"emotional roller coaster,\\" that will have you looking back at love past, present, and how you divulge your love in the future. She touches on everything from first meetings to lovers cheating. Even touching on the guilt you feel when you are the one deviating outside of the love. Just makes one wonder how much of this book this young lady has lived. And how much is just pure and good literary skills. No matter what the catalyst was for such touching, personal, and pungent feelings, I advise all that have the gift of love to pick this one up. It's a good and easy read that will touch you in the most sensitive and emotional ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tied for first place","review":"I can't decide which album is my favorite: this one or Violence has Arrived. Both are similar in style but VhA is a bit heavier. This album still has some very heavy songs such as Whargoul, Crush, Kill, Destroy, Stalin's Organs, Martyr Dumb, etc. But it also has some more punkish humorous songs such as The New Plague. Still though, the only song that I really just don't like on this album is Think You Otta Know This. Whargoul may very well be the best GWAR song of all times, and Martyr Dumb and Meat Sandwich should also be considered classics. The booklet is also really good. Read through it and you'll find it's quite an entertaining read. All in all you can't go wrong with this album. If you haven't heard it, Whargoul is worth the price of the CD alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is my favorite Gwar CD. Its not like there punk sounding stuff. Its more metal.

It was made right after his outstanding comeback CD's with Mercyful Fate (\\"In the Shadows\\" and \\"Time\\") and carries a distinct MF heaviness, imo. Unlike most KD albums, this disc does not have an album long story (although it does have a few songs that go together to form a short story), but that does not detract from the quality of the songs or the heaviness of the music. This is, imo, one of KD's heaviest solo discs. I like the album all the way through, but the standouts for me are From the Other Side (one of the best KD songs on any album, imo), Dreams, and To the Morgue. If you like King Diamond and/or Mercyful Fate, this is a disc you should definitely buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one.","review":"There are a few decent songs, but this album is King's only miss.

His character is one that you will respect and love in the end. He's the real thing in cowboys here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heaven help us from newbie Western \\"afficionados!\\"","review":"Wow, this is truly one of the worst westerns I have ever seen. A \\"minor classic\\"? I dont think so. And who cares if Heston \\"becomes Will Penny\\"? A solid individual performance but not enough to overcome a weak storyline, and even weaker script.Had the director followed the classic formula and left the ubiquitous Joan Hackett in the background that may have been enough to salvage this turkey. As it is, she occupies way to much of the screen and THAT is a major distraction. But if you like the creeping sentimentality of mush like Rooster Cogburn, the Shoot Out, and that silly out of place \\"Raindrops\\" scene in Butch Cassidy then you will probably love this thing.The DVD transfer is nothing spectacular, I'd give the video/audio *** and the soundtrack gets *. What a dud, I think the producers of Walking Tall used this soundtrack as inspiration. You've been warned.

And of course flip charts and VCRs are gone now, too, and we have the Internet. There was so much to update, the book really needed to be re-written.Well, It isn't updated one bit. It's reads like we're still in the year 1982 using 3x5 cards and DayTimer planners and playing phone tag on landlines.In this so-called revision, Tom certainly hasn't practiced what he preaches about excellence and attention to detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fundamentals. A little disjointed.","review":"I am brand new to selling, so I appreciate this book for what it is; a really good overview of the selling process. It's also a great reference that I've often gone back and thumbed through. However, it seems most targeted toward consumer sales areas such as automobiles, insurance, or retail. A couple of the methods, such as asking customers to call their friends and family right there on the spot for a referral, seem kind of old school and tacky, and not applicable to corporate sales. The book also jumps around a bit. Hopkins will advise using a technique or mention a term which he then says will be covered in a later chapter. It's kind of disorienting. Otherwise, it's a solid primer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sales intro","review":"Anyone working can get some value from reading this book.

If you're looking to touch the basics or soft skills I recommend it. However it is written mainly for sales that involve meeting prospects in person.

He outlines many specific scripts and strategies that are easily adapted to various situations. This is the best \\"how to\\" book I have come across.While the fundamentals of selling are still basically the same (perserverence, follow-through, shameless self promotion etc.) the author did a nice job of bringing his approaches into the 21st century.The book is well worth the money, both for the updates and the re-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Lost My Religion - When I Found Amazing Grace","review":"Your book is proof that a new wave of though is sweeping over the land, opening the Bible allegories for the true message waiting to be taught.

This is a great BIG improvement over the first record he cut and it's too bad it's the last one he made because it would have been great to see where he went from here. The best songs on here are Some Girls,Shakin All Over,Fingerprints and She's Trouble. Many people don't like actors singing but i collect their records so this was right up my alley,also if you are a Scott Baio fan check out a movie he made called A Wedding For Bella (aka The Bread My Sweet) it is to die for great stuff filmed in my hometown of PITTSBURGH Pa."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life-changing book","review":"I grew up in Oregon, and spent much of my childhood in wet, green, ocean-sprayed places like the ones described in this book. I first read Trask as a high schooler, and return to it now and then (I am 55 now), refreshed and moved by it. It always strikes me as a deeply male story. I don't mean that in the regrettable, hyperviolent context that defines pop-culture maleness today, but rather, Trask reflects the deeper male tendency toward pure, visceral restlessness. Just as it is quintessentially female to stay and nest, it is quintessentially male to simply go, to explore, to light out just because you can't stop yourself from doing so. When I was younger I did this all the time; just went, like that, anywhere, everywhere, all around the world. I have never read another book that expresses this tendency so well in a main character. Reading about Trask helped me to understand myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"An adventure set in the County where I grew up...","review":"I grew up in Clatsop County where this book opens.

It was a big disappointment because I felt the author blew it when it came to good history and the dependence of the early pioneers on God. Really way out there with the spiritual thing--men and women back then believed and relied on God, not some out of body, out of mind experience. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blues-tinged folk interpreter","review":"This was Terry Callier's first album, recorded in 1964. Singing and playing guitar, and accompanied by upright bass only, the recording is a straightforward, laid-back rendering of mostly traditional folk material. His voice is clear and melodic and expressive, and he infuses much of what he sings with a touch of the blues . Highlights include superb versions of COTTON EYED JOE, 900 MILES, and JOHNNY BE GAY IF YOU CAN BE. The most impressive track is the lengthy blues ballad I'M A DRIFTER, which tells a personal story of woe in a slow, dirge-like fashion that is almost hypnotic. But every track on the CD is interesting and pleasurable to listen to. Definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"Easy to hammer into the bottom of wood legs.

These were also cheaper than same/similar from other online sources."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a set of chair leg pads that work","review":"I've gone thru many, many dozens of stick on felt pads from several brands . All were garbage. It seemed they lasted for less time than they took me to install them. These nail on guys are much more substantial in their felt and are extremely easy to install. In fact, I say they are easier than their stick on cousins because you have to fuss with getting the wax paper off the others before applying them. These, line em up and give them a couple of whacks with the hammer, your done. They have already outlasted the others twice over and show minimal distortion/wear. When they do become worn out in the future the very same pads will go on the chairs again. Almost anyone that has been frustrated time after time with the stick on's will appreciate these guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Felt pads do not stay on chair legs","review":"I have used many felt pads for the bottom of chairs and these are the only ones I have ever used that come off the legs easily. The felt is good quality but the poor attaching quality is a detraction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super simple, look great","review":"I purchased these because I had no luck with the self adhering versions. I second those that don't know why there are not more of the nail in felt type available. Reading the reviews I was worried they might be flimsy and hard to hammer in straight. I was delighted when I started using them and how quick and easy they applied. Those that say the sharp edge bent in must not be able to use a hammer because they went right in and I did 24 of them in 10 minutes. I hammered them in wood and some in plastic and worked great on both surfaces. A+PS.

It is an amazing look at how important it is in the life of a Christian to totally and completely trust in the God of the universe for all that we need. And as Manning explains the utter, dire need for this type of ruthless trust, he also shows, in the way that only Manning can, that even though this type of trust is absolutely essential in the Christian walk, it is also not something we can do on our own - even in this we must fully depend on our Creator God to give us the trust with which to trust him.

It's been done before and it's been done a lot better. What doesn't improve on this release are the lyrics and vocals. Gradeschool level lyrics are sung in an awkward, constipated tone which have an almost 'Weird Al' tone to them. The guest female vocals that appear are equally amateurish.

In the 16th Century, Elizabeth I of England had a man called John Dee as advisor. John Dee found and translated the Necronomicon into English from it's Latin and Arabic original form. The book was kept in the British Natural History Museum until recently. Now, if the book is fictitious and made up by Lovecraft, how is it possible that Dee translated it over 300 years before Lovecraft was born? Also, the infamous Yog does not exist in the Necronomicon in any shape or form. The novel with it's three stories was rumoured by Lovecraft to have been based on nightmares he had after reading John Dee's translation.So to anyone who doesn't believe in either John Dee or the book he translated, search for him. He was into scrying and magic. So if the Necronomicon is complete fiction, how did Dee translate it all those centuries ago?I thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Living in Infamy","review":"Would anyone who has actually \\"used the book to its fullest extent\\" be living in Milwaukee?

However, the book is enjoyable and one is left wondering about the complexity of the heroine who we gradually get to know as the novel proceeds by looking deep into her past.

It implies that we will be receiving quality horror films of the featured actors. These movies aren't even the \\"B\\" movies that were shown at the drive-ins. The sound quality is not that great, muddy most of the time. The acting in some of these movies seems forced, almost to the point of over-acting. These movies are more of drama than horror. If you are looking for a collection with Frankenstein, Dracula, the Mummy, this collection is not for you. If you like movies of the quality of The Brain that Wouldn't Die, The Killer Shrews, The Hand, the movies on this collection are so much less that that.I'm truly disappointed in this collection.

As soon as it was hooked up, it blew air non-stop regardless of whether the trigger was being pulled or not. On top of that, when the trigger was pulled, nothing would be sprayed.

Also, my brother in law has a 50 inch Panasonic 1080P plasma and the picture on my plasma 720 Samsung is significantly better. The delivery service was excellent.

Turns out that Samsung settled a class action laws suit regarding this same issue in many of their televisions. They cut corners when manufacturing and installed capacitors that weren't of high enough voltage to last more than a couple of years. Of course, my model isn't included in the settlement. I'm on hold with them right now, but I have a feeling our options are to repair it on our own dime (which could be a few hundred dollars) or replace it completely. I will NEVER buy another Samsung product again. I would not recommend this product or company to anyone.

I was told they could send out a repair technician, but I would be paying for the call and any repair since my unit is out of warranty and NOT part of the Class Action lawsuit. Mine is this plasma model. (HPT4254) I find it very sad that the company knows about this defective part (used in many of their products) and refuses to support all of their customers. I will not buy Samsung again. I do not recommend anyone spend money on a unit that will likely only last 5 years. I am very disappointed and dissatisfied.

Unfortunately, I didnt buy the extended warranty. The charges towards fixing this issue seems to be around 40% of TV cost. I called up Samsung also if they can help with my problem. They told the same story what Best Buy told me, that fix up an appointment with technical engineer and I need to bear the whole cost, as I am out of Warranty.

The subject matter is still about getting high, shooting people, so don't expect anything else which I didn't when I heard this album. Usually I prefer rap cds such as cunninlynguists, sage francis, outkast[old stuff], music about things other than smoking weed and capping people but there's something about bone thugs that keeps me listening no matter how tired the subject matter is.Anyways, as I said, take the album for what it is.

It is also very simple to use -- didn't even look at the manual. You won't need to either. Left button turns it on/off and sets the tare, and the right one switches from grams to ounces. Soooo easy! I guess I didn't pay much attention to the item description, as I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was battery operated (batteries included!). No need for an outlet. It really does not take up much room because it is pretty flat and lightweight.

But the scale doesn't care what it weighs so I guess it makes no difference. The thing is easy to use, with a large platter to put whatever you're weighing on. As far as I can tell it's dead-on accurate. It starts quickly and shuts down quickly so if you're weighing a bunch of stuff you can save on battery life. The only quibble I have is that if an item is large and tends to flop over the platter it can be hard to read the numbers. For most folks this shouldn't be a problem. Also it seems to be fairly durable (I've taken it with me to camping stores) and wasn't very expensive. It weighs up to slightly over 10 lbs so the range is convenient. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate for smaller items","review":"If you are looking for a scale with pinpoint accuracy, this is not the scale for you. When doing the nickel test ( each should be 5 grams) the scale seems to weight the nickels anywhere from 4-6 gr. I tried several experiments with 5 nickels. Where they are placed the on the scale will make a difference in the numbers. Stacking or laying them flat also makes a difference. Even when not touching the nickels, sometimes the numbers would just jump around with a 10-15% variance. I then tried weighing items that had a bit more heft.

Seem very accurate, the tare function works flawlessly allowing me to add ingredients by its weight. Being able to read Grams, Ounces and Lbs/Ounces is a good plus (the Soehnle did only grams & Lbs/Oz). Another plus is the fact that uses AA batteries, the Soehnle used button batteries that were somewhat difficult to source.The only \\"complaint\\" I have (if you can call it that) is that is is mostly built of plastic.

I also found it helpful when it came to thawing frozen foods in the microwave. With a more accurate reading it allows me to set the thaw time closer to the actual weight so that the food is not spoiled by over thawing or under thawing.

It's a little melted on the bottom from laying it where I ought not, but still works fine.If you're serious about your kitchen gadets, though... this one could be improved by an extending readout and a larger, stainless steel weighing platform."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"Small, precise, DIET FRIENDLY, gets the job done! I love the fact that even though there is a \\"tare\\" feature, if you turn the scale on with the bowl/ingredient holder already on the the scale, it automatically goes to 0 and you just add whatever you have to add to the plate/bowl. It doesn't take up a lot of room at all either. Although I use it for mainly measuring meat, pasta, and other little things that I have a hard time figuring out proportions for, I'd definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful Purchase","review":"I bought the scale for a recipe I wanted to try.

It's a great scale, and effortless. It cleans easily and converts to grams as well as pounds, ounces. (This is especially helpful to someone as math-challenged as I am.) I higly recommend this scale to someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money and doesn't want any hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"ease of operation","review":"I buy quite a bit of food in bulk. This scale with its tare function is very useful,as I use many different containers and I do not have weigh and mark them seperately as I did before I got this scale.

Even the kids are using it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works great, just very small","review":"This scale works really well and seems accurate, but the problem I have with it is that is so tiny. You can only weigh small amounts because you cannot fit much on this scale. What I end up doing when I have to weigh large amounts is fitting as much as I can on the scale, then writing down how many oz, and continue doing so until all of it is gone. This gets to be a little bit annoying. A feature that they could have made to make this easier would be if there was an \\"add\\" button, so that you wouldn't have to write down anything, and the scale would total it. So if you are not weighing a lot of food, this scale is nice. I plan to get another larger one though, as I am always weighing large amounts of food."},{"rating":"2","title":"This scale was sent to me by a major university conducting a scientific study.","review":"I didn't buy this scale. It was sent to me by a major university conducting a scientific study of dietary habits and they wanted gram weights of everything I eat. When I questioned them about why they chose this particular instrument they noted the tare weight function. I LOVE it! I have a much higher priced scale that is not nearly as versatile or user friendly. Since I am a single person and frequently reduce recipes by weight, it is very handy.Thank you, Harvard!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally everyone agrees..","review":"No sense writing a long review here. Read the other's and see this is a great product. Yea it only registers one gram increments but if you knew a dollar bill weighed one gram (and one half of that weighed 1/2 gram) you would be all set. The nickel idea works too and so does a dime. A great scale for a great price. Small and compact with all the features. Fast shipping as always (even free sometimes), good price and it works very well. Thanks again Amazon~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Accuarate, attractive and inexpensive","review":"The Escali Primo scale is not a well known kitchen name, but its looks, ease of use and performance makes it the perfect scale to use everyday. It is lightweight, accurate and intuitive to use. The only drawback is that larger bottomed bowls can make reading it difficult but this was the only knock against it. It has worked well for all of my baking/measurement needs. Battery operated means it can work in any part of the kitchen regardless of electrical outlet locations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst scale I have ever used","review":"I go to a very prestigious culinary school where a digital scale is a must in the bakery. After having the scale for less than a month, it read OUT2 on it. I tried to change the batteries but nothing changed. I called the manufacture of this scale and they said it was mistreated, held too much weight, or got in contact with water. Hello, it's a kitchen scale. I am a professional, and when they said I misused it, I was very insulted.

To me it's useless. It doesn't work properly around any electronic device. I often talk on my cell phone while I'm weighing out my food and it's useless because the number is jumping all over the place. I can't get a steady number when it's near my cell phone. I complained to the company and they said that their fine print points out that it's not accurate around electronic devices. Yeah, as though I was able to read the fine print before I ordered it. I am now using \\"The Biggest Loser\\" scale which I love and is completely accurate around electronic devices. My escali sits in the cabinet unused and I'm sorry I wasted my money on it. I liked the look and color, that's why I bought it. But I must have an accurate scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sure it's functional, but...","review":"I'm sure it's functional, but it looks rather ugly. Needing a kitchen scale, I made a quick and un-researched buying decision based on the strength of the reviews for this product. In particular, one of the first reviews I read was \\"the scales are very attractive,\\" and so I hit buy without a second thought.Upon receipt though, my take is that it's not terrible but it does look rather like something you'd pick up in Chinatown. Cheap plastic, cheap \\"chrome\\" paint, a flimsy feel and a proportionally small measuring surface. I've decided to return it for something a little prettier and a little more expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing in the Long Term","review":"I used this scale several times a week for six months, stored it flat in a cabinet with nothing pressing against it, and always operated it on flat, dry surfaces. I took it out of the cupboard today and it wouldn't work. I replaced the batteries. Nothing. Tried a different set of batteries, still no power. I'm so disappointed.

I don't use it much, about once or twice a week to weigh out 3 - 4 g of tea, once every couple of months to weigh flour for a loaf of bread. It worked fine until today. Today, the display began to show strange things - couldn't get it to tare, couldn't get it to change from g to oz. I put in new batteries, and the problems continue.

They do! I ordered these digital scales because my latest breadmaker said weighing flour was more accurate than using cups. I never knew about the tare feature of scales (with punch of button goes to zero with container on it, then add ingredient). I love it! It does work great for the flour for the breadmaker but I use it for lots of other things. When I have an amount to share with my husband, I just weigh it, then take out one third of it for me. When I have a bag of frozen strawberries and want to use half if it, easy! I even weigh spaghetti because I know how many grams is right for the two of us. Sometime I'll even weigh the cooked spaghetti to divide it correctly. Switching between grams and pounds/ounces is easy. I got the red one and it's just perfect with my chili pepper themed kitchen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I love this Escali digital scale.

This is a fantastic scale for the money. Be warned, though, that it's not great on tiny increments.

For baking, postage and other standard uses, though, it's perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate!","review":"All the other reviews were so good that I bought one for myself and for a friend. The accuracy varies. I used certified weights and found that the scale produced variances of 10-15%. In fact, it doesn't weigh the same item the same weight twice in a row! A friends scale had the same problem. I threw it away (a waste) and bought another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Door to battery compartment keeps breaking!","review":"I've tried two scales with the same problem each time--the little tab on the door to the battery compartment breaks off, preventing you from opening the compartment and inserting the batteries. At first I thought it was a disposable plastic part, it broke off so easily. I was sure to let the second one warm up inside a good long time, thinking it might simply have been too cold from a morning in the UPS truck, but the same thing happened again.This might be a fine little scale, but you have to be able to get the batteries in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic - more than I'd imagined","review":"This product is incredible.

Thanks Escali!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after about a year of occasional use","review":"I owned it for about a year using it about once a month and when I most recently pulled it out of the cupboard to use it, all that would show on the display was \\"out2\\". Changing the batteries had no effect. I don't recall abusing it with water or too much weight, and certainly, it was working when I last used it."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken after ~1 month","review":"This scale seemed great, and at a great price. I used it modestly for a little more than one month, and now it reads \\"out2\\" and doesn't work. The Escali website says, \\"Out2 is displayed when too much force (i.e. overload) has affected, and potentially damaged the loadcell\\". No elephants in my kitchen... the last time I used it was while making a normal sized batch of bread - I was weighing out the loaves prior to proofing. I turned it off, wiped it clean (no excessive use of water) and put it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted one year","review":"After about 3 months the flimsy battery door cover broke.

Price is better than can be found locally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serviceable Kitchen Scale","review":"This product is simple to use, has a small (but sturdy) footprint, and is easy to clean when needed. While it measures in single-gram increments, you probably wouldn't want to use it to measure anything weighing down in the single digits (for that, you'd want to get one of their models that weighs in 0.1 g increments), but for typical kitchen measurements, its accuracy and precision far exceeds what anyone could expect to need. Very useful, and I intend to buy any future digital scales I may need from Escali in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"I've owned one for over half a year and it's so great and convenient that i am getting another one. It's compact, light, looks good, and accurate. I measure all my food cause I count calories so I am getting another one to take to work. I can't think of anything to criticize, except maybe i have to hold down the power button pretty hard to shut the unit off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent scale","review":"I purchased this scale after reading the reviews and despite the negative posts about a weak battery compartment cover. I found the cover to be more than adequate. Perhaps it's be re-engineered since those posts but frankly you'd have to try and break the cover. The scale does an excellent job doing what I bought it for, weighing food. Absolute accuracy, if this is a problem, is not required when you are weighing out 3 oz of chicken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality & Easy to Use!","review":"I was so very pleased with the way this scale worked, I ordered a second one! My first one still works, I had left it behind on a visit to my daughters and had no doubt that this is the model I would purchase again. It is easy to use, accurate and uses Double A batteries. A bonus that it comes in so many colors too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, accurate, and stylish","review":"I've had mine for three years and I have never changed the batteries! Of course it doesn't need to be turned on for very long, but I still think that's pretty good. It does have an automatic turn-off feature in case you're like me and forget to turn it off most of the time. I love how I can switch from pounds to ounces and grams while I am weighing something, and the tare feature is very convenient to add different ingredients to a bowl and weigh as you go. The Tarragon Green is a gorgeous color!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Food Scale, Essential Kitchen Item","review":"This food scale is perfect. I've had it for two years and use it constantly. It's reliable (I still haven't even had to change the batteries once) and durable (it lives in the cupboard with the pots and pans, so it sometimes takes a bit of a beating, but without any issues), and it even happens to be well designed. I use it constantly and can hardly imagine my kitchen -- in particular, my baking -- without it. Most highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely and easy to use","review":"This product is an easy to use and accurate scale.

Nice addition to our kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great scale! Owned over a year so far!","review":"I bought this scale over a year ago and it is still working great (and on original batteries, too). I use it to weigh food for my pets, to weigh out 100 calorie snacks for myself, to weigh my mail so I'm not over, and to weigh my smaller pets (pet rats and a snake). If you're looking for pinpoint accuracy, you'll probably have to shell out more money for a superior scale. But for measuring things in the kitchen and around the house, it is really accurate (within 1 g). It doesn't take up a lot of space, the platform is raised so you can weigh larger items without hitting the buttons, and is easy to use. It comes with a manual but I never needed it-- it's pretty self-explanatory.Someone mentioned the battery cover falls off-- I did not have this happen to me, and if it did, a piece of duct tape would fix it and you'd never know because it's on the bottom of the unit. I would recommend this to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"dies after awhile","review":"UPDATED 11/25/12: I would no longer recommend this scale to anyone. I bought one for myself and parents and both of ours have died/stopped working. It's not a battery issue it's the actual unit. Disappointed.BOUGHT in 2009: I have been meaning to buy a digital scale for at home for the longest time. I'm in the food industry, and am use to the big nice scales and balance scale. So I have been debating on which one to get, with all the great reviews I figured this one would not disappoint. I enjoy the different color selection too. Works great, it's pretty small, but big enough to set a bowl on and be able to see the #'s, which I know some have issues with. Love the grams, ounces, or # and ounces option. Happy it goes up to 11#'s wish they had one just like it that would go up to 20, but it does the trick for my baking. Overall great product and I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice small scale for at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"This product is great.

It is \\"dead\\" accurate. I tested it with the weights from a balance postage scale and it was accurate to a tenth of an ounce. The \\"tare\\" feature works great and is very handy. All you do is put your empty container on the scale, then you can take it off and fill it multiple times and it deducts the weight of the empty container. It also weighs in grams. It comes with 2 \\"Energizer\\" batteries and has a 5-year warranty. It is also very easy to read, and can weigh items up to 11 pounds. I am totally satisfied with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chrome doesn't equal metal","review":"I was disapointed that when this product arrived, I thought it would be a metal scale, instead, chrome meant the color of the scale, not the material it is made out of it.

It's incredibly accurate and sensitive to small, incremental changes, like sprinkling flour into a bowl. It has a manual shutoff and an auto shutoff after several minutes of non-use, and I've never had it shut off in the middle of weighing ingredients, like my last scale.If a huge bowl obscures the readout, I put something underneath the bowl to raise it out of the way. The tare feature makes this easy. A forward facing readout would eliminate this problem, but the unit would have to be thicker. I like that it's very compact, lightweight and easy to store.

I've purchased other scales, but either the weight bounced around when adding food, or the switch from grams to ounces was inconveniently located under the scale.With this scale, the scale stays in the last unit of measure you used, and the switch is right in the front. It zeros out easily, and the weight is very consistent. Very easy to clean and durable. Look no further!Also, love the color!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!!","review":"This is the third food scale I've owned, and it is by far the best, even comparing against a scale twice as expensive. It's digital, which makes for easy read out and registers the weight in decimals rather than fractions. I got tired of calculating what 3/8s of an ounce was equal to! The scale accurately zeros out when you put your own plate or bowl on it. It's intuitive to use and accurate. And inexpensive. I'm really pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bread or soap scale!","review":"This scale is a great basic scale! No rotten lithium batteries. No 9 volt batteries.

Unfortunately, I can't add to the long list of rave reviews.I received the product, put in the included batteries and then neither of the two buttons would work. I couldn't get the 'tare' function to work and then I couldn't get the 'off' button to work. It did however eventually turn off on its own. In addition, after a few minutes, the scale started reading a couple of ounces even with nothing on the scale. The scale was on the counter top (flat obviously) and was not near any other electronics.I assumed my problems were a fluke; I processed a return and Amazon had a replacement scale on my door step in two days (Amazon worked perfectly during the return process). I had similar, but not exactly the same issues with the second scale; I returned it as well.Oh well, I guess I'll try another product now."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for dieters","review":"This little scale is wonderful.

You finally realize just how much you've been over eating when you start to weigh everything"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not consistently accurate","review":"When using gram measurements I could lift an item off the scale and put it back down and come up with a different weight. Using the tare function often gave me a weight off by a gram or two.If you are measuring yeast for example, the difference between 2 or 3 grams is a lot, percentage wise and baking wise.Sending it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"handy little scale","review":"purchased a few of these for my employees . have had no issues to date . lightweight & accurate easy to use would look good on the kitchen counter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good scale, good price.","review":"While it may not be the top of the line, this sclae will get the job done for most, if not all, home bakers. If you're super serious abotu weight, buy something in $60-100 range. For the rest of us, there's this easy to use, accurate, Escali!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for measuring portions","review":"I bought this scale in order to help keep track of food portion sizes.It's simple, easy to use, and the tare function is great.Does the job nicely. Plus I love the colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last","review":"This scale worked very well for 6 months. Then it developed a problem that rendered it unusable. When the scale is powered on it never settles at zero. Initially the display started to fluctuate from +/-2g. Eventually the scale's display would simply start increasing up as high as 30g. Cycling through the units, taring, and changing batteries do not correct this behavior. The unit is stored upright in a clean drawer with no weight resting on it. I am not sure if anything can remedy this issue. The scale can not be recalibrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very decent scale","review":"After searching for a cheap sub $50 scale, I finally settled on this from suggestions from other coffee friends for a decent scale. The scale itself is awesome, I've had no problems, it seems to be quite accurate and the TARE function works well as does the auto turn off. Best of all, the auto turn off isn't too quick, giving me enough time to make my coffee pour overs.For coffee fans, this is a decent entry level scale. I will add a few negatives is that it is all plastic, so it feels a bit flimsy. I'd suggest for this price range maybe to find a metal one, but for at home use it works great. As a travel scale it would work awesome too because its so light. Overall, good product for coffee makers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally found a scale that works!!!","review":"So I have been looking for a good kitchen scale. I tried analog as well as digital. Nothing worked or it was too big. Then I found this one (that god for Amazon!) and it not only works but it is lightweight.I have used it to weight chick peas, beans, flour and sugar (particularly for british recipes). I love the tare feature. I can put a sauce pan right on it and it works!I highly recommend this scale for any serious baker or cook!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Used for baking","review":"Great item for the price. Compared accuracy to an industry scale at work, is extremely accurate. I have used it allot for baking for the past year or so, and never had to change the battery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent little scale","review":"This scale is easy to store, use, and clean. It's accurate and not unattractive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternative uses","review":"I use the scale to measure out epoxy resins. Since the ratio has to be perfect weighing the epoxy mix is the ideal way to get a perfect mix. It also saves the expensive epoxy because I only make the exact amount I need. I use a second one in my kitchen for the more traditional uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Escali Primo Digital Scale","review":"Although it is used infrequently, I found this scale to be very accurate and easy to use. It is a good value. Like other comments, the display is difficult to see if a large plate is used to hold the item to be weighed...using a bowl solves this problem.The \\"Tare\\" feature (used to null out the bowl etc. that holds the item to be weighed) is easy to use.I would recommend this digital scale to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have for every kitchen","review":"Its a prefect tool for anyone who loves baking. Gives the exact weight and the best feature is the fact that you can use your own bowl and negate the weight of your bowl using the TARE feature, and voila have the perfect weight for your recipe without any mess at all....PERFECT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Escali Primo Digital Multifunctional Scale, Chrome","review":"This scale is sooo great! It is not only accurate and soo easy to use, it is slim so that it fits into a kitchen utencil drawer. Highly Reccommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A mistake.","review":"Sadly, this item had to be returned. For whatever the reason it took too long for the scale to turn off. I found this frustrating and besides, it wasted the batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light weight and easy to use","review":"I enjoy this scale. It is small and light weight and easy to use. I have used it for portion control and I have yet to be let down. There is not much to say about this scale other than it won't let you down."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE scale","review":"I bought this scale after reading all the great reviews on Amazon but unfortunately, it did not work for me. It was too flimsy and light-weight (I'm used to using scientific scales which are much heavier) and it did not tare correctly (the display was stuck on something illegible) within the first 2 times I used it. I returned the scale and will buy something sturdier.Save yourself the trouble and don't get this scale."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"This worked just like i needed it to. I wanted a scale to help me weigh out my food, and this works perfect!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"This scale is easy to use and has a pretty fast refresh rate so you have fairly good control over what you're measuring. The only strange thing I found trying to buy it on Amazon was the range of prices for the same exact color and the price range for all of the scales that are exactly the same model, but different colors. I'd recommend searching Amazon thoroughly for the best price before putting one in your cart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digital Scale easy to use","review":"This scale was very easy to use right out of the package. The display is very easy to read although if you have a larger item the display is easly blocked because it sits flat and not tilted on an angle like some other models. Iuse it all the time mainly for portion control and love it."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],C={key:0},N={key:1};function O(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",C,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(M,[["render",O],["__scopeId","data-v-2046e9cf"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/40.md","filePath":"guide/40.md"}'),j={name:"guide/40.md"},G=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{R as __pageData,G as default};
