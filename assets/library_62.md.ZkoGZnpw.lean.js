Compounded sales from the Complete Set for those who waited AND sales of Season 4 for those who supported all along. Win/Win? Instead they decide to create a situation where not only will they lose sales of the Complete Set because those of us who bought 1, 2 and 3 will not buy it, but they will lose future sales of the stand-alone Seasons 1, 2 and 3 if a Season 4 never sees the light of day.

Buying it one season at a time is easier on my budget anyway.Be sure to leave good reviews for the individual seasons so people know it's not the show itself that you have a problem with, but this specific boxed set.

The episodes are good quality, the DVD menus are easy to navigate, the bonus features are as good as one might expect for such an old series. Overall, this DVD set made it possible for me to share my childhood love of Fraggle Rock with my daughter--I purchased it when she was 2, she's now almost 5.

Now HIT is taking my support and trying to get me to buy 3 more full sets of Seasons 1-3 to get the 4th season. I have never bought bootlegs before because I believe in supporting the company, but this has changed my mind. Likewise I will never buy another single season set of any HIT product as they are likely to do the same thing with other series.

Its corporate greed and its not fair for those fans who have remained so loyal over the years. I can't help but think that if Jim Henson were still alive, that he would be disgusted with such actions. I agree with others before me who said, that they wont buy this box set, unless they get 100 dollars off, for turning in the 3 previous seasons with their purchase.This is a Horrible thing for HIT to do.

The unavailable fourth installment standalone DVD is a mockery of the creator Jim Henson, and I for one will not insult his memory by buying such an effigy of outright greed.My review will remain at less than 1 star until a suitable standalone version of Season 4 is released on DVD to match the previously released three standalone Season DVD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Bunch of Muppets","review":"They must be a complete bunch of Muppets if they think people who have already forked out for the first three series will buy the complete set just to get series 4.

Does anyone know if they simple combined the 4th and 5th seasons onto the same final boxed set labeled the 4th season because of the reduced amount of episodes in each?

When I got to the binder 50% of the discs were loose, every page had the 2nd disc out of its pocket. Design overall for this set is just terrible.Bonus material is pretty much non-existent, I have to hold on to my other sets just to keep the cool stuff that came with it.If given the choice, though HIT didn't ask me nor anyone else, I would have followed in the footsteps of the Speed Racer DVD's - finish individual sets first with cool extra stuff for the hard core collector THEN the complete set with the not so cool extra stuff for the mediocre collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll buy it when I get a $100 discount for turning in the first 3 seasons that I previously purchased.","review":"Fraggle Rock is an amazing series.

It's still a slap in the face to everyone who bought the first three seasons, but it makes a certain amount of marketing sense. To not release the final seasons for individual sale *at all* is pure highway robbery, and a clear indication that HIT Entertainment believes Muppet fans are so stupid they'll cough up $140 for anything with the Jim Henson logo (even if it's something they already own)There's no way I'm buying this boxed set when it comes out, which breaks my heart, since I missed the last two seasons of Fraggle Rock during their original transmission, so these episodes are brand new to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember the old days","review":"This is realy great!

His language ranges from the mystical to the perfectly frank whether set in the convoluted world of man or in the sacred space of his garden. He reaches inward and outward, he digs, he towers then reclines. He Shines!Mr. Stern is richly deserving of all of the rewards he has received and so much more. A great American voice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sssweeeeeeeeet Sister Funk!!","review":"This is the last on my list of Groove Merchant re-issues to get and it is now my favorite (save the best for last- who knew?) This album reminds me of Donald Byrd's \\"Ethiopian Knight's\\" because it has the perfect blend of jazz & funk. The real goodies are: \\"First Come, First Serve\\", \\"Sweet Sister Funk\\", \\"Sweat\\" and \\"Lord Sideways\\". The import price is up there, but if you are into jazz/funk or soul-jazz from 1967-1974 then I would say this is not only essential, but a great rare find. Grab it while you can!!

When a friend suggested I watch this DVD, I didn't know what to expect.The documentary is pretty impressive. I learned quite a lot about the man and the motivation behind his work, and gained an appreciation for what he set out to do.Dali fans will be enlightened, and those not familiar with his work should develop a strong curiosity to see and learn more of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discovering Dali!","review":"If you are interested in the man behind the Surrealist Art--you need to watch this DVD. I didn't know much about the man, his art, his passion and his life. This documentary gave a glimpse of Salvador Dali by using rare footage from interviews which explored Dali's personality and extreme passion for his art. He loved science, psychology, research and dreams.I enjoyed learning about melting cheese and his soft watches. The experts on the documentary were very good. And the production quality of the video was great. Good audio, rare footage, great narration and experts who teach about Dali or who write about him.A great gift for someone interested in Dali--highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The only problem I had was that it does not come with a light.

The little cover to feed your fish is very tiny you have to remove the whole lid every time you want to change something in the tank. The little plastic piece that covers the light bulbs sucks. The lights died after a month cause of the water splashing up. I tried putting in new bulbs and waiting for it to dry first it still doesn't work. The plastic on the back is really hard to remove when you have to put the filer and all your other stuff in. I feel like if i were to get a lid in which the lighting systems sucks why wouldn't i just pay for the nice glass canopy instead of this cheap plastic one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"I ordered this hood for my basic 5 gallon tank.

I use it once a week and i notice a big difference in my hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real soap","review":"Sad but true, in the US you can sell detergent as soap. Why is that important? Soap is gentle on your skin and detergent strips the oils and can lead to nasty skin irritations. Most of the bath soaps sold at your local stores are detergents. I learned this when I developed skin problems.This is a true soap made with only Olive Oil. It smells a little funny, but I never smell funny after using it. It cleans gently and leaves a thin film of oil on your skin. No more break outs, no more creams from the doctor. And best of all no more of that tight dry skin all winter long.You must keep this soap in a soap dish that drains or it will melt away. But if you want fabulous skin this is the way to go. My friend with psoriasis started using this and found it greatly reduced her suffering. It is wonderful stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"mild and nourishing","review":"Kiss my face soap has been the answer to my sensitive, ichy, ashy skin solution. Its extremely mild, does not strip nor excessively foam, and its got a very faint fragrance which is good for those with perfume allergies. The olive oil bar soap paired with the olive oil and aloe moisturizer have stayed in my bathroom for years. I never have itchy scaly skin anymore, and have actually received compliments on how soft my skin has become. Kiss my face has a whole line of wonderful products but I would definately suggest this soap (also great for facial washing, and sensitive areas) for anyone with extreme skin sensitivities along with the moisturizer, and gentle detergents and paper products.

As long as you can find a blank FM station, the sound fidelity is just fine for in the car.

The illuminated numbers blend in with the background numbers, making it difficult to set the unit, especially while driving."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Sound Yet","review":"An FM transmitters is needed for use in cars that lack iPod connector, such as many rental cars. Most transmitters I have tried are very disappointing, the sound is either noisy or distorted. However, this unit has excellent sound with my Nano in a variety of vehicles. It is sometimes necessary to move the (fairly long) cord to a position that gives maximum signal, but this is easy to do, and not too critical. The manual tuning is very easy, and the programmable presets are useful for different areas, depending on the radio environment. I simply set a memory button on the radio to the memorized preset frequency.This is the transmitter that I recommend to my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be aware this does not fit in utility outlet","review":"I had high hopes for this product when I ordered it.

So I got another one of these to inable my ipod to keep my musically satisifed. Was it ever the best thing. Not once did I hear static or hissinf (I do in NJ) the music was clear as a bell. Even in Minneapolis with its many stations I found an empty channel let my ipod provide its musical splender. My son got an iTouch and it was seamless he unconnected my classic and attached the iTouch and off we went to what he considers music.Great product and the 4 stars is because back home in NJ there is static and hissing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the FM transmitters for your iPod","review":"I have tried two other FM transmitters for my iPod, and this one has proven to work the best. It includes enough frequencies that you shouldn't have any problem finding a clear channel (the lower 80's channels are poor in my area because of all the talk stations, but the high end of the dial works quite well).The only thing I don't like about this transmitter is that it is nearly impossible to see when it is plugged in. The angle of the LCD is good if you're standing on your head since it is about even with the top of your seat. Also, the orange back-lighting makes reading the numbers on the display quite difficult.If I were making one of these, I would tilt the display so it faces up, and I would use either LEDs or an LCD display where the numbers light up instead of back-lighting.I'm still giving this unit 4 stars because the sound quality is really what it is all about, and it does well in that area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This 2-in-1 device is brilliant.

I'll buy Kensington again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product...","review":"Bought this to go along with my new iPod. Very easy set-up, basically plug it in and go! I found three FM frequencies that worked and set them as my presets. I have an hour commute to work; had to swith frequencies once when I got a little static, but that's it.Nice clear sound through the car stereo. Volume is slightly lower than if I was listening to a CD, but the same thing occurs when I listen to the Sirius radio I have mounted in the car. Only drawback is the display is hard to see, but if you set your presets in the same order as your radio then you're fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the Money","review":"This little transmitter has worked well with my 30G IPOD. I found a station on the FM channel that works, and it stayed good for a 3-hour trip I often make. I haven't taken it farther than that. The sound and clarity are excellent. The only complaint I have is that you can barely read the numbers on the display. They all look the same and so you can't tell if you have the same station as your radio indicates or not. It's also difficult to tell if you've saved it correctly. I found the station on my car's radio and saved it; then I kept pushing the up button on the transmitter until the static stopped. That did it. Maybe luck. But the bottom line is: it works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good but not perfect","review":"I used this on a long trip to Canada and it worked flawlessly. I do have to turn the volume up much louder than when I listen to the radio though. However, in cities (Portland, Oregon, North San Francisco Bay Area) I have lost the good frequencies in just short drives and had to find a new one. I have more than one car and the cigarette lighters are located in different places. This unit has a cable so the iPod can be pretty much anywhere. The kind that doesn't have a cable wouldn't have worked in all the cars. Since I don't have a cassette player and the type of stereo system wouldn't accommodate a hard wired connection, this is the only way to go. Over all I am very satisfied. Now I see Kensington has a new device called the QuickSeek that will find the strongest station for you. I think I would get that one instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"not compatible","review":"Just as a heads up-I drive a 97 Pontiac Grand Am and thought this would be the perfect solution for playing my ipod since I don't have a tape player. The problem: my cigarette lighter isn't compatible with the charger that comes with the transmitter, that might have been nice to know before I bought it. Does anyone drive a similar car and have a transmitter/charger that is adaptable?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Usefull Product!","review":"This product is very usefull. Of course in cities and some areas of the country where there is no signal you may struggle to find a station, but if your a sub-berb you are all good. You definately need this for a road trip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the $","review":"I had a inexpensive Belkin prior to buying this that wasn't worth the few dollars I paid for it. The Kensington has been a major improvement over that. I've used it in different parts of the country and as long as you are willing to occasionally find new FM stations it work's fine. Easy to use too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Product","review":"I had this up and running in a couple of minutes with no problem.I commute in a rural area and have very few issues with static. I've basically only run it on one station.The main area for improvement is the display with is difficult to read. If I were having to search for clear stations, I would find this frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple to use, works as advertised","review":"I was looking for a way to run my iPod through the FM radio on a bareboat charter catamaran. The Kensington unit's operation was intuitively obvious and the audio quality better than expected. A small percentage of tracks on my iPod apparently have overly high levels that resulted in audible distortion (what electric guitar players would call \\"overdrive\\"), but for the most part the audio was fine. In the noisier RF environment back here in DC, the Kensington delivers noticeable hiss, but to be fair I haven't spent a lot of time trying different channel combinations yet. Not as good as a direct connection, but better than being stuck with the local FM radio offerings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine for a charger","review":"I live in a big city (DFW) and the static on any channel is too great.

It's being used in a Ford Focus, and it works beautifully.

The sound quality is not crystal clear all the time, every once in a while I get a little static, but it is never bad static, and it never lasts long.One of the greatest features for me is the iPod charger plug, because I never have to worry about having a dead iPod, when I turn the car off it turns the iPod off and I don't have to fiddle with the iPod volume to make the sound quality good(changing the iPod volume does nothing).I would recommend this to anyone without a tape deck or aux input who has an iPod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient little product","review":"I bought this item for my husband for Father's Day this year. What prompted my purchase? Well, I bought him a really nice iPod for his birthday right before our big Europe trip - and really - since then - he doesn't get an opportunity to use his iPod. He doesn't travel for work, he doesn't go to the gym to workout, etc... Right when his gift arrived, he got it set up in his vehicle (very easy set-up). Worked like a charm from the start. He said some of the music doesn't come through quite as clearly as he'd like - but having experienced it myself - I haven't noticed any of that. We live in the Twin Cities, and haven't run into any interference w/ other radio stations.If you don't want to spend the money to hard-wire your iPod into your vehicle, I would definitely recommend this device. It's very reasonably priced, in my opinion, and really convenient. I like too that we can swap out his & my iPods - as we have different taste in music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best FM Modulator I've Used","review":"Best sound quality of any FM modulator I've used!

Unfortunately this just didn't work reliably for me and I encountered a number of issues:1. Transmission was static-ridden for much of the time and I would have to crank the volume to the max to hear it on the road.2. On uneven surfaces it would generate loud popping sounds which, given the volume I had to run the system at, weren't sounding healthy.3. Eventually, the system stopped transmitting on the right side at all. Switching back to the regular radio or CD still played through all speakers, so this is where the problem lay.Just returned for a refund. Maybe you'll have better luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works with limitations.","review":"For the most part this product works but it has some limitations. No matter how much searching you do be prepared to here some static noise while using this product on the road. You're safe for short trips but past 15 or 20 miles you will probably need to switch stations. I literally have a station for home, work and school. Make sure you memorize those stations and there position on the device because the lcd is practically impossible to read when connected to standard cigarette/ power socket. If you happen to still have a tape deck in your car use one of those cassette tape adapters that has a mini plug attached to it. If your car stereo has a mini plug or audio rca input that's even better. Otherwise this product is nothing more than acceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very good","review":"I live in a 70,000 people town. Works great, no interference.

Overall the sound is better than two of the other transmitters I have used before but it is still not as good as having a direct input from the iPod to the car stereo.

However, the cable began to work loose from the housing almost as soon as I got it, and I have now given it up as trash since my iPod as been freezing up when I try to use the transmitter.

But mind you, maleness does not refrain or reduces his popular sophisticated style. On the contrary, enhances it. That is how and why I am biased.

The second shipment arrived with one damaged box; we attempted to fit the canvas back onto one chair, and again...one inch too short! Although the product is not the highest quality material, the chairs would have probably been sturdy enough to actually use, and would have been perfect as extra kitchen island seating for guests at holiday time. Apparently, there is no process by which to measure a piece of cloth to specs!

Come on, this is the author referring to herself in the third person, and she doesn't spare the self-admiration. The tone is very off-putting, and sometimes hard to believe. Example: In the introduction, the author notes that her customers \\"snap up [the projects] faster than she can cut, decoupage and glue\\". Pipe cleaner arms with paper faces. Indeed.

I have tried many controllers that are similar to the PS2 design, but they all lacked decent button recoiling, easy to push buttons, and slimness.

No lag, comfortable feel, and the buttons are easy to use especially for a fast sports game like soccer. Obviously, if you've used the wired regular XBOX 360 controller you know this is the same thing with different packaging (and an install CD). I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does not work with Final Fantasy XI","review":"I bought this controller for the primary purpose of using it to play Final Fantasy XI on the PC. I play the Xbox 360 version and it once I started using the PC version, I decided I'd like to have standardized controllers. Makes perfect sense to me that it would just, I dunno, work. But it does not. First, the controller is not supported directly, so you have to reconfigure the game to use it. Fine, but even then it's just...not...right. It's sluggish and slow, you can't use the trigger buttons to access the macro menus, and essentially does not work. At least it's not worth my trouble. So if you're buying this controller for that game, skip it--until Square gets their act together or Microsoft does (frankly, I'm not sure who to blame here).

I bought a second one so I could play Madden '08 with friends.It works pretty well with driving games (unless you have enough $ to buy a G25, then that's probably the best option) and 3rd person shooters.

So it seems ideal, but it begs the question as to why, in this day and age, with PC technology advancing rapidly, I should need different controllers in the first place.I mean, why should joysticks, etc. be necessary, when PC, and console users, have access to such a capable and compatible controller?It works well, and it is easy to install, so it gets top marks.

In addtition, we got a nice conclusion to the first plot at the end of the book, while the second plot was left hanging on a cliff in a typical old movie serial style: \\"Tune in next week, to find out what happened.\\" Still, even the second plot was good, just not as good as the first.

No proof is cited...It's a frustrating read because it is impossible to tell if there really is any truth to what the author supposes. As a descendant of Nell Gwyn and Charles II, it's clear the author chooses to paint both parties and their relationship in the warmest light. He also denegrates Charles' relationships with other mistresses. All of these occur (again) without any proof.The author hardly has any endnotes and his bibliography comes primarily from books far after the actual time.Overall, it reads as historical fiction with an accurate timeline of events."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gst","review":"Muy bueno, el libro es sencillo y muy interesante!!!!

It got rid of the constant headaches I was experiencing (I guess something about drinking enough water, but not getting the electrolytes I needed) and it provides a great energy boost, which is especially helpful during times when you need to watch caffeine intake.

This is a perfect example about how bad marketing is presenting sublime human creations trying to turn it in a mass-market product for the average Joe. I was exposed to classical music at the age of 14 listening Bach's Branderbourgh concerts, then softly moving to Operas starting with Rossini 'Il Barbiere di Siviglia'. then the passion started growing more and more, aided by further readings around. On the top of all, I received a good background education at school aiding me to go better in depth to this to this. The knowledge process is harder that this kind of compilation make people suppose to be ...Sadly, the fact that classical music (and jazz) market share is below 4% is a further indication of the degradation of world wide listeners' audience ... maybe spent on school education some of the military budget could help"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, they got one thing right...","review":"Judging by the title, I figured I'd somewhat like this cd.

The soap has a light, pleasant scent -- not overpowering. It didn't leave a residue on my skin after rinsing. I also felt that the soap made my skin feel soft, not greasy at all. The size of the bar is great for the money but somewhat awkward in the tub or shower. It barely fits in my soap holder! I'd prefer the product in a smaller size bar, for example, two 4oz bars for the same price. My children, both girls, also liked the soap. I'd definitely recommend this to people with dry or sensitive skin -- I have both -- as long as they had a garden tub!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd rate this a six on a scale ...","review":"I'd rate this a six on a scale of one to five! I got this soap during a bad adult acne breakout. I started using it and noticed that my skin felt really clean after rinsing off the soap and wasn't all tight like usual. By the end of the week even my acne seemed to have cleared up. It seemed like it was cleaning better than my other soap but the proof came when I couldn't get some grease off my hands and I gave this soap a try. The grease came right off. I thought it would dry my skin but it's been great. It easily takes off my mascara so I don't have to use eye-makeup remover anymore.

Saying that, Stay Fly had me thinking the album was going to take the music to another level that only these dudes can reach, but it didnt quite do that. The beats are hot but they are 8 out of 10 except for a couple tracks. The hooks aren't as creative, and the concepts to the songs arent as fresh as past. There are no major differences in the songs like there was in previous albums. Add to that there is no Gangsta Boo (best female MC (Remy sucks)) or Lord Imfamous.

I never thought they would release a weak album, yet here it is: \\"The Most Known Uknown\\" (Choices II wasn't great either). First off the best rapper of the group, Lord Infamous, is gone with no explanation. They keep Crunchy Black who can barely rhyme, but Lord is the one who is gone...go figure. Also there are too many lame guest apperances, the HCP crew used to be able to carry an album. But now the posse has more weak rappers than usual(Crunchy Black, Boogie Mane and Chrome) none of which compare to T-Rock, Gangsta Boo, or MC Mack. Finally the production is about 1/2 of what DJ Paul and Juicy J are capable of, now it just sounds like any other southern fried MTV rap. If Three 6 keeps on this road, than this might be one of my final HCP purchases.

And the exposition anticipates Bogart's IN A LONELY PLACE by several years, except the wrong female gets murdered. Broderick Crawford provides an easy-going, endearing performance without a hint of his later lockjaw screen personality. And the supporting cast--especially the adult women--are fine.But this attempt to combine Sturges satire, screwball comedy, and \\"My Friend Irma\\" is done in by the irritating, obnoxious heroine of the piece who keeps popping up when one wishes she'd be shutting up. The Irma-esque caricature is utterly unfunny and, repeatedly identifying herself as nearly jail-bait age, her romance with the much older O'Brien is as irrational as it is disturbing. And what happens to Eve Arden is an unpleasant shock as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"good sound, okay performance","review":"I'm by no means an expert on classical music, and I'm not eventhe biggest fan of Beethoven (I find him usually too\\"gimicky\\"), nor do I like \\"greatest hits\\" sort of collections for classical music, but I was in the music store and could find none of my desired selections, so I was nosing around and saw this. What caught my eye at first was \\"Digital Surround Sound\\", and then the fact that it was two gold CDs at such a low price. An amazing deal. Again, I'm no expert on his music, but I know I've heard more inspired versions of many of the pieces here. They're good, don't get me wrong, and rather enjoyable, but the saving grace is the astounding sound quality. I have a surround sound system, and the sound field is very rich and dynamic. But then, maybe compared to some other brand of recordings this is flat and dull.

I thought it was crazy to have something like that in the video for a love song, but it really makes sense when you think about how she's saying the world is wrong (about the masked wrestler?).Since buying the CD, all the songs, especially \\"Tu Peor Error,\\" have really been growing on me. The other songs also add some great lyrics to think about such as the line in \\"Ahora Que Te Vas\\" where she says she will dream in black and white if he leaves or how he's left her no option but to tear off her skin and bear the pain in \\"Para No Decirte Adios.\\" I also really liked \\"Que Fui Para Ti\\" because it showcases Natalia's amazing voice so well.

Although this book is a little difficult to use (measurements, strange ingredients, lack of specific guidelines for daily feeding portions), it is quite charming. The writing style and the little pictures are worth the price of the book. Once I figure out exactly how much to feed my 95lb.

Is gentle on the skin too which is a definite plus for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this product line, just wish it had a bit stronger scent","review":"I like the way this body wash feels and it rinses very clean.

It lathers very nicely with just a small amount, so one bottle will last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This shower gel and foam bath is aptly ...","review":"This shower gel and foam bath is aptly named. I couldn't really work up a lather, it was more like a rich cream. But oh, how nice that cream was! It left my skin so soft, softer than any other soap product I've used. The foam bath was a little disappointing. I really couldn't get much of anything to bubble or foam, but it left my skin soft."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked the fragrance of this product. ...","review":"I really liked the fragrance of this product.

I could smell it through the box when I opened the front door -- and so could the mailman! So let's start there -- the scent. In one word, yuck. It's very strongly scented, and heavily perfumed. We use a lot of Kiss My Face products and I was shocked to find that this one was scented so heavily. I know that scent is a personal taste issue, but be aware that this is strong. As far as lather and such, I did wash my hands with it and found it gave a nice lather and clean rinse, which is typical of KMF products. However, I was unable to shower or bathe with it due to the scent. I will continue to buy KMF products, but not in the Peaceful Patchouli scent."},{"rating":"2","title":"I used Kiss My Face Natural Shower Gel ...","review":"I used Kiss My Face Natural Shower Gel & Foam Bath, Peaceful Patchouli as a shower gel in lieu of my regular liquid soap. It performed as well as many of the more commercial shower gels currently on the market. I must admit that the aroma was quite different, but actually quite pleasant and not too overpowering. The patchouli scent remained long after the shower. The name and the packaging were a bit strange and geared towards a specific audience, but the product itself performed quite well. I would purchase this product and would like to know if any additional scents are available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Several members of my family tried this product ...","review":"Several members of my family tried this product and we all independently came to the same verdict on the shower gel -- we didn't like the smell at all.

I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Money on This","review":"I used to like, Kiss My Face products and love a foamybath. Thhis bottle spurted out hardly any foam andthere is no oil in it I can find. I dont know if I justgot a bad bottle but as it is rather expensive I amsorry I wasted my money on it.

The fragrance was strong and almost a musty scent. It also seemed to stay with me for a long time afterwards. This would've been great had it been a pleasing scent. My teenage daughter also tried it and felt the same way. The gel itself worked well and left my skin smoother than bar soap. I myself would not purchase this product except in other fragrances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peaceful what?","review":"Although it says it is Peaceful Patchouli, the lack of patchouli scent leaves one less than peaceful. Also the product does not sud, of course this could be our water here, but there are bar soaps that are far better. If this was as good as their hand wash, which does have a stronger scent and it suds up better, this would be a more desireable product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiss My Face Natural Shower Gel & Foam ...","review":"Kiss My Face Natural Shower Gel & Foam Bath, Peaceful Patchouli came in a generous 16-oz bottle, as opposed to many other shower gels I've tried which have consistently been in 12-oz containers. I found the shower gel to lather remarkably well. Just a dime-sized drop lathered my whole body. Since the Patchouli scent is unisex, it was a refreshing change for my husband and 13-year-old son, who also liked it. I would recommend it to friends and family -- particularly those of the \\"\\"Woodstock\\"\\" or \\"\\"Peace and Love\\"\\" mindset, who might like the natural smell of the product instead of something that's perfumed or fruity-smelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"This had a strong scent when opened (probably ...","review":"This had a strong scent when opened (probably because of the concentration) but smelled very nice in use. This is a soothing, gentle product. Great results both in the shower and bath, and my family's sensitive skin loved it! My toddler took one sniff and jumped into the bath with me -- of course THEN we had to pull those wet clothes off. Another wonderful Kiss My Face product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"art photography","review":"So the premise of this cute little book is the overlapping or merged ground between art and erotica. By and large the photos are a success. the woman and settings photographed are truly beautiful, sometimes as art, sometimes as erotica, and usually as both. Some of the women have what is best described as an unusual beauty, as do some of the backdrops. There are a phenomenal number of models from the eastern block. One of the memorable backdrops is of an eastern european or russian forest which has been leveled for timber, leaving a sea of stumps... I can recommend this book as a very nice addition to either a photography book collection or a collection devoted to an appreciation of the female form."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Movement, or Flash in the Pan? DOMEI is for Dummies","review":"Reading the high-falutin' statements of its mission, one could get excited about DOMEI; But seeing this book, edited by one of its proponents, should flatten your hopes and make you suspicious of any photographer who eschews being identified as an\\"artist\\". The models in this cheesily-bound hardcover are, on the other hand, hardly \\"artless\\". Rather, they project (if naively -- being mostly teenagers) that they are ready to do things to you and for you, the gauping male, that will give you a good time. This volume is Playboy Liberated with a nuance of the Hustler type of personal desensitizing.The models have no relationship to the landscape, so one wishes they would be removed, allowing one to enjoy the wheat field and wooded glen uncompromised. Rather than fight for and achieve a place in simple nature, the nude here becomes a desecration."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a book!","review":"This book is small measuring approximatly 7.5 inches by 5.5 inches. The photos are all shot in an outdoor setting and are extremely well done. This displays the \\"DOMAI-style\\" simple nudes with a balance of tastefulness and artfulness. There is no hardcore material in this book.This is one of the best displays of nude photography that I have seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Figure artist dream","review":"Wow what a book, it's way to small, like 5\\"x7\\" or some such lill size but man is this packed with the best bunch of nudes I have ever seen.I like it for the A+ models, the natural outdoor light and the lack of a bunch of b.s. props. I want a 8'x10\\" version, though it would have to cost $100 bucks.I will get some of my models to check this book for ideas and even do some out door paintings with the look of this book.

I was sorely dissappointed by the lack of variety of women shown in this book. They all look the same! The woman on the cover is pretty much what every woman inside looks like, just with a variety of hair colors and styles.That said, the photography is well done and the book itself is nicely put together. Its quite thick, with only a minimal amount of writing to introduce it. Without the variety, however, I'm afraid this book isn't going to get much handling from me or my spouse, so all the pretty photos are essentially a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naked skinny white teenagers","review":"The \\"natural\\" beauty in this is the artificial current Western ideal - very young, skinny, white, usually with make-up, with natural hair shaved away, placed in the out-doors, acting only moderately seductive. Mid-way between Playboy and a nudist camp for teen girls.If that's your thing, you may love this book. If you're looking for something more, you should probably pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"38 of the most beautiful women outdoors","review":"I have always been a big fan of erotic photography and how the subject interacts with the surroundings to form dynamic compositions. I must also admit I love looking at the women, but I feel women are a work of art themselves. As a painter, images like the ones found in this book have inspired my own work when I construct the soft forms of the human body.The fact is that this book features photographs of 38 of the most beautiful white women I have ever seen placed in breathtaking locations by extremely talented photographers. Each girl looks as if she belongs in that location, all while innocently frolicking naked from page to page.If you want to know something about each girl or photographer, this book lacks in that aspect. It doesn't lack in photos. From a short introduction all the way to the index, there is nothing but full pages of nude women with nothing else in the way.I definitely recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nude Photography at it's best!","review":"I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of nude photography.

Unfortunately, there was too little of the latter.I was, however, pleasantly surprized to see tht there was little of an overtly soft-porn mode. It seems that too much of the new \\"nextdoor beauties\\" photography is just a thinly-veiled, soft-porn eroticism. Still, there was little that would be considered fine art. But, then again, as the author says, that's not the purpose of the book. Just nice pictures of pretty naked girls. It works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Narrow definition, but true beauty","review":"I really enjoy this collection, for all the reasons the editor want me to like it for. The models are young, charming, and unaffected. Their poses are [generally] natural and comfortable. Their figures vary somewhat, as people do - some fuller of bust, some charmingly slender. Each one looks like someone I'd like to meet. The big artistic concept here is that there is no big artistic concept. I also like the multiple images and poses of each model, showing more of the variety there is in each unique woman.Still, the models do tend towards a type: European in features and coloring, twentyish and young-looking even so, and the figures vary only within a limited range. The look is beautiful (or at least pretty), but just one of the many kinds of beauty in the world of women. If you don't have to spend too much, it will add a soft and warm touch to any collection of figure photography.//wiredweird"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lover of enjoyable French singing","review":"She really does have a light touch that has been refreshing ever since I found out about her (which wasn't until the late 80's)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring attempt at RPG","review":"This game is a weak attempt at an RPG. I was highly unimpressed with the graphics, music, and the storyline. You're basically a young kid whose gifted with magic, and you're family is turned to stone by a giant crow. You need to travel to the Monster Tower (yes, it's actually called that) to find the monster that turned your family into stone. The dialog quickly (first 5 minutes) becomes tiresome, and the fight sequences are sadly put together. If you're a small child, and you haven't played the quality RPG's like Final Fantasy you may think this game is good. I can tell you that as an adult this game was a waste of money.

From the beginning with Hello There the scene is set for a great Rock and Roll Album. Big Eyes, Downed, Clock Strikes Ten, Come On, Come On and So good to see you are great tracks, but the best song on the album is without a doubt - Southern Girls. Unfortunately this Album also has the Lolipop song - \\"I want you to want me\\", which is where the Band really gained notoriety. Cheap Trick are a great band but every now and then release a real \\"pop\\" song for the masses. Give me their more unpopular tracks such as the classic Southern Girls any day. If you are a fan of Rock but think that Cheap Trick are a Lolipop Band - think again. Rick Neilson's riffs are as good as Angus Young's of AC/DC.

I have already ordered two more Mosley books on the strength of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Confusing","review":"The book, Devil in a Blue Dress, was very confusing. I thought this book required too much thinking. I like reading books that are easily read and interesting. I found this book very long and never ending. I found the books wording very simplistic. It did not catch my attention. At times I had to read a sentence 3 or 4 times. There was no really clear plot. I believe the only reason it made some top lists was because it was very suspensful. Though I did not like the book, at times I would be at the edge of my chair wanting to find out what will happen. The book is basically about a man named Easy Rawlins, that is hired to find a woman named Daphne Monet. She got a hold of pictures that could destroy a mayoral election for a canidate named Mr. Teran. From that point on I can't explain what happened because I really didn't follow the story. I would only recommend this book for people who love all kinds of twists and turns in the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"This book is a great read and easy to understand!

However, Schechter finishes this story and moves on to the main character of this book--Nelson the \\"Gorilla Man\\".This serial killer may have been the most frightening thing to ever happen to people in the 20's but a gorilla man? How scary is that?Schechter's quick account of some of the other killers were far more enticing and gruesome. Nelson's crimes were neither unusual or fascinating, except for his habit of eating his meals like a horse off his plate. The author's detailed account of all the killings were tedious and tiresome with the same M.O. and results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bestial","review":"Book looked interesting.

Here is a man with the physical ailments of syphillis-borne from childhood- trauma- causing a head injury, and mental illness, yet with all these obvious signs of illness, he was deemed to be an animal- out of control; instead of a human with very specific needs that needed treating. Great work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-written crime novel that doesn't delight in the gory details","review":"This is a well-written, completely engrossing story about one man's unbelievable 16 month murderous road-trip.

I recommend it for any true crime fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Bestial\\" is a gripping story; sad, unsettling, entertaining","review":"Harold Schechter's \\"Bestial\\" is first and foremost an entertaining journey. Through the lives of the victims, the killer, and the authorities who investigate the crimes, Schechter unfolds a drama as facinating as a Poe tale. The book not only informs the reader about a forgotten serial killer, but relates the difficulty police had in connecting crimes and coordinating forces two catch a nomadic criminal. Highly recomended for anyone who enjoys a trip to the unsettling outskirts of human existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of true crime's best","review":"This is one of Schechter's best, and IMHO, one of the best true crime novels I have read. It is about a murderer/rapist nicknamed the Gorilla Man, who seemed to be \\"cursed\\" from birth. He was abnormal from the beginning and lived a bizarre lifestyle his whole life. Both of his parents had and died of syphillis--it makes you wonder if this disease somehow affected this child's brain and warped him. Even his eating habits were more than strange. He later takes to killing and raping landladies while posing as a potential or actual tenant. He manages to get married--to a woman more than 30 years older than him and proceeds to make her miserable--and scared.This was a riveting read.

The compelling, labirynthine plot is embedded in an image of Germany which, while now dated, is both vivid and crafty. However, in my opinion, the book is marred by prejudice. Personally, knowing Germany pretty well, I instinctively share the author's prejudice, so that it did not affect, but rather enhanced my reading experience.

If they do, may God help us. Maybe if he wrote a great first novel, was a star football player, a viruoso pianist, or posessed some other talent, we could be genuinely interested in what he has to say. Parroting the agenda of the right wing, probably his parents, is something any chimpanzee could do. Takes no talent at all, just chutzpah. If he was a mini, lefty Howard Dean, I'd say the same thing.

He makes dramatic statements and offers very little factual information to emphasize his point. His lack of \\"real life\\" experience is evident in his lack of tolerance for diversity and culture.

That isn't saying much since he is in the ranks of McCarthyist Ann Coulter, racist junkie Rush Limbaugh and professional liar Sean Hannity. Kyle takes the conservative party line about evil liberals, a left-wing media conspiracy, degraded education system and a plot by homosexuals and rehashes it with unimaginative, unoriginal predictability. The author's claim of in-depth research is paramount to turning on the 700 Club, listening to hours of right wing radio, and drowning himself into the paranoid delusions of Fox News.

It was a feature I was going to enjoy watching with my kids. Unfortunately, this movie is soured by the single line uttered by Wolverine during his 4 second cameo. It could have been handled (or written) so much better to fall in line with a PG-13 feature. I'm no prude, and served in the Marine Corps, so I have heard it all, but this F-bomb is SO out of place. I just don't understand why the makers of a film marketed for fans of the comic book franchise, that includes younger kids, would feel the need to push the limits of a PG-13 rating and make it less family friendly. So disappointing.

Even a 13 year old or older doesn't need that in a movie. The story line and special effects were good. I allowed my 9 year old to watch this movie and regretted not viewing the movie before allowing him to watch it. I nearly turned off the movie primarily due to the profanity. I didn't like the lingerie scene but that was only a small part of the movie. The profanity unfortunately persisted throughout. Needless to say, the movie has been put away and might even be given away. I wish the writers and directors would leave out the unnecessary trash and just focus on making good movies.

That much is obvious. But this movie just does a huge disservice to both strip and to movie fans. Besides having terrible dialog and no story line it just blows to bits the entire X-men story. The relationship between Charles and Magneto is completely distorted which is unfortunate for so many reasons. The acting in this is superficial and Michael Fassbender's portrayal of him as a man on a mission to kill is just wrong.There is nothing memorable about the cast with January Jones being particularly ineffective. She has the winy, put upon queen role down pat. The only remotely interesting bit was the cameo by Wolverine which was perfectly played.

First Class is the missing link that will answer questions for the fans of the movie, who don't follow the comics, and it is one blockbuster film that more than lives up to its hype. From the special effects to the make-up and finally to the actors this film is amazing. Movies like this never win awards, but you will be hard pressed to find better performances than those of James McAvoy, Kevin Bacon, & Michael Fassbender. The whole cast was terrific, the story was fantastic, and the special effects were truly out of this world. This is a great film and I'm craving more.

I disliked that they changed the original Marvel universe (Sebastian Shaw was a Nazi who killed Magneto's parents ??? Emma Frost is Xavier and Magneto's age? Beast is part of this first class but Iceman, Cyclops and Marvel Girl are not?). But worse than being frustrated that they strayed so far from the story we all know, the movie was just plain boring.

The story digs up heroes and villains that I'm not familiar with, such as the one-dimensional baddie Azazel from a hyper dimension, but does its best to push the metaphor of the treatment of those who are \\"different\\" by mainstream society. James McAvoy is good as a young non-bald Professor X who is not yet wheelchair-bound, finding his way in the world, as is Michael Fassbender as Magneto, tormented by Nazi horrors. The plot is interesting - the Hellfire Club seeking to antagonise the US and the USSR into taking up war positions against each other orchestrates what would become the Cuban Missile Crisis.

MacAvoy and Fassbender ably lead an otherwise hit-and-miss cast. Using the Cuban Missile Crisis of the 1960s as a backdrop was an inspired choice, giving this film a unique, retro atmosphere and leading one to speculate what other historical events may benefit from a mutant influence in future installments.

I like the idea of going back and showing the origins of the X-Men and the Brotherhood, but I was very confused as to whether or not this was a reboot of the X-Men films or if it was a prequel. I've heard some say it's a reboot, and I've heard some say it's a prequel. But either way, it didn't affect my enjoyment of the film much. I kinda thought most of the mutants were kinda stupid, and the plot I think could have been something...more. Not saying the plot was terrible or anything, but I think it could have been better, and better characters could have helped that. Anyway, I didn't really like this X-Men movie, but just watch for yourself and decide for yourself. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray didnot play at all","review":"I got my product and the blu-ray did not play at all.It feels bad to spend money on a product and not get any value from it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not play","review":"Great looking case.

They were horrible. I was hoping this movie would be a reboot of the series but sadly it's more of a prequel type deal to the bad X-Men movies. The most disappointing aspect is that, with the exception of Beast, they didn't use the actual first class of X-Men in the first class movie.Other than that the movie was awesome. Magneto was a BOSS for the most part. Professor X was played very well. The Hellfire Club was a decent pick for the bad guys. The costumes were great. Blue and Yellow like they should be. Magneto had an awesome helmet instead of that dumb thing they made for Gandalf. The Wolverine cameo was great. It makes sense too since he is really so much older than everybody else.

Most the rest not so... casting for just about every other role in this movie and the the inconsistency to the comics (Alex older than Scott, Beast gets Blue from Mystique's blood, yeah, seriously ???).

Trust me; when they throw a hot, half-dressed blonde on screen every few scenes, and I STILL don't care...the movie's in a bad way. Even some very good actors can't redeem this farce. This wasn't just phoned in...it was phoned in over tin cans tied to string.I'm honestly trying to find a way to review this without massive spoilers, but it's proving x-tremely (get it) difficult.For now, all I can say is this movie is inexcusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is fantastic.

I shipped it back to Amazon for a replacement -- at no extra cost to me, at least -- which arrived quickly. Life happened and I didn't try the movie again until today. Unfortunately, the new Blu-Ray also refuses to play in the Samsung, which is just great. Of course, now I've found all the old reviews with other people whose Blu-Rays haven't worked, which is really disappointing and extraordinarily shoddy on Fox's part.

Wolverine drops F-bombs. The Human Torch's girlfriend gets to tell the world about her fireproof lingerie. Iron man gets to have a menage-a-quatre. Hmmm...Comics might not be for kids anymore...but these movies are movies that, honestly speaking, kids should be protected from.What happens when you don't?

This film was \\"okay\\"...but Michael Fassbender seems BORN to play Magneto. His performance alone makes this film really worth watching. He carries an almost regal quality to the character. I'm glad that most of the film seemed more focused on him as opposed to Xavier.

The Blu Ray technology makes you feel as if you can step right into the movie. The story line was superbly integrated into the series which is a rarity.

Casting Kevin Bacon (Kevin Bacon!) to play a Nazi is like casting Oliver Hardy to play Hannibal Lecter. It just doesn't cut it. The film flops along without energy, occasionally trying to blow a fuse but in some inappropriate, foolish fashion. Lights are seen directed down like beams upon character's faces, apparently to add \\"drama\\" to their expressions, otherwise flat and inexpressive. Oh, and the \\"story.\\" How has it happened that fantasy Marvel characters are now immersed in scenes of the Holocaust, concentration camps, scenes of murder?

By my own mistake, I did not open the package for this disc to Amazon within the return window, and am out the money as the last 40 minutes of the movie are unwatchable.This movie is a fun, action-packed superhero movie you would expect given the contemporary demand for these types of movies. I think X-Men first class actually sets itself apart as this movie has more \\"soul\\" and character development that allows the audience to empathise with the characters than most superhero movies of today. It's not in the class of Nolan's Batman trilogy, but it blows away the Avengers series, and the X-Men franchise movies from the early 2000s.Fine movie with a lot of re-watchability. Fassbender is tremendous as always, and this allows the ensemble cast to play up to his level.

Other highlights for me were \\"My Friend\\", \\"Quicksilver Girl\\", \\"Lucky Man\\", \\"Gangster Of Love\\", \\"You're So Fine\\" and \\"Overdrive\\". Incidentally, Miller seems to have followed in the footsteps of Cab Calloway, Jimmy Castor and the like by doing \\"sequel\\" songs over the years.

You can sanitize and clean everything. My husband even used it on a wall that my kids got muddy and it took everything off and looked like freshly painted.

A subscription to VOGUE would be more helpful for the fashion-challenged or those just looking for ideas & tips to update their image."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRETTY BAD TASTE","review":"Clearly these talented women have a large following, as they are witting and sharp, and television style stars, but when it came the selection of outfits and articles of clothing that they chose to highlight in this book as \\"What to Wear\\"? BAD TASTE is all that came to mind. I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the level of style in both their \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" options, as all of the outfits in this book are absolutely atrocious. No one I know would be caught dead in anything they recommend to wear for any of the occasions listed in the book. It is my understanding that all of the books they have written after their first book \\"What Not to Wear\\" are pretty awful, and derivatives of the first book. My recommendation: Unequivocally: PASS."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title promises more than the book delivers","review":"Although I generally enjoy Trinny and Susannah makeovers, this book seems like a movie sequel where they should have stopped when they were on top. Many of the after outfits are not that great. I was surprised to see there was a chapter on appropriate underwear when it is quite obvious that they ought to read their own suggestions before taking the after picture. Wearing a sweater that obviously shows nipples as an improvement to a career outfit is hardly sound advice. Wearing shoes where one's toes hang out and over to the point of touching the ground is just gross. Pants that need to be hemmed. Lots of attitude, but just plain sloppy. An easy 10-minute 'read' if you can get it from the library or second hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Not to Wear for Every Occasion","review":"This book features the cast of the BBC verison of What Not To Wear. I'm not considering this to be on my list of 50 books to read. It really is of no substance. There are pretty pictures and some helpful hints and tips. More events could have been done though. They outfits they do show are ones that will stay in style, but there are a few \\"What were they thinking?\\" Mostly in the wedding sections though. The stuff are age apporiate and they tell you which stores to shop at in your budget. However, money isn't really looked at in depth. Some of the stores they mentioned, I was unfamilar with and I live for fashion, clothing, and fashion magazines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly outdated","review":"This was the worst fashion book I have read in a long time.

I love their show, and have enjoyed some of their other books, but this one is over the top silly. If you're looking for \\"What to Wear to Clown School\\", this is the book! Swarms of butterflies swirling over your head for a wedding? You must be kidding. If you're curious, I'd hit the local library, there's a reason these books are selling for a penny here. I never give bad reviews and I adore these two women, but there is little of practical value for most women in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a let-down","review":"I've enjoyed Trinny and Susannah's other books and picked up quite a few tips from those, but this book has me shaking my head. Worst is the career-dressing advice: it might be fine if you've got an entry-level position, but if you're at a managerial or professional level, forget it!For one thing, Trinny and Susannah seem to have a strong allergy to suits or, for that matter, any clothes that are conservative or classic. Well, trendy doesn't work for everybody, and it doesn't work all the time. Some of their \\"don'ts\\" work as well as, or even better, than their \\"do's\\". And some sections are overlong; do we really need numerous versions of skiwear and after-ski wear?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Perhaps it is because the show is UK based but I was taken aback by some of the after pictures. Alot of dresses over pants and very outlandish hats are shown as do's.Some of the befores don't look too bad other than the dated 80's look which I think we all know not to wear. I would have preferred more tips on handling body types rather than the obvious no's. They put in some really sloppy don'ts which aren't much help unless people in London are really walking around like that. We need more realistic don'ts as opposed to the obvious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just on Okay Book","review":"If you are going to buy a book by these girls I would recommend their other book \\"What You Can Wear Can Change Your Life\\".

A fun book, but more information in the other book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining...Made Me Laugh","review":"If you're looking for something relatively light with lots of pictures and some witty observations about womens' fashion, it's worth the time. Not all of their suggestions are helpful, and some are downright outrageous, but I wasn't reading the book as a self-help book, so it was all right. I was reading it for entertainment, and that it certainly was!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Bling for the Buck!","review":"I love this watch! I get compliments on it all the time. I've found the time to be accurate for a mechanical watch; automatics are never as good as quartz but I'm very happy with this one. This watch looks good in the office, on the beach, or in between. One thing is the compass bezel is pretty much uselss for a couple of reasons: 1. you have to use the Sun to line it up but if you know the time and where the sun is, you already know the direction you're headed. 2. The crown that controls the compass does not lock so the bezel turns by itself as it rubs against my arm. To me this is not a big deal since I don't use the compass feature. All in all, this watch is worth the money. I've wanted an automatic watch for a while and dream of someday getting an Omega Speedmaster or Seamaster so I can fulfill my James Bond dreams. Meanwhile, in reality, I'll stick with the Seiko and save $1800."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very original and of great quality","review":"Very original watch, compass internal ring doesn't turn very loosely (in spite of many complaints I've heard), bracelet is so smooth I've never met like this before, had problems earlier wearing steel bracelets, but this one is very cool and comfortable. Haven't yet tried to swim in it, but I shurely will. Have been a lot on Seiko and Citizen forums and heard mostly good reviews on this Seiko Atlas (that's how they call it at the Seiko club). I've learned how to use compass - very nice feature.Good watch, very original, for extensive outdoors use."},{"rating":"1","title":"ITS NOT A GOOD WATCH!","review":"I bought this watch and knowing seiko 5 is a good brand. But all of the sudden after 3 times first is when i got the watch, second after 1 week and last one is just last night and that was after a week as will of reseting the time and date. The Crown was not good quality it was a lost thread or i spring or i don't know i just like i coudn't lock because the short and long arm was moving while i trying to lock the crown. So try a quality brand and good item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant and cool","review":"Both the look and the feel is great. The look is elegant and cool at the same time, the feel is durability and quality. Great watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete disappointment","review":"I bought this watch in 2007 and I've had to send it 3 times for repair in the past 2 years.First time, the watch started running really fast.Second time, the compass' crown broke off.Third time, the watch simply stopped working.Every time I send it back I have to pay shipping.The service and responsiveness of CoServ (the Seiko repair service in the US) has been dismal: they never returned the original box I send on the first repair (despite multiple communications); and each repair takes a good one to two months.I love the look of this watch; but it's been too much hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but not helpful in real test!","review":"I read it with great joy and fun, but the strategies the author provides cannot be that applicable to the real test because the major strategies in this book are pretty old. The code of modern CBT GRE is not that simply broken. Of course, it is true that first five (I think the first ten at least) questions are extremely important. But trust me! Do not rely only on the first five questions because ETS conders the most how many questions the test takers answer correctly. You can enjoy this book. But if you prepare GRE only with this book, I am sure that you will be greatly abashed. Math is good, but GRE math is getting complicated. For math, it would be better to review the Math section ETS freely provides through its website."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quck study book","review":"I am not a person to sit around for hours and hours to study. This book was great, because it reviewed all the basics and refreshed my memory quickly and easily. If you're a heavy studier, this book is a great starter book, then you can always read as many other books as you want. For me, I just read this one, and was quite satisfied with the tips and review it provided. I've reccomended this book to all my friends, who are going to take the GRE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even waste your money","review":"So, I just took the GRE today and let me tell you, nothing they discussed in this book was in the GRE. None of the formulas, vocab, anything! Ugh! You're better of just googling gre practice questions and checking out the different sites available. This book sucked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREs suck as much as the SATs","review":"I thought this book was a great way to ease me into taking the GREs. Everything is very easy to understand and well illustrated by the author (as well as funny).Instead of giving lists of vocab you have to read through the book to compile a list - which at first I thought was annoying but in the end I thought it was better. I did as they suggested, making flashcards for every word. However, if I could go back and write the 400 cards again, I would have divided the seperate colors into positive words, negative words and neutral. That way if you didn't remember the definition you could hopefully remember the color.Finally, I would say that although this book was very user-friendly I am glad I purchased a second (Kaplan with an attached CD of tests) book. I found the second book to be a bit harder and between the two gave me a better range of questions.Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Time!","review":"This was an awful book. Nothing that was discussed in this book was covered during the GRE. The verbal section was the worst. It tells you that the GRE will have a lot of Antonyms and Synonyms for you to answer. Let me tell you, on the new version of the GRE I found neither of these questions. I mean they were not even close. It was a waste of money and a waste of time. Get a better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use book but needs supplement.","review":"I recently took the GRE and to prep for the test I used this Dummies book. The book was easy to read, entertaining and very informative. I felt a lot less nervous about the test because the book told me what to expect. The math review was good and I think I would have done better on the verbal part if I had memorized the vocabulary words they provided in the book. The only reason the book does not get 5 stars is because there was math on the GRE not covered in the book. I think that another book in combination with this book would have helped to better prepare me. All in all though I would recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful","review":"I used The GRE for Dummies as well as the Cracking the GRE CAT (with CD Rom) to study for the GRE. Both had their strengths. In the GRE for Dummies, the math review was superior, the prefix, suffix, and root review was excellent; and especially helpful was the note that prior to studying, one should see whether or not the graduate school requires all three scores. I did that, found that I would not have to spend very much time studying for the analytical section, and was appreciative of the time saved. Using these two books, I did quite well on the GRE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the only useful GRE study book.","review":"If you are going to take the GRE, buy this book and no other. The author fills you in on all the tricks you need to know to score well on the GRE (and there are many), and does not waste your time with lists of 30,000 vocabulary words. Spend your time learning the structure of the test and how to avoid the traps, then learn the basic information. Her chapters on algebra and geometry are much more useful than Barron's or any other books I looked at, and her strategy for vocabulary makes much better use of your time than memorizing vocabulary. The only way the book falls short is in preparation for the unique features of the computer-based test. All the books I looked at fell short this way, even the ones that claimed to have sections on the computer-based test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"It is a good book but it is outdated. The math section is the best part of it.

Great book written with great style. Feels like you are having an informal rendezvous with the authors, face-to-face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial","review":"Overall the book although written in a fun language didn't get me into learning more and I ended using it only for making the tests inside and not actually learning from it. I would recommend a book that is more concentrated on a preparation method and focuses more on tips&tricks and methods to master the GRE sections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to Kaplan","review":"Being that it has been awhile since I have taken any math, I had heard the GRE for Dummies book was the best for brushing up. However, I have found it to be useless. Unfortunately, it lacks proper explanations and the examples are confusing. I have had much better luck using random math websites and Kaplan's prep book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have gone with Kaplan (or something else!)","review":"Let me start out by saying that generally I am a good test-taker. I am also an Honors student with a 3.9 GPA. I studied from this book and got a below-average score on the GRE. I do not attribute my score entirely to the book, but I do think I could have done just as well (or poorly, rather) on the exam without even cracking this book open. There are a few tips for how to relax before the exam than I did apply, but other than that, I found the book pretty useless. Now I have to shell out another $150 to take the exam again in order to have a shot at getting into graduate school. My suggestion is that you don't buy this book. Spend the little extra and get a book from Kaplan or Princeton Review. I hear they're much better at preparing you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give t zero stars it was so bad","review":"this book is usless. do no buy it or spend any time using it. not only is it not funny or helpful in any way it also covers nothing.not a good book. find smething else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dummies being the key word","review":"This book was helpful in explaining the areas where I needed to improve my skills to take the GRE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for dummies, but not the rest of us.","review":"Vlk does use a lot of humor which makes studying less painfull, but unfortunately it doesn't make up for the rest of the book. I used this book faithfully several months before taking the GRE and in the end did poorly. She encourages you to rush through the test, guessing if you can't come up with the answer in a short amount of time. Its much better to keep your eye on the clock as you go through the test and try to use all the time they give you, since if you finish early you can't go back. Since the GRE is only given on a computer now, doesn't it make more sense to study it on a computer? Her roots, prefixes, and suffixes is a good idea, but you need to couple it with learning the kind of words on the GRE, especially when knowing what just part of the word means isn't helpfull. I had much better results studying with a computer program, in my case the Princeton Review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I purchased this book last year and found it more annoying than helpful. The author's \\"cute\\" rhetoric was more distracting than helpful nor did I find any of her advice all that beneficial. The examples were overly simplistic and did not reflect the difficulty of the test. Her approach is superficial at best and downplays the rigorous nature of the test itself. This book was definitely a waste of money. The Barrons vocabulary list is far superior to anything in \\"Dummies.\\" I am going with Kaplan this time and anxiously awaiting the new edition of the ETS book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date as of Fall 2011","review":"This book needs to be retired from circulation.

I bought this book on Feb 10, 2010 & got it sooner than expected. I didn't have time to study due to a busy schedule but because time was running out, I had to at least read the book & see what it had to offer (consider that I am no Math genius & that the verbal section is equally as bad). So I read the book from cover to cover once doing the practices and before you know it, it was time to take the test. So on April 16, 2010 I wrote my test, still as terrified as ever & what do you know? I scored over 1000 SOLELY because of this book.I highly recommend this book to people who know for a fact that they are weak in Math. You will not regret it.

The actual belt is comfortable and includes adequate padding for the amount of tools and fasteners I carry in it. The buckle seems durable and is very accommodating for various waist sizes. Both side packs are mirror images of the other, so its handy for either righty or lefty. Velcro firmly holds the pouches in place so they don't slide around.

This is something I keep out on counter due to frequent use. If you don't have it readily availble, you tend not to use it. So folding reduces its footprint and opens up the counter more. The stainless and black also helps aesthetically. Quality wise it appears well made. So far it is working as promised with no hitches. A good design is how they manage the suction hose and power cord; power cord has recessed holder to hide its unsightlyness, and the suction hose has a mount as well. All neatly tucks away."},{"rating":"2","title":"fred","review":"foodsaver v2840 is a good product. we have used it many times since purchase. the instructions from the manufacturer were excellent. the price from amazon was good ,although the same unit from COSTCO was cheaper. we are happy and have rferred amazon to other prospective buyers."},{"rating":"1","title":"new bags","review":"i have been using the food saver system approximately 14 yrs. i bought my 3rd. machine about a month ago. found out from their customer service (seems from my experience that they would rather sell you a new machine than attend to your problem!) the only difference between the machines is the way it sits on the counter, 3000 series vertically and 2000 style horizontally with the higher nos. more bells and whistles. the guts of the thing (air pump etc.) are identical. now to these new bags, they are a ONE USE ONLY! and these bags are'nt cheap. the old bags could be reused many times. so beware this can get expensive over time, not the savings they claim."},{"rating":"2","title":"What would I do without it","review":"We recently purchased a chest freezer and immediately bought the foodsaver 2840 to seal our freezer foods. We have been extremely happy with it. The instructional DVD was cheesy, yet useful. It is easy to use and doesn't take up too much counter space.We purchased the jar sealers, universal lids, rounded cannisters, and additional sealing material/bags. I strongly recommend each of those items because they are useful in some cases where bags are a pain or not so useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two bad ones in a row.","review":"We'd been using an older model foodsaver for several years and thought we'd upgrade.

By bad, I mean turned and started to degridate. I store my unit in the box in a cupboard, so it is not exposed to anything that would cause this. I purchased my unit at Costco which accepted it back for a full refund (got to love their refund policy!). In turn, I purchased the newer all metal foodsaver 3835."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more throwing away leftovers!","review":"This is my second FoodSaver. The first one lasted over seven years, using it every day. My favorite way to use it is with wide mouth canning jars... lots of things fit in them and they don't take much room in the refrigerator. I love the one touch hands-free operation, and the soft food feature that lets me seal fresh fruit or rolls, etc., without squashing them. And it folds up against the wall if I need the counter space! Amazing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This is the 2nd food saver.

I was almost afraid to use it because I didn't want to find out I had made a bad purchase...finally I just went for it. I worked it hard the first 3 days and never had a problem. I've continue to use it often over the past several months and am still very happy with it.I do think it was helpful to read all the hints and tips from the other reviews before I started. Probably saved me a lot of trouble from finding out the hard way.Very easy to operate.

I keep spending more for each new product, but none of them last more than a year or so. I keep hoping that the more money I spend, the better my chances are of finding a reliable product. Not so. This very expensive model is no better than the ones I purchased in the past.I give up. I'm just going to start throwing my food away again and forget about \\"saving money\\" using this expensive gimmick. Wouldn't it be nice if we could produce quality products in America again?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Indespensible tool","review":"In today's economy, buying in bulk to save money is almost mandatory. This product lets you stock up at the warehouse club stores and have the piece of mind that freezer burn won't effect your goods while they sit in the freezer.What I find almost as important as the vaccuum sealer itself, is the heat sealer. Chips, cereal, crackers, carrots, and much more can be resealed in their original packaging. No more twist ties, baggies and even reduced uses of plastic storage containers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"expensive lesson","review":"Gaskets went bad after about 1 year. New ones not available.

I tend to shop at Sam's and I buy my meat in bulk. I separate the meat into meal-size portions and label and date my purchase. I have had ground beef in the freezer for a year and when you defrost it, the meat is still red. I place leftovers in it and a year later, it tastes like I cooked the food yesterday. My wife likes to grind her own coffee and she uses the canister with the hose to vacuum seal the coffee beans. I have put whole lobsters in these bags and they still taste fresh after six months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought","review":"Big and bulky,but works great. The tilt up design helps almost,but still looks huge. I you do tilt it up for storage and lock the top do not lock tight it will crush your gasket that seals around the bag and you'll lose suction. The latch has two settings, one to hold loosely and the second to seal. The only other concern is the pump motor dose'nt sound very strong. Overall I like it alot. It has saved me alot of money in wasted food. Buy bags on sale and you will save even more. I also bought the marinator and it works great (a must buy)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CJ","review":"I purchased mine at a store a few years ago. Then they offered two types of bags to use. One with bubbles on one side the other was just slick like a zip lock bag type design. then they changed them all over to the bubble type. That was the wrong thing to do, as it tries to heat and seal some of the bubbles are not compressed to seal. So then there is a leak and freezer burns appear. I wish I had not wasted my money on it. Think twice, zipper bags work just the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brand New, Out of the Box, Did Not Work","review":"I bought this unit to store some dehydrated food for a backpacking trip, and received it brand new in the box. After several dozen attempts, it never was able to seal anything. When I tried to use the vacuum sealer, it made a strange noise and then quit trying, giving me a flashing error light every time. I researched around online to see if there was some simple fix or something I was doing wrong, but I couldn't find anything. I thought the design of this V2840 was cool, but in my opinion I should never have to wrestle this hard to get a brand new product to do the only thing it was designed to do. What a joke! I'm probably going to try a simpler model ... don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality junk","review":"This is my third and last Food Saver.

But this product works well. I especially like the space saving design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intermittantly works","review":"We bought the V3825 Foodsaver in December of 2008 and should have taken it back.It is difficult to activate the sealing function - put in the bag and keep trying until it FINALLY decides to activate. Then after more than 4 or 4 uses it signals overheating and then we have to suspend operation waiting to start again. Meanwhile the meat products we bought from a wholesale club have to be kept in the fridge waiting. This has happened repeatedly and not just on occasion. Tried all the \\"removing the gasket and turning it over, etc\\" suggested by an email reply from Foodsaver - no help. I, personally, would NOT purchase this model at all. Plus, the model definitely leaves too much of an edge when sealing when it does want to work.Our old one - purchased years ago - worked perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreliable","review":"i have owned 3 different foodsaver models.from mid-range to their best.each, after minimal use, stopped working.the company would not do a thing for me because they were a little past the one year warranty date.did not offer a discount on a re-pack or anything.the same thing happened to my son and 2 of his friends.they look great on the tv commercials. they are terrible. do not buy one.for reliable home use, do yourself a favor, spend a little more money and buy a weston brand.i doubt that you'll have regrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine...","review":"i love my machine! i use it for our meat products, we buy bulk in chicken breast and ground beef.

I love it! It's so much quieter and the seal is much better. It's very convenient having the bags stored inside and cleanup is so easy.

I found reading the other reviews far more enjoyable than reading this book. Unfortunately, my husband didn't read them before buying the book for me for Christmas. I am a sailor, and was hoping for a nice short read over a holiday break that would entice me to this foreign land. Instead I found myself drowning in what felt like forced prose.To be fair, I am also an engineer, and never particularly enjoyed all those Honors English classes either.

Well, here we have an amateur sailor showing his well-read background off while breaking every rule of the sea. George, the friend and hired hand, must have had his hands full with this sea pup, heading out into gales, riding dinghies into heavy surf. Really, why read this book?

However, we need a better job done on it than this book does. To be fair, this style of \\"semi-reporting\\" is popular and does sell; but, it's not what will do the job. It is full of the author's \\"we shoulds\\" when what we could better use would be \\"given A, if you want B, and are willing to do C then do/support E\\". The book is full of anecdotes, that we are not sure are representative, and of \\"opinions\\", of many \\"non-government organizations\\" and \\"advocacy groups\\".

There are full chapters devoted to homeland security and to jobs.Also, just because you don't agree with a book's conclusion doesn't mean that it's biased. In fact, from my reading, Lockout is balanced almost to a fault: delivering both sides of many of the arguments about immigration - the Borjas/Card debate about the impact on low-wage U.S. workers comes to mind.No doubt, Lockout makes a case in favor or immigration's net effect benefits to the United States, but it doesn't ignore the costs-- and suggests ways to achieve a more moderate and sustainable flow of people across borders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for oily skin.","review":"I have combination/oily skin and this product was very thick and left my skin feeling greasy until washed off.

This particular moisturizer had a creamy texture that blended in quickly and didn't have that greasy feel to it. The one draw back was that it started out a milky white color and stayed that way until completely blended. I took the moisturizer with me on vacation to Las Vegas, where the dry desert atmosphere usually dries out my skin. I was happy to see that this product kept my skin happy without smelling like a fruit basket.

Rave reviews here, 2. Intro by Patrick Lencioni, 3. Review by Dalai Lama, and 4. that the work is based on lots of research.While I agree that the book is easy to read, I did not experience much substance in the book, and I think it only provided a very basic introduction to Emotional Intelligence. Given all the research the authors clamim to have done, there is not much analysis or explanation of what the research means. The 2nd star in this rating comes from the self-assessment.There are many other books on EQ out there (Goleman for example) that provide much more substance and depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best seller that earned it","review":"This book is a best seller for good reason.

I bought it after seeing Jim Mahfood's work in the \\"Clerks\\" comic, and this did not disappoint. If you like comics, or aspire to write them, this is a good buy. The story lags in some parts, mainly in some of the dialogue (it seems like he's occasionally trying too hard to make drug references or use slang), but that isn't why I bought the book, nor is it the reason why I love the book.

I would suggest you take this product off your sales list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item should be pulled","review":"Typically I carefully read and heed other reviewers advice. Somehow, I did not on this. Until you use it, quality seems fine. The wood seems sturdy and has a pleasant cedar smell. However, even with gentle use, it broke first time as the important internal tightening screw is cheap plastic. This product is designed to stretch leather. It should be sturdy and able to withstand the force needed to do this. This product is an excellent example of the fraud being perpetrated on the buying public by Chinese manufacturers AND the domestic sellers of their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap garbage","review":"I specifically chose this one because there's no plastic parts.

This shoe stretcher wouldn't even touch the sides on my size 13 Rockports. They were a little tight, so I wanted to loosen them up.It was ridiculous how far from \\"stretching\\" they were. I would guess there was at least a half inch of space in the shoes when the \\"stretchers\\" AND the little knobs were fully extended. Without the knobs it probably would have been an inch.

He isn't terribly forthcoming in telling me when something doesn't fit quite right. His folly was getting the narrow shoes in the first place.

On the one hand, for the first three quarters of the book, I thought it was absolutely delightful. Goldman's an excellent writer, is able to evoke the world he's writing about, and mixes both the comic and tragic elements masterfully. And then, about seventy pages before the end, it all goes off the rails.The mystery which most of the book has been building up to is resolved with an unlikely deus ex machina. The heroine and her supporting cast start acting strange and uncharacteristicly. And the last chapters make an awkward, poorly written shift from the third person point of view to the first.Really, as much as I liked Goldman's first two books, I can't recommend The Divine Husband at all. It should have been longer or it should have been rewritten one more time or whatever. Let's hope the next one is better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book and francisco Goldman are highly regarded.

I was immediately hooked to this funny, sad, romantic movie. While the family-drama level can be a bit high, it is not unrealistic. This is truly a movie that can be enjoyed by all audiences. On another note, George Peppard is a piece of eye-candy, that will not go unnoticed by female viewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mitchum in his prime!","review":"I am a movie buff but for some reason I never saw this movie until I was in my 30's..a terrific movie by any standard. Robert Mitchum WAS in his prime here. This movie and Vincent Minnelli squeezed out excellent performances from Eleanor Parker, George Hamilton and George Peppard. This was some of the earliest performances in Hamilton and Peppards' career. I thought George Peppard nearly stole this movie in his role as Rafe...a great part...for a very entertaining 50's movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend This Movie","review":"Recieved this movie on time and it was just as stated. This is an excellent movie. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too close to home from the hill","review":"After reading the book 3 times, I was disapointed in the movie script. The Captain played by Robert Mitchum was assumed to have many children in the town (due to the many town kids who had his trademark coal black wavy hair) His wife was homely and was of high moral fiber. His own son Theron was strong, smart and very athletic. His mother doted on him and his father taught him how to hunt. Theron got Libby pregnant and Libby's father thought it was the Captain and shot him to death. Theron disapeared in the woods and was never found and the Captains wife died a broken woman who never knew her husband's love. If the movie would have followed the book, it would have been a far better movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Home from the Hill","review":"I ordered Home from the Hill because I remember it being partially filmed in a neighboring town when I was a young teen. When I saw the movie at that tender age I had really liked it. It was a trip down memory lane. Unfortunately, the movie did not age well on any level. The novel is wonderful I would love to see an updated movie version of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is THE deck for iPod lovers.","review":"I bought this deck for my 2008 Kenworth. I spend alot of time on the road, and I listen to my iPod alot. I had an older Alpine with the iPod control, and I used to unplug my iPod so I could search for music to listen to. It was painfully slow to search through the deck controls. But this new IDA-X001 takes care of all those problems. The search function is amazing. It is really fast. Imagine picking up your iPod and searching for a song. It's the same on the alpine. Plus with Alpine's high quality sound in all of their high end decks, the music sounds amazing. The lack of a cd player bothered me at first, but I never listen to them anymore, so I got used to it in a hurry. XM sounds great as well through the deck. I give this deck the highest marks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but not so fast....","review":"Yeah, this should have been a great product. And it mostly works... 85% maybe. But you'd expect more from Alpine wouldn't you. Specifics - no matter what you do, no matter how many times you change it, the system will set to \\"repeat all\\". You can change the settings on your ipod and on your deck and the next time you use it, it'll default back to \\"repeat all\\". Why??? Second, the text is too big - you can't read titles. And you can't change the text size, no matter what they tell you. This just should have been tested more and should have been a better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yep this is one of them.","review":"I got this cause I didn't need the chuck.

If you want to know about nutrition, Amazon sells dozens of very reliable and well written books (those for freshman college courses are usually excellent for the general reader) for other medical/health issues affecting adults and children, there are also hundreds of good books - Reader's Digest, Dr Spock, for example.

Who hasn't wanted to get a little cozy at one time or another with somebody directly in the blood line? This movie branches out into the unknown and unmentionable with its satiric and often suspenseful take on life in the bayou. The boat chases are amazing with lots of open shirted scenes of a woman's breasts. What more could anyone ask for in a movie? Five stars may not do the justice that this movie deserves.

I turn this unit on when before I get into the shower, and when I get out all is warm. It heats so well that once I am dressed, the room becomes so hot I have to turn it off. We have a really small master bathroom, so maybe a bigger room may not get as warm.We do not use our whole home heater, energy is too expensive, the themaflo is the perfect solution to heating a specific area.Because it is hanging on the wall, there is no concerns about water mixing with the heater, and potential electrocution.

And let's not forget the great storage/carrying case, which allows me to take MY cards to any poker game in which I play (as I absolutely refuse to play with cheap, dime store cards)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic playing cards Copag","review":"Did not last as long as I would have liked them to last.

I was not skeptical at all about the quality since I read previous reviews. I have used many plastic ones even the ones bought from Italy. These cards are great. A little on the thinner side but definitely excellent. The build quality is superior than most cards on the market. Money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Kems","review":"First let me say that we used Kem cards in our club exclusively, however, the last few decks were so bad that we decided to try Copags. Lucky for us, as these cards are much better. No problems with the cards. No defects (Kem had 4 of 4 decks bad). If you play regularly you need to use these cards. They are washable, almost impossible to ruin (with normal use), and they feel brand new for a long, long, long time. Once you use these cards you will never go back to regular decks. If you only play once in a while, then the cost of the cards may not be justified, but the feel, slide, etc., is so far superior to regular decks that you will be glad you bought them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Copag cards are the best!","review":"Best $15 bucks (or so) that you will ever spend on your home poker game. Bee / Bicycle playing cards at $3-$4 bucks a deck, will last you one game (if you care about playing with quality cards, and not bent out of shape cards. The Copag set will last you YEARS. Yes, years! Until one of the cards accidentally gets cut with a knife or something, you're good to go.My old pair of Copags literally started to fade because they had been dealt so many times on the felt table. They started to fade before they lost their shape.Buy ONE of these two packs of cards. I say to buy only one because it's all you're going to need for a long, long time. Unless you want different designs that is.5 star product! Get these cards, trust me on this one. Modiano's are nice too. These are way better than the Kem cards, which are more expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cards became warped.","review":"I own four sets of these cards. For whatever reason, these cards tend to warp slightly. One particular set has warped to the point that there's about a 10 degree arc along the short side (making it even more noticeable). My guess is that these cards couldn't handle the heat (it reaches 90 degrees in my room, where I stored the cards).The other three sets are warped to a lesser degree, but there's still a bit of a curvature.This wasn't a problem with my KEM cards, which were stored in the same area and have not had any problems.If warped cards aren't an issue for you, go ahead and buy these over KEM cards. They're both extremely sturdy and the copags are a bit cheaper to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avid card player","review":"For the price and quality of the card is awesome!

Not knowing much of Mithridates, I was sucked in by the tagline of \\"Rome's greatest enemy\\". This guy was no Hannibal, that's for sure. He lost almost every battle he was in, and the ones where he was victorious can be credited to extremely bad generalship on the part of his opponents. I was rooting for the Romans, or anyone for that matter, to trap this clown and destroy him, rather than letting him get away once more, and raise another army, which in turn would be annihilated a few chapters later. If you want a more realistic account of the Mithridates, and you are especially interested in his relationship with Sulla, read McCullough's \\"The Grass Crown\\". That way you can get the whole story, presented in a superior novel, without feeling obligated to have sympathy for Mithridates The Loser."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Surprise","review":"Never heard of this king, this empire.

The characters and scenes are well painted by Ford, but it never grabbed me. I didnt get that usual 'cant put the book down' feeling. It was an enjoyable read, but definitely not a book I will pick up again and again.The story is told through the eyes of King Mithridates bastard son, Pharnaces. This gives the story an interesting and compelling storyline throughout, but I wanted more of Pharnaces own thoughts and feelings to come out. Through his eyes we see the great King in his conquests, defeats, loves and losses. Its an interesting way to tell this tale.The descriptions of battles and weaponry is well done. The visions the author is able to provide you are excellent. He truly excels in this area. Lacking are the insights into Mithridates' psyche, but that is a sacrifice made when you have a narrator tell the tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"A poor man's Pressfield novel.

Every question was of the easiest level, which led me into a false sense of security. i ended up taking the lsat not fully prepared and i will have to retake it now.

I thought I would breeze through the LSAT after reading this book, and then was shocked when the questions on all of my prep tests were SO MUCH HARDER. Not so much with the Logic Games, but definitely when it came to Reading Comprehension and Logical Reasoning. This book doesn't even have very good strategies for tackling any of the sections it explains; it just sort of tells you what the sections are. If you want comprehensive strategies on how to attack the sections, I would look to PowerScore.All in all, this book doesn't use real questions from previous LSATs, and anything that doesn't do that isn't an effective prep book.

I think the best application is to start with this to get comfortable with how to approach the questions, and then practice using the real LSAT tests.

There were lots of films made since the original Planet of the Apes ('68, directed by Franklin J Schaffner, before he won the Oscar for Patton). I never saw any of the others. \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" has little to do with the others, though it could be considered a prequel. James Franco is likeable, always, and the rest of the cast is in tune with the proceedings. John Lithgow is especially endearing, and Andy Serkis proves, once again, that he's the best \\"artificial\\" actor around. A commendable performance.I admire the film for outstanding visual effects, and some brilliant photography featuring vistas of San Francisco (and Redwood NP) that are breathtaking. Muted colors and close-ups are stunning.Worth a look, but it's hard to say that it would be appreciated as much without seeing Schaffner's original, a true ground-breaker in American film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"I like the old planet of the ape better.Sorry I seem wildness movies with bears, wolves, ect with skills and leadership."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This movie was awesome!

There's one thing that even the greatest make-up artists and computer geeks have never mastered and that is apes...or any animal for that matter. As I suspected from the trailer, this was in fact a blur of moderate CGI effects in every shot, that had me screaming for Roddy McDowall to return. If hundreds of monkeys overran a city..they'd be shot on sight. Easy! The inherent lack of any adequate quick reaction force in an American city after the break-out ruined the effect for me. It just wouldn't happen on horse-back with batons.What ever happened to the classic movies of the 70s and 80s that even today have us queuing up to buy the Blu-Ray?

Over-hyped, over-rated and under whelmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Awful, Unredeemable!","review":"This film is an embarrassment to movie making. Don't waste your time or your money. How do I give 0 stars??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I am very critical when it comes to movies and have never written a review for one, but this movie deserves it. The story was very strong and believable, the visuals were stunning, the acting was good, and it was just an overall enjoyable experience. I have watched every Planet of the Apes entity and I am very happy with this one. I would encourage people to take a walk into the past and watch the other ones...That will make this movie even more enjoyable. Definitely one of my top ten favorite movies of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was surprised by how much I liked it!","review":"I'd seen the original movies. I'd seen the remake with Marky Mark. I wasn't going to watch this.But then a bunch of different people in my life kept saying that it was really good and they liked it. We're talking people I know who don't know each other and each of them are very different from each other. Does that make sense? No? OK Well pushing on: I really liked this movie! It was highly entertaining and just a lot of fun! The CGI-apes are very well done and you easily lose yourself in the story. I also liked the little things they threw in the film as a sort of reminder of the other films (I'll let you discover them for yourself!). Anyway, if you're on the fence about watching this, like I was, I can easily recommend it to you. It's a lot of fun and looks great!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Though Provoking and Mesmerizing","review":"This film is a worthy remake (or pre-make) for us to seriously take into consideration. With cloning, germ warfare and genetic manipulation now being a reality, it begs the question, what if something was to go wrong.The base for the storyline is quite plausible, how far are the scientist willing to go to cure diseases? What is really happening today behind closed doors in the R & D departments of mega pharmaceutical companies?What I find impressive about this film is the \\"wow\\" factor that it generates each time there is even the most subtle, but yet astounding breakthrough in Caesar's intelligence. He proves himself to be a strategist and a thinker, while allowing everyone only to know the extent of his true intelligence on a need to know basis.It is quite worthy of the viewing and it will leave you with a satisfied, yet a bit disturbed feeling, realizing that sometimes, experiments may go wrong, and what would be the true damage in such a sceanario."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting summer fun!","review":"A research scientist is trying to develop a cure for Alzheimer's, as his father suffers from the disease. The private facility is using chimpanzees to test the drug and something goes awry. This prequel to the Planet of the Apes films is engrossing, exciting, and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The visuals of the apes are terrific, and the storyline is believable in the context presented. The film is not overly violent, as the apes do not produce a high human body count, and there is not a sequence of bloody violence. Stick around for the end credits, or you'll miss something. This is more summer fun, and you don't want to miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rise of the Special Effects","review":"I was looking forward to watching \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes.\\" Instead I wasted 2 hrs watching a piece of badly written, badly acted, and boring piece of forgettable celluloid. No suspense, no thought, and no fun. This could have been a great movie if they spent more money on writers and less on computer graphics. Poor James Franco---literally poor---he must have needed a paycheck, was wasted in this cliched mess. Tom Felton (Malfoy from the \\"Harry Potter\\" movies) plays Malfoy with an American accent in this piece of crap. Speaking of crap---I just want to fling crap (like a monkey) at this horrible movie.Don't waste your time...NO STARS from me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The original Planet of the Apes was a thoughtful political commentary despite its primitive special effects. The 2001 remake was more action-oriented, but at least entertaining. This remake just feels completely lacking. The acting is lousy. James DiFranco just can't pull off a scientist and his girlfriend fades into the background. While I'm a big fan of Andy Serkis' performance-capture CG work, his portrayal of Caesar the chimp didn't really do much for me - certainly not nearly as emotionally powerful as his Gollum. However, perhaps the biggest disappointment was the special effects themselves. Sometimes the apes looked OK, but more often they looked fake. I was really surprised given all of hype. I actually thought the apes from the 2001 Planet of the Apes looked better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and action packed","review":"I was excited to check this movie but my wife was less than enthusiastic. After five minutes, she was asking me to turn it up! Amazing visuals, interesting storyline and lots of action made this a fun option for our Friday night at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please let there be a third installment!!","review":"Rented this through Amazon Instant Video and streamed it to my TV through Roku (so convenient!). I enjoyed the first installment, and this one was surprisingly good. Acting and special effects were great. I hope there's a 3rd installment planned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This movie rocks from start to finish. I am a planet the Apes fan from the begining, and I can honestly say this is the best one. I ordered the movie when it came out on amazon and recieved it within a couple days. Great movie....The video presentation is outstanding....the audio sounds great. There are a bunch of special features that people will love. Go and buy it now!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]","review":"Two stars is generous for this film! I didn't really want to see this overhyped prequel, but my friends felt otherwise, and we went. For the first 40 minutes, the movie actually has a plot, is on genre, and was surprisingly good! Unfortunately, it goes way downhill from there. As the apes get smarter, the reality of the film decreases, and gets to the point where it becomes laughable. I loved the first half, but by the end of the film, I couldn't wait for it to end. First time director, Rupert Wyatt, really doesn't know when enough is enough! Some of the scenes just went on and on, and of course, they were the more ridiculous ones. Andy Serkis, who played the main ape, did a nice job with what must have been a difficult role. I give him props for that, but it's a good performance wasted in a ridiculous film, that was much too long, one that eventually becomes a farce of itself. Seriously, ignore the hype and save your money, this film is a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, but Enough with the References!","review":"I was expecting interesting. This was awwwwwwwsome! wooooh ooh ooh ooh eee eee eee aah aah aah!\\" I really loved every frame. Andy Serkis should be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, but of course, he won't be. The only annoying things were the constant verbal and visual references to the original series. I counted 23 or 24. One or two, to show respect for the source materiel, fine. But, 23? Sheesh! I was also pleased (and I'm sorry if this is a spoiler) that no ape at any time gave in to what must have been an overwhelming urge to throw poop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak...","review":"This movie was like a worse version of iRobot, with apes in place of robots. Just another excuse to overuse special effects...Shame on you James Franco, shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films of 2011!!","review":"Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a throwback to the golden age of sci-fi when big ideas where at the center of the storyteller. Andy Serkis as Caesar is a tour de force performance and hopefully he lands an Oscar nod for his work here. He is nothing short of brilliant. He looks real. He feels real. There are moments when it feels like you are watching a human brain trapped in the body of an ape. He is that good. The effects by WETA are truly amazing. The action and spectacle are also well done. Emotional, heartbreaking, and always riveting, this is a fantastic character-study film some thought-provoking concepts and ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"planet of the Apes","review":"This movie was not that great Why i say that, 1 the Apes are fake and they are not real Apes, 2 there ant no way that a Ape can move that fast, 3 and you can see that they dont move like apes in real life, but if they did put real apes in this movie that would be much more better movie out there to see. I would not wast my money on this movie.."},{"rating":"1","title":"dougv","review":"A poor movie. It has no real plot, it was slow moving, and it was boring.All it focuses on is angry apes seeking revenge on humans.No where near as good as the original Planet of the Apes series, which was original and interesting.One of the worst films I've seen.Don't waste your time seeing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!!!! and not in a good way....","review":"This is a review of the film, not the actual bluray product:I'm not used to being in the minority for like vs. dislike of a movie as I am pretty easily entertained.Visually this movie is something to behold, the CGI for the animal \\"acting\\" and facial expression is so good, it's creepy. That's the only thing worth watching, though. The rest, the real actors, the story... it's so bad that I want to do a drive by return to the video store that I got it from. As in: fling it at the door as I drive by (even though I know it's not their fault) I am genuinely confused by all the good reviews this movie got. This is only the 2nd time I have ever felt mislead by fellow Amazonians so I feel obligated to warn others."},{"rating":"1","title":"TiVo Download Is Corrupted","review":"I had to use my Xbox to rent this movie from Microsoft's Zune market, because four attempts to download to TiVo with Amazon resulted in the audio being out of sync, and video skipping.

I would most likely buy this movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great movie","review":"I've known a lot of people who think it may be boring, but I personally loved this movie. Its a very disturbing look at humanity, and makes you wonder why people are so deadset against evolution. Because the animal in this movie wasnt really the apes. Technically they are animals, but humans lack of compassion is where the real uncivility is. made me tear up. everyone should give it a chance"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie","review":"I thought this was a great prequel. I am not sure what people are talking about with the poor quality. I ordered the Blu Ray DVD from Amazon and with it came the free rental of the movie so I can watch it while I wait for delivery. It was the instant SD version for free so I thought I would watch it (yes I plan on watching the Blu Ray version when it gets here in a couple days) but I didn't see anything wrong with it. When I was watching on my TouchPad I saw the letter box, but it needed to be in order to fit my screen right, but I didn't notice it on my TV...if it was there it wasn't noticeable but I was pretty into the movie. I didn't notice any grainy scenes or backgrounds. Excited to watch HD Blu Ray and the extras once it gets here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the movie very much but the ending was not what I expected.","review":"Was not expecting much when I watched this movie, but found it very entertaining nevertheless.

This was by far my favorite movie of the summer, and ive seen at least 10 movies this summer. The apes looked amazing!! I couldnt tell if they were real or computer animated. I would love to meet the director of this movie bc he did such a great job with everything, the story, plot, setting, everything. Normally i can point out a flaw in every movie i see, but this movie stumped me. I could not take my eyes off the screen ever until the movie was over. GREAT JOB DIRECTOR!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What an excellent surprise","review":"I had no expectations for this movie at all. But wow, I was pleasantly surprised that it actual had a plot and Caesar - the chimpanzee- was a very compelling character and his scenes with his fellow primates made the movie. At the end I wasn't cheering for the humans, but for the animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"No More Zoo Visits!","review":"This is exactly the reason I stopped going to the zoo to stand at the gorilla enclosure and stare at these magnificant animals. The last time I went, about20 years ago, the silver-back glared back at me, then stood up and turned his back to us, sat down and did not move. That was probably Ceasar's daddy! I will forever watch from afar and be grateful I don't live in San Francico's Marin County!! :>)"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"My Main Simian ! \\"","review":"For some reason, I've always been attracted to the \\"Planet of the Apes\\" Series\\" and this one is probably the best. The special effects are outstanding, John Lithgow is touching, and I found myself really rooting for \\"My Main Simian !\\" (Ceasar). Even if you are partial to more mature and \\"artsy\\" films, this one will, without a doubt, provide you with a lot of fun and food for thought. I saw it on opening weekend in mid-afternoon at the local cineplex, and the place was jammed tight. I don't think anyone was disappointed. Oh--and don't dare get up to leave while the end credits are running!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbest Movie Ever","review":"This was the dumbest movie I have seen in a long time. A few key dumb points:1) A virus cannot create a genetic mutation that will take effect during an organism's lifetime.2) Intelligence is a result of lots of evolution. You can't just make a brain 'intelligent' by changing a few things. There are adaptations piled on adaptations, a maze of complexity that cannot be just started with a magic gas.3) Language is not something that chimps are physically capable of... even if they did become smart, no chimp is going to speak, it does not have the evolved throat organs.Overall, this movie was so dumb it hurt. Every single part, from the acting to the story. Just dumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here we go again with the DVD & Digital Copy included that NOBODY WANTS!!","review":"Number 1. Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Great movie.Number 2. I bought an expensive HDTV and a Blu-ray player to watch great movies.Number 3.

But what crazy person would find the need to watch an inferior DVD and/or digital copy of the same movie they have on Blu-ray?Answer is no one. This is another example (like Pixar's The Incredibles) where they try to justify an extra $10 to the price for inferior copies of amovie we obviously only want to watch in HD since we bought the player. What are they thinking? \\"Honey! grab the digital copy of Planet of the Apes for mylaptop!

Even if Caesar said he was home!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"There is some entertainment \\"value\\" in the movie, but for the most part it is/was very predictable. I wish I could give it a higher rating than two stars, but too often into the second half of the movie I kept saying \\"pu-leeze\\" when many of the action scenes were taking place.

After all, I've purchased television episodes and movie rentals from Amazon for years now. Now, of course, I see why it was so cheap: the quality of this movie is terrible. That is, the way Amazon has compressed this movie makes it difficult to watch.The image has thick letterboxing as well as pillarboxing. Horizontal lines and busy backgrounds flicker and pulse.

So, how's this one? Not bad, not bad at all. First off, if you dont like this \\"genre\\" of movies and / or you have not seen them ..... then please spare us all your opinion as it means \\"nothing\\". On a scale of 1-10 for P of A movies I rate this one about an 8. If you actualy watch the movie it has a rather complex plot and there are a couple of key parts that tie it in to the previous movies as well as what I assume will be the next. A little bit much on the CGI but that is a sign of the times. I wont give you any plot details because frankly I think it's rude to give away the plot in a review. You want to know what happens ... watch the movie. I did the $1.99 / 48 hour download and it worked great. I will also be picking up the hard copy to add to my video library. It's a good one folks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I did not expect what I received!!","review":"First, this is a very well crafted movie. In my opinion the movie stands on it's own. Second, the plotnever looses momentum and Ceasar's character is one that nearly everyone can identify with in terms ofwhat happends when humans do not show undertanding and the good side of their humanity. Personally, I like the part where Ceasar goes back to the Redwoods and tells the scientist that \\"he is home\\". The scientist agrees and leaves. This movie will not bore you. It does not drag on. The characters are the right ones to play the characters. In the end of the movie, Ceasar is the one with humanity, not the humans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serkis is the best; the script is pretty good","review":"Andy Serkis can do more acting with eyes than other actors can with their entire bodies. He was the perfect choice to play the enhanced ape Caesar, while Lithgow and Franco play his \\"family\\" members. The action and drama never stop, which is a credit to the screenwriters as well as to the directors; also, the CGI apes are very believable.Just one thing: the apes get to run free at the end, but they don't take over the world. Not even one city.

I figured special effects and whatnot would be pretty good with modern technology, but I wasn't too sure about the story. I decided to wait and rent this first, but in the end, after having watched it, I am glad to say that it really was pretty good. I wouldn't say it was totally epic, but it was pretty enjoyable overall. This is basically the story of how the initial group of apes became smarter and began their rise towards domination. It also goes on to show how mankind would begin descending (because let's face it, a simple pack of apes clearly couldn't take over the world), but there is an element within the movie that inevitably brings that about. I don't want to say too much, because I don't want to ruin it for anyone reading this who hasn't seen it yet. All in all, this movie is totally worth at least a watch, if not a buy. Check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it, it's crap.","review":"This thing is pretty much a piece of garbage. Because it neither cleans fast nor has much power, I would say that this item definitely does not live up to its name.

I've used one example from the book since I purchased it, and that had to be rewritten to the point where it was basically new code. I'd give this book 2 1/2 stars.

However, Anne Gjevang's recital of lieder composed by Alma Mahler, Gustav Mahler, Zemlinsky and Pfitzner is not one of them. This is the worst lieder recital I have ever heard. Gjevang's voice may once have been beautiful but you would not know it from this recording. Her contralto is wobbly, insecure, constricted and harsh. Gustav Mahler composed some of the most inspired and beautiful classical songs yet she manages to make them sound corny and repulsive. If Gustav had been alive and present when she started the recital he surely would have been dead when she finished with him. I don't know why this recording was ever issued. It is utterly unappealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it even on a bit.","review":"This is an awful movie with awful ''special'' effects. I don't know how anyone could like it.

I grew up listening to a lot of it because it's what my parents would play. I bought this for Outside Chance (the best song - and it was used in the Grave Danger episode of CSI so it made me like it even more), and the only other song I thought I knew was Happy Together. I actually realised that I knew a couple of other great songs like Elenore and She'd Rather Be With Me. Then I'm beginning to realise that I actually really like this group and though it's not the type of music I listen to often, it's great to put it in the player every now and then and bop around the house doing the vacuuming or something. It's actually great music. I didn't realise they had so many good songs, but they do and so I recommend this for any 60's fan or people who grew up listening to this kind of music because it will bring back a lot of memories of road trips etc. I like this a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over all a useful refrence","review":"If you aren't a professionally trained mechanic, the Haynes manuals are a life saver.

Tom Douglas shops here, and this book is an incredible description of what makes definitive Seattle cuisine interspersed with wonderful recommendations and reflections of restaurants, stores, and things to do for any food-lover in Seattle. Tom Douglas includes some of his most sought-after recipes from his restauraunts.This book is a delight for anyone interested in Northwest Cuisine (and Oregon Pinot Noir!), Living in Seattle, and some GREAT Food and recipes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This man is a genius","review":"I first experienced Tom's cooking at the Dahlia Lounge about 3 years ago, and I was completely blown away. Visit after visit, meal after meal, his dishes always suprise and amaze me. His imagination with regards to food is incredible. The menu changes constantly and I think it just keeps getting better. But this is a review of his book... All of the recipes that have made all three of his restaurants famous are here. The thing that suprised me is that he is completely open with his \\"trade secrets\\". He's like a magician that can't wait to explain to you how to perform his trick, because he loves the magic that much: he wants everyone to be able to do it. And all the recipes work, too! I've made about 20 different thing from this book, and not one of them hasn't turned out perfectly. His style of writing is very accessable. And for the seattle resident, there is the bonus of a complete list of where to find all the best ingredients. A priceless book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dining and Reading","review":"I first read Tom Douglas' cookbook while dining at his Etta's Restaurant near Pike Place Market.

Now I'm ready to recreate Etta's at home. Fabulous pictures of Seattle and a wonderful read overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Emerald City Defined Through Fabulous Food!","review":"Tom Douglas' Seattle Kitchen is an entertaining trip through the heart and soul of Seattle. Whether you cook or not, this book will provide a glimpse of the elements that make Seattle what it is; trips to the International District, Safeco Field, Pike Place Market and some of the unique shops that provide the fresh ingredients for Tom's recipes. My father in law is obsessed with Tom's creme caramel at Etta's and after finding the recipe in the book pronounced, \\"I may take up cooking.\\" There are loads of helpful tips, too. Skills such as \\"How To Clean A Squid\\" and \\"How To Cook Perfect Roast Beef\\" are explained in an easy to understand format.

(At the end of the book you discover that, apparently, the Freemasons once knew how to transmute gold and other metals into some other element, but lost this knowledge during the Glorious Revolution of 1688! - and to fully understand what he is talking about, you would have to buy one of his other books).Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very valid perspective","review":"As good a read on this topic as you'll find.

Sorry Ben, but you have some work to do in order to catch up with Elliott Smith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Album","review":"This album is fantastic. I'd imagine that as an artist it's hard to make three back-to-back fantastic albums, but BK made it happen. I can't wait for #4."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst album yet","review":"I am extremely disapointed by this album. I have been a BK fan since Sha Sha and have been looking forward to this album for a while, but it really doesn't live up to my expectations.I agree with previous reviews that said that this is mostly ballads and DOESN'T ROCK! What happened to songs like \\"The Rules,\\" \\"Ann Disaster,\\" \\"No Reason,\\" and \\"Harriet's Got a Song\\"??The songwriting is also a lot less creative. Creative songs like \\"Hospital Bed\\" and \\"Different But The Same\\" are nowhere to be found on this album (with the semi-exception of \\"Red Eye\\"--which is a highlight on the album). Instead, I have to listen to poppy ballads with conventional songwriting.Also, if you have ever searched LimeWire for Ben Kweller, you probably know the songs \\"I Gotta Move,\\" \\"I Don't Know Why,\\" and probably a few more from previous releases and live recordings of his. In my opinion, these songs are a weak cop-out he used to fill a full 11 tracks.Come on Ben, I know you can do better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kweller is Growing Up...","review":"First off i liked \\"On My Way\\" alot. I thought there where alot of stand up tracks, but also some crap. Whereas this album doesnt have the songs that blow your hair back the first time you hear them (except maybe \\"Run\\") it has songs that reward you listen after listen. I find it to be alot better than \\"On My Way\\", because it cuts the fat and is filled with alot of gems, i dont know why Ben would release \\"Sundress\\" as his single there are alot of contenders. Some of my fave tracks are \\"run\\" \\"i gotta move\\" \\"thirteen\\" \\"penny on the train tracks\\" \\"i dont know why\\" \\"until i die\\" \\"magic\\" and \\"this is war\\".So basically this album is the sound of Ben Kweller growing up, i am excited to hear what comes from him in the future, this is a really great album!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dud...his worst outing so far","review":"Having heard all 3 Kweller releases now, I was hopeful that he'd take the crunchy power pop on ON MY WAY and further refine his songwriting style by toning down some of the willful goofiness while still linking it to solid melodies. In other words, somewhat of a power-pop Barenaked Ladies. His debut SHA SHA was a little too askew lyrically and too flailing musically but it appeared with ON MY WAY he was starting to move toward his own sound musically.On this one, there's not a lot of high energy material. It's weighted down with bland ballads that don't really inspire me. Outside of \\"Run\\" and \\"I Gotta Move\\", there's nothing that grabs my interest here. And as others have commented it's obvious they were going for a \\"hit\\" sound here as everything is \\"slicked up\\". If this direction continues, the next Kweller release won't be something I'll bother to seek out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also Disappointed.","review":"I wont go into how much I love his previous albums, but let me say that I was EXTREMELY disappointed with this cd.

However, by constantly reiterating \\"I am black...\\" it takes all of the value out of the extraordinary descriptions of the beauty of being yourself. The author attempts to bring us back to the days of the \\"One Drop Rule\\" by ignoring the obvious mixed ancestries of the children and claiming them all as \\"Black\\", thereby reinforcing the division of white vs. black. I was horrified when this book was sent home with my son from pre-school and you can find a book with a much better way of promoting self love and equality."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a beautiful book!","review":"I LOVE this book.

I wanted to give them something that will teach them that no matter how light, dark or in-between they may be, they are ALL beautiful. Not only to me, but to each other. This book is so beautifully laid out and encompasses all the wonderful shades and hues we come in. The authors are to be commended for including EVERYBODY's color. While books celebrating our beautiful brown babies are to be commended, are our lighter-skinned ones to be forgotten? I don't think so, and obviously, neither did these authors. Thank you so much!

She's a Star is a song Barry wrote about his time touring with Bette Midler and it says it all. NYC Rhythm makes you want to dance aroung the room. Lay Me Down breaks your heart.

He demonstrates that it is, in fact, possible to perform heavy-sounding, trumpets/timpani works such as BWV 172 with a four persons choir.You might find yourself considering the one voice per part approach favorable in that the every detail of Bach's works are distinguishable and not muddled by over-sized choirs; as if all of Bach's intentions are finally coming to our ears.The soloists are of top quality and the singers blend with each other superbly. The choruses, in no way, sound undersized and indeed have the majestic effect of a larger chorus. Joshua Rifkin's interpretation of these three cantatas are fresh. This recording is amazing, beyond words.The opening and closing chorus for BWV 172, \\"Erschallet, Ihr Lieder,\\" is one of the most thrilling Bach recordings I have heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPECTRUM Children's Book Club Recommendation","review":"Reading Level: Ages 4-8Mary's little porker was a real ham - an actor that is - and you can't keep someone with that much talent down on the farm.I took a stack of picture books to a restaraunt one noon so I could catch up with my review back log.

I believe this book to be beneficial. Obviously, the author doesn't go in depth as to the whys one must do this or that, or what exactly influenced this opinion in the Hanafi school of thought, but it's very useful if you want to put yourself into action.The book is rather short and straight to the point, but it's of a good quality. As previously mentioned, it may miss some in depth consistency, but it does not fail to accomplish its own mission statement: to increase the knowledge of a Muslim following the Hanafi fiqh, and to apply it in his own lifestyle in a short amount of time.Definitely recommend.

I wanted to hear and compare the types of music being discussed, to clearly understand the distinction between fugue and canon, counterpoint and the newfangled 'sensory' music of the Enlightenment! I suppose just my admission that this book made me want to keep learning about music and history means maybe I should have given it five stars?? All in all, a very enjoyable read. It's going to be the book of the month for our community book club as well, so we'll see how it's received there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant, But....","review":"I have read most of the material out there from musical studies and analysis to books intended for general reading by the public on the subject of Haydn, Mozart & Christian Bach. The reason being, to try and get an overview on the subject from different perspectives and cross analysis. This book does not offer much new information in that regard on the historical background leading up to the Classical Period, either politically or musically.However....To say that \\"most\\" of Mozart's music is missing something compared to Bach's (is it 51% or 99% that is involved in this statement) is quite daring. What would have been even more daring is telling us exactly what Mozart was missing in his music. Maybe our learned author will tell us in his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"in search of a point","review":"Just finished the book, and I can't help feeling that its lacking a point. The are some good anecdotes, but nothing one wouldn't get from a more focused biography.In discussing canons the writer apologizes for boring the reader over the tedium of an esoteric musical form. Seriously? Anyone interested in Bach enough to read a biography, in this day and time, most likely is already aware of the form of canons, probably likes listening to them, and would be interested looking under the hood.If a writer wants to keep it light for a modern audience, then early 18th century Germany may not be the best place to start. That said, there's not a lot of material left to us about Bach, so a rehashing of the old favorites is still a good time even if it was more appropriately published in a periodical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Reading for All Music Lovers","review":"Simply put: This is one of the great books on music.

Bach saw music as meaningful, reflecting the divine order in everything. Although Frederick also loved music, he was a modern man who saw it as simply pleasing sounds. Two world views collide when Bach, in the evening of his own life, and of the baroque era, visits Frederick's palace. Bach responds to an unkind challenge by composing the Musical Offering, which seems to have gone unappreciated at the time, but today is loved by millions.This book brought me a new appreciation of the period, and inspired me to listen to a lot of Bach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two 18th Century Titans","review":"A delightful, informative book written in a rather breezy, casual (sometimes even a little gossipy) style,this book is always on target in tracing the parallel lives of two magnificent figures from the 18th century:Frederick the Great (the young Prussian king and military genius), and Johann Sebastian Bach (the masterfulgray eminence of Baroque music). The author, James R. Gaines, digs into the quotidian lives of these twomen and offers the reader a feast of detail concerning European politics, kingship, counterpoint, religion,musical syntax, and a host of other issues that influenced the genius of the subjects.I enthusiastically recommend the book to anyone who has an interest in history and the arts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and challenging","review":"Urbane. Witty. Intelligent. Superbly written. If you love great music and the tangled web of history, this is a must read. I have now given it to three friends as a gift. Warning.

Character, Monster, Treasure and Adventuring rules are all contained within these pages. This book, plus pencil, paper and dice are all a player and DM need for an evening of fantasy adventure.

Turn off the lights and light up some candles and just chill out. The ambient jazzy feel of Waltz for Koop took me by suprise as i didn't know what to expect. It's a definite mood creator, great background music and won't go unnoticed amongst friends, especially with the smooth voices of Yukimi Nagano & Cecilia Stalin. The jazzy twist is a bonus and kind of nutty in a unique way!The only downfall for me was that's it's over before you know it. Either way, it's great to own such music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who?","review":"This song boasts three catchy songs that are very pleasant (including the title track and most notably \\"Summer Sun\\"), one or two more that might hold up as strictly background fare, and the rest is abysmal filler that makes the album a strong argument for file-swapping. I suppose this band is trying to be experimental but for what they are trying to execute, I must highly recommend the solo albums of Towa Tei rather than \\"Waltz for Koop\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Koop a chance ...","review":"On first listen: Wallpaper retro jazz, no edge, no darkness, no drama. On second listen: Hey, there's some deceptive texture and depth here for music so indebted to MOR Creed Taylor/CTI jazz. On third listen: Hmmm, this is really rather fine indeed; real music played by flesh-and-blood musicians makes such a refreshing change from the canned sounds of Rykosopp, Lemon Jelly and the Cafe del Mar crowd. On fortieth listen: The inevitable burn-out is looming fast, but it's been a lovely ride. I plan to investigate the remix album next ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"JAZZY!!","review":"the first time you should listen to this cd it should be on the afternoon...with a low light not directed to your eyes in the most confortable corner of your house...songs filled with misterious voices...heartbeats...terry callier...ohhhh what a great album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxin' at Monte Carlo","review":"Yes, it's really possible, to capture the feeling of 60's jazz with a Latin flavor for these troubled times.'Summer Sun' took me on a trip to the beach, it reminded me of black and white pictures of Jean Paul Belmondo and Brigit Bardot, even 'Love Boat' came into mind! The song, beautifully sung by the fifteen year old (!)Yukimi Nagano, swings - highly orchestrated - into your very living-room with speed and lightning, makes you wanna dance on the spot!'Tonight' sung by Mikael Sundin is straight Chet Baker...I really can't think of any other name. Beautiful and very laid-back. Then there's 'Soul for Sahib' with a long flute solo; sharp and straight, it somehow reminded me of Lee Morgans' 'Sidewinder' on Blue Note from the sixties. Well, there's even more treasure to find...so I highly recommend you to buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I love cd. It's a little short, and some of the songs end abruptly. Cut #8 is ok, but a little weak compared to the others. Cut #4 is the best. It is fun, light and airy. You will hit the repeat button again and again. Don't be fooled by the CD cover. There is nothing wierd of off the wall about the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like finding gold","review":"I found Koop on epitonic.com while I was just searching through for something new to listen to. I downloaded \\"Summer Sun\\" and \\"Baby\\" and loved them. I played them over and over and finally had to go top the record store to get it!!!I love this cd. I play it every day. Its relaxing, inspiring, light, uplifting, chilled, and exciting all at the same time. I don't know how they do it all at once! The lyricists are wonderful, and the instrumentals and so smooth. I don't typically like jazz, but I can't help but love this!!! Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Step Into A Dream","review":"I bought this CD on a whim -- and boy, am I glad I did! The DVD video for \\"Summer Sun\\" is pure bliss. For the duration of the song, you feel as if you're on the best vacation of your life -- sunshine, smiles, happiness, and you're deeply in love. It's amazing how pure and beautiful and jazzy the song is, and the mountains and beaches and geometric shapes that that dance across the screen are mesmerizing. Everyone I've shown it to sits for a couple of seconds after it ends, and then says, \\"I need to see that again.\\" I'm going to keep this DVD on hand for emergency attitude adjustments.

This record has nothing to do with Miles Davis. The other names mentioned are somewhat more relevant. If you're into either of those people, Kruder & Dorfmeister, say, then chances are that you will like this album.Koop basically took *very* lush jazz samples and put dance music on top. They have a few musicians which play bass and bongos plus a set of singers, and the resulting music is a very relaxed downtempo affair. For those moments in life when you just feel like chillin out. The whole album gets a tiny little bit boring at the end but there are a few real gems on it. What's more, those gems are not overextended to last for seven or eight minutes - means they don't get boring as do too many other downtempo songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smoooooth!","review":"This is soooo smooth, so luxurious, sooo...aaaaah!I love it.I first heard tracks from this CD on last FM online and loved it ever since.I listen to this type of music after work, in solitude, with a nice drink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, amazing","review":"I have never heard a Koop song that I don't like.

The timeline from the disco era to the present presents the exotic and arresting life of the first gay attorney general in Massachusetts. Matthew Schipani is a gay man's dream...sexy, intelligent, compassionate, and full of passion! The tales of his love life are only rivaled by the tales of his professional life.The protagonist, as with every great novel, is one that evolves throughout the story, but his evil and downright fear that the author instill in you as you read, does not come out until it is too late!If you want to escape to the Berkshires and to Boston in your mind, and read a wonderful life unfolding before you on the pages, pick up Leaves of Red and Gold at your local bookstore or right here online.

Every page contains glaring errors (\\"your\\" instead of \\"you're\\", repeated words, etc.) Truly annoying! The plot held some interest, but the way it was written was totally unsatisfactory in my estimation. Compare this book to \\"The Year of Ice\\" by Brain Malloy or \\"Edinburgh\\" by Alexander Chee or \\"At Swim, Two Boys\\" by Jamie O'Neill or \\"The Man Who Fell In Love With The Moon\\" by Tom Spanbauer -- all of which absorb the reader with style and substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling Reading!","review":"I could not put down Leaves of Red and Gold once I picked it up!

It challenges the young, the foolish, and the conventional with paradox and honesty. Read it as a record of America in the 1920s and as a whimsical continuation of the Iliad. If talk leaves you cold, visit the Louvre, listen to the Berlin Phil, or grumble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is just too short for bad books.","review":"This is either a play made into a book or a book aching to be made into a play. It's nothing but talk, talk, dry-as-desert talk. None of the characters are even close to speaking, acting or being human. Helen comes off as a fembot with no emotion chip installed. Menalaos is 'whipped and the rest of the colorless supporting players are dull as dishwater. Avoid this disaster that somehow was a bestseller back in 1926. People must have been desperate for reading material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiny book","review":"Roberto Burle Marx is the questionably most seminal figure in contemporary landscape design. His use of tropical foliage and vegetation was of such artistry as to redefine the genrae.This amazingly small publication, is actually a fair account of his work. The photographs are mostly b&w; and not that impressive, however the collection of sketches enclosed are brilliant. The book is also blessed with some of his lesser known projects outside of the city.No matter how you look at it this book is a bargain, and an excellent complement to a library on landscape design. Don't however let it be your only insight into the talent of Burle Marx."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathing new life into some great songs!","review":"This is what Bon Jovi should have done with \\"This Left Feels Right\\" (which I still think STINKS- although CDuniverse wouldnt post MY review). Unlike other albums that attempt to do the same type of thing, this album succeeds in revitalizing the greatest of the bands songs. Kip's really breathed new life into these songs, while staying true to the originals. Everyone I know who's heard this album (Winger fan or not) has liked it. Dont listen to reviewers who havent even heard the album, and only judge an artist on their past, listen for yourself, I'm sure you'll be pleasantly surprised as I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it isn't broke, don't fix it.","review":"If you like campfire music, then you'll love this CD. Personally, the music on this CD should have been left in it's orignal state, as in the original version it was recorded in. The one original song that is on this collection leaves alot to be desired. Kip Winger is a very talented songwriter/musician, but after listening to this I think he's been taken over by an \\"alien being\\" that is impersonating him. He received a lot of flack about the final \\"Winger\\" project, \\"Pull\\".

Now I have trouble putting this down. Ranging in everything from short two page stories, to long epistles, the amazing mind of H.C. Anderson unfolds on every page. Many of these stories I've never heard of before, and I never am disappointed. You won't find the happy Disney twist in some of the more popular titles, but I think it enhances the story. It makes the experiences of the vivid characters more relatable. Giving anything a five star rating is not something I do lightly... This book deserves it and then some."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute for the fairy tale completist","review":"Now some of these tales are out there, but all offer some amusement.

Susan Fenimore Cooper's writing is delightful and fascinating to read; the work itself is well worth your time. However, the print-on-demand technology is far from perfect; my pages are full of typos (including the title--it reads \\"Bubal Houbs\\"). Deciphering what Cooper might actually have written is sometimes very difficult due to all of these errors. Mostly, though, it's highly annoying when a perfectly fabulous edited edition is available.So, to all who wish to read Rural Hours (as you well should), be SURE you purchase the excellent edited edition put out by Rochelle Johnson and Daniel Patterson.

I didn't get to see what happened up close, but it was amazing at how massively participated it was as a country's protest toward the war. After reading this book, I felt sorry for Ron Kovic, and apologized to him in my mind for how I treated the Vets. I realized how wrong I was. I loved the book. It was well written for such an in-experianced author, and I would rank him with some of the best authors of this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Better True Vietnam Stories","review":"I became familiar with Ron Kovic while still a Marine. Probably in 71 or 72 after I returned from Vietnam. Luckily I was not wounded. While stationed in Hawaii after returning, I had the occasion to join Vietnam Veterans Against the War. A friend tried in vane to persuade me to join, but I never could quite do it. I had been taught just like thousands of other young recruits that ours was a noble deed. I still believe that. However...after having read this book, I became much more enlightened to what a lot of men experienced after being wounded/and or wounded severely and emotionally. This book is not about a man against America, but in favor of waking some people up to the horrors of war and the terrible losses we all suffer because of war. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book ever","review":"\\"Born on the Fourth of July\\" is one of the best books I have ever read. The book is a true story about Ron Kovic, (who is also the author) a marine in combat in Vietnam who gets shot and is paralyzed from the waist down. The book takes you on a journey through his whole life from his birth to his turn around from marine to someone speaking out against the war. The book is a very emotional book especially for a guy. The book is not for all ages but for a more mature audience. The book helped me realize that war is not the answer to a problem. I highly recommend this book for any mature youth who would like an in depth look at what war will do to someone."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was so good","review":"\\"Born on the Fourth of July,\\" was a book which brought tears to my eyes immediately. It's a very appropriate book to read at a time of war in our country; it gave me a better understanding to what these poor soldiers are facing every day. Ron Kovic told a story of courage, bravery, and sacrifice. Not only did he discuss his own personal experience of the Vietnam War and the effect it had on him, but he deeply described all aspects of the war, from boot camp, to the people he met, to what the actual battles were like. However, it is mainly a story about one mans loss, and how he learns to cope with it every day for his whole life. It deeply affected me because I know there our soldiers out there today going through the same type of experience. It will touch your life as well and allow you to think about it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good.","review":"Had to read it for a class and it was surprisingly good.

The world of the Vietnam era VA hospitals is horrific. Being an Iraq war veteran, this book again makes me realize how fortunate my life is. This should be a must-read for all Americans. I don't think the book is anti-American, but rather pro-veteran, especially pro-wounded combat veteran."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad true story","review":"The story is poignant of this good American youth who went enlisted in the marines to fight in Vietnam in order to coma back as an Hero. Who did not have such glorious dreams ?Alas, he was seriously injured, and returned in a wheelchair deeply traumatized. Injury was double, physical and psychological, as a former Vietnam vet and thus rejected by society.Every holiday, patriotic, July 4, this dual wound bleeds more because this man is born on the Fourth of July (hence the title). How such a man can escape his tornament is well described in this very good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"only damaged items shipping","review":"I bought this pant press because it was so much cheaper than the Corby.

The stories of each of the women give an outside perspective of the other women. As you're reading about one of the women, you get a mental picture of some of the other characters as they are mentioned from her perspective. Then, you get to see another perspective of these women as they are introduced in different chapters. I really liked this book and thought it was very creatively put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mediocre Story about Shallow People.","review":"I read this book with a group of both men and women, and we were all rather disappointed - some by the uniformity of the writing style even when the narrator changed, others with the underdeveloped characterization and utter disregard of the protagonists for their children, still others for the lack of cultural insight revealed within the story. Personally, I liked it; but it was frustrating because, while the book was easy to read, the author's point was never quite clear. I think I was supposed to sympathize for women living in an ultra-conservative, male-dominated society, but the thread I mainly noticed was that selfish people are never happy. Perhaps the arid, Middle-Eastern setting supplied an accidental allegory, reminding the reader that without love, any country can be a desert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Went Nowhere...","review":"I thought this book was going to give me insight into a Middle Eastern culture I knew nothing about, but instead it was a bunch of essentially short stories that seemed to go nowhere.

Simple, secure, one hand operation. If there is a better EDC knife I have not found it yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Knife","review":"I got this knife for everyday carry and it has been great so far. The handle is ergonomically well thought out and the sculpted aluminum handles are very comfortable. I find the knife itself the perfect length for keeping it in the pocket and it is much slimmer than comparably-sized Benchmades. Fit and finish is outstanding but time will tell how the satin finish wears.A word of advice - there is not much difference between a wobbly lockup and overly tight lockup on the screw that holds the blade in. Some people have found that blue LocTite or Teflon tape applied to the screw helps it stay in place. Mine was a little on the loose side when I got it but I fixed it up with LocTite and now lockup is both solid and fast. This is apparently a pretty common issue and it probably has something to do with the outrageously precise tolerances to which Benchmade machines its products but I love this knife too much to give it less than five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"best all around knife out there.","review":"Best all around knife out there.

From the coal region originally, I got homesick for the talk on front porches, at block parties, and around the bar \\"upda Legion.\\" Besides the genuine coaltown dialogue, the book also captures the ambivalence of people like me who had to move on from the region to go where the work was. The story \\"Black Dirt\\" is the best example of these mixed feelings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After reading the reviews here I went out and bought this book.

It spent half the book setting up the \\"bad guys\\" mission (which is what I expected), but when it came to the rebuttal from the US of A, it was as if Robinson decided that to do it right would make for too long a book, so he hurried through it. What happened to the French President? Did the ships docked along the French Riveria ever get blown up?Did King Nasir go after the French Special Services for trying to assasinate his buddy? General Rashood played second to a new character - so I suppose the saga of him and Shakira is still to follow. Operation Tanker was a total \\"shoot and run\\" . There is normally more action taken by Morgan and the USA. To blow up France's tankers and escort was a good starting point, but come on, Patrick, you can finished much, much better than this!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total bust and totally forgettable","review":"If you are after an exciting sub novel, grab an earlier Robinson. After his first three, he should have stopped writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent story marred by errors","review":"After having thoroughly enjoyed Nimitz Class several years ago I anticipated enjoying this novel. The story line is decent, but the book is marred by myriad technical errors; a Browning Hi-Power revolver, AK47 bullets (7.62x39mm) that won't penetrate a wooden table top, supposedly highly trained Mossad assasins who walk into a crowded restaurant and attempt an execution by wildly spraying the entire restaurant with AK's, etc., etc. Overall, a disappointing novel. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up after 3-4 chapters","review":"Simply not interesting enough to continue after first few chapters. Too many Arab names with no personality, too much background of characters without building interest in them, I love political thrillers, but this was not thrilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Unfactual!","review":"Starting with numerous basic grammatical errors coupled with numerous factual errors, Patrick Robinson knows nothing about what he writes. Yamaha does not manufacture diesel outboard engines, AK47's can not be silenced ( only surpressed) and Navies of the world do not throw away Zodiac boats like McDonald's food wrappers. His previous works always had some sort of Naval consultation. This one has none and a premise that surely is from the mind of a lunatic. If Patrick Robinson believes that the US does not know the location of any French nuclear submarine at any moment, than he surely has no idea of naval capabilities. If he also believes that an operation that destroys the Saudi oil supplies and brings a huge environmental impact to the Gulf would not be found out in some manner, than he believes in the 'Fairies' and since he lives in Ireland, leprechaun's also.I threw this book down in disgust after page 177 and stopped reading, it was that awful. -Dick"},{"rating":"1","title":"A hard to believe plot","review":"Just completed listening to the abridged audiobook of Hunter Killer (by Patrick Robinson). Set in the current world, the plot is, unfortunately, not very believeable. It is a bit hard to get into a story where a Saudi prince secretly cuts a deal with the government of France to overthrow the king in return for exclusive rights to sell their oil on the world market. In the book, the French just say, Sure, let's do it. Add a couple of French subs and poof, you have an overthrow.Sorry, this ain't no Clancy novel in quality or story. It was short (5 CDs) and interesting when you ignore the main plotline. Not up to Robinson's usual standard for story quality. I'd pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"right wing fantasy","review":"Like Tom Clancy and Robert Ludlum, these authors seems to lose steam after a while. I suppose it's hard to keep pulling a rabbit out of your hat all the time, but Patrick Robinson is definitely on the downward slide of his talent slope.Since HMS Unseen, which was great, Robinson has gone to heavy-handed attempts to forcefeed us right wing propaganda and his stories suffer for it. The Democrats are portrayed as weak, stupid, and the source of all the world's problems and with no redeeming qualities. If he spent less time on politics and more time on character development, this could have been a better product. Instead the effort comes off forced and clumsy.If you worship the holy trinity of Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, and Rush Limbaugh, this is the book for you. If you like thrillers with a little more subtlety and believability, spend your money on Nelson DeMille or Brian Haig."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"Robinson knows a little about subs; his knowldge stops there! He completely misunderstands the culture of Saudi Arabia; knows nothing about the economics of petroleum; and is clueless about the operations of international diplomacy. His central premise, that the economy of Saudi Arabia could be seriously harmed by disruption of the flow of oil does not take into consideration Saudi dollar, sterling and Euro reserves; the rolls that would be played by banks and oil companies in recovery from any problem and the unity of the Saudi psyche.This is a stupid and worthless book best avoided!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"The book seems written on auto-pilot.

Moore is a bore; I don't care for how the author presents a President who very willingly turns over total control of the covert op to Adm Moore, an unofficial advisor, who seems to become the de facto President; even the Joint Chiefs are to defer to this man. Another peeve is the frequent use of \\"Nossir!\\" and \\"Yessir!\\" Also, the French are portrayed just too stereotypically. AMereican cruise missles never work perfectly, striking ships but never killing crew members (unless they are French). The ending was unsatisfying; it seemed to end too quickly and too neatly...and in my opinion very unrealistically... I've read his earlier books and found them much more rewardinig reads... Although some of the action sequences and the planning leading up to them are interesting, overall, I would not put this on my \\"read a second time\\" list and do not give it much of a recommendation for a first read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of political drivel","review":"I am so sick of the political undercurrents in Patrick Robinson's books that I have stopped reading them. Though the stories are good, Robinson diminishes them by labeling and pigeonholing and demeaning anybody he does not agree with politically - especially Democrats.

All the exercises are simple grammar substitution drills. The book attempts to cover too many forms in too few lessons. There are no explanations of grammar and no exploration opportunities to make such an inductive approach useful. Furthermore, I found the characters represented in the book to smack of stereotyping to the very point of racism. Do your students a favor and DO NOT adopt this book. If you must adopt it, make sure it's for the highschool audience it was written for and not for adult learners. I was forced to teach this book to adult learners for 5 years and even the very semi-literate beginners were not naive to the condescension involved in such a choice.

Take a little bit of Hendrix, Prince, Steely Dan, Sly, and a random 80's band---that might get you a taste of Van Hunt. I loved his first CD and I love this one even more. It's important to note that there is not a single musical theme on this CD so if you can't stand a little of rock, a little bit of funk, and a little bit of soul, you'll end up irked. My favorites for Neo-Soul: Priest or Police, FUNK: Hot Stage Lights, ROCK: Ride, Ride, Ride.For some odd reason, my absolute favorite is the The End of a Slow Dance...perhaps its my nostalgia for the 80's.

Some of my favorites are \\"Hole In My Heart\\", \\"Suspicion (She Knows Me Too Well)\\", \\"Character\\", \\"Being A Girl\\", \\"Hot Stage Lights\\", \\"The Thrill Of This Love\\" and \\"Mean Sleep\\".I know this review isn't very long but that's cause I sadly don't have the time to go on and on about my favorite Van Hunt album.

Damn nice.","review":"A couple of duds don't mar one of the most creatively diverse albums by a black songwriter since Mr. Purple Pants drove his motorcycle into the sunset; the good songs on this album are quite nice indeed. I mean, \\"After the Slow Dance\\"? It's the best General Public song they never wrote. And \\"If I take You Home\\" sounds like the best Isley / Dap Band collab ever dreamed up. This album does not have the organic feel to the first, and there are some terrible R&B duds already mentioned in other reviews, but I find myself going back to about seven of these tracks over and over. With 10,000 songs in my itunes library, I can tell you that that ain't common. Worth the price. Bound to turn on more folks than it turns off. Not a masterpiece, but lays the groundwork for a brilliant career."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I give Van two stars for effort and artistry. I was expecting a total heater after his first CD. I am hugely disappointed. Once again, I respect him as an artist and appreciate that he is unconventional in style, but it seems that he's flipped the script. To me, the worst thing you can do is change from the artist you were when you were building a fan base. I'm not sure what he was trying to accomplish with this work, but it did not go over well with me. Is this a crossover?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Just GOOD Music","review":"Plain and Simple.On par with his first album, Van Hunt expands his sound and puts his playful funky rocker side on display with phenomenal results.

It's a great addition to any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"These old songs sure bring back old times!","review":"I have to agree with the previous review. I was also two years old when this album first came out, and \\"The Old Songs\\" has to be the first ever Barry Manilow song I ever heard on the radio at that time. Even as of today I still get goosebumps or all choked up when I hear that song because it's absolutely timeless.This album has lots of touching, yet heartfelt tracks on this album that just move me to tears when I listen to it.

(Although I'm not used to hearing \\"hooves\\" rhyming with \\"moves\\".)-It's a matter of taste, but talking animals (or babies, for that matter) have no appeal whatsoever for me. Ugh! And if they did talk, no horse that I've ever ridden would have said, \\"Are you all right?\\" when I fell off. I believe they'd say, \\"Aaaaaaaaah...at last. Hey, there's some grass!\\"-Being a woman of a certain age, I liked the Sister character, (although I don't believe she still had her figure at 72).

If this is a sample of the quality of editing I will steer clear of the others. Although I found the author's voice unappealing, even worse was the swallowing sounds she made when reading her novel. The editing was so poorly done that you could hear pages being turned. When she made a mistake in her reading she began the sentence over again and the mistake was not edited out. Either this was a very low budget project or quality control forgot to check this one.I have enjoyed her books in the past but next time I'll check to see who is reading it before I pluck it from the shelf.As noted in the other reviews, the book jacket's description is not actually what happened in the book.

The other two foxhunting books, while a bit too much boilerplate about the sport, were readable. But this is over the top. Too much about foxhunting. Too much frothy talk amongst the silly hunt crowd. No mystery, but one: how did the book description on the cover get into print? Or onto the Amazon site? It bears no relationship to the book, which one can often find true of cover art. I have sometimes found minor errors in book descriptions on the inside cover, but never anything like this. Here's a mystery I would like to see solved. How did this happen?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her usual snuff","review":"I didn't feel this book was up to the usual quality of Hotspur and Outfoxed. As someone else noted, it was just chit chat...nothing exciting and it took too long to get to the story which barely lasted one chapter. Also, the rodeo antics of Sister Jane at the end were a little unbelievable. I mean come on now...standing in her saddle and jumping onto another horse? I was disappointed in the book. A better read if you haven't read it yet, is Shotgun. I've read that one many times and still enjoy it. In fact, I would like a sequel to see how Pryor is doing. She was an interesting character and I really liked her. So, Rita...how 'bout it? Can we hear more about Pryor?"},{"rating":"1","title":"only for foxers","review":"First I have to admit to a Rita Mae Brown bias; I love her work. However, this is just not up to par. The story, not really a mystery, barely a novel, goes off on far too many side excursions with fox hunt stories, hunt clothes, brand names to buy, hoof care for horses, etc. etc. A real yawn if you aren't a \\"Master\\" of the hunt.As usual, Brown manages to work in a few things to annoy everyone (a fact that usually has me chuckling); i.e., animals are superior to people, biracial sexual encounters between senior citizens, her characters opinions on some people just being 'born bad'etc.)Her editor was asleep a the wheel this time. With about 100 less pages this could have been a good book, As is, Brown's fans will be disappointed. Best advice: If you (like me) MUST read anything she writes, borrow it - don't buy. Save your money for saddle soap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full Cry //Audio (I almost did)","review":"I have always enjoyed Rita Mae Brown's work. That being said, and yes, this story line does wear abit thin, but the worst, unforgivable sin is that she read the story herself. It was awful. Several times she will start a sentence, only to stop and restart after a few words. There was no feeling of character in her voice. Yoy can hear her swallow and clear her throat, so I guess it's the production values that are the biggest offender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let authors narrate their own work!","review":"SLOPPY recording; I'm surprised, as Recorded Books usually does a good job. Brown is a bad choice to read her own book; her voice cracks and wavers like a 13 year-old pre-pubescent boy, she has some annoying pronounciations ('conner' for 'corner'), she stresses the wrong words in a sentence, and on at least 3 occasions, she repeats a sentence to correct her reading ('enveloped by a veal (pause) enveloped by a veil' being the most glaring example), which Recorded Books should have corrected in post-production. Perhaps the worst 'professional' reading I've yet heard. Story itself is so-so, but the recording flat out stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gads, what an eye glazer!!","review":"The first two books in this series (Outfoxed and Hotspur) were great--I couldn't put them down! And God knows I've stayed up way past my bedtime on a work night so I could finish a Mrs. Murphy story. But this one?! Slow cannot begin to describe it! What a big disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystery or misery?","review":"I found this book to be rather dull although I did learn a lot about fox hunting. The description was fabulous but I don't think that it was much of a mystery. I kept reading but I also kept wondering when something was actually going to happen. I did love the character of \\"Sister\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book-despite misleading jacket blurb","review":"Maybe you have to be not only a mystery lover but a horse person as well, but I LOVE her books. Despite the totally misleading jacket blurb (Sam Lorillard not only doesn't die, he's not a harvard grad and Sister does not make her announcements at the New Years hunt, nor does the story have anything to do with another hunts practices-what is up with this? The publisher went with details from a much revised first draft???), Brown's stories based on the fictional Jefferson Hunt are engaging, fun and full of very likeable and believable characters. I hope this isn't her last in this series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Whole Story--Complete and Concise","review":"I was young while the vietnam war was taking place. I've always wanted to learn more about it. This book tells precisely everything that went on very concisely. It also tells what went on in America during that time and you're able to get the whole picture. I wish that I would have read this a long time ago and I now know what other areas to look into for future reference. My family and I went to view \\"The Moving Wall\\" (Vietnam Memorial Duplicate) and I was fortunate and very honored to be able to discuss some situations with Vietnam Vets that were there. It was a great experience and those that I spoke with were impressed with what I knew!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Outstanding First Novel","review":"Guy Jones has crafted a superb military suspense novel featuring a strong yet convincing female lead interwoven with engaging subplots and surprising twists. The cast of characters is so realistic and well drawn that they elicit a wide range of emotions from the reader. A fast-paced conspiracy teamed with a few detestable villains creates a roller coaster ride of prevarication, betrayal and hypocrisy. Comfortably Numb is an intriguing, captivating novel that is impossible to put down. It is an extraordinary mix of suspense, humor, anticipation and fear. This story was spun for the movies. I didn't want it to ever end."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will love it!","review":"Comfortably Numb is a great story with really interesting characters. Once the story hooks you, you will not be able to put it down and you will wish the sequel was available to continue the story. The plot is very timely for our world situation today....a bit unsettling but definitely not outside realistic possibilities.

Ya gotta read this~~","review":"At the age of 63 I indeed was wondering if there might not be more I could learn. This book taught me things I had never heard, like the fact that sexual pleasure for a man over 50 is governed by \\"circulation, circulation, circulation\\"!! That there are specific simple and effective exercises that aide in this most important aspect of love making over the age of 50. Well worth the read, information that should be shared widely as we \\"boomers\\" head into the senior stage of life. The fun doesn't have to stop, in fact it could very well be the best times of our lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"Great book for seniors; better than pills, and message most positive. The writer gives specific examples and advice on how to create a loving, supportive relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!","review":"I am lucky in that we haven't yet experienced any problems that she discusses in the book. It is nice to be prepared if and when things begin to change. I am not in my 50's yet but my man is and I want this part of our relationship to continue to be good and this book tells you how. The book is mostly written to help the man but also talks about the needs of a women. The book talks about the physiological things that we should think about as we grow older. I would recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Steeleye lost their way.","review":"If you are looking for good Steeleye stuff, as songs available on the \\"Below the Salt\\" , \\"Hark! the Village wait.\\" or \\"Please to see the King\\" albums, forget this one. They have lost their way between folkish and experimentalisms that give the listener the impression that they had two or three good ideas but had to extend songs to fill the 30 minutes minimum LP time. You should buy this one only if you are, like me, a collector.

It's too light, too hard to handle full tanks, and certainly not for use outdoors. The tires are too light, too large and thin, like bicycle tires. The tray that comes with it is a joke, it falls off all the time. It's sitting in the garage unused, I don't know what I was thinking when I bought this. I will be buying a heavy duty one for outdoor use."},{"rating":"2","title":"A creepily satisfying read","review":"People who have enjoyed Mantel's more gentle, humane novels like Experiment in Love or Change Of Climate might be surprised by the black comedy of this one. But I became weirdly fascinated in the characters, the occasionally chilling plot, the astringent prose and the biting humor from the outset. Immediately after I finished this book, I plunged into its sequel, Vacant Posession. But I don't recommend reading them when you're home alone at night. Mantel's decription of madness is so convincing, I briefly feared for my own sanity for a minute or two while reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book","review":"Hilary Mantel has done amazing writing in this novel. She catches the reader up in the lives of her characters. You can't help but have emotions when reading her novels"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"This is not the worst book I've ever read, but it is very close! It had potential to be a good read, but lacked in many key areas. The characters were fairly interesting and decently developed individually, but the outcome of all their interaction was not develped nearly enough. The entanglment of the characters had good plot potential, but ended up being VERY anticlimactic. I felt like the book was unfinished and probably needed at least another hundred pages or so to round out the characters and their situations. It even felt as if it was published exactly as the first draft was written, without any content editing, rewriting or further plot development. Every Day is Mother's Day is a book that had promise, but fell quite short of it's potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"MARCIA MULLER AUDIOBOOK","review":"The Book is great. The quality of the audiotapes (old, from some library collection) was not. Unfortunately most of her old books were not recorded digitally that I can find. However, the Sharon McCone series is really great. One of the first of the women PI series. I recommend you start as early in the series as you can, although all of her books can stand alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most enjoyable CDs I have ever heard.","review":"I heard Natania for the first time on a CD collection of various composers sent by a CD club. Netania sang the \\"Bailero\\", which is on the first CD in this set. I was captivated by Netania's pleasant voice and intriquing music. I could listen to her for hours, which I have done since receiving the 2-CD album from Amazon.com. The CD plays in my PC anytime I am the computer and online. In addtion, the music is invigorating, pleasant and jovial.I normally prefer instrumentals recordings, but Netania has found a top place in my collection. I will see what else she has recorded, and no doubt order whatever she has recorded. What a voice!For a wonderful change of pace and pleasant listening, listen to Netania and Songs of the Auvergne."},{"rating":"2","title":"How r u feeling today","review":"The poster serves as a great reminder of the many different moods we experience on a daily basis.I also use it as a tool to address these moods whenever they appear and try to keep them in check."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I ordered this product for my counseling practice.

Plain and simple, this thing works!My girlfriend and I started using this product 6 weeks ago. After about 2 weeks of use my skin (not hers) became much worse and similar to what others have noted in past reviews. However, we continued to use the light and after about 4 weeks of daily use everything cleared up to a condition which is better than one could imagine. Pretty much perfect for both of us.My theory, the light has to pull out the bad stuff before you can see the good. If you have any reservations about this product, dont. We were at first hesitant to try, but the money-back guarantee made that decision easier. Well worth the sub-$200 price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk to your doctor","review":"I made the mistake of buying this light to treat my acne without first talking to my dermatologist about it. After just using it three times my acne became more out of control than it had in years--my face broke out in places it had never broken out before.

This album is not very good. The first three songs are good, especially \\"Electric Mainline.\\" The rest is an uninspired reading of the ...Ladies and Gents... album, and an overproduced one at that. With the exception of adding an orchestra on almost every song (READ: not very interesting), these songs sound exactly the same as the original studio versions. It doesn't even sound like a live album. Jason Pierce is usually meticulous; it would have helped to think LONG and HARD before unloading this on the public."},{"rating":"2","title":"-)+**","review":"i once declared after a spiritualized show that i no longer believed in the written word. i wanted the whole of life to be sensations from heaven, and nothing to be planted firmly on paper again. it took about three months to get over that, but the memory is still strong... this disc captures part of that for me, especially since i won't see a show like that again for a long time. take that by itself or with a grain of salt.to you and yours, j spaceman... let it flow haha!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly dangerous","review":"Like a strong acid trip.

If you can do this, this album will take you to amazing places that you have probably never seen (or heard) before. If you can't this album will likely rip your head off and hand it to you on a platter.You have to ride this album, and let it drive. If you try to steer you will be left scrambling for a stop button before Shine A Light.That said, this is one of the reasons headphones were invented. Throw on a pair, and just lie down on your bed listening to the sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mine got stolen...","review":"a must own if you ever spent hours (okay, years) of your life with the sounds of Spacemen 3 washing over you while indulging in things you probably shouldn't.

There are songs from Jason's first two, incomparable studio albums as Spiritualized (Lazer Guided Melodies and Pure Phase), but the majority are from Ladies and gentlemen... I miss this stuff Jason!

The examples are way too personal and you will see that for most of the advice,there often are common exceptions and departures that should be included in the book. There are a few good solid tips, but it gets lost in the examples. The reader raises more doubt as the reading feels a little bit opinionated than based on factual.Perhaps it is because I feel this book isn't tailored to the profession I am looking for, but it just seems inappropriate at times.

TEAC no longer markets the AG-D9100, or anything closely resembling it (sadly), and so I settled on the HK3485 as an alternative. Comparing the two (a totally subjective, unscientific exercise on my part to be sure), I find the clarity and definition of the HK to be a bit better than the TEAC, but the low-end power not quite as booming as the TEAC (surprising, given some of the reviews I had read).

The movie does has a couple of laugh out loud moments. That is about where the positives end. What is odd is that this is a raunchy comedy that is actually trying to be a message movie. We have 3 troubles kids, Jonah and a female friend. For some reason the writer decided that by the end of the movie the main character needed to solve all of the problems for the 3 kids, his mother, his girlfriend and of course, himself.

I guess it was better than doing nothing, but honestly, not by much. I will admit I chuckled at a few points in the film, but more because it was so absurd and not because it was particularly funny. The writers apparently think that the more f- and s- bombs in the dialog, the funnier the script. Really, it's not. It's more pathetic than anything else. Frankly, the aggressively selfish overweight Jonah Hill swearing, threatening and criticizing a 13-year old and two younger kids, stealing the family car, stealing checks at a bat mitzvah party, heading into Manhattan in the middle of the night, buying drugs for a girl just so he might get laid (how he was going to manage that with the kids in tow is a mystery), etc. made me cringe much more than anything else.

And I was surprised by it. I thought it was fun and had more funny parts than most critics let on. Of course, this is a very perverse version ofAdventures in Babysitting, and it's not as wholesome as that 1980s classic. But, despite its foul language and very adult situations, \\"The Sitter\\" has more heart than one would think -- with Jonah Hill dealing with the three kids he's been tasked to watch over. If you have a night where you're feeling like laughs, this one may surprise you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sitter","review":"Jonah Hill is currently riding high on his recent Best Support Actor nomination at the Academy Awards and the surprise success of his '80s reboot 21 Jump Street, but if we go back just a few months, we'll find The Sitter. The latest raunchy comedy from David Gordon Green, The Sitter stars Hill as a layabout who reluctantly takes a babysitting gig, only then to be lured to a party by the promise of sex from his girlfriend. A wild evening full of drugs, car theft, robbery, and more ensues, all with three young children in tow. I found little to like about the film, with its recycled plot contrivances, inappropriate humor, and what seems like a phoned-in performance from Hill himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"are you kidding me?","review":"this movie sucked so bad, how did this talentless pig become a star?

There wasn't one original twist. It wasn't for children while being about children. Right from the first scene I kind of hated it and the feeling never left. It's one of those movies that is just a huge waste of time and talent.

I cringe at anyone who gives this 5 stars, which is the highest amount of stars you can give something. Does that mean that this film is one of the greatest of all time? I mean, you gave it the same amount of stars as you would give The Godfather or Duck Soup/Blazing Saddles if you're only looking at comedies.To get back on track, if you like Jonah Hill, you're going to get this anyway.

It was incredibly disappointing, and it made very little sense. I understand it is supposed to be a comedy, but look to The Hangover, or I Love You, Man.

Jonah Hill is one of my favorite comedic actors, and the script just really wasn't that funny.

I thought 21 Jump Street was so funny, I saw it twice in two days. So, thinking I would stay on my Jonah high, I bought this. It's not very funny at all; despite a pretty decent cast; and it failed on almost every level. I only managed to chuckle two or three times, and the majority of the movie was really flat and lame. Other reviewers have compared it to Adventures in Babysitting, and the plot is quite similar but they tried to drive it in a more adult-direction. I had high hopes for this, I think Jonah Hill will eventually become one of our funniest and most celebrated actors ever and I've never seen Sam Rockwell in anything I didn't think was brilliant. Rent it on PPV or netflix if you really want to see it, but save your money and buy 21 Jump Street when it comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had hopes, but the earlier reviews were right, it's not very good","review":"I wanted to like it going in, and while it doesn't do anything wrong exactly, it doesn't do the humor very well, and obviously for a comedy that equals failure. The tender moments where the hapless Sitter teaches the kids how to be better people are actually effective and probably the best parts of the movie. All the other subplots (girlfriend, drug dealer, new potential girlfriend, father, old high school acquaintance with a grudge)seem very false and contrived as does the third, adopted, child - his role is completely a waste, unfunny, probably racist and totally unrealistic. The other two kids were likeable enough behind terrible scripting. I don't blame Jonah Hill, he was reasonably funny, he just didn't have much to work with. I blame the director, and I'd say if you didn't like Pineapple Express, like I didn't, you likely won't enjoy The Sitter either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"My god this film is so bad.

It's rare that I regret spending $3.99 to watch a movie on Amazon but I wish I could ask for my money back for this one. It's just bad. I love Jonah Hill and thought this would be a modern spin on \\"Adventures in Babysitting\\" or even \\"Uncle Buck\\", but it's actually boring most of the time. I think the only really interesting thing about it is that Jonah helps one of the kids he's babysitting figure out and come to terms with the fact that he's gay -- that was a surprise the movie went there, and the way it was handled was well-done and beneficial to the kid. But the rest of the movie feels like it was written over a weekend and the movie was made for $2 million dollars and filmed over the following weekend. I didn't find any of it funny, and I actually felt bad for Jonah Hill because he's usually in much better movies.Avoid this one unless it's ever on here for free with Prime membership."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible waste of time","review":"This movie was just terrible and I really wish I could get my money back for it.

I expected an objective and historic account of Christian martyrs over the centuries. While it starts out that way - maybe that the piece actually written by Foxe - but it quickly devolves into the alleged atrocities committed by the Catholic Church after the initial Christian conversion of Europe. While there is no doubt that the Catholic Church committed its share of atrocities in the name of Jesus and should be rightly condemned, the book ultimately lacks balance. For example, the book covers more than 50 individual \\"persecutions\\" during the reign of the Catholic Queen Mary of England. Yet, there is almost no mention of the martyrdom of the well-known Saint Thomas More at the hands of King Henry VIII. This book is little more than a rant in the name of John Foxe.

His complex, well plotted novels bring vivid characters and appropriately convoluted puzzles for a lover of traditional mystery with a modern twist. \\" Blood on the Tongue\\", his third novel in the series set in Peak District, is up to his high standards. Few seemingly complicated strands get slowly weaved in to give a logical explanation of a tragic story. Mr. Booth manages to pull together numerous topics, the plight of immigrants and the first generation that comes after them, heartbreaking destiny of the World War 2 soldiers and survivors.

This set is value priced (ie. cheaper). For occasional home use (ie. once every 6 months or so), it is ok. If you use screw drivers more frequently than this, I suggest you look else where. First, the grips/handles are not good when applying lots of torque. They are made of smooth plastic and doesn't provide a lot of friction. I often found my hands slipping when applying lots of force. Second, the shafts are round, not rectangular/square, which means when the application is really tough, you cannot use a wrench as auxilliary handle for more torque.

The Casio will definately handle most of the music that she would play.She realizes that this does not compare to her grand piano but she admits that it is an excellent item for the money.The only drawback is that it does not have a dedicated line to hook into an amplifier.

While the CDP100 may lack many bangs & whistles of the more expensive dedicated controllers, the pros entirely outweigh the cons. It is MUCH lighter. It is much cheaper. It feels at least as realistic. It is acoustically quieter than any modern dedicated controller. It still offers 16 midi out channels. As a sound source, very limited. I haven't heard the pianos on larger speakers so it's not fair to comment. The 1/8\\" headphone out jack is the only way to get audio out of the machine. This is a very weak alternative to a 1/4\\" stereo output. To make matters more unreliable, the speakers shut off when this is plugged in. Therefore it's probably a normalled 1/8\\" jack - the most undependable connection imaginable, & I would expect to develop problems with the internal speakers cutting out if the jack is used regularly.

My wife runs mostly from the house and this stroller had been folded less than 10 times.The side latch that broke is inside the frame and cannot be repaired even by the bike store (this was confirmed by customer service). Unfortunately the stroller was six months out of warranty and instep will do nothing to help. I called and the bike store called and the company says no warranty no luck.This part is innacessible to replace and as I said the stroller had been folded so few times I am very very disapointed with the product and this company and will never buy from them again. For such an integral part to fail is a real shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Quality!","review":"When I first recieved the stroller, it seemed to be okay for the price. It was fairly easy to put together. However, when I got the tires inflated, one of the inner tubes was warped, and the other randomly popped while I was walking down a fairly smooth street.

I have close to 100 Christmas albums of all kinds, and this is the second worst of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs sung with love","review":"This is indeed a beautiful album. It opens with the traditional \\"In the Bleak Midwinter\\" and then goes directly into the classic \\"Christmas Time Is Here\\" from \\"A Charlie Brown Christmas\\". Another traditional but seldom heard number is \\"Rocking\\", and then there's the haunting lullaby, \\"All Through The Night\\". \\"Silent Night\\" is the one absolute Christmas standard here. And \\"Close Your Eyes\\", Brahms Lullaby, is heard from time to time on Christmas CDs, though it isn't truly a Christmas song. However, with Shawn's voice, all of these are good.Regretfully, I can't put this album into the same category that I have put CDs by other female vocalists such as Judy Collins, Natalie Cole, Anne Murray, or Julie Andrews. But this is a good folksy type classic record to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lullabies? Holiday Songs? Oh but wait..........","review":"As an ardent fan of Shawn Colvin, I must admit I had my doubts when I first heard her new album would be a Christmas release featuring lullabies. In my opinion many holiday albums tend to be pretensious and lack originality. And lullabies? Not exactly what I was hoping for from my favorite singer/songwriter. However after I listened to the first track I was won over.The beauty of this album is in its simplicity. None of songs sound contrived or overdone, but rather make the most of Shawn's subtle voice and distinctive style. Whether accompanied by a guitar or a brass choir, the arrangments never over power. I was surprised how much I enjoyed listening to this album. Also, like with the Cover Girl album, I discovered some old songs I never knew that have become favorite.It is a very soothing and relaxing album that does not compromise Shawn's body of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to Par!","review":"I just love everything Ms. Colvin has published to date, but this latest issue is a real lightweight compared to the others.

She sings \\"All Through the Night,\\" one of my favorite songs that is not often considered a Christmas song, but my family has often played it at holiday time, \\"Sleep my love & peace attend thee all through the night, guardian angels God will send thee.\\" It's such a gentle lullaby with Colvin's tender reading. \\"Love Came Down at Christmas\\" is another sweet track, \\"Love be yours & love be mine, love to God and all of us.\\" This quiet CD is soothing and gentle, a perfect disc to play while watching the lights twinkle on the Christmas tree. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've tried so hard to like it","review":"About once a year, I get this CD out and try once more. I love Christmas music, lullabies, and Shawn Colvin, but this album just doesn't work for me.I think it's because she doesn't really do anything new or interesting with the music and her voice sounds (IMHO) *too* bare and stripped down--like a 12-year-old girl singing Christmas music to herself. I got bored/frustrated with track after indifferent-sounding track. This one's going to the Goodwill this year.For what it's worth, I have three other Shawn Colvin albums and love songs like \\"Shotgun Down the Avalanche\\" and \\"Round of Blues\\". I just think the girlish lilt and untrained nature of her voice seem to work better with her own compositions."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Christmas CD","review":"This album is the perfect blend of some classic and new songs with a bit of a folksy voice to go with them.

Shawn's voice combined with the hauntingly beautiful lyrics and music instantly places you in a warm and tranquil state of mind. The whole CD is enjoyable from beginning to end but 'In The Bleak Mid-Winter', 'Rocking' and 'Love Came Down At Christmas' are standouts.

It use to be that there were few pictures and lots of writing to accomplish getting the job done but more recently the manuals have gravitated to more pictures and less explanation. This manual falls somewhere in the middle of the two scenarios where they have a fair amount of pictures and a fair amount of description for repairs. That being the case it leaves a lot of room for guessing what really needs to be done in some situations like the process of removing the counter shaft sprocket. Bottom Line: There may be better manuals out there but for the price this will get you most of the way there and you can always take notes as you go through the first time right in the book. If you aren't daring when it comes to tearing things down you probably should pay the extra for a more detailed manual."},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious hilarious hilarious","review":"I highly recommend watching this funny movie...this is by far the funniest movie I have ever seen...this is a great cult classic and when friends come over, we always seem to pop this one in and laugh for hours..Great movie!

If you own an early album by this band (Switched On, Refried Ectoplasm, Transient Random, etc.) and are wondering which one to get next, this is it. If you own later stuff by the band, are wondering what the earlier stuff is like, and don't like too much grit in your pop, this is the one too. Gorgeous drones, lots of repetition, drums and guitars, bilingual lyrics, analog synth washes, this one has it all. Classic Stereolab. Don't wait six years to get this like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beats on drones","review":"This is my favorite 'lab CD. The music consists more of beats over drones in a warm-ish electronica mode. Compared to 'Dots and Loops', which many reviewers name as Stereolab's best CD, 'Mars' is less jazz-laced and more methodical and constant in its rythm.

I'm sure that any residents of the local art school would be interested in trying to answer that one. Finally, I decided to listen to the \\"Stereo Lab\\" CD itself.

Such grammar would not be so bad if it did not confuse the already semantic-laden arguments of the PMI; however, it does, and does so consistently. Finally, I must agree with the set of reviewers that suspect cheating on the part of Crosswind through implantation of glowingly positive reviews.

I started reading the PMP Success Series first and using the PMBOK as a complimentary resource. This combination worked great for me!

Previously it had been updated every 5-10 years. With the advances in technology and what is being taught in the classroom, the vocabulary level of many terms have changed in the past 22 years.

She even remembered the name of the steward who helped her find her way to the boat deck to be rescued. I first knew of her when I attended the Titanic Artifact Exhibit two years ago and was given her \\"passport\\". I had been so curious about her ever since.

The first few songs are just OK but nothing as moving as \\"Imagine\\". Songs 4 through 7 (including \\"Imagine\\") are quite inspiring and memorable. Song 10 is also filled with passion. I grew up in a family of professional musicians and enjoy music of all types - rock, blues, jazz, Broadway Shows, etc. This sounds like great mainstream music - with a spiritual and inspirational message. I have become more interested in Christian music as a result of this CD - and believe you won't be dissapointed if you purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but a goodie","review":"Still wonderful.

I don't care for MercyMe's version of \\"Imagine,\\" despite the fact that they wrote it. They have too much of a country \\"twang\\" for my taste. I think Amy Grant's version of the song is more vocally interesting (versus flat and boring) and her vocal maturity shines....plus she changed some of the lyrics and her touches make all the difference. Check it out on her \\"Legacy Hymns and Faith\\" album."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's the deal?","review":"\\"I Can Only Imagine\\"....yeah, it's uplifting, and it gives some people that \\"feeling\\".

Total, sappy drivel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vietnam War as Seen Through the Prism of John P. Vann","review":"Vietnam was a complex and divisive war, one which has had longlasting effects on American culture. Our longest conflict, it was an epic struggle in which the US tried to prevent the southern half of the country from being unified with the Communist north after the departure of the French in 1954. In doing so we ended up propping up a corrupt south that was badly fractured by ethnic, political and religious rivalries. Through the character of John Paul Vann, who came to Vietnam as an Army advisor in 1962 and was finally shipped home in a coffin after he repulsed a large North Vietnamese force in 1972, Sheehan reveals the tainted struggle over Vietnam that he witnessed as a journalist and as a close friend of the brilliant, brave and fatally compulsive Vann."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read for all","review":"Being in my early thirties, as with most of my peers, I did not learn much about Viet Nam in school. This book sheds \\"a bright shining\\" light on the (mis)information and (un)intelligence that involved the United States in a \\"war\\" we had no business being a part of. This book provides a great deal of history about Viet Nam's struggles against \\"occupiers\\" from ancient China onward and a first-hand view of what was going on in there during the turmoil. There is a LOT of information in this over-700 page book, but it's worth the read and the attention one must pay to all the details.It's also a good example of how out nation's leaders and military officials blindly engaged in war based on ego. It makes one hyper-aware to what's going on in the world now and how history could very well be repeating itself.Om shanti."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bright Shining Lie by Neil Sheehan","review":"A lengthy but involving account of the career of John Paul Vann, a US Army officer and latterly a civilian adviser with the Agency for International Development (AID), who died in a helicopter crash near Kontum, Vietnam in June 1972 (generals Westmoreland and Stilwell both attended his funeral, as did Robert Komer and William Colby of the CIA). Vann attracted attention early on with his outspoken comments about the South Vietnamese military after the battle of Ap Bac in January 1963, the author being one of the journalists who interviewed him on that occasion.Successfully combining biography and history, this in fact goes further and includes a lot of useful background material as well. An impressive achievement, one of the better books about the Vietnam War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Balanced Account of the war","review":"This is an excellently researched book and it is obvious that Mr. Sheehan thoroughly knows his subject. As other reviewers have noted the book ends when J. Vann dies and doesn't delve into the issues surrounding the winding down of the war. But, I don't think that detracts from the quality of the book. The only thing I was dissapointed in was that the writing was at times a little sloppy. This is surprising given the length of time Sheehan spent writing it and his experience as a journalist. I guess ultimately this indicates a weak editing job. But, this shouldn't stop anyone from reading it. What Sheehan does do well is present a balanced view of the issues surrounding the war interwoven with specific details from Vann's past that provide a good flavor for what the war was like."},{"rating":"2","title":"found this book fascinating","review":"This book served as a great introduction to the complex issues facing U.S. forces in Vietnam. After the recent attention to civilian suffering in Iraq, you are staggered to read about the extent of devastation of the Vietnamese population during the war. A fairly long book that breezes by."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Media Spins Viet Nam","review":"Neil Sheehan, was a writer for UPI,and then The New York Times, he was also a self described friend of John Paul Vann. He is of course as fair and unbiased in his treatment of Vann, and the war as all the other reporters. Sheehan did an impressive job with research and facts, especially in screening facts, drawing wrong conclusions, and spinning what was happening. Sheehan was caught-up in conventional wisdom of the war. He also delights in exploring Vann's shortcomings, something everyones friends loves to do. I meet and talked to John Paul Vann in 1969 and 1970, and I doubt that Sheehan spent much time discussing his shortcomings and delusions with him. I also doubt this book would have been published if Vann had not been Killed, and unable to state his opinions. Instead his friend shows how deluded warped and wrong Vann really was, I am not sure he would agree with Sheehan's opinions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent view of both sides of this man - Good, Bad & Ugly","review":"This is without doubt one of my favorite books - particularly the way it shows both sides of the same man. In one half I was highly impressed and somewhat in awe (not something I do easily or often). But in the second half, the author portrays a man who I found I truly disliked. We all have a Good, Bad and an Ugly side to our personalities. In this book we get to see all facets of John Paul Vann, an American hero and villan."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! You can't put this book down.","review":"After reading this book I had a much better understanding of a very confusing war. The best written book I have ever read, the author truly has a gift for combining history with the story of a man's tragic life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very disturbing book!","review":"It's easy to get taken in by the written word. It has some authority just being there. The power of the truth, however, shines through after awhile, and you realize that what you are reading is substantially correct, especially after checking the bibliography. Neil Sheehan appears to have the test of time on his side. And if this is true, if what's described in this book is in fact how it happened, it should be required reading of everyone with any authority to commit American lives to any cause, from the President on down. The enormity of the ego-driven stupidity of a few men, from Harker to Kennedy, from McNamara to Westmoreland, from Johnson to Nixon is enough to make one sick with rage. For those of us who have spent time at the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington DC, reading names and letting the vastness of it engulf us, the realization of why it is there is almost too much to bear."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book ever!","review":"When ever I am asked the question... what is your favorite book? I have but one single answer... A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam by Neil Sheehan. This is outstanding biography, history, and adventure story. So well written that you just do not want it to end. And no other book buts the whole Vietnam experience into better perspective. I own a first edition, and read it when it first came out in 1988... and ever since then, have felt it was, for me, my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Brilliant","review":"This is one of those books that will only become more important with time, a sort of American Iliad with Vann as the tragic hero. One thing I like about this book is how Sheehan manipulates the reader to reveal the darker sides of Vann's personality only when Sheehan deems it time to do so. Also interesting is how Vann is shown to be courageous, but also egotistical and capable of tremendous cruelty. His disregard for his wife is downright chilling.All said, this book is a tragedy: the story of one man's slow demise. All the worse because he seemed to hold so much promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BRIGHT SHINING LIE","review":"WONDERFUL FACTUAL WORK.

We have the Tucker Boys of later years when Doug Gray is mouthing & over-singing the songs. The finest the band was recorded was in Milwaukeee in 1974, then the British recordings are pretty good as well, especially Blue Ridge Mountain Sky. This recording fails in comparison to those. With Doug Gray as producer I feel he probably increased the crowd noise by 500% at times, especially when he is front and center.

Are people just so damn stupid these days? Spurlock and his followers please...don't BITE ME for my critique of this fame seeking sham.

I believe that this book is something that every parent, teacher, administrator and politician should read and read again. Anyone concerned about what we put in our mouths and call food, especially with the health and well-being of our youth, will want to read this book.While Spurlock makes frequent reference to his experiences in the filming and production of \\"Super-Size Me,\\" I do not believe that it is necessary to see that first - although it is certainly worth watching and extremely enlightening.This is a great book with great information that may certainly change your life and the way you look at food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware, weak stomachs...","review":"This book will change the way you eat forever.

That's always the problem with Christopher Guest's films like The Mighty Wind and Waiting for Guffman - they're just absurd enough that you can laugh merrily.Jenna Fischer and James Gunn did an outstanding job making this a darkly humorous, painful to watch, hilarious documentary. As a fan of Jenna's character Pam on The Office, and after reading an interview with her and finding her to be as funny and sarcastic as her character, I was intrigued when I heard about Lollilove.

While dated with an expiration date of 2016, there is no real guarantee that these film are fresh (and were not substituted for old or expired film).I use to shoot film but since switching to digital, I keep a few inexpensive rolls of negative film for the simple purpose of running a few rolls through my film cameras throughout the year (i.e. maintenance). So even though I am questioning the film I received in this last order, I know -- based on prior experience -- that Ilford HP5 Plus are a great b&w; film and I snagged these at $3.75/roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coyote tan boots","review":"These boots are different from my old pair of Blackhawk Desert Ops boots.

If you are looking for a solid jump from standard issue to personal boots these are the right choice. I wear size 13 civillian shoes and I bought a 12 and that was perfect. I have worn my boots now for almost 2 years and there is nothing wrong with them. These are for the grindstone soldier out on patrol's and marching through ridgid terrain."},{"rating":"2","title":"They aren't Oakleys","review":"I rotated between these books and a pair of Oakleys for my tour in Iraq. I was outside the wire most everyday and these boots, while not as comfortable nor as light as the Oakleys wore better and held together much better. Where the Oakleys are showing wear and tear, including cracks in the leather, and broken strings and threads, the Blackhawks are still going strong. They also were my boot of choice in wet and muddy weather as they seemed to offer better wet weather protection and keep my feet warmer. The flip side is that durring the summer months they were too heavy and hot to wear without a very thin pair of socks, which wore on the soles of my feet a bit rougher than the thicker smart wool socks I prefer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was initially happy but...","review":"These started out as excellent boots. I've been wearing them in the desert for 4-5 months now, 6 days a week. My job requires very little wear and tear. I haven't had any of the usual issues I normally have with boots; The soles and tread are holding up great. They feel awesome on my feet, and I haven't had any significant wearing or tear on the inside of the boot....but, stitches on the toe of the boot have already popped, and a small hole is already starting, thus it's only a short matter of time until they go in the garbage now. 4-5 months in is a no-go. I would most certainly never buy these boots again."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Blackhawk Boots are made in China","review":"Was about to replace my old boots and was looking at these, so I contacted their customer service and was told that Blackhawk boots are made in China.

Hopefully I can play them off and use them for the rest of my tour but I am just disappointed for receiving the wrong color."},{"rating":"2","title":"very comfortable","review":"So far very pleased. Received these boots the next day, a day sooner than expected. They wear ,and act like a sneaker on your foot. But they provide the protection as a boot should. Hunting season in a week I will put them to the test then!? Miles of rocks and cactus of Colorado will test there durability.The option of getting a great fit is a welcome change to; since I have a wide foot. Most shoes are a one sizes fits few option these are great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good.","review":"Well I have only been wearing these for about 2 weeks but so far everything seems great about these boots. I have a fairly wide foot so I went up 1/2 size from my normal issue boot size. Actually I went to the PX and tried on these, along with several other brands, then went online to find the cheapest price.Also, as far as the complaints about the heel wearing away, it seems as if they have redesigned the it and there is this moleskin type fabric there instead of a cloth material.I would have given them 5 stars but since I have not had them long enough to put them through some strenuous training I could not give them full credit.

In addition, he has included many of the important religious dates for each month, easy to see at a glance. For me, a Westerner who's knowledge of Eastern religion is still growing, this is a great tool for connecting into the activities of other forms of worship.

Mr White truely is a master of getting the very best out of such a wonderfully evocative instrument.

Even though Amanda Seyfried's character is written to be the crazy one, it's really Julianne Moore's character who definitely has the serious issues. Definitely not Julianne Moore or Liam Neeson's best, but it does make you stop to wonder if we are too paranoid at times and not paranoid enough at others.

This movie telegraphs its predictable plot twists from the first scene. Without giving away \\"spoilers\\", I can say that I had the progression of events figured out within the first half-hour. I have to say I felt some disappointment seeing Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore in the kind of \\"adultery melodrama\\" that the Lifetime channel regularly delivers.Prurient in ways mostly involving money and class distinction, these movies are very cynical and unimaginative.

Wrong, for a family that's supposed to be falling apart - there's none of the typical explosions or white knuckle tension that accompanies that premise. Both Liam and Julianne feel dangerously anemic in their performances leaving us with Amanda who now has two films with this one that leave me with little confidence in her ability to hold a story together. Too much background music and let's not forget the lackluster chemistry between the two women leaving us with a sex scene that is supposed to be much more intimate then it actually comes off as being. The bottom line is: Unfaithful still holds the ultimate standard as far as I am concerned in movies that tackle infidelity with all of the consequences psychological and physical that go with it. Chloe fails to do this on a grand scale basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"bought this movie for myself based on critics reviews. was not disappointed. good movie with a great twist ending. recommend!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Love... very strange movie.","review":"Unfortunately, this was just one more movie about SEX.

I was afraid of the inevitable comparisons that would occur. After all, no one can \\"be\\" Sinatra!This cd was a pleasant surprise. With a tip of the hat to Sinatra's impeccable song choices, Manilow has come up with a nice mix of ballads and swing tunes that identify with Frank without trying to copy him. There is no doubt that this is Barry Manilow singing Sinatra. The orchestra background is superb and sets the tone nicely. The ballads are fine, but I was most impressed by the up-tempo songs when both the orchestra and Barry cut loose and SWING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is only one Frank Sinatra","review":"So, Berry Manilow decided to do a tribute album to one and only Chairman of the Board!

He took these songs and made them his own without any disrespect to Frank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad At All","review":"I must admit that I had my doubts about this one. To release a Sinatra tribute album so shortly afther the man's death either requires a lot of gut or a lot of ignorance.In this case, though, Barry Manilow did a marvelous job. He has always been much more of a professional musician than the the mostly hostile media gave him credit for. Albums like \\"2 a.m., Paradise Café\\" have proved that beyond doubt.I would have preferred some other song selections that might have better fit Barry's singing style, but all in all this is one very good tribute album. I never understood why Manilow was never chosen to sing along on one of the two FS Duet albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real talent lies in the arrangement","review":"Barry's voice does not carry the same \\"weight\\" as Frank Sinatra; however, it is the skills of the arrangers that allows Barry Manilow to carry this off. \\"Stranger In The Night\\" has never had a better arrangement than what Doug Besterman did for it. The same holds true of Johnny Mandel for \\"I've Got A World On a String\\", a light-touch arrangement that even Sinatra's lower voice can't carry out as well as Manilow's. To truly enjoy this CD, you have to have all ready been a Manilow fan. If you have not been, this CD isn't going to change your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic for a Manilow fan!!!","review":"Once again Barry has made another CD (almost used ablum; shows my age)that his fan will rave about. I also feel that his constant detractors will find fault in the selections. I tried to listen as an unbiased person, but alas, my prejudice shows thru. I enjoyed the orchestrations. I enjoyed the selections, even though I didn't know every song. The inclusion of \\"All The Way\\" and \\"My Kind Of Town\\" brightened the CD for me. This is not the; \\"say all and be all\\" for Manilow but it is good to hear him again. I missed the dynamic Manilow style that comes thru on this CD....

I enjoy a lot of his original work. He did what he did well. But just as another reviewer, I must ask \\"Why?\\"No one could phrase like The Chairman of the Board. No one could capture a mood; be it patriotic fervor,the triumph of love, the dispair of a lost love like he could. No one has done it like Frank, either before or since.Lamentably, Barry does not come close, even with his own \\"style and freshness\\". Do yourself a great favor, and get these tunes on one of the dozens of Sinatra collections as Frank did them.Dobie Grey said it best thirty years ago in \\"The In-Crowd\\": the original is still the greatest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hi there I', not sure if thsi is inslult or tribute...","review":"I don't think barry Manilow recorded this to spite frank Siantra's memory on purpose, he may have meant well, but in any case this is more of an insult to Sinatra, than a tribute.

Paying tribute to a legend such as Sinatra is tricky business, but Manilow accomplishes that with grace and style. Manilow sings as himself here, much in the same way he did on previous cover material \\"Showstoppers\\" and \\"Singin' With the Big Bands\\". This is comfortable territory for Manilow, who has been unfairly branded as \\"schmaltzy\\" even after such stellar work as \\"2AM Paradise Cafe\\". I doubt Sinatra would disagree with the intent here, and at least in the case of many Manilow fans, it's likely Sinatra will gain new fans as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Interpretation of Sinatra","review":"I have never heard a better version of Sinatra's work than this album that Barry Manilow has produced, and he performs so well in Frankie's style making it his own...When my son heard this album he says it's the best he's heard Sinatra and my son a talented musician himself knows his music. The songs have been sung with a smooth unmistakable style and the band is authentic to that of the swing in Frankie's style.

There are several things that made it not worth the money.1) Very weak motor. If you push too hard it stalls, but if you don't push hard enough it doesn't sharpen. So you have to work very hard to maintain just the right pressure to get any results at all.2) Even when you get the pressure right, it still doesn't sharpen very well. The point isn't very pointy, and the wood is rough.3) The unit is very light and unstable. There's almost no way to sharpen the pencil with one hand - you have to hold the sharpener to keep it from falling over.4) The shaving collector cup doesn't latch in very well.

He is so passive, that her attraction to him is just not believable. She is so strange, and so disturbed, that her attraction to him seems strained and beyond understanding. Undoubtedly, there are many sad and lonely and strange people in the world, but in this movie these characteristics are taken to the extreme.It is interesting to note how the real Psychiatrist is portrayed . . as a self-important, money grubbing incompetent . . perhaps his portryal is the truest, most credible part of the movie.

Copious references to 'the fairies' abound.Other gaffes in the dialogue include a character using the word 'robot' in 1905 and another character in a scene from the late 19th century using the phrase 'human rights'.I may be pedantic in raising this criticism, but it seems a shame that such work should have been put into the historical research only to have it undermined by such poor and uncredible dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trinity","review":"I reluctantly picked this book up after receiving it as a Christmas present. Boy was I wrong about my initial impressions. I devoured the entire book in less than a week. I found the story fascinating. The dichotomy between the haves and have-nots in Ireland and the constant struggle was intriguing. The author created well rounded characters, who seemed to suffer unimaginably. The book read like nonfiction. Overall, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"I'm going to name my son Conor. I'd encourage anyone to read this book, not just for the fascinating portrait of an Irish family, but also for a great lesson in the history of the Irish conflict."},{"rating":"1","title":"who'd would make a good Conor?","review":"The first time I read the book the ending stunned me. In fact the whole book stunned me until I found out just who Leon Uris based the character of Connor on. Martin McGuinness! So now we can relax and imagine if Connor had lived until he was sixty years old what he'd of looked like. Would he have developed a bad temper due to getting knocked out playing football and the swarms of angry Protestants after him and succeeding in beating him. No way would he still be singing the Rising of the Moon another few head banging times! It's a easy book to read not really insightful about any character fairly accurate history and of course CONOR. I wonder if Mr. Mc Guinness has ever read it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Condescending \\"blarney\\" of the first degree","review":"The popularity of Leon Uris shouldn't surprise me, but his truly awful writing style was a shock and I found this book nearly unreadable. His condescending depiction and blatant stereotyping of the post-famine Irish is insulting and childish. He uses details that can be gathered from any schoolboy's history of Ireland to prove his \\"expertise\\" on the subject matter, and flavors his characters dialogue with phrases that no self-respecting Irishmen ever spoke - to give you a taste of his style, he uses the descriptor \\"wee\\" dozens of times in just the first 20 pages of the book. Compared to a masterwork like \\"Angela's Ashes,\\" this is little more than a Jackie Collins-style novelization of the history of Ireland."},{"rating":"1","title":"An agonizing tale...literally. It took me 5 weeks to read.","review":"First off, I must say that I detest this book. I read 800 pages only to be rewarded with 16 pages of action at the very end of the novel. I agree, that Uris writes extremely well, however just as history repeats itself, so too, does the plot. Perhaps the plight of the Irish is well portrayed in this story, but nothing is achieved, and all the Catholic murders go unavenged. I give this book five stars for style, but I take away three for my frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRINITY","review":"Leon Uris is capable of much much better writing. After reading Exodus and A God in Ruins I had high expectations for Trinity. The stroy line is shallow and the love story is about as deep as most teenage love storys. I'm an Irish-American so I know about the problems in Northren Ireland. Let's just say that Uris should have done some more research. The only redeemable part of the book is the part before Seamus and Connor grow up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting read!!","review":"Very long book with very small print I found difficult to read, but the story line is excellent. My eyes just not that good.Takes place in Ireland after the potatoe fammin. What I got out of this book is how the upper crusts works dilligently to keep normal folk down, the tactics of which are still in use today.When a people let others rule them it is very difficult to get out from under. The rules, the laws, all will be working and contructed to hold a people back and down. Such as in these times our financial monkeys rule everything. Corporations have more power in our laws than do people.When you make similarities such as the above, I hope it will make everyone think. I hope it will make everyone who reads this book aware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating!","review":"I read this book when it was new, over ten years ago, and it still lingers in my mind. It opened my eyes and ignited my interest in Irish history. I think it is a definitive study of Ireland's \\"troubles\\" and why they probably will never change. Read this book! I am looking forward to reading it again, to see if my reactions to the story are the same as they were back then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy","review":"Enjoy MIchael Bamberger books.

At first listening, I thought the sound was just a little bit off...and then I read the booklet and found out that this was the reformed group not the original 60's. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for beginners and advanced refresher","review":"For a beginner in the feild of fiction writing, this is an excellent book to start with.For a more advanced writer, some of the subjects (subplot and symbolism) goes deeper than most beginner books. A good book for overcoming writer's block, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I have painstakingly gotten through this book. I would have not read it in its entirety had I not thought it just might get better. Complete waste of time for someone who knows nothing of the people written about. I found that this author is very witty and funny at times throughout this book but it just can't make up for the pure spitefulness and long windedness of material already spoken about earlier in the book. Thumbs down on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor rich kid","review":"This author needs to have this book truly edited. This editor was not doing his job to the reader. As I'm sorry that he had to go through such a sad divorce but more than half of the kids in this country has been touched with the same pain. Maybe not as publicly but the pain is still the same. My huge question is what is the motive to write this book? I sure hope this made him feel better because he seems to me like a person that needs a ton of help. The start of this book was some what funny...then it just seemed to drag and drag. There is only so many times you can hear the same story written slightly different and still be entertained by it. I love to read but this has got to be the hardest and worst book I have read in several years. I can't recommend anyone to read this book, it was just too painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare yourself","review":"This book went on and on and on and on. The author has a chip on his shoulder the size of his trust fund and I don't know why I made him richer by buying his book. His older dad remarried and he didn't like his new stepmother who ended up inheriting the money. Hardly and original idea for a book. Occasionally witty passages are interupted by hundreds of pages of endless detail about his schools his friends his rehab, etc. I ended up just not caring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sean has a big chip on his shoulder","review":"I put this book down after reading the first half. Theinsights into the upper levels of SF society were interesting,but Sean's perspective really soured the experience. It sounded as though Sean had an upbringing superior to most, includingextreme privilege and decent support from his parents. Hisresponse is a whining stab in the back. I wonder how he'd feel ifhis son did the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"not interesting","review":"My daughter gave me this book and said it was supposed to be so funny. It was long and hard to stay with and sometimes mean. If you don't care about society people in San Francisco it isn't so interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I went to Cascade","review":"So I went to Cascade, the boarding school in northern California, in Whitmore. I have to say that he comes from the perspective of a bitter beginning schooler. I hated it to, don't get me wrong, I found it too restrictive, hated the fact that the rules were called \\"agreements\\", hated the \\"contracts\\", hated the forums (what he called raps...they changed the name to forums). I have gotten ripped to shreds in forums, had indictments turned on me, been on upperschool down bans once when I was in leadership so I could \\"step out of my square\\", had dishes and work projects, etc. etc. but I did get a lot out of that place and made friends that I still keep in touch with, so although everything he said in there was true, there is more to it than that, there was a lot to learn from that school."},{"rating":"1","title":"I started rooting for the stepmother!","review":"The book get a great review from the NYT, and I decided to give it a spin. I didn't like it. During his childhood the author was emotionally abused by parents and stepmother alike, and I guess he thought he could strike back, particularly at the stepmother, while earning a voyeuristic tell-all type buck.But the thing drug on and on, he apparently had no editor, and I think of the saying that the only thing an American hates more than a bully is someone who won't stand up to a bully. I finally skipped the middle and jumped to the back, only to encounter more boring and frustrating material.I'm honestly confused why so many people enjoyed reading the book. Perhaps a type of reading schadenfreude aimed at wealthy people. I dunno.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh The Glory of Excess","review":"Look, I know James Frey is considered a big fat liar in the world of memoirist literature, but at least he's compelling in his story telling. Sean Wilsey had an absolutely messed up childhood, complete with a suicidal socialite Mother, a narcissistic distant Father, and a Stepmother truly descended from Satan. The book follows his descent into juvenile delinquency, and various extreme boarding schools,until he ultimately finds a path towards peace and redemption in an Italian reform school. I think I would've loved this book had it been two hundred less pages. I just began to resent the plodding narrative that veered off course numerous times into mind numbing side tracks detracting what is at the core a moving book about a boy trying to have a relationship with his father."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH TO BE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR","review":"Entertaining, moving and strong. To me, a memoir's strength rests in its conclusion. And this story concludes elegantly and powerfully. Once you're there, the energy of the preceding 450 pages fold back on themselves like a wave breaking on the beach. If you're prospecting for the much publicized scandal and dirt in here, you'll find it. But if that's your sole motivation for reading this, sadly, you'll miss the point. I've read many memoirs and this one was a highlight in the pile. Glorious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly Reluctant Love Story to San Francisco","review":"I just finished the book this afternoon. If you want to learn about the machinations of Society in the City, then read it. If you enjoy reading stories transforming the main character, then read it. Finally, if you want something that is trashy (quote by neighbor who knew some Wilseys, I had to set her straight), yet poignant, then read it. Enough said. The writer has a way with words and can tell a story, quite well. I laughed (deep down, cat-scaring laugh) and cried (same). The passage with his father at the restuarant where he puts his hand on the side of his face had me at a mountain of Kleenex moment. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts well...","review":"then descends into self indulgence. If he had stopped about one-third of the way in, this would be a witty, engaging book.

The Gory of it All...","review":"Oh: I now know more about another person's bodily fluids than I ever wanted to. The Glory: Yet another memoirist who glorifies what a bad, cool, messed up kid he was (exactly what James Frey is now in hot water over). In fact, reading this made me feel the way Sean seemed to as a teenager: bored, sarcastic, and angry. Of it All: The book would have been much better at half its length. While it's easy to have sympathy for Sean's suffering at the hands of his family, he spends little time offering any real understanding of why and how it all affected him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring & whiny","review":"Do we really need another \\"Mommy Dearest\\"? I just feel that if the stuff in this book is all he had to complain about while growing up, he should have hung around my neighborhood. Poor little rich boy. Should have stopped whining and done something productive, or at least interesting, in his youth. Read Jeannette Walls' \\"The Glass Castle\\", for an admirable look at someone who really had a tough time."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh the bore of it all","review":"When I first started reading this book, I became entranced by the characters. However, after 100 pages of \\"you can't be too rich or too thin,\\" the book became wearisome and pointless. It droned on and on about the wicked stepmother and loveless father until it became clear that the writer himself led as shallow, pointless and pathetic existence as the remaining characters.If you want a soap opera, go rent Dallas or Falcon Crest. Without photos, this book is simply overblown --like the characters' egos-- and boring! Give it a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Glorious Read","review":"Fascinating, hilarious, exuberant, and so keenly written -- I was disappointed when it was over, because I'd come to enjoy hanging out with the narrator so much. It's up there with Eggers and Burroughs as can't-miss memoirs of the ex-Gen-X -- just great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read It In a Day","review":"I could not put this book down.Sean Wilsey is an outstanding writer. His strange childhood, complete with nutty mother (Pat Montandon), vicious stepmother (Dede Wilsey) and hypercritical father (Al Wilsey), is beyond anything I have ever read, and his reflections are laugh-out-loud funny.Mix Dave Eggars, David Sedaris and Augusten Burroughs, and you'll have Sean Wilsey.What a story and what a writer. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"SAD BOOK ABOUT GROWING UP","review":"I was surprised by OH THE GLORY OF IT ALL by Sean Wilsey. It is a narrative about growing in in a home or homes with wealth but oh so many problems. It was hard to put down but was told in a choppy style. Much more sad than comedic, and I wonder how factual the recollections of a youth? I do recommend the book with some reservations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"Buy it to be a voyeur into a world of excess and wealth but read it because it's so very well-written. Wilsey's life--young as he is--has got to fascinate anyone who lived in San Francisco or wished they had. He chronicles the breakdown of a family, the creation of new lives, and manages to do so in an engaging and interesting style without a \\"woe is me\\" point of view. He's a survivor and his work proves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as witty as Wurtzel; couldn't keep my attention","review":"I read the first twenty pages, which were interesting, then the focus of this book and its tone began to get repetitive and I could not keep my interest in it. I skimmed the rest.I find the pace of this memoir to be quite similar to Prozac Nation by Elizabeth Wurtzel; Wilsey employs the same shifting of short narrative scenes and deadpan humor applied to less-than-ideal situations. But where her memoir has a sense of the individual trying for some overarching philosophy or schemata, and wanting to reach toward herself, as well as some funny and generally sympathetic character portrayals, his memoir is nothing but a relentless chaotic jumble of unpleasant events, it seems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't believe it was real.","review":"Between the wicked step-mother and the flighty dad -- literally, since flying is his hobby -- I didn't realize this book was non-fiction until almost half-way through. It's amazing that Wilsey is able to write this eloquent memoir, because he could just have easily have been the tragic victim of suicide or violence."},{"rating":"2","title":". . . and now I know, after all these years","review":"This book was so well written. I do believe Sean and his memories of incidents some of which he couldn't possibly have taken notes on. I was in my early 30s and in SF during the 80's (now living in the Napa Valley - but lucky me I don't travel in their circles) and I remember the disgust of the Montandon/Wilsey divorce (hindsight - poor Pat), the surprise of the Dede/Al \\"union\\" and the \\"gossip\\" from friends at that time which are confirmed by Sean's writings. Shame on Dede. Whether completely true or not, I am convinced by his descriptions of the various and numerous relationships (which changed over the years) with family members both biologically related and through marriage that Sean's memories are reality. Whew. What an expose and what a shame that the Wilsey Foundation . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voyeuristic Pleasure","review":"I felt a bit guilty the entire time I was reading this book, which has considerable literary merit but REALLY dishes the dirt. Although Sean writes with considerable wit and humor, there's a vindictiveness underlying this work that you don't often find in literary memoirs. And I couldn't quite get over the timing of its publication, which pretty much coincided with the Grand Opening of the new (and spectacular) home of the De Young Museum in San Francisco, which Sean's evil step-mother Dede Wilsey had spearheaded. But, oh, the pleasure of seeing the very rich skewered in that way! And, (as I had to keep telling myself throughout the book), given the great reviews by respected critics, it's okay to read and enjoy it, right? Because it is the self-exploration -- and not the gossip -- that keeps those pages turning . . . right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's great!","review":"Get past the tell all mentality - and the need to judge verbage, length, style - this guy tells a great story in living color - his adolescent journey is so graphic and honest - his account of the emotional growth schools, the process of personal reclamation, the family narrative and the portraits of characters - all so well done and true to life that i put him in the context of a latter day salinger, twain, agee - he tells the story more of a late twentieth century divorced kid than rich kid - minus the famous names, he speaks to the huge numbers of teens lost for direction - he presents an accurate picture of healing that makes for compelling reading mixed in with the anger, humor, and recollection - if this were presented as fiction there would be good deal more attention directed to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true delight!","review":"In America having money means you should not suffer at all. It is refreshing to see that from lemons you can make lemonade. Mrs Wilsey had to go in hidding for a long period after this book came up to light. It is seldom brought up that there is a kind of woman who make their living on being the \\" invasion of the body snatchers\\",and child abuse in the upper classes is real. Mr. Sean Wilsey in a humorous way depicts a San Francisco society that lacks integrity, moral or legal grounds which in a cruel way ,celebrates the wrongdoings of a man , because he is wealthy.Judges can be bought, as well as friends and people can be discarded as kleenex tissue-paper.What is wonderful about this book is that makes you laugh, and brings you the reality of high society to the last \\"t\\".Great book and I highly recommend it!!!

Don't expect sophisticated special effects, but be ready to challenge your mind with very intriguing questions about the consequences of scientist's arrogance, the possibility of time travel and the paradoxes of it.

Sullivan is tough, vulnerable and struggling with the suicide of her mother. The story is rife with wonderful depictions of Floridian landscapes and waterways and is moved along by a cast of characters rich in description. Intrigue mounts as Sey finds herself a target of the murder investigation of her ex-lover and she must do her own digging to get to the truth.Seychelle's ability to escape several dire situations stretches credulity a bit but noneless are exciting and fun. Her relationships with her brothers, and memories of her father and mother enrich the story. The story's pace is good and the ending keeps open the door to Sey's further adventures. Overall a great first effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I ENJOYED THIS STORY. THE AUTHOR REALLY KNEW HER SUBJECT.

The main character, Seychelle Sullivan, demanded the reader's admiration as a strong, highly-motivated woman. The action kept one in suspense and the setting was exotic (to one from the hinterlands of the Midwest)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me entertained","review":"I found this gripping from the very beginning. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because there were some minor grammatical errors towards the end of the book which could have been omitted by some good proof reading. The ending of the story left me wanting. I guess the book had built up to a crescendo and then it was finished off in a hurry as if the author wasn't sure where to go with all the webs that were woven. Still it was pure entertainment and I really enjoyed it. I usually read thriller/action/crime type of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"surface tension","review":"This book didn't hold my attention.

I've already purchased the next in the series I enjoyed this one so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captured five times? Jeeez","review":"First, I did like this book, especially for a debut, and I'll read another sometime. I really liked the Florida setting and the fact the story revolves around boats and the ocean. Living in Midwest I don't see a whole lot of ocean and the author's descriptions of life on the coast and a hero who works as a ship's captain is new and refreshing. The main quibble I have, and the reason I only gave it four stars, is that the heroin gets captured or kidnapped or held five times! Jeeez. In many suspense thrillers the main character gets captured and escapes once, sometimes twice, but five times is really pushing it. It makes her seems like such a sap. Since this is her first adventure I hope she learns from her mistakes and the author turns it down a couple of notches in the subsequent novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"no support!","review":"I would love to say how this product performs, but we are unable to get it to download onto our computer.

As you read, it becomes more and more obvious that the author did not really know what to do with his story or his characters.I finished the book, but it took some work on my part, because half way through the story telling of Mr. Brown does not hold up. If I was the editor of this book, I would have sent Mr. Brown back to work on making it a completebook, and not coasting on its intesting beginning & premise!Its too bad, because it could have been a decent read. I rated it a 2 on the overall premise of the story and the beginning. All and all, I think Mr. Brown was just writing a movie script and not a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It feels like eating fast food","review":"This is the second book I read from Brown and it feels like we are about to get a book factory. Even though the book is a nice read, far away from being boring it leaves you plain after you finish it. It feels like eating fast food - feels good while you are eating, and then dull when you are finished. The only way how to get rid of this feeling is to get another book from Brown and read it. The problem might happen if you finish all four before he writes fifth.To be a bit more specific, what I really don't like about this book is that so many technical facts are either irrelevant, or not accurate. And this can be very annoying if you know even a little bit of engineering. However, what I like about it is that it take so little to finish reading it...and then another BROWN can be taken for read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrant Rubbish","review":"Brown's success with The Da Vinci Code made his name. However not having read that book yet, I thought I'd try this one first. It is a cheap pastiche of (bad) science fiction, political machinations, and conspiracy. Exciting enough in a pulp fiction sense but far too much extreme heroism and contrived suspense.Having now read The Code, it by contrast deserves its popularity. I'm left with the view that Brown is a one-book wonder.Don't disappoint yourself with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish","review":"I am an avid reader and generally not too picky. This was the first book in years that I gave away without having finished it. I started and put it down several times. After about 6 months I had only read about half of it and was dreading the need to finish. I came to realize that I just did not like the book. The plot was too unbelievable and I did not care much for the characters. I have read other books by the author and could not put them down. This one just missed the mark in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"You might like it, if you are as dumb as the heroine.","review":"To buy into this story you have to believe the heroine, who works in DC distilling intelligence reports into briefs, is so dumb that she constantly has to ask dopey questions because she can't grasp what is going on around her or what anyone is saying. And she has to ask these dumb questions because the author thinks the reader is equally dumb and has to be lead by the hand to understand everything. Cut out the excessive explanations, the perpetual reviews of the action, and the ever-present (bad) foreshadowing (i.e. \\"He wasn't worried. Yet.\\" \\"If only she had known what was ahead.\\") and the book would be half the size but twice as good. I kept asking myself - how did he convince someone to publish this? Save your money. Angels and Demons is much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as sophisticated","review":"It's easy to tell this is one of Brown's earlier efforts.

What does the nonsense involve? A plot by NASA to save itself by planting a fake meteorite under the Artic ice cap...to help save the presidency....YAWN! Stink, stank, stunk!

In this book he describes a situation where an elite Special Ops squad is assigned the task to eliminate some Americans who have learned too much about a government cover-up.First, the Delta team would in fact never comply with such an order. Such an order would be unlawful and under the Uniform Code of Military Justice any soldier would be justified in refusing such an order.Second, assuming the team does attempt to kill these people, Mr. Brown gives them an unrealistic set of arms and equipment. They carry \\"machine guns\\", which are probably Heckler & Koch MP5s and should be refered to as \\"machine pistols\\" but they only have one clip of ammo and no side arms! In addition, they carry radios that are not \\"hands free\\" which would be ridiculous in a tactical situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Already predictable...","review":"I try to avoid reading novels that are even remotely political.

I decided to try an author, new to me, whose reviews are good. I encounter this stereotype within the first five pages. Ahh, all is fiction. The mindset is immediately predictable.

The reader, a fellow traveler, simply could not savor the vapid, vacuous and utterly charmless prose of Dan Brown alone. Given the laughs which ensued, I'm glad he refused to spare the rest of us.

This book reminds me of a B-rated movie. Starting with the plot, and the now expected lack of character development, the whole book as a piece of writing is unbelievable. The lack of facts just follows course.This was my third Dan Brown book. Each one came recommended by someone who knew of my love for reading and was just convinced that this was worth my time. Dan Brown goes after conspiricy ideas, twisted facts, and claims of just trying to get people to be more aware. Take all that away and what is left is that Dan Brown cannot write. The plots fall apart, the characters are lacking, and there is nothing to sustain the finish.Thanks, Dan Brown, for again making me so grateful that there are other authors to read. Because those other authors are who I am going to read from now on. Three books in a row that were just aweful was enough waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks - Not worth your time","review":"I am an avid fiction reader and was hoping that this book will be at least OK, considering that it is written by Dan Brown. I was disappointed, to say the least. The plot is OK and some of the situations in the book are built up really well, but overall this book totally sucks. There are some instances where the author has gone way way too far off the main plot, rambling incessantly. Some of the prose is so silly that it makes you laugh.Overall, a very amateur-ish attempt by the author which is best avoided. Go for Angels and Demons or Da Vinci Code by the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mess","review":"After reading Davinci code I was full of hope in finding some more good reading in this novel. Well, it started out quite good (if you are good at suspension of disbelief) but later you cannot go on any further.The characters are pathetic, the story line poor, the details and data used wrong and pathetic. Well, I kept on reading until about half way, saying to myself \`it cannot get worse, it has to start picking up now'. Well, no, it did not. It went from bad to worse. How it ended I don't know as I could not force myself any further.So if you are looking to buy this, please, please stay away.

I am just being honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful","review":"This is one of the worst thrillers I've read in several years. Dan Brown does no research whatsoever in writing his books. It may sound like nitpicking, but he gets every scientific and technical aspect wrong. F-14s that fly at supersonic speeds from Washington to the North Pole and land on the ice. Powered skis that can go up hill and then recharge on the downhill (perpetual motion?). I won't give away the ending, but it's so implausible as to be laughable. Don't waste your time with this one. There are plenty of better authors out there that at least bother to do some fact-checking."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadfully mundane and far too contrived","review":"and as you might imagine, predictable.

Then scientists discover that this meteorite contains a shocking revelation that will send shockwaves through Washington, DC and affect a Presidential election.

The buildup for the 'discovery' that would uplift NASA, restore the President's campaign, and shatter the senator's campaign was too hyped with very little substance. Fossils in a meteorite, big deal!(3.) The lame attempt at misdirection of who the villain is Pickering vs. Tench was simply childish.(4.)

It has a relatively good story, however if you have a problem with plot holes, this is a book to steer clear of. If you don't know much about or don't care about the way the US government and military works, this book won't be bad. Several things that are key to the plot, and several that aren't, detract from the author's work. For one, the basis of the entire book is shock and frustration that NASA is spending $15 billion a year. Unfortunately, this is a miniscule portion of the government's budget, and shouldn't shock anyone. Then there are the myriad of improbable to impossible technologies, along with minor details that make it apparent the author didn't quite research everything he should of. Overall, its a good story with lots of little details that really get in the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let this loser dumb you down!","review":"Dan Brown has found his niche in hypothetical conspiracy theories.

But when I read Deception Point I felt like I was dealing with a dangerous level of \\"dumbing down.\\"Dan Brown's true niche is in exploiting the paranoia of the uninformed. I had laughed at the idea that Angels and Demons and the Da Vinci Code would probably keep the Vatican on its toes for a while. I figured, they're going to be working overtime to keep the conspiracy theories at bay. But I'm not laughing now because he's developed a huge cult following. Deception Point's anti-science paranoia is not funny at all in that context.Read this book and think not about advanced science/political conspiracies but about the altruistic nature of science and the self-serving needs of pulp fiction marketing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's just say I'm glad I got it for 50 cents","review":"I would write a detailed review on why I didn't like this book, but it's not worth it to waste more time on a book that took so much of it from me already.Suffice to say, the plot is boring and the overriding theme of NASA possibly being shut down due to the action or inaction of certain characters is duller than a roll of toilet paper. I highly doubt the possible privatization of NASA (or keeping it a government agency) is enough to keep most readers interested, and that is the focal point of the novel.The characters are dull. Not so much characters as caricatures.The only reason I made it though this book is because, like other Brown novels, it is so easy to read. Even though it's boring and contrived, you can easily make it through 50 pages a night and be done with it in a week. Of course, you could just skip it altogether and save yourself the anguish and frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"great plot, disappointing end","review":"I've read the other blockbusters by Dan Brown (DaVinci Code, Angels and Demons, Digital Fortress) and as with the others, I thought that DP started out great with a fascinating, page-turning plot.

Kind of hard to read a story when huge chunks of it are missing. If you intend to buy this book, I suggest you check every page for missing parts.

There are many instances of stilted writing structure and other basic writing mistakes.

Perhaps it was rushed to the printer's to capitalize on the author's fame?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in the league of Da Vinci Code!","review":"Dan Brown's second novel, Deception Point, is definitely better than the disastrous \\"Digital Fortress\\". But you can still see the flaws that the first novel suffered. He has found a better subject and tied in the multiple plots neatly. However his dialogs between the characters especially between the scientists are painfully shallow and the sarcasm is totally unnecessary.

Sadly, the book was so poorly written that what should have been fun was overshadowed by silly characters, and plot points that were horribly contrived.

Stick with Katherine Neville, or even the Garforths for more intelligent escapist entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I might give up reading entirely!","review":"This book was so bad that I might give up reading for the rest of my life to avoid a repeat experience. I took it on a flight and had nothing else to read, so I kept going hoping it would get better. By the end, I wanted to open the emergency exit and leap out to end my misery. It is formulaic and implausible, with plot twists as a substitute for actual plot. Erase my memory, please, and give me back my 5 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive Ending","review":"Dan Brown has hit upon a formula for his novels where (if you've read some of them) you will recognize the protagonist, the nomitive antagonist, a supporting character(s) who you are lead to believe is working for the antagonist and, finally (and near the end), the actual bad guy. The bad guy's identity is usually a surprise in that the material preceding the finale is even handed and unbiased.Brown has followed this formula for at least 4 of the books I have read, and frankly it is wearing thin.He has always managed to serve up politically neutral material before this one, however. But not here.He has taken pains to paint one political party as above board and sacrifing and the other to be featured by a self-centered, abusive personality. He has even taken the opportunity to paint the nation's military in an unfavorable light.Altogether a disappointing book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, formulaic","review":"It took me a second to remember which dan brown book this was, not that it really matters as they are all incredibly similar but I couldn't even make it through a quarter of this book.Dan Brown's books are considered \\"Smart Thillers\\" which apparently means there is a plot twist, oohhhh"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good beginning, then downhill","review":"An interesting, well developed, fast paced plot which unfortunately is undercut by predicable and uninteresting characters.

It captured my attention and my wife would get mad at me and tell me to go to sleep. I would tensely tell her \\"I think Pickering just died!\\" She knew not to bother me. I read the book till late into the night. I finished late the next morning. It was good good good. But the Da Vinci Code was better.Oh, and one more thing.

Deception Point is a fast read, with a quickly paced story and better-than average (for Brown) characters.Deception Point is unlike Da Vinci Code or Demons and Angels, but it is a well researched, scientifically interesting story about a meteorite that just might contain proof of extraterrestrial life. Intrigue abounds, with insight into the foibles of NASA, a Senator making a run at the White House, a famous TV-oceanographer, and a headstrong young woman working in the Washington D.C. intelligence community.Couple the interesting plot about the authenticity of the meteorite with an Arctic Circle setting and you've got a terrific page-turner that will most definitely keep you up late a few nights in a row.I highly recommend this one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great One","review":"I can't believe it.

For a thriller, Brown spent way too much time establishing has plot and his characters. He put in plenty of action, but until he finally got the story rolling somewhere around page 250, much of the action seemed contrived.I was impressed by all the details Brown worked in to make his political, scientific, and action scenes seem authentic. Impressed, but for the most part not swept away into a believable fictional world.Eventually Brown hooked me enough to read through to the end. My final impression is that Brown stirred all the ingredients of a good thriller into _Deception Point_, but that the dish never quite came together.Robert Adler, author of _Medical Firsts: From Hippocrates to the Human Genome_; and _Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation_."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of Action and a great plot","review":"I have read \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and that was my first book by Dan Brown. Next, I read \\"Angels and Demons\\" then \\"Deception Point\\". In my opinion, Deception Point was the best of these great books. The story is full of action which is set during a presidential election, and then the author throws in some unsavory political characters that make the plot of this book very suspenseful. This is certainly an easy read and the writing style makes it an excellent bedside book. Check it out and have a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Kidding Right?","review":"What nonsense!

Apart from the ridiculous story line, this book is so poorly written that it ought to be an embarrassment to both its author and publisher, except that it make a few bucks from the author's celebrity. There are tidbits of new technology sprinkled in it, but to call this \\"thrilling\\" literature is just very wrong. It was boring, boring, boring...and predictable.

I read this one in record time. It centers around the discovery of a meteorite at the North Pole that contains, what appears to be, exterrestial life. Just judging by the title of the book you can determine that there is a ruse going on. And those that stumble onto the deception must be eliminated.The action is fact-paced and the characters are extremely intriguing! I especially liked the scientists when they are so into themselves as being right that they just discount anyone that questions their analyses.

Dan Brown shows he has not knowledge of or bothered to check the accuracy of much of anything in his book. The concepts of NASA, satellite orbits, satellite software problems, launch vehicles, rocket fuel and engine design or common laws of physics dealing with gases under pressure. The questions that were just left hanging, like how do you bore a hole up 100 ft into the bottom of a glacier and hold a 8 ton rock into it until it freezes in place. And that is jujst one example.

Aside from dropping every cliche known to man, giving characters names like dad soap operas (Sedgewick Sexton...pulleez) and getting stuck somewhere between a Lifetime Network movie and a James Bond film, the book is so badly conceived that when the real villain is finally unveiled, the reader has already figured it out to utter boredom 150 pages earlier.This book will keep me from ever reading a Dan Brown novel again. If you want to avoid the same fate, pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it zero stars","review":"I hated this book so much that I am willing to go to any site and review it, all in hopes that another unsuspecting soul won't have to endure this terrible,terrible book.I somewhat enjoyed \\"The Lost Symbol\\" and the \\"Da Vinci Code\\".

Waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author lost in twists and turns!","review":"This is book is a great example of how sometimes good writers are lost in the twists and turns of their own work. The book starts with a great promise, but ends rather anticlimactically. The main character Rachel seems quite confused as she, in the first 95% of the novel, is risks her life to get evidence of the truth and spends last 5% of the novel trying to hide the same evidence. She starts with philosophy of 'having no assumptions only evidence' but at the end accepts the innocence of one party without any proof. Even though most of the book is interesting the end is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"This book is TERRIBLE! It is implausible, unsuspenseful, and just plain ridiculous!

Or where a ship is sucked down to the depths of the ocean by a giant swirling whirlpool (ala The Little Mermaid)?I barely got through this book. I put it down on several occassions and only finished it because I needed a good laugh and to find out what the next unbelievable scenario the characters would get themselves into.One question after having read Da Vinci Code: Why do people continue to buy and read Dan Brown books?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"This is the first Dan Brown book I have read and I have to say that I am not impressed.The book started out good, but then turned out way overblown.

The characters are the same, the plot is basically the same, and the twists are the same. There are only so many times you can feint with your right and follow with a left hook for a knockout before everyone in the world sees it coming 3 rounds earlier.

Although it was a good read, it makes a mockery of how science is practiced. The plot hinges on whether an object is genuine. However, none of the outside \\"experts\\" called in to examine it had the knowledge required determine its authenticity. The implication that these experts could somehow validate an \\"astonishingly rare object\\" found in an Arctic ice sheet in a short time is just unthinkable, especially given that they include a TV science popularizer and lack scientists with the necessary expertise. Routine geochemical analyses and additional tests would have revealed problems from the start. I won't go into how dreadful the explanations of how the object was formed were, suffice it to say that they were gross misrepresentations of what is physically possible. Usually, I can forgive a bit of stretching of the science in a book, but here things were stretched until they broke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Dan Brown book yet...","review":"Deception Point is fast-paced, and hard to put down. Plot twists are surprising. Characters are well defined, as far as they go. This story would have gotten a five star rating but for its contradiciton of keeping NASA under government control. 'Government science' is a contradiction in terms. Force and Mind are opposites. Still, this was a great read. Worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Angels and Demons...","review":"While not the concise and mesmerizing work of his other novel The DVC, this book certainly shows the author's growth from A&D.

You'll figure out plot points many pages before they happen, sometimes even chapters before they happen.

And the ending... so... bad... ughhhh... it hurts... oh, dear God... it hurts... so much... please, make it... stop...If you are discerning in the least, take your memories of The DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons and your money and walk away, just walk away, and no one will get hurt.Then again, if you are looking for a literary lobotomy Deception Point may just be the ticket."},{"rating":"1","title":"The boring of Dan Brown","review":"This book was the most boring of Brown's legacy.

The reader is drawn along in unraveling the mystery behind the find in the Arctic and then propelled suddenly into a race for revelaing the truth.

Action packed and thrilling, I felt I could not put it down until I was done reading, but then came the disappointment. As his previous two books, boy and girl now have to save the U.S. presidencial office, all in one day, in one far-fetched adventure after another. Characters that survive getting lost in the North Pole and fall into Arctic waters, but suffer no frost bite and only mild shock, fly for hours in one day, swim with sharks and survive bullet wounds, etc., and still have the energy to have breakfast at the White House, well....

Or more popular?","review":"This and Brown's other pre-DaVinci novel are similar to the books he's famous far, except art history and religious speculation have been substituted for science speculation (or combined as in Angels and Demons).Given that readers more knowledgeable than I have dismissed the science in this book, I have to wonder whether he switched tracks because art is easier than science.Or perhaps it's more popular, because I doubt many people at this stage are as emotional about NASA as this book assumes.This is a wild ride that's barely credible, but of course exciting.And if you've read other Brown books, you'll easily guess who the ultimate villain is -- it follows the same formula of his other books.It read easily and was worthwhile.

If a book can take you to another place and help you forget the real world for just one moment in time....its a good read. And thats exactly what this book did.

I couldn't put these down, so I couldn't wait to start Deception Point. While I would have to say the book was okay, it wasn't up to par with The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons. It was just too far fetched for me. Just when you think there is no way they can get out of their current issue, the unthinkable happens. A submarine coming to the rescue? Just a little too out there for me. It would be a good place to start for someone wanting to read Dan Brown.

For this \\"Deception Point\\" I was hooked at the beginning but slowly waned off towards the end. There are some good descriptions of the American's political systems/scenes and the author Dan Brown kept me guessing until towards the 4/5 of the book.

I was sorely disapoointed, as you can tell from my title. It lacked the flash and panache of his works already mentioned. Too much invention, rifles that fire ice and sand bullets, ships capable of near impossible speeds, and of course \\"black\\" helicopters firing missles at the FDR Memorial? Uh uh, I didn't buy it, but I did finish it, mostly because it was a fast read, and I didn't feel like I was devoting too much time to a mediocre book.

On the back of these two books, I decided to continue on, as I'm sure many other people have done with other novels he had written.What did concern me was the fact that his other books went by pretty much un-noticed until the success of The Da vinci Code. Why? Because they are increadibly poor. I have just finished reading Deception Point, and I have to admit, I breathed a huge sigh of relief that I could finally move on to something else after enduring nearly 600 pages. The storyline was thin, and the further into the book you go, the more ridiculous it becomes. Far to often, it becomes too difficult to picture in your own mind what is happening as the description of action scenes is just so far fetched.My advice is enjoy and leave Dan Brown well alone after reading The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice conspiracy thriller","review":"This book reads like a cross between Jeffrey Archer and Clive Cussler (not only adventure, but adventure at the ends of the earth and in the sea). Lots of political intrigue mixed with life threatening adventure. The heroine is torn between loyalty to her father, and what she thinks is moral and just. The president comes off as sometimes a good guy, sometimes a bad guy - you have to wait to the end to find out the truth (which is nice). Dan Brown did an excellent job of creating a most unusual story with just enough scientific background to lend it enough credibility to make it a fun read. I loved how after the car was bombed, the reader had to wait several chapters to find out who was killed. The suspense was killing me.Overall, I found this book more enjoyable than The DaVinci Code. So if you are like me and like Clive Cussler's books, you must try this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could they all have been duped?","review":"Dan Brown's books are fast paced stories, but like Digital Fortress, Deception Point involves brilliant described who don't act brilliant. How can so many preeminent scientists be duped so easily. Also the Kiowa Warrior which destroyed the car and attacked the boat simply does not have the capabilities described. And even Delta Force couldn't fire a helfire missile in Washington DC without being tracked and shot down. As a helicopter pilot it annoys me when authors get the details so wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - Good Action - Tricky Plot","review":"Deception Point kept my interest, and challenged my mind as I read it. I really enjoyed this book and the twists and turns. It had everything a good thriller needs, bad guys, good guys, good guys that are bad, bad guys that are good, and a bit of a romance (without much actual sex to distract from the plot). I found some of the things in this book to be a bit unbelievable which is probably why I didn't give it 5 stars, but all in all it was pretty realistic and up-to-date with technology and science. I even learned a lot about ice-conditions and research (and some things about NASA and our government which are probably true, but not talked about openly!) I read this book nearly straight through, so it was a page-turner---definetly the sign of a must-read. Dan Brown is a fantastic writer and I think you will enjoy this one too.Meghan WierAuthorConfessions of an Introvert: The Shy Girl's Guide to Career, Networking and Getting the Most Out of Life"},{"rating":"1","title":"i keep hopeing it would get better","review":"After reading the back of this book, (and having just finished a book i loved by Dan Brown), I started this book ready to be taken on grate thrill ride. all throw this book however I keep thinking and hoping it would get better. it never did, there is one good part throw it ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written with a nonbelievable story line","review":"I read Deception Point expecting/hoping it would live up to the da Vinci Code. It did not. The characters were unbelievable and the plot was poorly done. The more I read the more I disliked the book.Save your money and your time. Read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"The plot and characters were great and it would make a terrific movie, but it read almost more like a screenplay than a novel. Lacking in character development. If you are just interested in an exciting story, it's fine. But if you really like to get into the lives of the people in the novels you read, I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely disappointing","review":"For those who have already read the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, this book is a severe let down. This is one of the first books that Dan Brown wrote and it shows. The story isn't developed nearly as well as the Da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons. Angels and Demons is where the reader can really tell that Dan Brown is becoming a good writer. Dan Brown wrote the Da Vinci Code after he finished Angels and Demons. In the Da Vinci Code I think he perfected his craft. You can see errors that he committed in Angels and Demons that he fixed in the Da Vinci Code.Deception Point is about cryptography, but if you like a story about a subject such as that I would much rather recommend Body of Secrets by James Bamford. It's a much more interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book! I would love to see this one made into a movie!","review":"This book is smart and thrilling! It has all of the intricately complex elements of \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons.\\" However, this book is NOT based on any religious content. Tom Clancy has seemingly stopped writing his Jack Ryan thrillers (unfortunately), and Grisham seems to take a two year vacation before starting each new book. So if you like these authors, you should love this book. Dan Brown has found a way to make this book just as compelling, but without the infinite detail of Clancy and by writing the book with a real ending (unlike Grisham)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reason I Read","review":"Dan Brown is the reason I read. I have never been a much of a reader, as a matter of fact Deception Point was the first book I read outside of school on my own free time. I picked it up by chance one day and started to read, I was immediately hooked. Not only did the storyline fascinate me, but the characters made me fall in love with this book. Each character, well important characters, had their own background story and events in their past that made them unique yet still relatable to people I personally know. Yes, the book was a little wordy at times and seems to drag on, but it still kept me interested. I have read several reviews of this book and it seems to be a love hate book, few are in between, but with a government conspiracy, plot twists, action, and some romance on the side, what's not to love?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Dan Brown's standards","review":"This book was just like his first book Digital Fortress. As I was reading the characters were almost the same. He also did not do his research on the military men the things he had them doing had me laughing throughout. I guess if your audience is not military this book is ok. I thought it was demoralizing to say that these elite fighters would kill americans like they were robots or something.

I wanted my money and time back after buying it and reading it. The plot is loose rip off Ice Station from Matthew Reilly a fantastic author. The twist at the end was ridiculous to say the least and made no sense.The book read like most of Dan 'thief' Brown works, microcosms of action with science fiction and historical fiction based in a present day scenario. These little sequences designed to keep the author reading without actually achieving anything whilst entertaining the reader with falsehoods of history and pseudoscience.If you enjoy reading good books stay away from Dan Brown, especially Deception Point - Worst book ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO STARS, REALLY","review":"Not recommended. Sleazy. Only picked it because my brain was mush right then. There were at least 35 cliffhangers ... and it just got to the point where I would laugh at a new cliffhanger ... and not even care what happened to the person. That said, there was some cool/creepy technology. Cool from a purely intellectual point of view. Creepy from a human vs. Big Brother point of view. For example, mini-bots. Tiny tiny robots in the shape of bugs - literally a fly on the wall that listens to people's conversations. A person can \\"drive it\\" all over -- into and out of rooms, into and out of buildings ... and spy on people. The book left a terrible margarine taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average","review":"I have read three Dan Brown books: Da Vinci code, Angels and Demons and this..although the other two books where average at best, this is just pathetic..the plot is incredibly thin and you can spot the twists from chapters away..something which is rather annoying since you're screaming at the characters who are really for some reason quite dim and require 100 pages to figure out simple facts.. also this book reads like a second or even third rate Hollywood action movie..full of false american notions regarding God, patriotism and many overemphasized dramatic moments..it seems once you make a name for yourself any piece of trash you publish is a classic..recycle this.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Started But Great So Far","review":"As in my title, I just began to read this book. However so far it is quite entertaining. Like his other fast paced books like Angels and Demons and the more popular and well-known Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown simply has a way with words. I am not very far into the plot though the idea so far seams very original. Most of our country sees NASA as a beneficial program that we need. Not many people on the other hand see it as a waste of money; our money. I would have to say that the majority of citizens in the US and maybe other countries see NASA as truly American as apple pie and the World Series. To get rid of it would be unthinkable. Brown challenges that idea in this book. The way Brown also combines technology with modern ideas even as recent as the Clinton Era make for a real page-turner. Overall, I think I am going to complete this book because I really have enjoyed it so far. That's 4 stars from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"goo","review":"Put simply, \\"Deception Point\\" is a poorly written book with the dialogue of a bad video game. I was willing to forgive that, expecting an exciting and suspenseful thriller. Unfortunately, this book lags through cliche and inconsequential character back stories, relentless technical jargon, and constant plot summarizations through inner monologues. Furthermore, Dan Brown's claim that all the technology described is real, makes the many technical inaccuracies and fantasies kind of pathetic. I never knew massive government coverups, aliens, and government assasins could be so boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once you've read one, you've read them all","review":"Typical of a freshly famous author, Dan Brown's old garbage has been released on the public. The same storyline, stereotypical characters, plot moments and endings happen in all of them.This and other non-DaVinci Code books of Dan Brown are repetitive and unimaginative, characterised by lack-lustre writing and the same old mind-numbing, lowest common denominator storyline. Don't waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Absolutely not typical of Dan Brown's work! This was a total waste of Dan Brown's great talents as a writer!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be deceived into thinking this is a good read","review":"After the first few pages, I should have known right off that Dan Brown still has that bigoted, narrow minded chip on his shoulder when an obvious Bill Clinton-type smarmy presidential candidate is labeled as a Republican. Because in Dan Brown world anybody remotedly conservative, or religious, is bad,bad bad bad and every liberal is good. Well I guess there is a reason this is under fiction!Very convuluted....preachy and pretty much boring....the book started sounding like Charlie Brown's teachers...wah wah wah wah wah.... If you LOVE Dan Brown, you might like this -- and as is typical of all his novels, make sure you have a heavy, heavy dose of suspending your disbelief (and that's just in the first few pages)!! Not worth buying, but maybe checking out at the library....only if you're on a desserted island and there's nothin' else to do.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"After reading Da Vinci Code, Digitial Fortress and Angels & Demons, this was a total let down.

Not only does this fictional story come across very realistically, it also has some great twists and surprises toward the end. Although slow moving at times, it is a quick read and will get you hooked in no time. The characters are very well developed and it is interesting how some people change ( Gabrielle Ashe, for example ) and some never change ( Sexton ). Pick this book up right now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It gets better and better","review":"Thanks to Dan Brown, I am now a fan of thrillers! I have read three out of four of his works, and I'm hooked. Deception POint is one read that's definitely unputdown-able. What can I say? The book kept me guessing about what happens next, and more often than not, I couldnt guess how the events will progress from page to page. Although his writing can be formulaic, I still enjoyed the book and how it kept me glued to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plot Twists, Power Struggles, and of Course ...Deception!","review":"I found the begining of this book to be a bit slow, but once I got into it I couldn't put it down. Brown is incredibly imaginative. Almost the entire story takes place in one day, and it is just amazing how much happens to the characters. Like every good thriller, not all of the likeable characters are good and not all of the unlikeable characters are bad. Brown definitely keeps the reader guessing until the very end. This book is well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last one","review":"I purchased this book for my daughter for Christmas. She has read all of his books except this one.

It's very \\"Dan Brown\\" as his stories go with great research (though people will claim differently) and description and he always seems to touch on very important subjects. In this case it's about Nasa and Space research.It also is very good with the supsense and thrills, and it seemed to be to a lot more action oriented which was really entertaining.The only thing i have to say about this, is that there really is no SUPER great twist at the end like i've come to see from hsi other books. You kind of already know what's going to happen by the middle of the book, and there is one tiwst that's not all that big, and a pertty funny one at the end, but that's about it.Still enjoyed it alot though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting pageturner","review":"Dan Brown has quickly become one of the most well known authors in the \\"keep you guessing\\" genre, and Deception Point has helped him reach that fame. Certainly an enthralling addition to any bookshelf, this read has all the makings of a great thriller... but gets almost too crazy towards the end. If made into a movie, it would be a Tom Cruise specialty, meaning unrealistically heroic scenarios and constant victories for the million-to-1 underdog.Nonetheless, Dan Brown has crafted another addicting yarn, leaving us wondering what he'll come up with next. Of course there's one thing we know for sure: his stories will be exciting and unpredictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good political thriller","review":"A NASA satellite discovers an unknown object buried deep in the Arctic ice and announces that it has found evidence of alien life form.

One of Brown's best books."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST narration ever!!!!","review":"This review is only for the narration (by Richard Poe). The book is great by the way. But I feel so ripped off by the annoying narrator I just had to get it out of my chest. Do a quick test and close your eyes. Now start making noises with your teeth, throat, lips, tongue, etc. Like swallowing saliva, sucking your teeth, licking your lips, and stuff like that. Now imagine listening to that through out the whole narration. Every 3 or 4 words Mr. Poe adds his \\"special touch\\". It is so incredibly distracting you can't even get into the story. It almost sounds like a home made audiobook recorded in the bathroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-Trick Pony","review":"Dan Brown, unfortunately, seems to be a one-trick pony. This book, which predates \\"The DaVinci Code\\" by about a year, follows pretty much the same ark. Two \\"heroes\\" (actually 3, but one is pretty much a throwaway) discover a secret, and are pursued by killers (Delta Force, instead of the Albino Priest), who are guided by the secret manipulator (The Controller, vs. The Teacher) who is a surprise when we find out who it is. Both stories take place in one continous swath over a day or two.Deception point also suffers from a generally preposterous plot. Brown invents far too many technologies, and doesn't do enough research on known technologies (do I really want to believe that a Los Angeles class submarine has enough space for an anechoic chamber in the middle?)Sorry, but I don't think I'll be picking up more works by Mr. Brown."},{"rating":"1","title":"science or comedy?","review":"As an engineer currently working for NASA, and as a former Lockheed Martin engineer, I found parts of the book sadly laughable. Dan Brown should stick to writing about historical things instead of trying to be the next Tom Clancy. Even Clancy occassionally gets it right. The editors should be fired for gross stupidity as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deception Point","review":"Reading ANY of Dan Brown's books is like seeing a good friend that has been away for too long. His stories are always compelling, well researched AND an easy read! Such a good book! I checked out a copy from the Library, and enjoyed it so much, I ordered this hardback to add to my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked the movie 2012, you may like this book","review":"I am astonished seeing this book received this many favorable reviews. The story line and actions scenes get so absurd that mission impossible and the movie 2012 look like documentaries. I would recommend that you read a short summary of this book if you are curious about Brown's first book and move on. Definitely not worth the money or the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappoints on many levels","review":"The writing style is predictable and full of uninteresting flat characters. That itself wouldn't necessarily kill the book as it is billed as a \\"smart thriller\\", not the next Anna Karenina. But the book fails to live up that expectation. It is full of plot holes, factual errors, and highly unlikely chains of events. Virtually nothing in the book seems even remotely believable. Dan Brown clearly forgot to do his homework on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"To predictable","review":"I read Digital Fortess, and then Deception Point.

For the past 30 years Motorhead have been nothing if not reliable (don't read that as predictable). And unswervingly dedicated to their style. Kiss Of Death continues the tradition and serves up a medley of hard and fast rockers, the occasional tricky time signature, the power-ballad (!) \\"God Was Never On Your Side\\", and satisfies like only Motorhead can. Lemmy can deliver some surprisingly thoughtful, and thought-provoking, lyrics at times.By now they are playing to their own audience and are a relic in this world of 2-minute attention spans and single-song downloads. So what!

It has basic movements and stances, but doesn't really cover all the kicks and movements of Taekwondo very well, but that is because it was written about forms, like I have said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poomse and nothing else","review":"The book covers the moves of every poomse, but lacks everything in covering the basic techniques.The basic kicks, stands and punches gets one (1) picture + a very short description each, so the movement is up to the reader to find out. I'm afraid a lot of beginners will get really bad techniques, if this book is the only source.The poomse's are covered in detail, and that's fine. Too bad the kicks, punches and stands are sometimes badly performed: Ms.Ricke seems to have only one front kick: The head section, even if it's describe as a kick to the middle section.The poomse's are great, the rest is fluff, and I 'm really annoyed that the original names for the moves are in english. It's a korean sport, and the three clubs I've attended has all used the real names, like Apchagi, Yopchagi etc....so it's a poomse-guide, and is nothing near a \\"Training manual\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Forms Reference","review":"I've been doing martial arts for about 10 years, and found this book useful for learning Taekwondo specific forms. I use it as a reference when trying to remember or learn a new form.

The book seemed to lack detail and had a certain, I dont know, \\"fakeness\\" to it. Of course it is Science Fiction, but I just couldn't find the characters believable. I think the author should have devoted a few more pages on character development and back story. I thought the beginning went too fast and could have provided more depth to the fanaticism of the Skyborn and their mysterious past. An okay read, but I found myself struggling to finish instead of anticipating the next read. Hopefully, the sequel will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Great bottle when running longer distances outdoors. It fits very nicely in hand without intrusion or having to grip it which would cause fatigue. It fits both myself (very petite) and my husband (very tall with big hands) very comfortably. The pocket is great for storing house keys and carmex so I don't have to wear a belt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked, pocket too small and strap loosened","review":"I'm new to running so I bought this bottle based on reviews and guessing it would fit the bill. Here what my experience was from a new runner's perspective:-Bottle leaks unless overtightened which can only mean it will strip with use.-Strap on back of hand kept slipping open while running.-Pocket is good for keys and maybe mini ipod but not a phone (as designed but I think it should be a bit bigger).-If you carry a cold drink (ice water), you had will freeze as it's against the bottle and not an insulated sleeve.-Stopper is hard to open/close...I couldn't use my teeth unless risk losing one.So for me it didn't work. Bummer I went past the return window."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good bottle to run with","review":"I've been using this bottle on every run I go on for the last 5 months. Anywhere from 5-15 mile runs. It is comfortable to carry, doesn't leak, and is easy to open and close. I am able to stuff 3 gels in the pocket with some cash. Alternately, I carry cash and my car key in the pocket. Sometimes it gets a little smelly, but you can easily remove the bottle holder and throw it in the washing machine. Only thing I can see that would make it better is that if it were insulated in some way. Since the bottle is in contact with your hand, cold water only stays cold about 20 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great holder, ditch the bottle","review":"I purchased this bottle/holder combo for use in marathon training. The holder works absolutely perfectly. The zipper on the pouch works flawlessly (unlike the one on the Camelback holder). This is critical, because I need to be able to open the zipper, take out a gel, and then return the empty gel pouch to the pocket...all while running. My only problem is the strap to tighten the holder over your hand...it's not sewn in, so it can come completely open if you're not careful. I tied a knot in the strap, and now it works just fine (more of a nuisance that I had to do that than anything else). I do like the reflective material on the holster. I ditched the bottle immediately for the Camelback thermo bottle to keep the fluids cool during the summer heat (and considering my hand it around the bottle the whole time).Overall, it works as it should. I suggest buying the Nathan hoster and the Camelback thermo bottle separately for the best combo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good container, but a pain to carry","review":"I purchased this thinking it would be a handy way to hold my water. However, with cold morning training runs, I found it annoying to carry. Not just \\"annoying\\" but rather that the bottle was cold, the carrier isn't well insulated, so my hands were cold within minutes. I will keep with my water belt and stay away from this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for short runs","review":"It has a secure, snug fit in your hand. It is a bit large for longer runs, 10+ miles. But would be great on an out and back course, leave it at mile 2 and pick up at mile 8. Overall, it's a great product. I would try out the smaller version for longer runs in the summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this bottle!","review":"I was a little skeptical about running with something in my hand, but I absolutely LOVE this bottle for my long runs! I barely notice I'm carrying it, as weird as it sounds. The only thing is, make sure the lid is on tight or a little bit of water leaks and makes your hand wet. If you put the lid on all the way there's no problem though!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky mouth piece","review":"I love the holster, and the bottle was a nice size but it doesn't stay closed. It leaks water when tilted or turned. I use the holster with a different bottle and I like it alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for long runs.","review":"This item is great for longs runs (8+ miles) as it allows me to run without stashing water bottles along my route. The hand strap is well padded and has a pretty stiff elastic on it so that the bottle stays in the hand without much effort. There is a little bit of sweat that gets built up in between the bottle and the hand but nothing that's too uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly constructed!!!!","review":"There are two problems with this water bottle. 1)Your hand rests right up against the water bottle effectively warming the water and icing your hand. 2)The mechanism which secures your hand to the bottle is attached to the elastic which goes around the neck of the bottle. Therefore, if you want the pressue against your hand to be tight, then it pulls on the elastic which weakens the security of the bottle to the pouch. I would not buy this item again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I am new to the running world and read the other reviews on this product. I decided to purchase it from REI. I am so glad that I did so that I could return it and get something better. The top is really difficult to unsrew which makes re-filling on a long run awkward. Also, the rubber pop-top leaks and is very hard to close. This is awkward to drink from while running."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets heavy and sweaty","review":"When I first purchase this, I loved it! I used it during my first half marathon and realized quickly that I did not love it. Your hand gets sweaty and it is annoying holding onto something for the entire race. Most races will have enough water stops along the way anyway but if you want to have your special blend of some energy drink, I suggest a fuel belt. The belts take a bit to get used to but you get to keep your hands free and you don't get sweaty palms. I kept switching hands during the race. The pocket on the front holds a decent amount of items, it has a loop to hold a key, which I used. I could also put shot bloks in there along with my id, credit card, and a $5. The bottle, like most bottles, will end up getting moldy if you don't clean and dry properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great, Must have for distance Runners","review":"I bought this because when I got on long runs on hot days, I got tired of carrying a water bottle. This makes it virtually effortless to carry because you don't even have to hold on. I love it and I even bought another one for my dad who is also a runner. The band that goes around the back of your hand is very comfortable and stays in place very well. The pocket on the front works great for car keys and is even big enough for my asthma inhaler. Also, the water bottle comes out of the holder very easily and you can use other water bottles with the holder. Very nice for when one is dirty. Overall I have no complaints and it is a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Work","review":"This book goes well beyond mere postures and meditation. The 450 pages are filled with 14 lessons, each designed to be studied for two weeks each. The lessons each contain:* Philosophy* Postures* Breathing* Routines* Healing* Diet* Meditationsas well as a CD with guided meditations and lectures. The philosophy portion was an exceptional read and insight. While I don't and likely won't practice Raja Yoga, Swami Kriyananda makes the teachings accessable, and the philosophies are exceptional. A good work even if only for the philosophical elements, the work itself will get you thinking about the transformative and enlightening power of Yoga. If you have interest in the subject, it is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good Enough","review":"I just got a Cool Sweep and am disappointed.

THIS IS NOT THEIR BEST WORK. You can totally tell that someone else dictated this album. If you want to hear what Everything is really about, go out and buy their album Solid.

The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that its not ideal for travel. I put it in my suitcase for a weekend trip, but it took up a large portion of the space.

No kidding! Not to mention, I almost felt a little \\"high\\" from use after a week! Now, I use this light almost every day for 1/2 hour and am 2 1/2 months into the purchase. I have recommended this to all my friends and family. Living in the Upper Midwest, we are so deprived of light during the winter months and this is my new recommended treatment to anyone who suffers a little bit of Seasonal Affective Disorder. It is a true concern and this light has been an amazing treatment for it! Much better than taking the mind-altering meds that are often prescribed by physicians! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this item!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Made of awesome","review":"I have been dithering about whether to buy one of these lights for seasonal depression for about 10 years.

Within 15-20 minutes, I am awake naturally.Have you ever gone camping and found yourself unable to sleep once the sun came up? That is what the Happy Light does for me, except I get to be in control of the light.The Happy Light has saved me from wanting to hit the snooze button three times, from needing excessive amounts of coffee, and from being late to work.

We have this lamp on a timer in our windowless office, where it provides indirect sun-quality light all day long. I'd have to quit without it.

It makes all the difference in keeping my mood healthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do You Have SAD? Give This A Try!","review":"I have been diagnosed with Seasonal Affective Disorder. If I don't spend at least 20 minutes outside in the sun each day, I start feeling sluggish, lethargic, and turn to carbs (which makes me gain weight and then I get depressed). If this sounds all too familiar to you, try using the HappyLight.My doctor advised me to go for a walk every morning; which is the most helpful thing I can do. However, I find it hard to go out in the bitterly cold winter. Also, fish oil, vitamin D, and exercise help a lot. But rainy, dismal days still bring me down. So after researching the science behind full spectrum light therapy (using at least 10,000 LUX) I decided to try the HappyLight. What a difference! After sitting near the light (12 inches away; for an hour early every morning) for only a few weeks, I have WAY MORE ENERGY! I really love the HappyLight and wish I'd tried it much sooner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely poor customer service","review":"I bought one of their products and when I opened the box, plugged it in, it worked for about 30 seconds.

Living in Minnesota, I tend to get depressed in February, so wanted to see if the light would help. Starting in Oct/Nov 2003, I began turning it on at desk height at my work for the suggested amount of time. I did not use it on weekends.Anyway, I think that it helped me keep from sinking so low with the SAD blues in February, but it did not completely keep SAD away. I spent 4 days on the beach in Florida during the 3rd week of February, and that helped the most.I will indeed use the light again this winter, because it helps--but does not eliminate--SAD for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm","review":"I have suffered from Seasonal Affective Disorder all my life. My first lamp was one I bought from a competitor 10 years ago. I have got to say this Verilux lamp is amazing compared to the old one. The light is a soft whitish-blue, not harsh at all. When it turns on there is little \\"warm up\\" time. The cost is especially worth it...as my first lamp was $250. If you just need a boost during the day try the Mini version. I have one on my desk at work...and it really helps me stay focused.If you suffer from SAD a light literally changes your world. Every fall I start using a lamp to wake up starting in September. Within 3 days I notice a significant difference in my attitude. Not only that, I have noticed that my thinking is more clear, and especially sharp throughout the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incessant sales brochures from company","review":"If you order anything from Verilux they will send you brochures every two months for years.

The camera is only carried in this case and is removed to take pictures. That would have been at least acceptable for use, but after the camera too easily fell out of it on the blacktop parking lot, I don't use it on my belt any more. The sides of the case are too shallow and elastic, and the cover is held by a clever magnetic catch that doesn't work too well. The camera endured only a very small nick, but I was lucky.

I have all these songs, but to get it one album was awesome. The two new releases were cool. I am glad to see them get back together with Bob Rock. Maybe they will get back to the great Crue of the Dr. Feelgood erea. Also liked the cover art. Would liked to have seen a few more songs on the album. But the songs on it are all great.

The 2 songs are pretty good, but with the original albums and Decade, this means that many songs have been released for a THIRD time! THEN, all individual albums will be released again next year with extra songs on each (making a FOURTH time that some songs will be released).

It has a good beat, and a...slightly good moral. While it talks about \\"following your heart\\", it also talks about breaking the rules.I personally think that Hilary Duff is a big phony, and she makes me sick. She's trying so hard to be a \\"bad girl\\" that she looks like an idiot! The reason Hilary and Avril Lavigne don't get along, I think, is because Hilary is copying Avril so much. She's trying to break away from her \\"Lizzie McGuire\\" image, even though many more people liked her then. I think Hilary just wants money, and she's trying everything to get it.

One of the difficulties of CMM is the application of the model to the right extent in the right context. This book has made it simple to understand what the essential project management aspects in CMM are and how to use them effectively. This is a simple-to-read-and-understand book. One good thing I liked about the book is that it's precise, to the point dealing of topics; no less, no more. Less theory and more practical implementation details from a high maturity organization. Grteat amounts of insights into the actual practices and data of a high maturity organization is a huge bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Substantial","review":"This book is beneficial only to those readers who have never managed a software development project. The author essentially provides a high-level overview of the project management processes used at Infosys, an organization which reached CMM level 5.

Liberal journalists are the ones who will faithfully detail how and why your flesh is being flayed off your body by the corporate-government elite. Thank you, very much. By presenting all sides, we get no ground to stand upon, no point of view. We get some critical remarks tossed off next to corporate jargon about competition.

The book is useful if you want the author's personal reasons for investing in condo's vs. other investments. He sees them as low hassle/risk v. reward and gives his reasoning.

Adler and Charles Van Doren describe the fourth level of reading. Synoptical reading challenges the reader who, having carefully and thoroughly understood several individual works, strives to hear the conversation of their ensemble. \\"Labyrinths\\" brings us the dreamlike reflections of Argentine author Jorge Luis Borges's profoundly synoptical reading. Borges heard the conversation of writers across cultures, centuries, languages, genres. Then he came back to outline over and over the one nearly infinite and unattainable truth in these stories, essays, and parables.Yet Borges's writings remain humble and personal. With the voice of a shy, erudite uncle, Borges recounts magical reveries that came to him deep in the stacks of some dim basement of the library. Throughout the text the reader feels at once the quiet loneliness of the bookworm, the presence of the immortal, and the terrible portents in the twilight rustling of leaves."},{"rating":"2","title":"A flight in an unusual world: a library","review":"I read \\"Labyrints\\" three times in my life, and every time it was incredibly different, every time I got lost in that weird world that is Borges' mind, every time I was amazed by the genius of this author, every time this book changed me and I think it's going to chang you too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this book immensely","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely; not just the fiction, but the essays and parables as well.The stories were thought-provoking and engaging beyond belief. They ran the gamut from murder and mystery to magic and fantasy.The essays and parables offered a minor counterpoint in flavor, but succeeded in rounding out the entire set rather completely. They functioned as insight and humor into the self-aware thought processes and mind of Borges.Typographical errors were surprisingly abundant throughout. They did not serve to detract from the content any, but mildly agitated my anal tendencies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Boring SF","review":"This book is filled with short stories of bad boring science fiction.

Borges, in my opinion, exemplifies post-modern thought even better than Lyotard and Derrida. His style is very different, although that could be due in part to translation, and really forces you to have an open mind.It is interesting to note the sheer number of people highly influenced by Borges. From Hofstadter to Jantsch his ideas seem to have influenced many; you are unlikely to escape unscathed.There are, if I remember correctly, at least 40 stories in here. I suspect it will take a while to read them all and longer to understand them but it is well worth the journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting style","review":"Neko Case offers an interesting approach to popular music and progressive country. Having heard her latest album, Fox Confessor, I was eager to see her live. This DVD was my next best opportunity. She played with a small ensemble of tight musicians and a back-up singer, and they played surprisingly well, if not dramatic. Neko seemed extremely nervous on the Austin City Limits stage, and she admits to being over-joyed to be on the program. Nonetheless, she was very adept at playing her music, which is a mix of country, folk, and light jazz-rock. It will be interesting to see where she goes from here. I would recommend this performance if you haven't seen Neko case, or even if you haven't heard her music. She is a very interesting singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Neko :)","review":"Neko is one of my favorite artists... her vocal range is amazing and she is pretty funny at shows too.

As was the case with her first live album, \\"The Tigers Have Spoken,\\" which actually was recorded after this one, in March and April of 2004, the overall sound on \\"Live From Austin TX\\" is alt-country. Unlike its predecessor, however, the music is more stripped down and there really are no uptempo rockers. While I slightly prefer the mix of songs on \\"The Tigers Have Spoken,\\" the sparser instrumentation and slower tempo songs on \\"Live From Austin TX\\" really allow Neko's strong voice to come to the forefront, which provides further evidence that she really knows how to belt out a tune. All 14 tracks are very good. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food, in it's purest form, really can be medicine","review":"Glad I bought this book.

Sorry to say that I'm not sure the rest of the book is any better than chapters 1 & 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music kicks a**, vocals bring the star rating down","review":"I am a huge electric blues fan, as well as a Blues Brothers enthusiast, but on this CD there's at least one guy (not Aykroyd) who is hollering along but can't sing, and it comes off sounding like some drunken college dudes singing along in a bar.

If this is the only Blues Brothers CD you own, you must check out the rest- the others are great, and they don't suffer from inferior vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play it loud","review":"I have not played this cd in several years and decided to give it a spin. The intro started and it gave me goose bumps as though I was at the concert. It just took off from there and I turned up the speakers, by the time Sweet Home Chicago started my walls were shaking.

Being a child of the 90's and growing up on the songs of the 80's, I was never into the music of the 60's.But I find myself strangely attracted to this band and this album. No, more than attracted.

I suspect she believes she is exposing some great social problem that whites have to recognize and solve.In the book, the black women are portrayed as horrible sex-driven pseudo-parents who are only concerned with getting an orgasm. The black men are criminals, also sex-driven and useless. Only the white characters have any redeeming qualities and they are called upon to solve the blacks' problems.The book went on way too long and we all know how it ends from just reading the title. Better luck next time, Ms. George."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow","review":"I love Inspector Lynley books but this one is very, very boring. Took me forever to get through it. I was disappointed needless to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"200 pages too long","review":"I was tempted to stop reading in the early part of the book, but forced myself to continue - a 12 hour plane ride will do that! The book would have had more impact if it was 200 pages shorter: The prelude was on the point of being tedious, with the incessant piling on of troubled youth, an insane mother, oversexed black women and a dilect that was difficult to read, and the undeveloped poetic genius of an 11 year old boy. Do all poor London people, blacks as well as Arab, talk like this? - The denouement was anticlimatic, with it's almost \\"Law and Order\\" fading out before resolution is presented. I assume that this is merely a way of leading into a sequal."},{"rating":"1","title":"I need therapy after reading this book","review":"This is the first book that I have read by author, Elizabeth George. I don't know if it would have been more enjoyable to me if I had read some of her other books, but I doubt it. It was just one bad thing after another happening to the three children in the book. I would cringe every time Joel would leave the house, afraid he would be beaten. Anytime there was a ray of hope that any of the children would rise above their circumstances, something horrible would happen and they would be even worse off than before. When I finally finished the book, I felt sickened.I suppose the book did offer a look at how kids enter a gang lifestyle and get stuck in it. I need to read a happy book now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I read this with my book club and opinions were mixed; some loved it and others hated it. One of our club didn't even finish it. This book definitely conjured up strong feels among our readers.As a fan of Elizabeth George, I was disappointed in this one. It is not a book I will recommend to friends and I will never consider re-reading it.I did not like the dialogue and found it hard to understand at times. I found the plot line frustrating. The only central character with redeeming qualities falls to the tempations of the streets.This is not one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time with this book","review":"Like the other reviewers, I am a fan of the Lynley books, and bought George's latest novel in hardcover - a move I regret. I can't recall a book I've read in my recent memory that I enjoyed less. I made myself finish it, but feel the need to write my first review of a book here on Amazon. Problem number one is that we know how it will end. We have no hope that after trudging through this book, (thankfully it is much shorter than some of her novels) we will find light at the end of the tunnel. There is no happy ending, there is not even a glimmer of hope. The characters are superficially described; we learn briefly that each has a tough past with which they must deal, but there is no deep delving into any of the characters. George goes out of her way to write the book in phonetic Caribe-African London slang, yet she has no ear for it, so the \\"authentic\\" dialogue reads forced and fake.I appreciate her desire to try something new, but this attempt was a disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"what dull and really, really wrong?","review":"Be warned before you buy: George's newest book is not a mystery. Nor does it have any of her standard characters.Instead, George wants to examine the events that lead up to a murder. This is like asking how evil happens. In someone else's hands, this could have been a breathtaking book. But George can't think outside of cliches.Nietzche's response to good and evil was to deny that either existed, since there has to be a God for there to be a right and wrong, and Nietzche claimed God was dead. George agrees, to an extent. At least here she argues that the murder was no one's fault, really. Everybody involved simply had these awful, compelling reasons. It's the cry of every burglar and murderer and cheater in the world. \\"It just happened! I didn't mean for it to happen!\\"George preens over her ready sympathy and deep insight into the tragic lives of these characters. Her readers get to suffer through this long, bad, silly novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not have been more disappointed","review":"Horrible and depressing waste of time and heart.

If so it lacks any validity. It is simply a boring dribble of excuses for the shooting of helen. I forced myself to read most of this book - hoping for SOMETHING to justify the waste of my time & countless reams of paper used to print it. Finally, I did something I rarely do. I tossed it into the recycle bin. Even my local 2nd hand book store did not want it, 25 other people had already dumped theirs off in mint condition.

Done reading her books for good after this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome addition to George collection!","review":"I love the Lynley/Havers books - and when I first began to read this account of the life of the boy who shot Helen, I was very disappointed. However, I stuck with the book and I found myself unable to put it down. The characters are very realistic and I hope George continues the tale. Not only are the characters sociological significant, they are also deserving of empathy. Definitely worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elizabeth George Chicanery","review":"The New York Times mass-market fiction paperback best seller list ranks this book 11 out of 20 with it being on the list for one week.

I would never buy it and I would never buy another book written by Elizabeth George, trickster."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't read it","review":"I was a loyal Elizabeth George fan for many many years, but the brutal and rather pointless murder of one of the most sympathetic characters in the last book made me so angry that I tossed the thing out. I guess that I'm being stupidly sentimental, but if I want to get really depressed and read about disadvantaged, messed up and deprived people who murder senselessly, I can watch the news. I won't read this, or any other Elizabeth George books. I know that she's a good writer and will probably not suffer too much from losing my support, but I gotta protest this somehow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Lynley But Stands On It's Own","review":"It took me about a year to warm to reading this book. I was mad that George decided to write this novel. I wanted only to read about Havers and Lynley and how they were coping with the devastating death of Helen and her baby. But this book was a pleasant surprise. It was intriguing and well plotted. I enjoyed it very much and I found that I have a better knowledge of the city in which Havers and Lynley operate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!!!1","review":"SOOO disappointed in this book. Wish I could get a refund. Elizabeth George should be ashamed to pass something like this off on her fans! As far as I'm concerned I won't be buying anymore of her books!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"This book is a hanuting look into the lives of disadvantaged families and children in London. It is troubling and not a comfortable book to read. I find myself thinking about the children, Vanessa, Joel, and Toby, as well as their aunt and her friend. Elizabeth George has delivered her usual beautifully crafted novel. To look back at the events she portrays is like watching a line of dominos tumble, one by one. I highly recommend this thoughtful, insightful troubling book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither Fish Nor Fowl","review":"I am so glad I borrowed rather than bought What Came Before He Shot Her. I have been a fan of George's writing till now, but after this tome I'll proceed with caution. If George had stuck to the story, which certainly had plenty of tension, rather than breaking it with her sociological asides, it would have been much better. I got really tired of her explaining in depth why Ness reacted the way she did, how Kendra felt, etc.Aren't writers constantly told \\"show, don't tell?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Drab and dull","review":"Overly didactic and utterly pedantic, I didn't even finish Ms. George's latest book, \\"What came before he shot her\\". I am not interested in her viewpoints on social ills, I am interested in a good story. Alas, this does not a good story make! It is boring. It is dry. Besides, handwringing and making excuses for the evils that people commit based on a perception that social ills bring about behaviors that would not occur otherwise, is ignorant in the extreme and just another version of utopian thinking. Unfortunately, this is the malarkey that Ms. George feeds us with this novel. Again, I don't read a book to be lectured and that is really all this book is, a lecture disguised as a novel.As a fan of her Lynley/Havers characters, I will read the next book because her past work with those characters has been superb, and for that reason, I give her a pass on this dull endeavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly tedious, slow moving and generally boring","review":"There is no doubt that Elizabeth George is a marvelous writer. I have previously read and own all of her novels. Prequels can be interesting reads in many cases, but this isn't one of them. Writing in dialect is a dangerous chance a writer takes because it makes for a difficult, often boring read. This novel is 548 pages of tedious dialect representative of a lower class that is well done enough to draw us into the sad story and begin to understand how they speak. I'm sorry but it is much more than I want to know. As a mystery buff, I read for enjoyment and the suspense of the story--NOT in order to raise my social consciousness. This novel is NOT a good choice for a fan of George's work. I wish I hadn't bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary and didactic","review":"I give this book 2 stars instead of one because the author's intentions are good and she tried something different -- a star for boldness.Unfortunately it just doesn't work. She piles woes on her dysfunctional family until Job looks like a lucky winner by comparison. But she fails to make us care very much about any of them. If ever a novel induced \\"compassion fatigue\\" this was it.I hope she returns to the tried and true in her next novel. It may be formulaic but it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment - don't even borrow from the library!","review":"I have read all of Elizabeth George's books and have found some in the series needlessly dark and some just not all that interesting, but on the whole I am a huge fan of her work. Her last book before this one brought a much needed new spark to the series with a cliff hanging ending. So, I immediately bought this one when it came out in hardback -- I never buy other than paperback -- since I couldn't wait to find out what happened to Lynley and group! I was hugely disappointed to be dragged into a tedious story about a group of kids whom I could not even pretend to care about in the underbelly of London. What a waste! I'll be much more cautious about the next book but certainly hope she gets back on track with her usual family of characters whom we have all grown to love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome to the Sewer","review":"This book follows three children of London's underclass from their precarious perch on the edge of society through their descent into hell. The family's limited options and bad choices end up becoming just a painful (and far too long) litany of one bad experience after another.While it is well written, it's just too depressing. A couple hundred pages might have worked, but who has the stamina to stay engaged with this tragic family for the full 700+ pages? I certainly didn't!Save yourself some heartbreak and find something else to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Long Sad","review":"WHAT CAME BEFORE HE SHOT HER by Elizabeth George was a title I let slip to the bottom of the pile because it was so thick and had fine print.

In this it's one horrible sick person after another. One pities the innocent children who are emotionally abused page after page. I admit to barely being able to get a hundred pages in but I couldn't inflict myself with her morbid story with no relief in sight. If you're a contented person and would like to be terribly depressed, this is the ticket! Skip it and try any other Elizabeth George work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"A pointless book to explain a pointless murder in a previous book. This was a very sad story, and one that needed to be told, but it really could've been done in far fewer pages. The character of Joel didn't flesh out to me though. He was too street smart to fall for everything the Blade was having him do. That just didn't make sense to me, that he would be completely blinded by the needed to protect his family. He knew how things worked. His actions didn't ring true in a book that was supposed to deliver a searing truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"background would have helped","review":"The book was a slightly difficult read due to the frequent use of lower class British vernacular in dialogue. If you can get past that, you will find a long and occasionally interesting story with several digressions and slow exposition. It finishes with several loose ends, though after looking at other reviews here I know that if you've read one of her other books things do make some more sense. I picked this up at random to read on a long flight. I am not inclined to read anything else by the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Lynley to be found","review":"After waiting excitedly for the next installment of the Lynley mystery series, I grabbed this book without bothering to read reviews. Guess what? No Lynley. Just a depressingly grim, not very well-written diatribe about dysfunctional families. It's full of lurid details but nary a mystery in sight. You can bet I'll check out George's reveiws for her NEXT book before I waste money on another clunker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hockey Pucks have more personality.....","review":"What a shameful waste of paper, this writing falls so far short of George's ability as a novelist, one would wonder if she really was at the pen. Boring, beginning to end, not enough oomph to keep awake for an entire chapter if used for bedtime reading. London slang was never this uncolourful until George's coined gutterspeak blossomed in triplicate monotonously throughout the book. Moving to Seattle must have put the author into a depressed mode, thumbs down, moving on to someone consistent after this disaster....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take an antidepressant before trying to read this!","review":"While the author takes the reader deeply into the lives of a dysfunctional family, this stark look at the reality of their lot in life is depressing and unentertaining. With no story, there are only descriptions of events that lead to an appalling crime, that I suppose tie into some other book she has written. Perhaps having read that book would make this one more interesting, but maybe that is a long shot. It could have been meant to be a psychological study of what could make a child behave in unlawful ways, but it just took too long to do it. When I finished the book, my only thought was that I had wasted too many hours. Just a note - this book is riddled with street slang from Britain, and some of it is a reach for the typical American reader. I cannot recommend such a dreary book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer of a Book","review":"As a avid fan of the Lynley/Havers mysteries, this book is a huge disappointment. This book was the #1 item on my Christmas list, I relished opening it up and diving in. Ugh, what a mess. Granted Elizabeth George is a gifted writer and delivers a family you won't forget--but, and it's a big but, they are a mess, with basically nothing redeeming or enduring about them. It reminds you on almost every page of just how awful teenagers can be and how screwed up people can get.

She's as strong as ever here.I'm surprised there's been no comment on the fact that hidden in this book are seeds that suggest Helen's death was not random after all. The character Blade, whose main purpose here is to brutally maneuver 12 year-old Joel into unredeemable evil, is also shown to be powerful enough to call in favours with the cops, although Ms. George is mum on how Blade achieved this level of power or which cops he's paying off. Perhaps she's saving it up for the next book, a showdown between Blade and his corrupt policemen and an out-for-revenge Lynley and Havers.So quit crying, see the big picture, and appreciate this book already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid book from my favorite author","review":"First let me say that I read five books a week and Ellizabeth George is my favorite author.

I was really disappointed in this book and wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misery","review":"Misery for the reader, and for all the characters. I am a huge fan of Elizabeth George and have read all her Inspector Lindley books. I bought this book with a great sense of anticipation. What a let down!

I feel that what was just put before us in the shape of \\"What Came Before He Shot Her\\" were her working notes--background that the author needed to set up a real Lynley/Havers yarn.

Elizabeth George is a master at the nuances of character and \\"What Came Before He Shot Her\\" is a beautiful example of her writing at its best. Your heart is literally wrenched as you follow the incredibly sad childhoods of the three Campbell siblings and how they grapple and cling to a normal life even as it slips away from them on a daily basis. I particularly liked the character of Aunt Ken, so believable as she tries and then fails, is hopeful and then hopeless, at caring for her family. The picture George draws of the streets of London are frightening but so well described that you read the passages thinking, \\"Why are these children walking these streets\\"? What a beautifully crafted work. I can't wait for the next Lynley novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly bad","review":"I have enjoyed all of her previous books. I was so turned off by this book that I will not buy another written by her. I could only slog my way through half of it before I gave up in disgust.

I could not beleive they were real and if they were, they were so uninteresting as to drive you to read an old Agatha Christie novel for the 5th time with great anticipation even though I knew the outcome by heart.It actually makes me angry every time I think about it - just written to make money from her previous fame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant: Listen to it on audio for the best experience","review":"The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars is that the ending was too abrupt, and we're left hanging AGAIN. I didn't want to like this book, but it is haunting me. The audio version is compelling, and you'll get past having to read the patois and slang, when read aloud it flows nicely. I didn't want to have sympathy for these characters, knowing how it will come out, but I did. If you thought this was a Lynley/Havers book, you're an idiot. All you have to do is read the flyleaf or the basic description of the story. This is what happened BEFORE Helen Lynley was shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Dissappointing","review":"Could Elizabeth George possibly address any issues more depressing and with no possible solutions.

The inside flap misled me that this was a Thomas Lynley-Barbara Havers book, and I read over 100 pages before I realized they were nowhere to be found. This book is disturbing, depressing, and has no entertainment value whatsoever. I found it exploitive - George labors to make us truly care about a character before she completely destroys them. Prior to this, I would have ranked George one of my top favorite current authors. I will never invest $30 in a George hardcover book again. For readers of the series, skip it. I wondered if the PBS miniseries would take too much of the author's time. Having read this book, I think I have my answer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Read - Way different than others","review":"I have always looked forward to books by Elizabeth George and eagerly purchase every one, but this one was terrible!!! The dialog was hard to read with all of the black English and the plot sucked!!! I plowed through it, hating every moment. She should go back to writing in her normal style.

I think judicious editing would have been useful.In short, I am not going to be anxious to read her next book"},{"rating":"1","title":"What came before he shot her","review":"I am so disappointed in Elizabeth Georges new book. In fact it was so bad that I had to stop reading it not even half way through. Instead of a wonderfully intricate story built around the lives of her characters: Inspector Linley, Barbara Havers etc. we are submitted to a gritty London Urban tale that is not entertaining and very predictable. Also the dialogue is mostly written in heavy dialect that is a strain to read. I read for escape and not to be confronted with the urban plight that I know exists and am sorry for. It seems George has gone the way of Minette Walters and so has probably lost a significant readership."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ending, unless a sequel's on the way","review":"[[ASIN:0060545631 What Came Before He Shot Her]When I finished reading this book, I promptly threw it in the recycling bin instead of donating it to the library because I don't want to subject anyone else to reading this. She's a very good writer, that's evident, but I feel as if I wasted so much time reading this 700+ page book to have so many loose ends. Disappointing ending is an understatement. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Came Before He Shot Her","review":"What a let down when I started reading this book, I had been waiting months for the new Elizabeth George novel with Inspector Lynley and all his sidekicks. What do I get? A lesson in class and race and why the disenfranchised have a reason to kill."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful read","review":"I have been an avid Lynley/Havers fan for many years, and I admit I read What Came Before He Shot Her hopeful they would appear. Nonetheless, this was one of the most emotionally gripping novels I've read in recent years, I could not put it down. The author's graphic style allowed me to feel as if I lived and breathed the Campbell children's experience from the inside. Having just finished the book, I miss them. Being a believer in the ultimate good of all people and that, in the case of our young Joel he was a very good soul and the fault was not his that the book ended in such a tragedy, I hope Elizabeth George will find it in her heart to create a way out for Joel, perhaps Barbara Havers will do the compassionate thing and go in search of the truth, and allow Joel the opportunity to mature and redeem himself.In any case, in my opinion, this was an excellent novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Clue, folks, is in the title","review":"The title of this \\"mystery\\" bothered me from the get-go. Is Ms. George going to present a sociological treatise? Yes, after 100 pages I decided to skim the rest of the book and could see it heading where I assumed it would be heading from the beginning - revving up all the situations everyone has read about the plight of poverty and racisim in Britain [as well as elsewhere]. A mystery? - well, here's the problem and deception. It really should not be placed in this category. As a mystery I give it 1 star; as a sociological tract I give it 3 - not much insight is offered in the pages; we are given \\"What Happened Before...\\" but that could have been done in a 10 page summary. I agree with those who were overwhelmed with the unrelenting tedium of bleakness presented in the book. Books exposing the horrors of poverty and racisim abound in the libraries of the world, we don't need another that just \\"dramatizes\\" the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is this??","review":"As usual, I looked forward to Ms. George's new book with enthusiasm....I even went to a book signing. I should have known from the way she spoke of the genesis of the book, and of the change in style, that something not so hot was going on. I will probably never finish this book......I find it dull and pedantic, have no feelings for the characters and also find it difficult to read the local patois or whatever it is. I am so disappointed.........is there less than 1 star??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trust the reviews","review":"Despite the bad reviews, I bought the book on sale because I really like Elizabeth George and thought if I knew going in that it wasn't like her mysteries, I might like it. Wrong! It was long winded, depressing and went no where. You would be better off reading the newspaper about real events which can be depressing enough but at least might inspire you to do something to help in some way, but this book just inspires one to watch TV!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing storyline","review":"I guess everyone is right when they say you either liked or hated this book, because I hated it. Boring right from the start when discussing poverty and hatred among the British, and the entire storyline dealing with these chilren involved in what came about in the end. No reason for what happened and nothing involving the Lynley's beforehand. Such a poorly written story, and I will make certain I read more in the book before I consider purchasing her next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Came Before He Shot Her","review":"This is possibly the worst book I have ever read. It hard to read; it is depressing and the ending makes you wish you had not wasted the time it took to read it.What Came Before He Shot Her"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate 722 pages","review":"I am an Elizabeth George fan but this was something else. I did persevere thinking that it might redeem itself at some point but was totally disappointed. The characters were flat and underdeveloped. The plot was a sad statement of aspects of life that however true or untrue were presented in a fashion that lacked interest. What was claimed to be a mystery was no mystery at all and even though pronounced as \\"profoundly moving\\" was neither profound nor moving. Sorry Ms. George, I will look forward to your next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not that bad!","review":"I'm also a big fan of Elizabeth George. This book is not that bad! Yes, it's depressing, but Ms. George's novels aren't exactly light hearted. It takes you to the darker side of life, which isn't that different from the majority of authors out there now. Jodi Picoult doesn't exactly lighten up my day, for example. This book is well written, pulled together nicely, and is very realistic. You are pulled into these characters, you root for them, you want to help them. I knew what was going to happen but I still kept hoping for a way out. If you are a fan of Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers, you will want to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't dis this book so fast","review":"I, too, was disappointed that it wasn't a Lynley-Havers story, but I read it anyway and was compelled by it. I found it heartbreaking and tragic and couldn't stop reading it. Definitely a dark story, but one worth knowing. I kept pulling for the Campbell children and their aunt til the inevitable end. I found the dialect hard to follow at times and couldn't quite get all the characters straight. I hope there will be more on this subject and perhaps hope for the hopeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Get over it, you disappointed Lynley/Havers fans. What a brilliant writer this woman is. After totally devastating loyal readers with the shooting at the end of the last installment, she has done an absolutely amazing job weaving together the lives that led to this murder. I am sure she will go back to the story of her \\"regulars\\", but who can deny her character development, her understanding of children and their psychological make-up, and the elements that combined to create this \\"killer\\"! WOW. This is one of the best constructed novels I have read in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Came Before He Shot Her","review":"Highly recommended reading. So many readers are complaining about not getting the book they wanted from Elizabeth George. I found the sociological comments fascinating as they are very carefully woven into an extremely thoughtful story. Elizabeth George's characters are well drawn as is always the case and the plot moves right along never giving away too much and delivering for the reader. The reader can always depend on the author to be meticulous in her presentation and writing. She is at the top of her game in this novel and further demonstrates her skill as a fine novelist. Taking on issues that compel and force the reader to think. This is a fresh and different approach for the author which I thoroughly enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book!","review":"I cannot believe that while she was writing this book that she thought it was good. I have read all her novels and this was boring. The worst book she has ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"the dialect is my problem","review":"I have given up halfway through this book - something I seldom do. Why? It was not the lack of Lynley and Havers, or the story itself. It was the unrelenting use of dialect. Whether the local speech is rendered accurately or not I cannot say, but it was like reading a 500+ page book written as a text message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, even without Linley and Havers","review":"I hadn't the opportunity to read the critics regarding this book. (it was my first Kindle purchase) and, having read about 6 previous books of the Linley saga, I directly ordered 2 more after receiving my new toy.I was a little disappointed not finding Linley or Havers, but after 3 or 4 pages, Mrs. George trapped me as she always does. It took almost as long to get used to the slang she is using here and after that I couldn't stop reading. Really can't understand the few people rating this book with less than 5 stars!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Elizabeth George","review":"I especially love the early George books, where I could enjoy a great mystery and cared about all the characters.But aren't we all a \\"wee bit\\" tired of the caucasion bashing found in her recent books?Come on Elizabeth! Go back to writing great mysteries & drop the preaching to the reader....."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"I hated this book with a passion. i love books in general and Elizabeth George is one of my favorite authors, but i hated this one so much that i was tempted to actually burn it. i decided i won't be buying any more of her books, but i have relented enough to at least give one more book oh hers a try by getting it from the library.WHY did i hate it so much? mainly for the nonexistent ending; the rest i seem to have blocked out. :-p"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeeks","review":"Truly horrible. Insanely repetitive situations and very little progress of plot-- I did not finish the book. After the fifth time-- eighth time-- nineteenth time?-- the kid gets beat up by the neighborhood psychopath-- OK, I get it!Forsyte."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting concept and story","review":"It is really distressing to see readers demanding that a writer like George must only write stories with her continuing characters. Think how boring that must get for the writer. Is she not allowed a deviation from the standard storyline? Some of you remind me of the character in Misery, who mained the writer for killing off the heroine. When Helen Lynley was killed we knew it was a 12 year old boy but nothing about why it happened. I don't think that George is excusing the killers, nor do I think she has made them overly sympathetic. Sorry folks, but poverty does breed crime and this well-written tale simply looks at some examples of how wrong things can go even when the people involved are not all bad. I enjoyed this sad tale, even knowing how it would turn out. And just because George is not poor and lives in America, she is not excluded from writing a well researched story about a side of life few of us want to acknowledge, much less do anything about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Downer","review":"Depressing setting, characters and world view. Tawdry sex, drugs and teenage girls playing hooky. I threw the book in the garbage after 136 pages. Don't waste your money or your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Came Before He Shot Her","review":"Unreadable. If you're an Elizabeth George fan, save your money. I hope she got some personal satisfaction/benefit/literary stretch from this because that would be the only thing that might make the destruction of trees for its publication somewhat justifiable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lynley/Havers Fans - Don't waste your money on this one","review":"I should have read the customer reviews before buying this book!!! This is NOT the Lynly/Havers/etal detective, crime solving novel I was led to believe I was buying by the publisher's review. Now I do admit that I did not read all the way through that lengthly tome. I was so bored after the first chapter that I had to really force myself to continue. I was finally reduced to skimming through the book to see when my favorite Scotland Yard detective would finally show up - well that didn't happen until the last page. Will not further waste my time with this book. Elizabeth George should be ashamed. This is probably the last of her books I will buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst I ever read","review":"Please don't think this is a Lynley novel. It is a disgusting unremitting social services failure. It should not be. It just is a horrible novel. Why are we buying this junk? This author should be reprimanded about this making us think that it is a Lynley book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a boring read. . .","review":"but not a particularly interesting one, either. Perhaps it's social commentary, but I didn't like or care about any of the characters as they were just too hopeless and dismal. You knew from page one that they and everyone around them were doomed. And perhaps killing Helen Lynley, who on the other end of the spectrum was rich, beautiful, loved and basically useless, is supposed to be some kind of poetic justice, but it left a very bad taste in my mouth.However,if Ms. George would like to kill off that whining, uninteresting Deborah, that would be a step in the right direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"No credibility","review":"I would not read another book by Elizabeth George. This one is about 200 pages too long, with a lot of gratuitous sex, ending with a finale that lacks credibility. The job would have been entrusted to someone more capable and trustworthy. While the leadup 500 pages had some insight into how difficult it is for such a family to cope with the gangster element, it was not worth the time to read it. (I had to because of a book club, but will pan it there too.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wish Zero Stars Was an Option....","review":"I am a huge fan of the Lynley series, both novels and tv series. Some of the books in the series have been so-so or weak but others would make it up for it. I hit this novel in the series while on a trip to the UK over the holiday and \\"saved\\" starting this novel for the long flight. HUGE MISTAKE. What Came Before He Shot Her is just horrible. It is just a self-indulgent exercise on the part of the author and provides nothing of value for Lynley fans. It was fine to get the backstory of the person responsible for the murder of Helen Lynley. However, it is all stereotypical. If you know anything about today's troubled youth, you could pretty much accurately imagine this backstory yourself. If you are a fan of the series, just skip this one. Read a short synopsis if you want to know the young killer's story but don't waste your time with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As one of Elizabeth Georges biggest fans,I was very disappointed with this book.It was very hard to read,very depressing and not worthy of George at all.I would not encourage anyone to buy it as it was a complete waste of my time to read it.All of her other books were so great that I could not believe she would publish something like this. I pray that any future books that she may write are nothing like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I like Elizabeth George's writing, and can understand her wanting to write about something other than Lynley and Havers, but this book was disappointing. The book doesn't feel closed and I don't know if it's part 1 of the sequel or just leaving us hanging. I also didn't care for the London street talk. I spent way too much time trying to figure out if \\"innut\\" meant \\"isn't it\\"; \\"idiot\\" or what. And in the end, I just didn't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this Elizabeth George Novel","review":"I'm a big Elizabeth George fan and would give five stars to her previous effort, With No one as Witness. However this one is nothing more than a fictionalized sociological study of the London underclass. George is usually great with charactar and dialog but the voices often ring false here, especially when the main character, a 12 year-old boy, is on stage. There is not much of a plot, really. Fans who've read With No One as Witness will understand how this book is going to end from the title. It takes a long,loooong time to get there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dickens, she's not.","review":"A more depressing tale of poverty, degradation, the corruption of children by gangs I've never heard. The argot in which most of the dialog is written renders it almost unreadable. There is no redemption of any of the characters, which renders it hopeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work","review":"I recently discovered that the Inspector Lynley series that I loved on PBS was actually a book series first so I have being reading the series almost nonstop for the past 3 months. I could not finish this book, in fact, I stopped before page 200, and then skipped to the very back of the book. While Ms. George's books have been heading in this direction for the past several, this one delivers a preachy, social commentary on London that leads the reader to believe that the city is peopled by poor, uneducated immigrants who have taken over it over and are dealing drugs and peddling sex on every street corner and/or are deviants and perverts. I love a good murder mystery with plot twists and thought provoking writing. This was just a depressing slog through a sewer. I would recommend giving all but the last chapter a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Came Before He Shot Her.","review":"I wish I had read some of the reviews, before I purchased the book.I am struggling through it, but I'm determined to read it out.I have been a long time fan of E.G.. and will continue to be.I just feel she has gone off on a tangent, perhaps to prove her deeper writing skills.This book has been well researched, and well written, but the ghetto dialect wore me out.One would guess writers grow bored with there characters after a time, and need to have a change of pace.It just short changes the reader, when they think that the beloved Lynely will be included in this new book ..PS. Glad Helen is dead, and will not be missed, in the next Lynely book?D.I. Spaulding"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was she thinking??","review":"I have read every other mystery Elizabeth George has written and enjoyed them all immensely but I have to say I couldn't finish this one. I can only liken it to Dickens who drops the reader down only to lift her up again. Except there was no lift to this one. It just plunged me deeper and deeper into a kind of literary despair. If I had finished this book, I might have done myself in. Two thumbs down. I think a writer the caliber of Elizabeth George could have done better than this. I can't help but wonder if she's going through some dark period in her life that's manifesting itself in her writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has she lost it?","review":"I am soooo glad I did not spend money on this book.Whether it is intended as social commentary or not, one prefers the characters in a novel to develop in some way or another, not simply remain fixed from beginning to end. This novel in particular would have needed some really good writing to make it worth reading, since we all know before we open it how it's going to end. Either Elizabeth George has lost her touch, or her editors have failed her miserably.This was actually apparent in \\"A Traitor to Memory\\" - what was her editor thinking to let her leave in that final page? With one phenomenally stupid piece of writing (the girl destroying the instrument), what had been a decent book up to that point was transformed into pap. \\"A Place of Hiding\\" was unremittingly dull, and \\"With No One as Witness\\" guaranteed that we can never again enjoy reading about Inspector Lynley's life. What next? For now, I'll stick to the library when it comes to George's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"with no expectations","review":"I'd never read Elizabeth George. Lynley? Havers? Quien es?My mom, however, is a fan. We read What Came Before He Shot Her at the same time, checking in via telephone about our progress and reactions. She hated it and informed me often that it wasn't typical of George's work. Me? I loved it. Her use of dramatic foreshadowing is quite powerful, and her dialogue is spot on. I don't read many classical mysteries, and this was not one. But I've got to stand up and cheer for Elizabeth George's writing style!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dark world","review":"I absolutely loathed this book by one of my favourite authors. We all know that there is an underworld which is inhabited by lawless, immoral low lives, but I for one, don't need to read about it as a source of enjoyment. The book is based around the lives of the family of the eventual killer of Helen Lynley and his terrible childhood. Yes, poverty, misery and crime exist but I don't derive any pleasure from reading and wallowing in it when I could be reading an exciting, uplifting book about decent people, rather than knowing all the details of depraved, amoral garbage who have fewer fine feelings than an amoeba!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Came After She Wrote Well","review":"Elizabeth George has earned herself a well-deserved fortune writing about the English upper classes. She should've stuck to it. In this book she tries to do the same for London's lower classes, and she's hopelessly out of her element. Just trying to get through a page with her version of the slang blacks use there was enough to twist my eyebrows. Formerly one of her biggest fans, I forced myself to make it through to the end, and took it to my used book store for credit (it didn't deserve an honored place with the rest of her books, to be read over and over, on my bookshelf)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Elizabeth George is one of my favorite authors. I love her books and the television shows. She has really captured the British style in her books. This book has deviated from her others. I didn't like the dialect, the way the story unfolded, and felt little sympathy for the characters. If I had known this was such a departure from her other books I would have never purchased it (I probably would have reserved it at our local library). Hope her series continues in its usual way, I would love to know how Lynley gets on with his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Bad to Worse","review":"Even though I have never written a review, reading this book has compelled me to do so. Having never read a George novel, but having read excellent reviews of her previous work, I was really looking forward to this book. After reading this one, I will probably never read her again. In the first chapter, I found the characters unbelievable and throughout the book they became less believable. How can every character in the book can never make a rational decision in any situation is beyond me. Her writing takes so long to get to the point that is goes beyond boring. I kept reading the book feeling that it would eventually get better. Boy was I wrong..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment...","review":"I certainly can't speak for all readers of English murder mysteries, but I know that I read them for pure escape. One can usually count on things coming out right in the end. I have enjoyed several of Ms George's previous Inspector Lynley books and was looking forward to this one. I was horribly disappointed.It is rare for me to start a book and not finish it - seems sort of ones moral duty to give the author the full book in which to tell her story; I'm on page 109 and will return it to the library tomorrow.I don't read English murder mystery books in order to know more about the mixed race underclass in London, nor do I enjoy dialect. I can't imagine what on earth the author was thinking - she certainly has disappointed her loyal readership with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Disappointed","review":"I can't tell you how disappointed I was when I began to read this book. I never read the covers for Elizabeth George's books. I always just order them because I a am such a fan. I continue to read because I love the continuing characters. I was shocked and crushed when Lyndley's wife was killed in the previous book and could not wait for the next installment. This is where the problem is. I could care less about the life of the boy who shot her. I know this is probably a socialy revelent book but that is NOT why I read Elizabeth George. If I could return the book I would and I just hope I can save other fans from making the same mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Want My Money Back!","review":"I am really angry at author and publisher for what I consider false advertisement. This is not a Det. Lynley book as the sensational description would have you believe. While the author is free to write whatever she likes, it should be advertised for what it is. If you want to read an incredibly dreary (and often unintelligible) account of \\"how children become criminals\\" in an English slum, then this is the book for you. If you're looking for another Lynley/Havers mystery, you won't find it here. Despite how much I like this series, I feel so ripped off that I will not be buying anything else by Elizabeth George."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirty, gritty, unlikeable characters....","review":"I usually enjoy Elizabeth George mysteries. This book, however, is a travesty and far off-track from her usual novels. So.....Lady Helen Clyde-Lynley was murdered in the previous book. We did NOT need to know the history of her killer ad nauseum. In my opinion, this book has no redeeming qualities to it. George would have been better served by forging right into the story of how Inspector Thomas Lynley coped with the death of his wife, instead of wasting our time with this study of the underbelly of London society."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This is the only Elizabeth George novel that I abandoned after struggling through three quarters of incomprehensible dialogue. I feel the author must have known she lost her way. The vernacular might have been well researched but detracted significantly from the storyline. aluckily the books that followed restored my faith in Elizabeth George as one of a small handful of superlative crime writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, too predictable, too hard to take","review":"I (like another reviewer) read about 100 pages and then skimmed to get to the end. I wanted a mystery -this was a treatsie on social ills and flawed human beings. Including these issues in a book with an interesting plot could be very effective. In this book I felt suffocated by the myriad of misfortunes -drug abuse, mental illness, developmental delay, poverty, child neglect, criminal behavior, rape, sexual misconduct (to put it mildly). Certainly not enjoyable --but also not illuminating. Just way too much -would have required an author with far more insight into these topics to pull it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I had read another of Elizabeth George's mysteries and mildly enjoyed it, and I very much enjoy the TV series \\"Inspector Lynley.\\" This book was horrificly bad, horribly written. None of the characters seemed real, or interesting. The dialogue was painful. I read about the first 75 pages, then skimmed through the rest just to see approximately what would happen. I was not rewarded by quality. Oh well, at least I only spent 25 cents for it at a bargain sale. Now I will donate it to charity for some other victim."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"black and white\\" vision","review":"Although this is a well-written book and very suspenseful, I found it offensive in that all the \\"dark-skinned\\" characters are problematic -- narcissistic, violent, incompetent, out of touch with reality, just plain crazy, etc, (with the exception of the Pakistani clan) while all the \\"white\\" characters were understanding, idealistic, highly educated, forgiving, competent, serious, dedicated... Would definitely have preferred a more balanced mix there. If I were a dark-skinned person, I would certainly not appreciate this lop-sided view of reality, even of the slums in London.However, I'm delighted to be delivered from Helen. I suspect George was also getting bored with her. It's still a mystery why she bothered creating her at all... Certainly gives me less respect for LYnley to see him hanging out with these dull women...Oh well, no one's perfect. The love interest in detective novels is often pretty much not the point... and it shows!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book has no sign of Thomas Lynley and is not even a mystery. Instead, it is more of a social commentary about poverty, broken families and the gang lifestyle in a fictional setting. Language was often unpleasant. Perhaps necessary for realism, but not enjoyable reading. If you want a crime, investigation and to puzzle out the solution to a mystery, I doubt you would enjoy this book. It is baffling why the author would turn a highly successful series into a soap box. I'd recommend getting this book from the library before spending money on it. I wonder why I actually read it to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Latest installment disappointing","review":"I love Elizabeth George and always look forward to her next book; however \\"What Came Before He Shot Her\\" was a great disappointment. Interest story line and glimpses of life in the stums of London, but the combination of lower class British usage/gang slang/black dialogue made the book hard to read. But, the ending did answer the who and why questions of the on-going Inspector Lynly series."},{"rating":"1","title":"No sociology please!","review":"To the reviewer who thought this book was wonderful and had not read any of George's earlier work: go back and read them so you will know how BAD this one really is. If I want sociology, I'll take a class at the local college or read the newspaper. I want mystery and suspense and I don't want my favorite characters killed off. I hope this is not a sign of things to come from E. George. I loved her earlier books and would be sad to think that she had lost her touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This novel is largely a 550-page justification for the murder with which George ended With No One As Witness. The family at the center of the story is disadvantaged in every conceivable way, and as the story progresses they just can't seem to catch a break. However, they are also guilty of nearly unjustifiable acts of violence and self-destruction at times (especially the daughter) so my sympathy is tempered.George is much given to didactic asides which attempt to explain her characters' motivations in sociological terms, which quickly becomes tiresome. Over 500 pages of a treatise on the social ills of London's underclass really starts to drag after a while. Ultimately I found I just didn't care very much about the Campbell family, certainly not as much as I care about Helen Lynley and her unborn child, the innocent victims.Here's hoping George sees the light and gets back to Lynley and Havers in her next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"What a complete waste of time! I took this book with me on a recent trip and read it only for lack of something better to do on the long flight. The idea of providing a different perspective to Helen's murder was fine, but 100 or so pages would have done nicely. Blathering on for over 700 pages was so unnecessary and tedious. Just downright maddening! I kept waiting for the real story to start but instead was assaulted by page after page of repetitive drivel. Do yourself a favor and skip this one....I'm not even sure I'll try the next one after this colassal let-down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, I get it now...","review":"If you read the title of this CD as it is listed on Amazon it reads \\"Blueberry Hill: The Very Best Of Fats Domino\\".

This book captivated him (and his 2 year old brother) every night for over a month. Many of the Mother Goose references were familiar to him and he enjoyed hearing the poems over and over. Pirates became the biggest intrigue and the action had to be edited toward the end. Still, it will be a book I am sure we will read again and again.

At that age I believed the longer the story was the better the content. Generaly I was wrong, but this time I couldn't have been more write. I read the whole story in a matter of hours and fell in love with it. I checked out Amy's Eyes as often as I could and made it my favorite book. After I moved away I was shocked to find that I couldn't locate Amy's Eyes anywhere. I'm 13 now and just recenly found the story at a library and I'm glad to know that I can now own this book for myself. This heart warming tale about a young girls imaginative adventures is one I'll never forget. Its tragdys and joys will live inside of me for all of my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A *must read* belly laugh fable for kids and adults.","review":"Amy's mother died while she was a baby. Her father, a tailor, leaves her at an orphanage to seek his fortune at sea. His one gift to her is a hand-made sailor doll, the Captain, which Amy loves. Accidentally, Amy discovers a way to bring the doll to life. As the situation at the orphanage becomes more unbearable, the Captain runs away to earn enough money to come back and rescue. When he doesn't return on time, Amy begins to turn into a doll herself. Add in swashbuckling pirates, mutineering rubber ducks, and a treasure at the bottom of the sea, and you have, ... well, Amy's Eyes.Kennedy's plot is ingenious, his characters hilariously outrageous, and his wit biting and sharp without being cynical. It was a wonderful read-aloud to our kids, but I must admit that I had finished the book a couple times before the kids heard the last chapter"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great fable for everyone","review":"I had walked past this book and was reccomended to me at least a million times.

It broke my heart and i don't recomend it for children. I just don't think they're ready for such things unless they have a tendancy to be overly optimistic.

But I was thoroughly disappointed by the quality of the kayak. 3 leaks in three outings!! All without any punctures from the outside. The quality of the inner tubes is very poor. All leaks were right at the seams, and very close together. I attributed the first one to overinflation. But that was definetely not the case for the next 2. And since they're all within a few inches of each other, I have to attribute the leaks to poor quality. The kayak is also not for people with average or above average size feet. They don't fit inside.This kayak is too unreliable to use outside of a swimming pool! Not even deserving the one star I had to give it.I also have an Advancedframe Kayak, which is wonderful, and absolutely trouble free. That I would give 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sevylor Inflatable Pointer K1 Kayak","review":"Enjoy the portablity. Have been having fun with the kids on the river.

I will not use an inflatable again."},{"rating":"2","title":"convenient kayak","review":"This is my second Sevylor. It's great for inaccessable spots to put in. I can wrap it around me and hike up and down rocky ledges for half a mile. It stuffs in the trunk of my Ford Focus. After 75 floats, it sprung a small air leaks at the inflation valve. For 50 more floats, I super-glued a piece of balloon over the leak (the leak kit was basically useless). It only works until you deflate and blow it up again, and then after a point, you can't fix it any more. Also, glue the drain ports shut. I stuff pool noodles along the port and bow seams for extra floatation and ridgitiy and also for safety. Never paddle an inflatable without a life vest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing power for the price.","review":"This little fan really blows! :) A unique design focuses the air column without letting it spread out too much, so what you get is a very windy \\"tube\\" of air, enough to make your ears roar from more than 10 ft away. I bought this fan for a very specific purpose, photography, and it packs plenty of punch to get a models hair moving without needing to be right up on the subject. I usually put it on the floor about 8 feet away or so and it does the trick just fine, on the medium setting. From 20 ft, I had the vertical blinds fluttering wildly about. It is also very quiet and and energy efficient, so thats a nice plus. I highly recommend this fan if you need to move a lot of air and don't want to pay over $1000.00 for a wind machine, or just want to cool yourself on a hot day and don't need anything oscillating. I am totally happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap design","review":"Would never recommend: With in a few months the knob broke then after only a year, the fan stopped working.

I don't want a replacement, I want my $79.49 back. Also, the instructions say to only use 117 volts 60 HZ A.C. outlet. Well, this is the USA and that is not my wiring.

We called the company and got the part within the same week, with a few extra parts along with it. Customer service from that company is fantastic. They were very polite and resolved our problem right away.FUN FACTOR: The rockets go very high, and kids in our area congregate in our yard to have a turn at stomping.

I don't have a huge yard and was figuring I'd be knocking on a neighbor's door to get these back. Not the case. They typically went up > 100 feet when I (the adult) used it and landed within 5 feet of take off location. Maybe if it was windy it would be more of an issue but it's a calm day and no issues. My 5 year old was able to get it to > 30 feet quite easily. The toy is simple and works and made a great filler gift under the tree. Also, even though the age is listed 6+ I, as a parent, would see no problem with 3/4+ with minor supervision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun","review":"My 3 year old son absolutely loves this toy. He will play with it in the backyard for ages by himself. When we have playdates with other kiddos, they are all equally enthralled.

Outside I do just that. But inside the house my son wanted to play with it and I let him without watching him careful. He jumped on it and the rocket shot up and hit him in the eye. It was really scary and I always worry now about how bad it could've been. We got lucky and my son's eye is fine, it seems. Just be careful. It's a good toy. And yeah, I don't need to hear about how my son is too young to play with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Toy For Kids and Dads!","review":"I gave this to my 5 year old grandson for Christmas. Set up is kind of funky, as it is rather flimsy, but it is lots of fun. The rockets traveled high and created lots of excitement. One rocket was already ripped by the second day of play, so that wasn't a good sign, but it still worked. I also bought the Junior version for my 3 year old granddaughter. The rockets were too tight to go on and off the base. That was a disappointment. I wouldn't rate that one well at all! But this one provided lots of fun, as long as you know you are not getting something highly durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for kids and adults","review":"My toddler sons got this as a summer gift and love it, as do all the neighborhood kids.

The base is not all that sturdy tho, but it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty cool and fun","review":"I purchased this for my two cousins, aged 3 1/2 and 5 1/2. The 3 1/2 has trouble jumping, so this will help him learn and he does pretty good. The 5 1/2 can get it to shoot pretty far, but I think the 200 feet is a long shot; even for me at 180lbs. (I'm always slightly afraid I'll break it) All in all, they loved it; we'll see if it will stand the test of time, when I visit next. I'm sure with practice, they will get better at it.I'd say if you want extra rockets, just buy another stomp rocket, then if something breaks, you have another base station. The cost for four extra rockets is almost as much as just buying another kit, which comes with the same 4 rockets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertainment!","review":"My son played with it for hours!

It is so much fun that even my husband and I had to give it a try. Overall, it is pretty durable however I had to tape the red wings on the rockets back on. But I think the reason they came off is from my kids grabbing them from each other. They do not fly well without the red wings on them.

Did I mention that even the 30-somethings had fun stomping on it? My 1 1/2 year old pulled off some of the plastic pieces on a rocket but it still works.

He got all sorts of toys for his birthday, and the Stomp Rocket was the biggest hit. He, and several of his friends played with it for hours. It's simple and worked well. With the heavy use it's getting, the platic parts may not survive for too long, but considering the minimal cost, it's well worth it. So far, it's taken a lot of hard use, and nothing has broken. The only risk is loosing a 'rocket' in the top of a tree, or on a rooftop.

Adults love to see how far they can make the rockets go, kids love to use up all of their excessive kid energy stomping on the stomp mechanism. We just purchased another one for ourselves - will be put to good use by our 2 1/2 and 4 1/2 year old daughters. Great value - great fun.

It is very poorly designed, awkward to assemble and flimsy. We received it as a gift and within about a month every piece of it was broken in some way, including the rockets/arrows (the cheap plastic cylinders on them cracked and the fins/fletching on every one of them had broken off). The \\"pump\\" part started out with a lot of force, but after a few weeks didn't work well anymore. And the \\"stand\\" snapped apart.We once had a similar kind of toy made by Air Hogs that was MUCH better made with higher quality, thicker plastic.

Very easy to setup, the rockets launch a good 50-60 feet into the air at least on a good stomp and the launcher and the pad are built well enough. It's garnered LOTS of attention from the neighborhood kids who are all asking where we got such a thing.Our only complaint would be the durability, or lack thereof, of the rockets themselves. If they land hard or on the wrong spot, the red tails will split. This doesn't completely ruin the rocket nor the experience, but some didn't make it through two launches even. That said, we ordered the launcher kit and replacement rockets and will be buying more. We're very glad we purchased it, the boys love it as do the neighbor kids and we'd of course purchase it all over again, easily.Fun toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"I bought two of these for my grandsons 5 and 3, they said it was an awesome present!!!

Sometimes the stand is hard to keep balanced on the grass, but on a hard surface it works great. These rockets are better than the rocket jr version.

And for the price, it is a great toy for the family or as a gift for a birthday party. The rockets shoot very high, well, at least when an adult does it, but even my six year old can get it pretty high. It is air pressure based, so you simply slide the rocket onto the launcher, and stomp on a durable plastic \\"bubble\\" to send the rocket shooting into the air. It's fun to watch the rockets shoot up, and to try and catch them as they come back down. We use our stomp rocket a lot, and eventually the fins on the rockets start coming off, but they do take a heavy beating before it gets to that point. You can glue or even tape the fins back on the rockets, or you can even buy the rockets separately."},{"rating":"2","title":"A toy for little and big boys","review":"This was purchased for my grandson, age 6, who brought it and refills to a family reunion the day after Christmas.

And it does.To be honest, Brubeck is far from getting to my list of favourite piano players (Ellington, Monk, Tatum, Peterson, Basie, Wilson...); he probably never recorded something that would excite me like Jess Stacy's famous \\"Sing sing sing\\" solo on Benny Goodman Carnegie Hall concert, but nevertheless, at this record he somehow pulls it of without compromising his own musical persona too much.In the end, I conclude that I don't really know why this works (although bass and drums seem subtle and versatile enough to help) but I enjoy this album imensely. Five stars, there's no doubt in my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant album. The vocals mesh with the music.","review":"What a great album.

The author also uses his own custom classes (which is not necessary for study) in his examples. The author has decent explanations of various notations such as Big-O, Big-Omega, and Bit-Theta.

A textbook, by definition, should try to explain everything in detail as much as possible and convey the concepts in a clear and well-illustrated manner. On the contrary, this book is full of partial details in long-winded sentences, which makes a already hard topic even more difficult to follow. As a textbook, it is counter-productive. Maybe the author dont want to bother, but the lack of detail and jumping of thought is striking in this book, not to mention the incomplete, half-baked C-like Java code that does not even compile.

For a computer scientist who already understands the subject this book may contain a few good points. Indeed, I was able to follow the sections where I had previous training, but when I studied material new to me, I was out of luck.If you are unlucky enough to have a university that uses this text, consider trying to find a better book to get yourself an adequate understanding of this important subject, because Dr. Shaffer's text won't do that for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, solid introduction","review":"I've been using this book for a course in Data Structures and Algorithms in an undergraduate computer science program, and I must say I'm impressed by how easy to read Mr. Shaffer has made the chapters.

He does a great job writing the chapters, but when it comes time for us students to do problems on our own, there's no reasonable way to check to make sure we're headed in the right direction.

But it simply did not work for me. I wanted something that would peel and core apples, and I couldn't make the Applemate peel efficiently, try as I did to adjust the blade. I experimented on four apples (two fairly hard, two soft), and each time the blade would begin peeling and then would just slide off and merely scrape the skin.

I went in expecting great things from a great cast, but the whole movie reeked of effort. I'm going to blame it on the writing and perhaps the direction. I mean when Josh Hartnett says something along the lines of \\"I take it no one ever told you not to use the word you're trying to define in the definition\\" and that was supposed to be \\"smart,\\" \\"witty,\\" and \\"funny.\\" I knew it was over. You can really tell when someone puts in stupid references and tries to pass it off as wit. I have never written a review on Amazon (obviously I'm no critic) and it's been a while since I have seem this movie, but I am making a conscious effort to tell everyone I know not to see this movie. The entire movie is so predictable. Aside from Lucy Liu looking very nice and one memorable seen with Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman, this movie is awful. Please don't see it. And if you like it, please reevaluate your movie viewing decisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Loss","review":"I am almost at a loss for words in reaction to this film. I really feel this is because in itself, the film lacked substance. My first sensation from this came from the cover, which I feel sums it up well: Some good looking people with guns.The rest of the movie follows this, as the story line feels like an empty encasement waiting to be filled. The main character is in the \\"Wrong place at the wrong time\\" and because of his mental disability he is unable to feel worry. Well, I similarly had very little emotional involvement with the plot of this film as I watched the main character blow in the wind.I watched this character sway about as he accidentally had to introduce the viewer to pointless violence and sex scenes. Did they add to the movie? Well, they pretty much were the movie, as there was nothing else. It was simply an excuse to throw all of the elements of an \\"edgy\\" movie into one box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vile Manipulative Trash---a waste of the great Morgan Freeman & Sir Ben Kingsley.","review":"Josh Hartnett is wonderful.

Crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure you have an HD DVD Player","review":"I am a soldier in Iraq, and I thought you could play it on a regular DVD player or computer, I was wrong.

Some cosmetic changes to the format, but all questions are answered if you are paying minimal attention. Overall, \\"Lucky # Slevin\\" is a decent 'turn off your brain for a bit' flick; a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor","review":"That's \\"Buyer Beware\\", for those of you who have forgotten the Latin lessons from parochial school. These folks that sell used DVDs provide a useful service, but be careful: If yours arrives scratched (like mine did) you'll be in the same pickle I was in: How do you justify taking the time to get a refund or a replacement on a $ 4 purchase? Anyway, just remember that when you drop the order. I bought this just to have an archive copy of my all-time favorite movie, but two scenes were damaged. Wasn't awful, just annoying. Sometime when I get a minute, I'll probably bet another $4 on the Lottery and order another one, to see if this time I get a winner !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Noir-ish-action-comedy","review":"The love child of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler: this movie is a stew of flash backs and flash forwards stirred in a double-helix plot that threatens to choke itself. Yep, I loved it. It took me several viewings to get all the hints (my 18-year old grasped everything immediately but he's steeped in anime'). However the casts' performances stand up to the repeated exposure. Bruce Willis is his reliable stoically smug self. Josh Harnett is comedically heroic, or heroically comedic. Lucy Liu does a good turn as a brainy ditz - contrast that with the Yakuza she played in Kill Bill! The hands-down best performances are Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley as amoral mob bosses locked in blood feud."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Kansas City Shuffle","review":"I got the chance to catch Lucky Number Slevin in theaters, and I'm glad I did. IN FACT, I was so glad, I saw it a second time. This is a great noir/mystery film surely not to be missed. Most underrated of the year for sure. There are so many things I can say, but to keep it breif, WATCH THIS MOVIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great acting; poor script and direction","review":"\\"Lucky Number Slevin\\" is chock full of fantastic performances from great actors like Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley. Lucy Liu, Josh Hartnett and the rest of the cast also do fantastic work. But the direction is poor. We see the strings in a lot of the scenes; dialogue being fired back and forth in an artificial and stilted manner - the fact that's across the board means it's a directorial and not an acting problem.And the script. Wow. It's a second draft Tarantino clone that needed a couple more drafts to be worth shooting. It's chock full of unbelievable coincidence, unnecessary complication, and uneven pacing.This may be worth a rent. But \\"Lucky Number Slevin\\" should not be purchased until you've spent a couple dollars on a rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Ride","review":"The movie constantly keeps moving making for an enjoyable experience with few slow moments.

I rented it anyway and I was very pleased with the viewing experience. Not to delve too deeply into it, there is some amazing star power in this talent pool. From Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman, on to Bruce Willis and Stanley Tucci and down to Josh Hartnett and Lucy Liu- there are plenty of excellent performances to go around.This movie is similar to many others you've seen, no doubt. There is a crazy back and forth plot happening and all is revealed at the end, after many twists and turns. The difference is that this time, it is actually interesting along the way - AND the ending actually comes together and ultimately makes sense.I would recommend the movie.

Fear not. Director Paul McGuigan and writer Jason Smilovic have things well in hand. You will not be disappointed. A superb film that will keep you entrenched in a potpourri of action, drama, and dialogue that is so machine gun quick it approaches comedic proportions.Great cast and casting. Led by Bruce Willis and Josh Hartnett with Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Stanley Tucci, and Lucy Liu. All in top form. You will note, and it's really quite funny, how Mr. Willis ages so well in a span of 25 years.Don't hesitate. It's really that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie rocks!!

Don't bring that mentality to Lucky Number Slevin. Bruce Willis opens a movie with a cryptic tale and more cryptic actions, which carries you for a ride that offers the whole package - action, drama, plenty of comedy, and a story that, rare as it seems, closes itself off entirely.

It was suspenseful, twisting and turning this way and that. Just when I thought I knew the answer of what was to happen next, the plot would turn, and more anwers were revealed.If you like Josh Hartnett a little bit now, you will like him even more after viewing this movie. It seems to me like he is growing up gracefully, out of the teen movie paradigm, into succeeding as a young adult actor.Bruce Willis is also good, taking a bit of a backseat in his role but steady throughout.

The film covers the history of Israel from 1948 to the present. The production values are pretty bad, the sound isn't good, and the footage is lame (to illustrate a terrible blizzard they show youngsters engaged in a snowball fight). Plus, the narrators are British, which I found to be in very poor taste. There are many excellent videos on Israeli history out there. This isn't one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stronger heroine would've netted 5 stars","review":"I loved the story, I love Jude's writing, I loved the hero, but did not love the heroine. I really enjoyed this story a lot. My only gripe is that the heroine was whiny and had no backbone. Other than that, this was an excellent read. I will definitely save it on my \\"rereads\\" bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not enjoy as much as I thought I would...","review":"I try to stick with a book unless it's absolutely horrendous so I stuck with this one, and at the end I was sorry I did.I couldn't identify with Dougless, the heroine because she, first of all, stuck with her bad boyfriend so long, then second, she even *thought* of going back to him! Lastly, I was SO disappointed at the ending. Everyone said this was her best book? I probably won't read the others then!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic - Endearing - Entertaining","review":"I reluctantly started to read this book after a co-worker loaned it to me and said that I would love it.

You will thoroughly enjoy this story, I promise you that."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a great book!","review":"this is truly the best romance book i have ever read. there is something so real about th echaracters and their predicaments even if it does deal with time travel. i would reccommend this book to anyone who enjoys a fast-paced story and wonderful people.

The historical information is very interesting & informative (& made me glad to be raising my children in the 21st century!). This is definitely Jude Deveraux at her best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most romantic story I have ever read","review":"This was the absolute best book I have ever read.

And he loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I agree with all of the other one star reviews. This book is a huge waste of money and time. The heroine was not someone I could identify with. She really just made me annoyed because of her crying and lack of confidence. Although I did enjoy reading about the clothing and food, it wasn't enough for me to get over the main characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"I expected so much more with this story then what I got. It had so many great reviews. However, the female lead \\"Dougless\\" is a millionaire's daughter and will inherit a fortune when she turns 35 yet her whole \\"goal\\" in life is to find a man to love and marry him.... YIKES! Of course, every man uses her but then again every man she looks at she looks at as a future husband. Hmm... Anyhow, I found the book very frustrating - didn't finish it and put it in the discard box. The story was beyond ridiculous and if romance is chasing after a man - then this story is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gah! joining the minority here","review":"I'm in agreement with all the 1-star reviews here. The main character was pathetic and just cried ALL THE TIME. Who wants to read about that? Also, how she acted in the 16th century was completely unrealistic! (do you think she can run around in a different era doing whatever she wants and get away with it?)If you are looking for a book like Outlander (which I was) and love it for it's richness, vibrant characters and in-depth portrayal of the times - I recommend staying away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much, much worse than I remembered","review":"I first read this book when it originally came out in the late 80s early 90s and remembered liking it. Then I saw it in the bookstore and thought I'd pick it up for nostalgia's sake. MY GOD it was awful. Just about the worst written novel I've read this year and unfortunately that is saying something. Dougless is a completely unlikable, and spineless character, and Ms. Devereaux' explanation at the end that she was trying to shine a spotlight on alcoholism through the use of an emotionally abusive - but dry - relationship was nothing short of bizarre.Anyway - don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluffy Waste Of Time","review":"This book was a big disappointment. The book's character's are 2-dimensional, flat and boring. The author doesn't draw detailed enough characterizations. Her writing is at best uninteresting and at worst childish. I though the book was light, fluffy, brain-candy, and it didn't make me want to read any other books by this author. I wanted rich detail, descriptive text, engaging dialogue and I got nothing even close to that. Ugh... no more Jude Deveraux for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read.....","review":"I didn't read this book the first time it was released, so this was quite a surprise for me when I picked it up and literally could not put it down. I loved this book and laughed out loud in several places. It makes you want to believe that time travel is possible and from Jude's descriptions throughout the book it leaves you wondering if it really is. The ending brought me to tears. I highly recommend this book to every lover of romance, young and old. This is a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very great book","review":"this is one of the best books i've read in a very long time, i know its been out for a while but i just saw it & i had to get it i have read more of judes books but this one i think is the very best one yet. i would recomend every body reading it it is just great."},{"rating":"2","title":"time travel classic","review":"I had read most, if not all, of Jude's books when I came across \\"Knight\\" and I LOVED it. It's a classic. If you also are a fan of this book, I highly recommend \\"The Mirror\\" by Marlys Millhiser and the Voyager series by Gabaldon. I sure do hope Jude Deveraux doesn't stop writing about the Mongomery family!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I paid 25 and I want my money back","review":"I picked up several Jude Deveraux novels at a library book sale. \\"Knight in Shining Armor\\" was the worst of the lot. Admittedly, I am not a great fan of time-travel romance, but this book totally ridiculous. Come on, people--Dougless travels 400 years back in time with her handbag, which just happens to contain a drugstore full of toiletries? I just wasn't convinced by the plot, and the characters were not that interesting to me either. I'll take a Judith McNaught or an Amanda Quick novel any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me...","review":"I only picked up this novel because a friend threatened my life--and I nearly ended hers after reading it. I've read a novel from this author before and didn't like her style of writing; it's written with too many facts, and not enough emotion, which is what I look for in a ROMANCE novel. I want to connect with characters, empathize and weep and ache with them since I'll be spending so much time with them anyway--this author does not provide that, and although this tale is interesting, it falls flat due to lack of character/reader affinity.The heroine seems very likable, although you only get to know her in a single wave-length way, and the hero sounds dashing, although he's sometimes parched, I did like the way the story circled back to the beginning, giving it wholesome synchronicity--but I think that was it.And the ending...The only word I can think of to describe myself, especially after not enjoying the book so much anyway, is inconsolable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Have read \\"A Knight in Shining Armor\\" twice and was absolutely enthralled each time.

Very Good!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say about this book it deserves a 10","review":"What can I say about this book it has been a long time since I read it and it still present in me. A very hard to forget book because it deals with a real love story not like some other books that don't deliver on the romantic part.

This is a must read for everyone who believes in love."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books!","review":"I love this book and used to check it out from the library, but I wanted a copy to keep because I know I will want to read it again and again. What a great story from start to finish and I just love the characters. You can't go wrong with this book, you don't want to put it down because you can't wait to see what happens next. This book has humor, history and of course romance. I just love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulmates are timeless, and apparently time-proof too!","review":"I had trepidations about reading a book on time-travel, mainly because of the surrealist element (I'm not partial to fantasy), and also because I couldn't imagine how any author treating this genre could surpass Diana Gabaldon's Outlander.Devereaux doesn't outdo Gabaldon, but she certainly didn't disappoint.What I loved most about about A Knight in Shining Armour, was, undoubtedly, the ending. Since I don't want to give out spoilers, suffice to say that if you are jaded with the usual romance novel, try this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO great! Worth every star!","review":"I could not recommend this book to readers more. This is a true \\"meant-to-be\\" love story. I cried at the end of the book! The time travel quirks are great.

And across time!!After I read this book, the first thing that comes to my mind is \\"I want to thank Jude Deveraux!\\"I want to write a thank you letter to the woman who writes such a wonderfully romantic story. I started to search for her email, but no luck there. I couldnt find any address where i could send my letter to. I really really hope she would pop by here and read the reviews, and read this!! :DThank you Ms Deveraux!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A knight in shining armor","review":"This is one of THE best books Jude has ever written.Its my absolute favorite and I have read everything as well as collect all of her books . It brought out about every human emotion know to women .Her charcters are so believable and the research she did is right on the money to especailly for those who love the medvial times .Although it is not easy to choose one of her books as my favorite, this would have to be it. Jude Deveraux has the talent not only to write but she also tells a story of not only love and hope , she also takes you to many places , most importantly she makes the reader feel as if they were there experiencing the story firt hand.I recommend any of her books, there all GREAT !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, anytime pick-me-up!","review":"This is the most fabulous love story I've ever read...and re-read at least twenty times!The story is a great way to beat off the winter blahs and warm your heart to the possibility that anything is possible when you are truly in love. I've read this book at least twice a year since discovering it in 1992. Ms. Deveraux has the most interesting way of including persons from her famously fictional \\"Montgomery\\" family in any book which she mentions the family name.This is a good, weepy read and I would suggest it to all those who still believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting","review":"When this book begins you are ready to start shouting \\"Stop being a ninny Douglas!\\" before the end of the first two chapters. We especially hate her boyfriend and his spiteful daughter. But then, we meet her soon to be love and we are spellbound, finding ourselves cheering them on in this story of love and heartbreak.

Keeps you reading with anticipation of what is happening next. Everyone needs a knight in shining armor"},{"rating":"1","title":"Research?","review":"I downloaded this book to read on holiday in Greece. After several chapters I became rather disenchanted and indeed rather cross. The author chose Ashburton, England as her 'remote' village. I lived there in 1969 and have been back there recently so was pleased to discover the story using the village as a setting. However it lost its credibility when she describes a busload of 50 Japanese tourists stepping out. That will never happen in sleepy Ashburton, we don't have sidewalks, and the streets are not arranged in 'blocks'. Police have not been referred to as 'bobbies' since the 1950's and the final straw came when Douglass ordered scones and describes slathering the scone in clotted cream with no mention of jam - sacrilege! It may seem petty but it would be like me choosing a remote town in America and describing pavements instead of sidewalks etc. Write about what you know or do the research. It may have been a good story but I will never know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do NOT pass this story up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I don't even know how to begin. A Knight In Shining Armor is one of the most amazing, sweetest, funniest, sexiest, heart-wrenching stories I have ever read. (And I have read over 300 books in the past year alone.)Without giving away too much, it's a romantic story about a woman from the 20th century and a man from the 16th century. It's difficult to get into at first because of the context. But once you get past the \\"this would never happen... ever!\\" it sweeps you off your feet. The main characters need to accomplish a goal, but in doing so they learn so much more about themselves and life around them.I recommend a box of tissues and enough time so you don't have to put it down until you're finished. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending was too sad. Writing style and conversations lacking.","review":"I didn't care for the author's writing style. Parts of it seemed like a reporter was writing events that were happening each day. The author was trying too hard to make us not like Robert and his daughter. They were too bad to be believable. Dougless's reasoning didn't feel real to me. I wouldn't think or act like her. Conversations were not interesting. During parts of the middle the reading was tedious and I wanted the book to be over. The last few chapters had me in tears far too much. Yes it was a great love spanning time, but too much sadness. SPOILER: The worst sadness for me was that Nicholas lived the rest of his life back in the 1500s never marrying because he loved Dougless. Even though there was an interesting ending with her finding someone, I was still in tears so I do not consider this a feel good book. Sexual content: moderate."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply fabulous","review":"this was the best book I have ever read. I am not an overly emotional person but this book made me cry.

But I was so upset with how it ended. I guess maybe because I don't belive in re-incarnation that I could not be happy that she ends up with someone else. And I felt that he was cheated that he spent his whole life alone. They should have been together.

I have to admit that I almost put it down in the beginning because I hated the way Dougless was so submissive in the beginning. But I stuck it out, and BOY AM I GLAD I DID. This is they best romance novel I have read by far. I love they way Jude takes you through 2 eras and they ending....WONDERFUL !! I couldn't stop crying. I started to get very sad as I got closer to finishing the book because I knew, and know now, that I would miss the characters. BRAVO !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A romantic tale with irresistable charm","review":"I have read a bunch of books by Jude Deveraux and A Knight in Shining Armor was the first one by her that I read. This was 10 years ago and the story has stuck in my mind as one of the great ones ever.I haven't really enjoyed the other books by Jude Deveraux as much as this, since this book seems to have been written with greater detail and passion to the story. As mentioned in earlier reviews, you will absolutely love the characters and bond with them in a way that makes the ending of the book sort of heart-wrenching despite of being hopeful.I am not a fan of romantic stories or romantic movies (I like detective stories, action, and even \\"strange tales\\" more, because romantic stories are usually so predictable), but this is a must-read. You will love it! :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Craptastic","review":"Wow.... I really can't believe this book got so many good reviews. Reading the first few chapters of this book is like listening to nails on a chalk board. The \\"heroine\\" (AKA the Doormat) of this book makes me cringe so badly that I can read no further. She is so very gullible and whiny. She's in a horrible relationship because she wants to get married and if she doesn't get that ring on her finger she will be some sort of failure. She may not be after his money but she expects him to pay for everything and waxes dramatic when he cons her into going dutch. He treats her like garbage and it goes right over her head or she just lays down and takes it because he might propose to her \\"someday\\". That's just the tip of the iceberg, it just gets worse from there on. I couldn't even make it to the part where she loses all hope in life at being dumped by the douche. If you haven't already guessed, I'm wishing I hadn't wasted my money or my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"None","review":"terrible waste of time - story line was repeated over and over as if author was trying to fill in space due to writers block - what a bummer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happily Ever After? 'SPOILER'","review":"I do enjoy books that tug at your heart strings and ones that make you laugh out loud but I always like my romance books to end happily ever after. I have read alot of Jude Deveraux's books and this one is as wonderful as others with the one exception of the ending. I was getting more worried about the fate of this couple as I got nearer the end but I thought to myself...this has to end happily ever after, I never have read a romance book that didn't...I felt awful after I finished this book. Imagine finding your soul mate, your other half and then never loving again and going through the rest of your life alone. That is how the hero spends his life...how romantic! NOT! I was pleased with the story line and will continue to read Jude Deveraux but I am hoping to never find an ending like this one had again."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!!!","review":"After reading all the wonderful reviews here, I was really looking forward to this story.

I definitely do not recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Time travel and romance rolled up in one.","review":"A pleasant surprise and an interesting read. Douglas finds herself stranded in England after she parts ways with her far from perfect boyfriend and his whiney daughter. Little does she know but her tears will summon an Elizabethan Earl from the year 1564. Our plucky protagonist is about to show the Earl what a modern girl is all about, and he is about to find the kind of love and devotion that only happens once in a lifetime.Deveraux writes an entertaining yet predictable story that will keep you interested till the end for the sheer enjoyment of the characters she has created and the clash of two centuries. Another book by this author that I really enjoyed is THE SUMMERHOUSE.

From beginning to maybe the last 5 pages, blech. I guess it's a matter of personal opinion, but I couldn't stomach the heroine nor could I stand the hero. The heroine was bland and weepy, the hero a bit of a doofus, and the plot boring. I found myself skipping several pages just waiting for the \\"good part\\"--which didn't come until the very end.A lot of people like this book, but I would recommend borrowing a copy before you decide to get one for yourself. This is the first Deveraux book I've read, and if this is the best she has to offer, I think I would think twice before giving her other books a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weep, weep, weep","review":"It seemed like all this broad did was cry, cry and cry. I guess with an ending like this she was justified. A few historical factoids thrown in, but the heroine was extremely unlikeable. I will never read anything by this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me feeling Blah...","review":"I was very anxious to read this book because of all the great reviews. My first gripe about the book is the heroines name. Dougless. Yes Dougless was indeed a female name in the 16th century but I could not get my 21st century mind to except it. It was just too masculine for my taste.Another problem I had with the book is that Dougless' character is soooo weak and cries constantly. She really got on my nerves at times.The idea for the plot was a good one but in my opinion poorly written and silly at times.The ending was left my angry. A very disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed in this novel, because although a fantasy, it didn't seem feasible.The characters were unexciting - the heroine cried throughout most of the book - the hero was a chauvanist in both past and present and the \\"baddies\\" were so bad as to be unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader beware - Not a romance!","review":"It is very easy to notice that this book has received many positive reviews. As a regular drama novel, I could accept that the writing is decent and it deserves praise. But as a romance novel, this book seriously falls short of the mark.If you are into romances that make you feel all warm and fuzzy which you put down (eventually) with a big grin on your face, then this book is definitely NOT for you. It is depressing, the heroine is weak, and it is bogged down by historical detail. And to top it off, the characters don't even end up together in the end. Deveraux was really caught up in trying to make this novel too factual for a time travel romance - it destroyed what little romance there was to be had.By all means, check it out at the library, but don't waste your money. Romance readers who like the good stuff won't want to keep this on their shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"in poor conditions","review":"i was displeased to see that the book was in worse conditions then i was promised. i really wish that in its description someone would have made it more clear that the book was beat up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spectacular romance novel !!!","review":"This novel is what dreams and imaginations are ultimately made of.

The premise of the story, a bending of time, is an interesting basis for a plot, but it is of a nature which requires deft handling and an artful writing style, neither of which are to be found in this novel. It is populated with cartoonish characters, none of whom are particularly likeable, who are so unlifelike as to reach beyond the ridiculous, afflicted with childish dialogue and unbelievably distorted judgement. In a word -- Yuk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me.","review":"I'm not into time travel, but I thought I would give this book a chance. I shouldn't have wasted my time. I had a very hard time finishing the book. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This time travel romance is much better than Outlander, another popular time travel romance novel. The reason I said this is because: A Knight in Shining Armor has more elements a time travel and a romance novel need or require but not in a cheapish way. It is a more complete and mature work. Outlander has ambition on reaching a larger scale of romance novel. Unfortunately, Outlander's author fails on that attempt.Anyway, A Knight in Shining Armor is a very enjoyable reading.

From the first time I read it, I fell in love with the characters and wept when it ended. Every year since I take it faithfully with me when I am on vacation and re-read it again. (that's about 21 times!) Like one of the other reviewers I wish it was made into a movie, I would buy it and watch it over and over again.

I have read a number of Jude Deveraux books so I knew I liked her writing style but I was apprehensive about the time travel aspect getting too sci-fi or technical. My apprehensions proved to be unwarranted. I enjoyed reading A Knight in Shining Armor, parts of it made me laugh out loud (Nicholas buying new clothes), other parts (Dougless' repetitive meekness) frustrated me.

I mean to make her pay her own way, put up with his spoiled kid, and THEN leave her alone without money, etc. in a strange land.

This film is certainly not the one you want to see to fall in love with him. However, it is a sweet movie on its own merits.The story concerns a young man (Langdon) whose family has kept him in short pants for his whole life. They believe it will keep him innocent and out of trouble. It seems they were right; when he gets long pants he falls in love with a troublesome but beautiful girl (Alma Bennett). Although he is engaged to another (Priscilla Bonner) (who he is willing to do anything to get rid of), he follows the beauty everywhere including to jail and out again in a crate.There are some classic gags utilized, some belly laughs to be had, but also a rather disturbing scene of comedy rooted in murder. This is one silent comedy you might want to ban your children from."},{"rating":"1","title":"the unfunniest","review":"This is the film that practically destroyed Harry Langdon's career. Supposedly a comedy it has nothing going for it. Frank Capra disowned this disaster and it's easy to see why. Langdon's comedic characater was very fragile and had to be carefully handled.

Alas, this is not the case. The story line is such an over-used one, with quirky patches, and the acting is barely adequate. What a waste of such a talent as Scott Thompson. I was disappointed in the film from beginning to end and actually had to almost discipline myself to watch it to the end, since I had purchased it. After considering it, I later decided to watch it again, and my reaction hadn't changed, but knowing what was coming seemed to make the movie even more insipid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Time","review":"I loved this movie. One of the great things about gay comedies is that even if the writing or acting is bad, you can't tell because it's designed to be cheesy, cliche, and over-the-top. This movie funny and inappropriate in all the right ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, but don't take it seriously.","review":"I thought it was a hilarious movie. Definately not a family movie, but who cares. It's essentially the gay version of Not Another Teen Movie or American Pie. I say not to take it seriously because the characters in the movie do not represent the gay community as a whole. I don't believe it is offensive to gay people because the characters portrayed in American Pie don't represent all hetrosexuals, as is the same with this movie. Just take it with a grain of salt, and you will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like over the top comedies this one is for you","review":"I loved this movie, I thought it was hysterical. It is very raunchy and there are some parts that offended other viewers, but it is made in the fashion of \\"American Pie\\", \\"White Chicks\\" etc. with the physical gags and \\"bathroom\\" humor. The cast did a great job as did the director, it's no BrokeBack Mountain but it wasn't meant to be. As a comedy, it's successful and as a gay movie I think it's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing movie.","review":"I was really hoping that this movie would be a truly funny movie dealing with gay issues. However, in my opinion it was a movie that was very closely modelled on the movie \\"American Pie\\", but a lot less funny. Substituting a Quiche Lorraine instead of an Apple Pie, four gay guys instead of four straight ones, someones grandfather instead of Stifler's Mother and a overly loud lesbian instead of 'the Sherminator' does not make this movie all that different from \\"American Pie'. I am surprised the makers of this film havent been slapped with a copyright lawsuit. Most roles feed on gay stereotypes and are over-acted to the level of being annoying rather than likeable. Yes, this movie is meant to be a spoof, but its lack of originality severely hampers this aim. Surely the gay film community is capable of a movie with more originality and imagination than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I thought this movie was a lot of fun to watch.

It was not a bad movie, but if you like bad movies like I do, then you'll love the fact that some movies are so bad, they actually are better for it.Maybe I'm biased because I like Jonathan Chase and his Jim Carreyesque ability to try really hard to make you like him( see \\"Gingerdead Man\\"), but I never got douche chills at any point during this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar is like melted cheese","review":"Bought this guitar online here and am very pleased with it.The thing I like about it most are that the strings are close to the fret board.

I love the finish on it and love thebeautiful style that it has. I'm going to be proud of it for years to come. I was going to decide on eithera strat or this Epi and I definitely love this one.

From the very beginning, I was immersed in a world of kings, ghosts and nemesis, so much so, that I read the complete series before picking up another book. Louise Cooper is such a magnificent writer and weaves a tale like a master storyteller. As I finished each book and began another, I can tell you I was never disappointed. Louise Cooper's stories are as good as those of Brian Lumley, Terry Brooks and J.R.R. Tolkien. If you love fantasy, Ms. Cooper is a writer not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book!!","review":"This is a very good book to start a very good series! I had never read Louise Cooper before, but I will definitely read more of her books now. The story begins kind of slow, but more than makes up for it through the whole book. It is an excellent story of an obnoxious princess who, out of arrogance and foolhardiness, ruins her perfect life and curses the world when she releases the seven demons in the fabled Tower of Regrets, and must not rest (or die) until she restores peace to the Earth Mother. It has many, many qualities, emotionally, suspensefully, and most importantly, fantasy!

Night Shyamalan - people love to hate on him these days). I haven't watched the original Nickelodeon series, so I can't comment on how well it adapts the story; I know this movie covers the events of season one. But all in all I found it to be a very enjoyable, if flawed, young adult fantasy/action film (like \\"The Golden Compass\\"). And it made me really want to check out the TV series.

The only positive things that I can say about this movie is that the graphics are really good and the costumes are great. The negatives highly out weigh the positive, however. The actors can't even pronounce any of the names correctly, they cut out characters pivotal to to plot, montages were over used, the acting sucked, and there were times where it felt like a 1970's kung fu movie.

The movie is heavily influenced by Buddhism and the \\"benders\\" who control the elements do so by Ta Chi movements. If you could give half stars I would rate it a 3.5 but rounded up.

There is depth perception in some scenes, but that's it. Can be watched without glasses with little or no distortion.

This movie sucked so bad, it gave Hollywood a hickey; you see where I'm going with this? The writing: terrible. Direction: terrible. Effects: mediocre.

I had great expectations for the live-action film, but it was terrible. The storyline was mostly different than the cartoon, and at times, didn't make any sense. Acting was extremely poor, and the themes were over emphasized throughout the movie (yes, I get that it's your destiny--Shut up about it).The only really good part of the film was seeing bending in action.

On the other hand if a good story and acting is you forte then you'll probably be disappointed like I was. I have to say not having seen the cartoon Airbender in Nicktoon really helped me finished this movie simply because I had nothing to compare it with but now that I have managed to see a couple of season of it I have to say what a waste of time that movie was. First of all the main character's acting is so terrible I couldn't bear to listen anymore, throw in some one liners and cheese acting by some of the other cast members and you have a hell of a ride.

And I'm pretty generous when it comes to certain films, but this one a polished turd.Do yourself a favor and rent this on Netflix if you want to watch it that bad. If you have never seen or heard of the Last Airbender Series or just have low movie standards then there is a slim chance you might actually like the movie, but even avid movie watchers will tell you it's pretty shoddy. The only thing interesting may be some special effects and that's about it. It's pretty much a rushed story, poorly acted, cheesy film based on the Avatar: The Last Airbender animated series.

All the makings of a good movie were there (karate stuff, special effects, decent background), but it just didn't work together.

The action scenes are some of the worst. All they are is a whole bunch of special effects with bad fight scenes. M. Night is the wrong director for this film.

I've seen some real stinkers in my life, but this was BY FAR the worst movie I've ever had to watch. I will readily admit this is, in large part, due to my love for the animated series, but even that aside...this movie was a flop.If you love (or even just \\"liked\\") the animated series, don't watch this.

I knew I wanted to see this movie because the effects had to be amazing, although I also knew there would have to be some differences.But it just went downhill from there.The main characters' names were mispronounced, why?! It was incredibly distracting.Why change the way bending works? Why the extra fluff moves, and yet none of the extra umph that is shown in the cartoon? Why the horrible glaring contradictions: earth benders in an earthen cell?The cartoon was light hearted, funny!, and amazingly complex world one can believe in. Which is why it was such a fun cartoon to watch as an adult.Overall, this movie was a disappointment to me as a fan of the Avatar: The Last Airbender series.

More like a script with a bunch of one word lines, back and forth till you want to push the mute button. I think the director needs to find a new line of work. good idea of a movie, but fails in every way and then some. I going to tell people to buy it just to see how crappy it really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"My kids and I love the cartoon and this movie was supposedly based on the cartoon.

First of, the very concept of people who can, by doing kung fu moves, manipulate the four elements; earth, fire, air and water, just looks ridiculous on screen. Yes, the Jedi Knights in the Star Wars movies could do similar things, but at least it looked natural there, as if the Jedi is reaching out beyond their bodies to do it. Here, it just looks stupid.

It sucked in the theatre but wasn't as sucky seeing it a second time online but still horrible. I'm only giving it two stars because a few things they actually got right: the fire nation ships, costumes, the landscape of the southern and nothern water tribes, a handful of bending scenes, the casting of Aang, Katara, Sokka and Princess Uwei wasn't bad but everyone else was out of place.

Not only were there unnecessary cuts, as other reviewers have elaborated on, there were really stupid and unnecessary changes from the story all the way down to name pronunciations.

They supposedly spent all the money on special effects...could have fooled me.This was my last hope for a decent M. Night Shyamalan movie and it failed...miserably. I don't even think kids liked it very much. Complete FAIL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and your time. Avoid this movie.","review":"This movie is absolutely aweful. If you want a more detailed review of why, there are plenty of good ones out there. And I support those reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"primitive plot, good visiual, and non-existent 3D","review":"It is a typical fantasy film, kind of a fairy tale, with very simple and predicatable plot. At the end of the movie the stage is set for a sequel and it is amazingly obvious what will happen in the sequel, down to the details, based on the simplicity of the plot of the movie.The movie is reasonably entertaining for adults and suitable for kids. There is a fair amount of action but mostly non-violent (or does not appear to be violent). The computer graphics and visuals are very nice. It could be a decent film to watch in 2D. However, 3D is possibly the worse from all 3D films released so far. The image is astonishingly flat, and computer graphics takes absolutely no advantage of 3D possibilities. Don't waste your money on the 3D version.By the way, on one of the web site this movie got multiple \\"awards\\" - the worst film of the year and the worst 3D of the year. Not sure about the first one, but the second one is well deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!!","review":"Disappointing!The movie promises sooo much when one reads about the movie, when one sees the preview BUT watching the whole movie I was very disappointed -Lots of effects but that is it - it is a movie one watches BUT will not watch again....not worth buying, not worth keeping! if one wants to see it ONLY AS A RENTAL!!!Therefore VERY DISAPPOINTING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"The Nickelodeon cartoon series was absolutely amazing. The story principal was well thought out and the characters were people you really cared about, that faced problems and overcame them, becoming stronger.The movie based on those stories is a HUGE disappointment. It failed to capture the essence of the characters and took maybe three or four points along the first season's story line and tried to cram it into one story. The dialog has to work overtime to make up for not showing what happened, and is therefore weak and repetitive. There is barely enough time to understand the journey that the characters are going to take, and then it's over.The special feature interview with the creators of the cartoon is the only thing worth watching on the dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal beyond words.","review":"The writing was awful, the acting was terrible, and the plot was horrifically rushed.

I can't believe the movie studios are dragging their feet on releasing better 3d movies in time for the busiest retail season of the year .. Why are they taking so long to put out 3d blu ray movies.

When I went to see the thirz Ice Age movie in theatres, they showed a teaser for the Last Airbender. My sis and I eagerly awaited summer od 2010 to see it. Now I invited my best friend, Grace to see it with me, since she was also an Avatar fan. But she had told me it had gotten bad reviews, so we saw New Moon instead. So monthes go by and on a dreary November day, my sis and I order it from OnDemand. We watched it. When it finished, we sat there speechless. she sid two words: \\"That sucked\\" I couldn't agree more. I was a little annoyed with the different name pronunciations, but when they cut out Suki, I was annoyed. She becomes a key character in the third season. All the fun was sucked out of it.

The animation series is one of my favorite stories ever with beautiful animation. I curled up on the couch with this movie excited to geek out to the story. The first few scenes of the movie I was just shocked at how awful the acting is. This is insignificant next to the blatant racism of this production. The \\"bad guys\\" are cast as middle eastern, playing into the most cliche hollywood stereotypes of the day. The animation series doesn't play into these simplistic cliches. Rather, it creates a world where many different viewers can be represented and explore the narrative of transformation and social change."},{"rating":"1","title":"No 0 star rating available","review":"This is a horrible rendition of the series.

Yes, it's one movie having to cover an entire season. I understand that. But when you have visual confirmation of what everyone should look like, as well as sound check for all the pronunciations, how do you screw up so much? Look, the water tribes have brown skin.

Now if you are one of the avid fans of the cartoon series then yes you will surely and absolutely be DISGUSTED with this film. From the interviews you would think the director (aka the Hack) would be caring to make sure it stays true to the story and characters of the series. Nothing to recreate here the story and characters are well thought out from the series but no the hack has to put his trademark style in the movie and voila the biggest disaster of a movie.

Nice try M.night Shyamalan but this was a straight to the dvd film. I couldn't believe the horrendous screenplay, I never finished watching it. Trying to fit a whole season of series into less than a 2hr film is one short of a miracle. Some cast members needed to be recasted and the screenplay needs to go back where it came from. Until a better version is due to be released if and in the future, I will stick with the animation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous","review":"Piss-poor, even for an adaptation.If you're a fan of the series, don't bother.

The previews showed a promising movie; reality dictated otherwise. Objectively speaking, the acting was sub-par, there was little to no character development (usually a focus, if not a must, for movies that plan on sequels), and the plot was somewhat weak. Not hating on the movie or series, and I am not judging the correlation between the movie and the series. This is just a review on the Airbender motion picture.If you would like to check it out, I recommend renting first before purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It wasnt as bad as they say it is","review":"As you can tell this movie got a bunch of bad reviews, mostly because changes made and things cut out. What all the people giving bad reviews seem to not realize is that it is really hard to take the personality of charecters in a cartoon and make them physical because it would make the movie seem corny and lame. For example the scooby doo movies. they act just like they do in the cartoon and the movies are very very bad. Overall not bad as a movie. Could it have been directed a little better? Yes of course but altogether M. Night didnt do too bad of a job."},{"rating":"1","title":"True Disappointment!!!!!","review":"I am a big M. Knight fan. Like most, I was excited to hear about the movie coming out. Then I heard about the casting.... Well maybe it will be alright since it's a M. Knight film. If you are a true Avatar fan, do not waste your time with this movie. If you never watched the series, them you will probably enjoy the movie.Personally I was pissed off with it. He changed the names of the character, why? It's not like they were hard names to pronouce. The bending took foreeeeevvvvver!!!! By the time they actually do bending, the other person could take them out. Why change the personallities of the characters. That's why you fell in love with show. Long story short, I hated the movie! I hope if they continue making the movies they get someone else to do it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Casting Nightmare","review":"Wow, never in Hollywood history has such a movie been so badly cast. There are no name actors in the movie, and that was remarkably courageous of the director. But the actor cast made the movie seem like a bad high school production. The stupidity and banality of the characters, plot, and dialogue are all understandable -- I mean, this is after all a cartoon series dreamed up by white men about young Asians so what do you expect? What's not forgivable is the casting nightmare -- you'd want to more laugh at the chief villain rather than shutter in fear.Critics are calling this movie the end of M Night Shyamalan's career but that's unlikely. If mediocrity were cause for termination Hollywood would become a ghost town."},{"rating":"1","title":"the last airbender","review":"This is NOT authorised to playback in this area.

Yes there were a lot of stuff cut out of the movie that they had in the cartoon and yes some of the acting was a bit off but it was a great movie and it tells a great story. M.

I have said for a few years now that Avatar: The last Airbender was my ultimate favorite series of all time. This movie made me sick. You took something good and fun and completely AWESOME and fudged it up ROYALLY. You stripped it of innocence and beauty. I used to be your fan. BLECK!!!! Not anymore. Actually, I'm pretty sure I hate you now. As a matter of fact you are now ranked right up there with the devil on my handy scale of evil doers. I know it may sound childish to feel so strongly about something, but the t.v. show really made me feel happy and like a child again. It brought back the innocence and awe that I used to feel. I had to re-watch the entire series to get the nasty taste off my brain from his (MNS) adaptation.P.S. I'm not actually a very dramatic person usually, but this just had to be said."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont do it","review":"If M Night was smart he could had have this spread out into 7 to 8 movies like the Harry Potter films.

The obvious complaint as most of you have already heard is why the change in the character's race? Usually Hollywood does this to include A-list actors in their films. Puzzling. The script was predictably campy and childish just like the show. I've yet to see a decent movie from M.Night since Six Sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute garbage!","review":"That's right, this movie is absolute garbage. From start to finish: crap. I can't tell you how many people I've told to avoid this (not just for the racist casting choices) who've gone to seen it in theaters only to come back and tell me: \\"You were right! Why didn't I listen to you?\\"Seeing all of MNS's movies I can say that is is definitely his worst. That is, if he doesn't come out with another movie that tops the crap that is The Last Airbender. The only way I would recommend watching this movie would be if there is a RiffTrax version in the future.Avoid at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just plain TRASH to the original fans","review":"Generic lines bad acting terrible scripts just plain garbage to the fans of the original series.Some of the characters names are changed and the back grounds of there origin are also changed.

THEY ARE DIFFERENT. I liked the story... it had CLEAR purpose and I found myself caring for the protagonist. It was a classic hero's journey.

THIS FILM IS A WINNER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peraonally, I liked it","review":"I have never seen the original cartoon, but I liked this movie. I was not expecting much after the terrible reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. The acting wasn't great, but it was nowhere as bad as the reviews would lead you to believe, and the story is very good. i had no trouble following along, and I liked the tai-chi like dance of the bending. Go into it with an open mind and you will find it pretty darn good. I look forward to the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie! Never saw the cartoon version though.","review":"I loved the movie. Effects and gracefulness of whatever form of martial arts was used flowed well. I'm hoping they continue with the trilogy and complete the movie.I've never seen the cartoon version though. A lot of the bad reviews seem to come from reviewers who were followers of the cartoon series. I guess this typical if you've been introduced and immersed with the original format--like a song. If you're used to hearing it sung the original way, hard to accept the rendition ;-)I still recommend this movie for pure entertainment and appreciation of the art of movie making."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you must watch this, then at least save some money","review":"This movie is horrible. Everything that was wonderful about the cartoon fell apart in the hands of Director Shyamalan. Although the special effects were good, they couldn't save the movie. The acting was horrible, and the terrible script didn't help. They made Aang completely serious and devoid of joy or a personality for that matter. This movie is not one of those \\"It's so bad it's good\\" movies. But, if you DO still want to see it because you wonder how it could possibly be as awful as everyone says it is (a mistake I made)then at least rent it from Redbox and save yourself a dollar. Believe me, the less money you spend on this movie the less guilt you'll have after watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"seriously","review":"Ok seriously people it was one person's interpretation of how he imagined that a live action movie should be. Granted I understand that many people had expectations and all but come on already . No I haven't seen the cartoon version and I do agree at least the names should have been pronounced properly butin the end it was like I said it was one imagining of events.

The special effects were worth the two stars, but there was absolutely no humor in the movie. I felt that the depth of each character was paper thin. They missed several key plot points for Book 1: Water as well. I understand that you can fit only so much subject material from a season into a feature length movie, but I felt they didn't even try. If they decide to follow up with books 2 and 3, I sincerely hope that it is written differently. They have great source material, so this shouldn't even be an issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to take away stars.","review":"There should be negative stars for this film.

I am so upset about this piece of bulls***! I have watched the entire books of the cartoon. The cartoon is awesome, serious, and funny. I was so upset to learn that HOLLYWOOD did away with the true meaning of the cartoon that me, my daughter and my grandson used to watch together as a family. Yes I am a grandmother who watches the cartoon and I LOVE it! But this movie sucks big time. No one in HOLLYWOOD truly thought about the fans you can tell from the cast of this movie. I hope that they remake this movie and get it right the next time. And who the hell casted a little white kid to play an asian kid? Yes the kid is cute but still...the entire cast to me was ALL wrong. This movie looks like a great B-movie maybe a B is a bit extreme a C-movie is more like it.

I could go on for paragraphs describing in detail why it was so bad but, I'll try to keep it brief. My main issue was that it didn't stick to the show at all. For example, the characters from the movie were nothing like the characters from the show. Their attitudes and mannerisms had changed, along with some of their names. They also left out key elements that shaped the story and replaced them with trivial instances. The acting was ok. For the roles they were playing, the actors did a somewhat decent job but they could have researched the parts a little better. Overall, I was heartbroken by this piece of trash and because of this, I have made it my life goal to get M Night blacklisted in the film making community."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fans Stay Away","review":"If you're a fan of the Avatar: The Last Airbender series then stay away from this movie.

Yes, as a director you need to make changes to a story to adapt it for live action but this complete garbage.

As an adaptation of a FABULOUSLY imaginative animation with greater depth of story and character than any cartoon should be able to lay claim to, it is SACRILEGE! Shyamalan and this complete failure of an adaptation that he created, make me both saddened and angry.

It also suffers from child actors that deliver their lines with dull and wooden expressions. I felt like someone was just reading me the screenplay there is so much narration in this movie. Not even for complex story points, but very simple ones. You don't have to tell me that the boy is going to fall for the cute girl. What a crutch. Also the ending moves so far away from the series it is laughable. With out giving to much away. Not for the movie, but so I don't ruin the ending of season 1 for you since I highly recommend that one. **spoiler** The point of it was balance and what happens when that balance is lost.

First, I was not expecting to watch a movie that was 100% accurate with the cartoon story already established. This does not however excuse the painful to watch acting, the things that made absolutely no sense, and the incredible choppiness. This movie is so far beyond terrible that it has absolutely zero redeeming qualities. Even Dragonball Evolution was a better movie.Bottom line, not only should you not see this movie, you should get your money back for buying or renting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Air","review":"Worst. Movie. Ever. From the static line readings to charmless characters, from the haphazard plotting to uninspired action/visual effects set ups. If there was a way to make a movie bad, Mr. Shyamalan not only found it, he made up more as he went along. At least hacks deliver a predictable summer commodity, but someone please tell this guy he cannot write nor direct. It's like The Sixth Sense was one crazy fluke. I'm not even comparing this movie to the brilliant Nicolodeon series. This film version has created its very own abysmal level of quality. With a little luck may it stay there and spawn no sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"familiar but not the same","review":"this is a good movie for people whom have yet to see the original tv show. mispronunciation of the character's names, the plot is the same but the atmosphere of the show is gone. even the setting in most of the scenes were off. i understand m. night shayamalan had to bunch it all together, and production had to be a certain way because it was a cartoon before it was a movie but they should have just left it as it was and parted with the \\"live-action\\" dream. it was a miss in my book. not a good film for the tv show followers. :/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow that was trash","review":"The cartoon was a classic. This movie wasn't even classically bad. Pretty much a waste from start to finish and a total trashing of a brilliant original story. It was like watching one of those sit-com episodes where the writers have run out of material, so they do a flash back show of old funny stuff. Which would have been fine if they didn't accidentally show you clips from another show that weren't in the least bit funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the cartoon series instead","review":"The movie was quite bad. I only gave it two stars, because it did hold true to a couple of the cartoon episodes from the first season. But the acting was poor, and development was sorely lacking. I watched the entire animated series from beginning to end, and it was much, much better than this movie. If you watched the movie and have a bad taste in your mouth, watch the cartoon instead. It's actually a very good series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written script","review":"The script did not do justice to the original Avatar. I could not find fault in scenery and special effects; the back-end crew did their job. Here are the reason for poor rating:- need tighter script, doesn't seem to be written in native English tongue.- need better directing, poor camera angles to highlight character emotions to convey message- need better post cut, amateur editing/cutting job only concentrate on action scenes but not character dialogueGood thing it was free through Amazon Prime.If they continue with the 2nd movie, replace the writer, director, and editing house on this first movie. Then, I will reconsider purchase it and forgive their poor judgement on the first cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents are corrupting their kids with this blank","review":"PEOPLE those of you who gave blank 5 stars are either old or stupid(both can apply) that know nothing about special effects or ART. The MARTIAL ARTS WERE TERRIBLE, visual effects even WORSE given our current technological standards. If you want art & visual grandeur watch AVATAR not the Last blank bender who cant act or anything....DO NOT BUY OR WATCH TERRIBLE, if its free like in NETFLIX go right ahead and see the torturous excuse for a movie of all TIME..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself!","review":"There's lots of great movies on amazon prime. This is not one of them. Acting is terrible, dialog is terrible, directing is terrible. It was a movie built for ages 6-9. If you are under 6, you won't understand it. If you are over 9, you will realize it's not exciting, not charming, not entertaining, and has little redeeming value except sharing a name with a beloved cartoon. I do have some relief that the movie was bad enough that there will be no sequel.If you do have a 6-9 year old, they will probably like it. Just hit play and leave the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"The story of course was great, as it is in the cartoon. The special effects were pathetic and the acting was mediocre at best. Everything was too disjointed and choppy. The cartoon flows smoothly from scene to scene. Stick to the cartoon it is a much better presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just horrible","review":"OK, first things first,pros and cons.Cons first the movie acting and and the martial arts (especialy the firebenders) was horrible. also,the fire bender coudn't just create fire, they could only move it unlike the cartoons. The comedy aspect of the show was like it was put down at an animal shelter for this movie,Sokka was just a strict big brother whereas in the show katara too care of sokka instead of vice versa. There wasalso the fights, which hardly ever had bending it was mostly martial arts... that REALLY SUCKED. overll the pros were,well actually pro since ther was only one at least they were bending in some of it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Monochromatic","review":"Everyone's written excellent reviews on this movie already, and they are utterly true. I haven't watched all of the cartoon series, so I'm not as emotionally invested in it, and it gets two stars for special effects. The day that I don't get some entertainment out of watching magical swooshy water/air being moved by fake martial arts is the day that my soul dies.What I did come here to say, though, is WHY ARE KATARA/SOKKA WHITE? Come on! There can't possibly even BE a reason to have only one race in the main characters other than the people who made casting decisions are scared of brown skin. Come ON! The water tribe's coloring is so cool, and they ruined it!In summary, watch the cartoon, or else watch the magic bits of the movie and sort of squint through all of the parts where they've bleached everyone. And plug your ears if anyone is talking.**terrible acting, as covered in the other reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie i've ever seen","review":"Terrible!! I nearly fell asleep!! After watching a few episodes of the tv show, which was well-written and entertaining, i decided to watch the movie with my younger brother. As the movie went on, i found myself yearning for an excuse to leave. The acting was bland and colorless, and the actors all acted as though the after effect of they're recent lobotomy jobs had not yet worn off. They're eyes were constantly glazed, and they're emotions were stiff and unconvincing. The only part of this movie that actually evoked some emotion in me was when the fish died, and the one thing that prevented me from falling asleep completely was the special effects, which were reasonably good and entertained my little brother."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was good action.. BUT..","review":"I thought the graphics were good.. the story line was OK.. but when you miss pronounce the names of the characters.. every time you hear the name is just grates on my ears.. I think this movie would have done a WHOLE lot better if the people making the movie stuck with saying the names like the cartoon. It seems like that's the biggest problem they had. Maybe they'll figure this out (if they want to make good money) and have everyone say the names like the cartoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time you will NEVER get back","review":"I love the show. It's my favorite on Nick and I'm 25!Seriously. This movie sucked.The bad:Mispronunciations of character names.Cast was all wrong look-wise not acting wise.The tone of the whole movie was depressing. Where are the happy funny moments? Sokka is cheesy and Hilarious!The movement of the benders were wrong!basically, it was 99.9% badThe Good:The 3d effects. They were the only good thing in this filmI truly believe that those not following the show would be totally confused by this story line. I don't think it's possible to cram 1 whole season into 1 movie and get all the details you need. If the movie had been split into two, it might have had a chance. This was so not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment...","review":"Well, the Last Airbender TV series is probably one of the best made for TV animation I've seen to date. For that exact reason, true my expectations were high. But even without that, this movie was still a disappointment. First, the acting is just terrible. Second, the plot is fragmented and story's just too bastardized. Even if someone didn't see the excellent TV series, I feel that anyone will be disappointed with the result. This movie just isn't well made. Only good thing about the movie is the special effects. Somebody should remake this movie...properly. It deserves better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every performance on the verge of tears","review":"Bad acting. No tension. Broken Story. No laughter or comedy.

Skip the movie, watch the cartoons."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"We really wanted to like this movie. The acting was so bad, I couldn't believe that M. Night Shamaylan was the director. The acting was LAME. The story had potential, but the movie was very was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is made for those who know nothing about the airbender","review":"If you have not watched the series, buy this movie. If you have watched the series, do not buy this movie. It does not follow the series well. Pronunciations of names are wrong and hard to listen to (most notibly the main character's). The coloring save during fire bending was earth toned and probably will not appeal to younger children, though 6 - 10 should be okay with it. To imagine the 3D version could have made this movie better of at least more than it is would be a mistake. It was a rushed and very short film, lacking the humor that the series was known for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing in Every Way","review":"Everything that could go wrong went wrong in making Airbender. The casting was bad, the acting was awful, the directing was horrendous, the dialogue was terrible, the story telling was embarrassing, the pacing was wrong, nothing made sense, and the special effects weren't not any more impressive than those found in a good video game.I've seen some bad movies in my day (thanks Syfy Channel), but this may be the worst movie I've ever seen.One positive about the DVD: You don't have to endure the 3D. For that, one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"He ruined my favorite TV show, completely","review":"If you want to know what this Last Airbender thing is, go watch the original TV show and skip the movie. The movie is nothing compared to the TV show. In fact, the movie is sub-standard compared to the amazing wit, humor, and character-building in the show. The TV show is rich in details, characters, story-line, plots, love-interests, family problems, situational problems, villains (who may not be as bad as they seem!), and friends. The movie develops NONE of this. The movie glosses over details, leaves out important characters, and does not develop characters enough to make you care about them or what happens to them (beyond that they are the main characters, so you probably are supposed to care).M. N. S.'s ruined it for me, my friends, and family. I'll bet you that your kids will love the TV show and not really enjoy the movie that much.On my Christmas Wish List? The original TV show. Go check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"It's hard not to compare the movie to the show. The show was sooo good, I had to see the movie. However I was extremely disappointed with the movie. The acting was terrible, the story was ruined, the effects weren't as good as I expected them to be, and they kept pronouncing the names weird. I'm glad I didn't have to pay to watch it. It would have been a waste of money. Shamalayn (I don't care how it's spelled) completely destroyed the my dreams of watching a good avatar movie. Don't waste your hard earned money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Director, Writer and everyone involved in this movie is a Disgrace to the TV Series.","review":"I hated it once I saw the cast and then once everyone started actually speaking I felt even more disgusted. I can not possibly believe that anyone who ever saw the TV series would produce a movie to monstrosity. The cast is nothing like the movie, the script is atrocious. This movie resembles the TV series in name only."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible apaption to an awesome cartoon!","review":"Now to start this review off i am a fan of the show. So when i heard about the movie i thought sweet! I rented it and watched it. It was a horrible movie and i wish never watched or rented it! NEVER SEE THIS MOVIE! M night took the series and made it into a horrible movie! The acting was awful i have seen better acting in a raw fish then this movie. Dave Pattele who played Zuko was the only good actor and i am not really a fan of him! It was not true to the story nor did they prenounce the names right! It was too damn fast too. Watch the cartoon instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST 3D we have seen yet.","review":"Crayola 3D sidewalk chalk was WAY better than the 3D for Last Airbender.

I read the other reviews and thought \\"These are written by people who've been watching the cartoon series for years...that's why they don't like the movie!\\"Never having watched the cartoon series, I thought I'd really like this movie. But I was wrong. This movie has great special effects and a great concept behind it. However, it's the SCRIPT that sucks. There is pretty much no character development, and the emotions the characters DO express seem to come out of the blue, are melodramatic and well, they just don't seem to FIT. The dialogue is just so awkward.I give this movie 2 stars for the basic concept of it and the special effects. It wasn't a TOTAL waste of time...but it was pretty bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 3D is horrible","review":"Most of the movie is in 2D. The 3D parts are so unpronounced that you can watch them without the glasses and notice little to no distortion. If you liked the movie, just get it in 2D. It's more of a hassle wearing the glasses and paying the extra money for the 3D than it's worth. Had I have been able to give it 1/2 a star, I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your a fan of the animated series, you won't enjoy this","review":"This movie got me interested in the Last Airbender. After watching the movie, I watched the cartoon series. The cartoons are way better and more interesting. After I watched the entire cartoon series, I went back and watched this. I couldn't stand it. There are so many differences. The only thing that kept me interested was the bending effects in the movie. Nothing better than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible waste of a top notch story","review":"My family and I watched all the Nickelodeon episodes. Loved them. We knew this one was going to be bad but we thought we would give it a chance. Simply awful. Mispronounced names, even the creators called the main character Aang not Ong and Soe-kuh... why not Socka like the creators say. Unbelievable that so many simple things could have at least been done right. The air bending, fire bending effects are like slo motion but not in a good sense. The acting is so horrible my 6 year old and 4 year old were laughing. Jackson Rathbone almost does ok, but is just sucked down the vortex of this wrongly executed film. Did M. Night not even watch the original shows?I can honestly say, even to fans, don't bother. Just watch the animated versions again and enjoy. Seriously, don't even bother, you will wish you hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"If you've never seen the show this is based on, you will be completely lost.

I've watched the entire series and I'm very unimpressed with the content of the movie. The movie just can't grab my attention long enough to want to pay attention. When the series came out on netflix I sat down and watched the entire series in 2 days. I waited a long time for this movie to come out and I'm so disappointed. I really hope that they don't do any of the others. Please leave this amazing children series alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Don't watch this movie.Seriously, watch the cartoon. If you haven't seen the cartoon before, you are in for a treat. If you have, watching this movie will just make you sad, so just watch the cartoon again.Even if you approach this movie with drastically lowered expectations, you will probably be disappointing. It's not surprising that Shyamalan dropped many the the details that made the cartoon so great.

Night should've seen this coming!","review":"This is just about as bad as those stupid \\"Twilight\\" movies! Ughhh! The first \\"Twilight\\" film was OK but the sequel was bile. And this one ranks right up there with it. Jackson Rathbone (who co-stars in the \\"Twilight\\" films) purely got this job just because he could say the sister's name (Hitara, I think) just like the annoyingly-dubbed voice in the cartoon. In fact, the most annoying thing about this film was the acting and voices that were so similar to the annoying cartoon. The story itself -- as well as the action -- is interesting but the acting is horrid. I mean, c'mon! Aasif Mandvi .... from the \\"The Daily Show\\" ... as a villain!?!?!? SERIOUSLY!?!?!? I couldn't buy it! And the lead, Noah Ringer, was just not a good actor. Interesting that a story about Asian characters are played by caucasian actors. Oh well. I like M.

I wish it had done better because I would like to see the rest of the books made in to movies. I did watch the cartoon, which I enjoy, and understand that when a movie is based off of a book or t.v. show it's not going to be exactly the same. M.Night did a great job with the adaption.

They mispronounce the names, change the personalities, bastardize the plot, suck out all of the humor, and take away every single thing that made the show great.At least with the show you could actually believe that these were KIDS you were watching, which was the point. This movie made everything dark and broody, and made bending just look silly. I wonder if M. Night even bothered to watch the show in the first place. From what I heard all he did was have his daughter tell him about it after she dressed up like Katara for Halloween. Great.I was really excited when I heard this was coming out, but it just wound up being disappointing. Seriously, don't bother buying it. It'll only encourage them to make the sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only watchable with Rifftrax.","review":"A cataclysm of awfulness. I don't even know where to begin on this awful movie. The dialogue and acting is a failure on every level, not only failing to keep you engaged, but also failing to make sense at times. The story is comprised of major events from the Avatar TV show, the problem being that the show had 20 episodes to develop itself and the movie has just under two hours. The movie's one possible saving grace would have been the effects, but even those are just average.The only way I recommend seeing the film is with the genius comedy of MST3K stars Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett over at [...].

All appologies to Jeffrey Sachs, who lays out a heartfelt and idealistic case for ending poverty, but this is the best work on the subject I've read. Hernando de Soto's insights into the informal economy, the creation of wealth and the importance of property rights should be the starting point for any discussion addressing world poverty and economic development. And while not the smoothest read, de Soto makes his points clearly and succinctly, boring into the heart of the subject with very little pomp or fluff. For importance, it has to be in the discussion for the best popular economics book since \\"Free to Choose.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Answer to Global Poverty?","review":"The Mystery of Capital posits the theory that development of capitalist economies is a function of the ability to accurately record and protect the private ownership of property as a means of allowing that property to function as capital. Once the nature of ownership passes beyond just the realm of physical possession, property can be synthesized into non-physical forms that can be sold, rented or borrowed against to generate more economic activity. The problem in Developing Nations isn't a lack of property, but rather an inability to convert property into its most productive uses. The author includes numerous statistics to substantiate his hypothesis, but not so many that your eyes glaze over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to know why the 3rd World is poor?","review":"Don't be misled by De Soto's rhetoric; he attempts to paint a picture of the third world that ignores the ongoing exploitation of those countries by the first world. Understanding the plight of some of these nations requires delving into their history and critically examining their trade, diplomatic, and military relations with the developed countries. For an analysis which takes these factors into account instead of ignoring them, check out \\"Year 501: The Conquest Continues\\" by Chomsky."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Asset Management...OH, PLEASE!\\"","review":"\\"The Mystery of Capital:Why Capitalism Trumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else,\\" by Hernando De Soto. is a crock of...

Hello!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Duh!","review":"Do you remember in college when you would get a textbook that repeated key phrases over and over again instead of making them bold, rendering it impossible to skim and a longer read than is necessary? That's the impression this book gave me.Although De Soto's points are mostly valid, they are overly elaborate and sometimes exceedingly obvious. In particular, the segment on squatters in the post-colonial United States takes up a considerable portion of the book, yet proves only a minor point that could have easily been explained in much less.Another major issue I have with this book is that one of the main axioms of the book's thesis, that extralegal settlements are dead capital, is not well justified at all. Without this point De Soto is only proving correlation not causation.If you are the government official of a developing country, then I highly recommend this book. If you aren't, I suggest you find something else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting information","review":"The book certainly contains interesting information, and makes you think about the basis of western economies. The first couple of chapters seemed a little trivial as they did not present any new information for me, and it seemed like the author was repeating the same point over and over again. After the inital hump, it got better and the author does do a good job of describing the developing of the property system in the U.S., which was qutie interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"De Soto forgets about risk management and market liquidity","review":"De Soto, observing that \\"the single most important source of funds for new businesses in the United States is a mortgage on the entrepreneur's house\\", concludes that by providing real estate property titles to poor people, they will have access to the same type of funds from banks.He forgets two important facts:1) Banks take into consideration the credit worthiness of the entrepreneur asking for the loan. A poor person in a shanty town with a business idea of starting a fruit stand will not be considered credit worthy by any commercial bank.2) Banks take into consideration the real estate market liquidity when making a property-backed loan. If the real estate market is not liquid, the bank cannot liquidate the property in case of a loan default. I'm willing to bet that the real estate market in a shanty town is less than hot.We should always bear in mind that economics is hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must reading for every eighth grader","review":"I was very disapointed in the book. Everything Mr. DeSoto says is true, of course, and important. Further, it's not understood by many, including many in the west who should be interested and passionately involved. I was eager to read more, for instance, about the real impact of liberation theology and land redistribution (with protective limits on true title and transfer options) on the living standards of the poor. Unfortunately, the people who need to read this aren't interested in learning more about the importance of property rights and the rule of law because it's inconvenient to their worldview. Those who are interested have almost certainly thought and read enough about this subject to find Mr. DeSoto's book to be basic and tediously repetitive. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important work","review":"This book is a very important work in the area of the economics of property rights. De Soto emphasizes the importance of property rights for the development of developing countries."},{"rating":"2","title":"like, not enough really complex equations and stuff","review":"The book is redundant and definately simplistic in its approach and solutions, but the research is important and compelling enough to warrant 5 stars. Anyone seriously interested in economic development, especially the macro gurus who think low inflation and balanced budgets is all capitalism needs to take off, should be aware of this research.Unfortunately, the lack of point data and \\"hard\\" analysis may keep its importance from being recognized by the usual lot academic snobs that for some odd reason seem to dominate development debates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I would have given 3 stars to this book but coming from a recognised economist as Hernando de Soto I give it only two. Although the book explains in what consists his proposal for the development of the third world, he repeats his idea too much through out the chapters. The examples and methods mentioned didn't satisfy my curiosity for his theory. The book looks more a marketing scheme for selling his idea, which isn't a bad thing, but considering the seriousness of the theme, I would have expected a more professional layout.After reading this book,go and buy The Myth of Development : Non-Viable Economies and National Survival in the 21st Century, written by Oswaldo de Rivero, a peruvian as Hernando de Soto. Although not advertised as The Mystery of Capital, it has a better book structure and an excellent analysis of the world's current situation and ways to solve it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting concept.","review":"Although communism has collapsed everywhere in the world, except in a few remaining contries,it could raise its ugly head again, especially in an age of fast growing poverty and unequal income distribution.De Soto proposes to \\"capitalize\\" the poor in an attempt to integrate them into the mainstream of societies. Governments and societies alike should find ways to legalize properties of squatters and shantty town people and to convert them into liquid assets, which can then be bartered or traded.But this is not the only problem. The goal is to motivate people to \\"create additional usable value\\", to get them out of their \\"poverty-stricken\\" mind and to teach them to be independent. This is a difficult goal to reach, but rich nations have the means to do it. And unless they are willing to tackle this problem, peace on earth cannot be assured, for poverty invites diseases, malnutrition, disturbances, and revolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-Trick Pony","review":"While the author does raise several points, by the 3rd chapter it feels like de ja vu. Yes, you are really into property rights and yes there's a lot of extralegal activities in developing economies, but do you have anything new to say?!

The main issue that I have with this book is the fact that once the hero not one time told his family about him being married already (granted the wife left but still it seems like a big secret to keep seeing as your family is trying to get you married to someone else). Then to make matters worse he finds his wife and sees she is pregnant. He helps her with the delivery and they STILL keep the baby news away from his family (his family the ones that want their children to marry and have kids). Then we are made to believe that somehow the hero managed to sneak said wife and baby in the house undetected by his family and he still DID NOT tell his family about the baby. The only reason they found out when they did was when the baby woke up crying and BIG DADDY heard the cries. Really?!?!

To read of Herman's nonchalant attitude toward killing is equally chilling than being given blow-by-blow accounts of his misdeeds, and that for me was the true horror.The structure of this novel may remind some of Stephen King's Carrie, which was written in a similar way. All in all, the book is a quick yet engrossing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe Everything You Read","review":"Don't believe everything you read in this book as much more than the 75% suggested by the author(s) is made up. Don't believe everything you read in the 4/5 star reviews above because the book wasn't nearly as enjoyable as they say. Is the book scary? No. Is the manner of storytelling new, unique or effective? No. Those who rave on endlessly about the merits of this work do not read nearly enough. The author(s) open with a narrative figure that disappears never to return after the brief intro. Many of the one-sided dialogue/monologues are too similar in tone and style to make you believe in the characters. What is described as \\"the wildest book I ever read\\" or \\"a totally new concept\\" is nothing more than a gimmick designed to disguise a rather poorly told story.

Unfortunately, the way the story is told makes it exasperating to read. The novel is told in a series of short first- person accounts, with each character telling his or her own story. The prose is pedestrian and not at all written in the style of the time period. All the characters sound the same. I'm afraid the writers don't have the skill to pull it off. The story becomes confusing and eventually boring. A straight-forward narration would have worked much better. I still want to learn more about this man, who was the devil incarnate."},{"rating":"2","title":"eaves dropping","review":"This is the wildest book I have ever read and this serial killer topic is most intriguing to me so I have read much. It expresses the diabolical acts of murder in such a matter of fact way that you almost feel like Hermans special guest where he is just \\"showing Off\\" for you. The way in which it is written makes you feel as though you are eaves dropping on some juicy conversations. This absolutely holds your attention and keeps you anticipating the next page. It is in no way predictable. One piece of advice I would give a reader is to pay close attention to the various characters and how they relate. It can get a bit confusing because there are so many that come into Hermans life including all of him. All in all this is an exceptional book and well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long on discourse and too short on solution","review":"This author provides many facts as well as long discussions without a central theme. While it makes an interesting read on the many facets of American higher education, the solution offered to dismantle the higher education as knowledge factory and rebuild it as higher learning is far too light-weight. The author, obviously a social scientist, views the reform from the angle of humanities and social science. While this is encouraging, it is by no means adequate.In fact, Aronowith's solution is not even as good as the one offered by the book \\"The Abandoned Generation,\\" which suggests separating the undergraduate education from university and make it a separate entity much like high schools are separated from middle schools.

And as always Cornwell's writing style is great and if a fan of action then you'll enjoy this work it's packed full of swords, axes, battles and blood, you could ask for more.Uhtred is faced with a dilemma, whether or not to fight for the Saxon King Alfred or fight with the Dane warriors he knows best, he finally makes his decision when Alfred offers him command of his small but powerful navy. And from here Uhtred faces numerous dangerous situations from naval battles to surviving the invasion of a massive Dane army and rescuing Alfred from the swamps of Wessex. All the while he wonders if he is doing the right thing in fighting for the Saxons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uhtred's journey continues","review":"This is the second of Cornwell's books about the 9th century England of King Alfred the Great as seen through the eyes of Uhtred. I'd recommend that the books are read in order: each book builds on its predecessor.Uhtred sees - and moves between - both sides in the conflict between the Danish and the Kingdom of Wessex. He is ultimately fighting to recover the lost estates of his father but has sufficient links with both sides in the conflict to be useful to both. And, perhaps, trusted by neither because his loyalties are clearly divided.Again, Cornwell makes the battle scenes of the front line (the Shield Wall) come alive in their chaos and bloodshed. At the same time, the struggle between the pagans and the Christians is part of the fabric of the story.I like the character of Uhtred as depicted by Cornwell. I found the novel both entertaining and enlightening.Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment...Big","review":"This thing just ain't cut out from the same cloth as the Last Kingdom. It starts out with Uhtred losing a lifetime opportunity b'coz he wants to go home and shag his wife, who he dumps for the nunnery later anyway. I like Uhtred and his attitude, but this book is really uneventful.Take my advice. Don't buy it. Bernie's rich. Doesn't need our charity. I donated the book to a kid in Afghanistan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never interested in this period until now.","review":"I have read all of the Sharpe series as they were printed and couldn't wait for the next. I finished the Archer series last year and took a break from MR. Cornwell. I downloaded the kindle version on a whim and found this book to be really interesting. The characters and period took me a little while to warm to but now I am downloading the next book. The Dane invasion of England never really excited me and now I find myself looking up historical books on the period to fill in a basis for this series. Do yourself a favor and give it a try. Good stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"Cornwell is probably the best historical fiction writer today. This a very good series well written ans as always historically correct.

Made of flimsy sheet metal (and I do mean flimsy), the whole thing boasts of asian quality throughout. The top cover doesn't close correctly, latches are poorly aligned, and the paint finish is.. well, un-finished. The white paper you see attached to the pictured unit must have been glued-on by the photographer, because it sure as heck doesn't come that way. Avoid this, unless you just can't find any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steppe Peoples - Tactics and Warriors","review":"Erik Hildinger once again hits the mark with his latest book \\"Warriors of the Steppe\\". His prose makes this an enjoyable read. If you want to know about the people of the steppe and how they achieved success against their sedentary counterparts, this book will start you on that journey. The book initially deals with a generalization about nomadic peoples and their tactics. It then delves into specific historic groups ranging from the Scythians to the Manchu. While the book is well written, its broad nature as an introductory tract will more than likely whet your appetite for more. I am sure that in the future Mr. Hildinger's excellent writing skills in this subject area will be put to good use in writing specifically about any one of these peoples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding. Buy this book!","review":"As a university lecturer in military history I am constantly looking for good books for my students (both civilians and army officer cadets) to study. Hildinger's book is marvellous, and I recommend it to my students as an example of how warfare should be analysed and history should be written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teenager Interested in History","review":"This was an amazing book!

I may be a teenager, but I am really interested in history, and this book was so informative and cool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This edition is probably good","review":"I have an older copy in descripitve notation. From the other reviews, it appears this edition is algebraic. That should make all the difference in the world.

It is NOT in any way similiar to that hack edition published by Hays. It also isn't similiar to the David McKay edition from decades ago. So don't compare it to the older ones. One of the happinesses of Nimzo is his flamboyant style of writing. It always forces you to think. Chess is a game of thinking so get used to it. This new translation restores a lot of the passages that were omitted in the previous 2 versions. So give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOWSERS","review":"Thank u Mr. Hays for publishing a fabulous version of My System by Aron Nimzowitsch. Before I came across this book and read the rave reviews of this edition I stayed away from My System, because A. It was in descreptive language and B. Because it used old stodgy language. I am so glad u came out with this book, because if it weren't for your edition I would have never picked up this book and would never would have been a true chess player. This is the staple of a chessplayer if u buy any chessbook this year make it this one!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book but makes difficult reading","review":"This is by far the best chess books I have ever read. This book is very good if you are keen on improving your overall understanding of positions. The author's emphasis on concepts like open files, 7th and 8th ranks, basic end game techniques like bridge buiding and peice coordination will give the readers a greater understanding of the game. Every concept is followed by discussion of the games. This book is a good buy just for the 40 odd games at the end of the chapters, each based on a concept discussed in the earlier chapters. The games of the great masters of the 20th century are a treat to follow. However, it makes for serious reading which involves time and effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Study this book FIRST","review":"Read this book FIRST. No other chess book can help you until you have read this one. Every chess book written in the last 50+ years assumes that you are familiar with the principles Nimzovich sets out in this book. If you want to spend the rest of your life losing at chess, never mind this advice. Otherwise, READ THIS BOOK NOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Chess Book...","review":"I own about 40 chess books, but this is the first I have ever felt the need to review. This is the definitive chess book as the ideas Nimzovich brought to the game were unheard of before his mastery. Ideas like center control and prophylaxis were scoffed at, no one understood the power of a rook on the 7th or the pawn chain until his explanations. Sadly, the only flaw in this version is that the diagrams are small and grainy. (This does not detract form the expertly written text) Nimzovich was the \\"Stormy Petrel\\" for a reason. He was pretty high on himself, but generally had good reason to be. My Elo went up about 50 points during the duration of the read and another 30 on re-read. I plan on taking a week to go over it again as it has been a few years and hopefully i have improved enough to further learn from the master.Relic113"},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult to Understand","review":"I read this book when I was a teenager. Since then my understanding of chess has increased immensely. Even though at the time of reading I didn't understand a lot of it, I do notice that now later in life I use a lot of strategies in this book, but not neccessarily from reading this book. I am going to buy a new copy and see if I understand it better. This might not be the best book to get if you are a beginner because it is difficult to comprehend. If you are into buying chess books and want to have a nice collection, then you should get this book. For those who want a book that is easy to understand and will see a marketable return then try \\"How To Reassess Your Chess\\". \\"My System\\" will make you a better player but it might take more work than other books because of the complexities and early 20th Century language.PawnMoves"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hang on to your receipt....","review":"Make sure you keep your receipt if you actually purchase this book. You can probably return it for a much more enjoyable book you'll find at the store.To start, some of the situations are sooooo far fetched it's not even believable! The dialog between Tony Valentine and his love interest is ludicrous! It's worse than some soap opera dialog!Another problem is there is no character development. While the author does tell you about them to some extent (not much though with the son and the love interest), it's not enough to make any of them likeable, much less care enough about any of them to finish the book.I grudgingly did finish, hoping for some kind of atonement at the end, something to make my time invested in the book worthwhile, but alas, I was disappointed, as it didn't get any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Casino is Open - Enjoy!","review":"There is nothing funny to Tony Valentine about the murder of his best friend and ex-partner, Doyle Flanagan. Valentine, an ex-cop and a majestro at figuring out the various scams of those who try to rip off the casinos of the world is called upon in the second of James Swain's books about Valentine to try and unravel one of the most complicated deceptions that he has yet encountered. In doing so, he finds himself involved in some of the funniest and scariest escapades of his 62 year old life and the reader is taken further into the mind, dreams and hopes of this most entertaining \\"hero.\\"Swain's stories about the seamy underside of the gambling business continue to deserve our attention and it is really better if you find out for yourself what he has in store for us. I assure you that if you enjoy this type of genre, you will enjoy the journey. I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Usual Swain Wit, Creativity and Success","review":"I could read Swain's Tony Valentine books all day, every day. Swan's got to be one of the most original, creative and clever authors writing today. His books reek with reality, from the \\"Pulp Fiction\\" -style dialog to Swain's incredible knowledge of casino gambling. Some of the plot turns and characters are way way outrageous, but in Swain's hands they don't insult the reader. You'll guffaw in more than a few places and you'll learn a lot about casinos and the people who inhabit them. Unlike his other books, Swain sets this one in Valentine's home town of Atlantic City. He gives us a nice clean, simple plot that develops linearally and is not cluttered with a whole lot of psychology and intrigue. But from the outset, where Valentine's old cop partner gets killed, until the ending, where once again we find that crime doesn't pay, you'll enjoy a book that is a treat to read. Swain hits the jackpot here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book for a long flight","review":"If you want a good book for a long flight, Funny Money is a \\"good bet!\\" Tony Valentine's character is developing nicely and the relationship with his son adds an interesting twist. Add in some \\"professional\\" wrestling and some inept thugs and you have a fun read. Swain's knowledge of the gambling industry gives you something to talk about around the office water cooler. You may start to feel sorry for Casinos who are scammed (not!). You will at least root for Tony Valentine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I am a fan of gambling and mysteries. However, I am not much of a reader. A friend recomended the book and it was wonderful. Lots of twists and turns yet easy for a \\"non-reader\\" to follow. I have read Grift Sense and Funny Money.

I wanted to like it and kept reading it but it didn't have the feel of Paris and the story was too way out there for me. It felt like a science fiction book and maybe that's why I didn't like it, I don't like science fiction.After a while, I gave up on it. Reading this book felt like a painful high school English reading assignment. I decided that there were too many good books out there that I wanted to read. I wasn't wasting any more time on this book. I was going to give the book to someone else, but I didn't think it would be fair to punish anyone else.
