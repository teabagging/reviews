I just graduated a month ago, and have been asking myself such questions as \\"Who am I?\\", and \\"Where is my life headed?\\" Even if you're not a Christian, the principles (developing humility, being faithful, etc.) are useful to anyone. Do yourself a favor and either buy this book used (for those who are skeptical about the religious ideas included in this book), or request your local library to buy it (so that you can borrow it).

Each section is followed by a few questions that I found surprisingly helpful in shaping/realizing my focus, life goals (professional and personal), and what I want my remaining few \`twentysomeone' years to be about. Enjoyed the book and the result of it in my life so much that I had to share it with my friends.

I'm not religious myself, and after skimming the book and seeing references to God and passages from the Bible on almost every page I decided I wasn't interested.Had I read the reviews more carefully I probably would have realized this. Surely it's a great book for those who are Christian, and those who don't mind the religious perspective, but I would rather read one that isn't written from a religious point of view.

The format is the same, people talking about how great they are, themselves talking about the other two, etc... Not a lot of original footage of them actually working on those projects back in the day. Rush always kept the fans excited because they don't flood the market with themselves like DT does. I take this as a positive approach. This release is borderline flood. It's nice to see the band members in a documentary after a year or two of not hearing from them. It keeps things fresh when they come around."},{"rating":"2","title":"The GREATEST Drummer ever.","review":"RUSH is one of those bands that only get better and more appreciated as time goes by and we all get older. When I was younger all I knew was that the music was great of course but I didn't realize how complex it was. And then you add that in with having the greatest drummer in the world. Sorry Neil I'm sure your uncomfortable with that but a fact is a fact. Alex and Geddy are amazing too. I hope RUSH does one of these DVD's of their entire catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating insight for any Rush fan","review":"While some of this info is more or less contained in the Beyond The Lighted Stage film, this is nonetheless a fascinating glimpse into the making of 2 incredible albums from Rush. Some of the best parts include moments where Terry Brown solos up parts on the console, as well as insight from each member about coming up with the tunes, both lyrically and musically. An absolute must have for any Rush fan - even casual Rush fans will be interested in this.My only criticism is that they do not address each song from each album. For example, I would love to have heard about how they wrote and recorded side 2 of Moving Pitcures. Most of 2112 is covered (exceptions: Lessons and Tears).Fun to see these guys in this light."},{"rating":"1","title":"not videos","review":"I love RUSH and have for a long time, I thought I was ordering a set of videos of RUSH, what i got was a documentary on RUSH.

Plus most of the time you see the trio jam it is to dubbed songs and not live.

Maybe show more demonstrations solo on their instruments. Talked about gear used. What synths, amps, fx, guitars etc.... Meaning of the lyrics to those songs.Some of the bonus stuff is cool. Neil has some cool drumming footage. 2 stars for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Repetition and not all songs covered","review":"If you're looking for a song by song review of '2112' and 'Moving Pictures' you will be disappointed.Although 2112 (side A) as a concept album is discussed, side B is only briefly touched upon. (Something for nothing is covered in the 'extras'). Songs NOT covered are 'Lessons' and 'Tears'. Why wasn't Geddy asked about the lyrics for 'Tears'? since on this rare occasion he wrote the lyrics, not Neil?Same goes for Moving Pictures. Songs not covered are 'The Camera eye' (why not?), 'Witch Hunt' and 'Vital signs'. The first few minutes are a history of the band before '2112', which we have heard all before and it has been covered numerous times. Nothing new here. The two albums are squeezed into an hour. It's worth viewing but I expected more in depth track by track coverage of each track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with \\"creativity\\"","review":"I purchased this dvd due to the great reviews.

My husband is a beginner and he could only perform the sun salutations at the beginning of the video. I was hoping to see many other poses not present on the video...I was bored within minutes as the repetition offered little new info with each series.

My biggest complaint is that you have to take your hand out of the gloves a lot to cool them off even in below zero temps. I have used them for many things including four wheeling, snowboarding, hiking, cutting firewood, loading an outdoor wood boiler and other things.

But the cats are finding their way home, along with O'Malley the ally cat, and many other friends.This movie was funny, touching, and entertaining. It's sad that Disney movies aren't like this anymore. Many of you might disagree, saying that Brother Bear was similar to the old movies, but I thought that movie was a major let-down, too.This movie is clean, and free of the junk in a lot of Disney movies today. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purr-fectly...

It is a great movie for the evening because the kids aren't left feeling anxious or worked-up.As for the animation, it is a shame that everything is computer generated or enhanced nowadays.

In my opinion, the two dogs, Napoleon and What's-his-face, were hilarious. The funniest scenes in the movie were the scenes with the dogs and Edgar. By the way, one flaw in the movie (and it's a major one), is that Dutchess's owner sighned her will for her estate to go to her cats. Now what would four cats do with an estate? No wonder Edgar was so mad. I didn't blame him. Anyway, the characters themselves were great, and the kittens were cute. In a way, this movie reminds me of Lady and the Tramp (my personal favorite) because a pampered pet (in this case, Dutchess) gets lost and meets a streetwise and charming dude (O'Maley) who helps her find her way home. Just sayin' is all.Overall, an enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Disney Fun!","review":"Aristocats is not the most classic Disney movie ever, but it is a classic to say the least.

The story and movie are well-done and family-friendly, and worth watching for any Disney fan. The quality of the movie streaming is good considering the age."},{"rating":"2","title":"The approach Disney seems to have forgotten","review":"Considering Disney's recent track record, it would appear that they think the average kid is maturing faster than before. Thus, they seem to put out movies that are dark and inappropriate for the average kid. The only exceptions to this trend are the wonderful Toy Story movies and A Bug's Life. Flash back a decade or two, and you'll find a different Disney, a Disney that made movies everybody could enjoy. Aristocats comes from that era. True the animation from this decade is weak, and the story loses a few points in some areas. The villain is also quite tame. All of that, however, disappears under the movie's charm, upbeat attitude, and general fun. It's certainly more fun than Hercules. People looking for something intense should avoid this. Families with small children and those who love adorable cats will love this movie. From this era, I also recommend Robin Hood. As I've said before, you just can't beat old school Disney."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a widescreen release","review":"Shame on Amazon for recycling reviews without adding a disclaimer.

This film should have been released in its original theatrical ratio of 1.75:1. Why has Disney changed its policy about widescreen? Some people prefer full screen while others prfer widescreen. No problem. Give consumers the option, like on the excellent Mulan DVD which has both versions.

I had a bad feeling about it before I watched it. It's probably more enjoyable to children than to adults. I didn't like it for numerous reasons. The tape was in bad shape and it got stuck in my vcr. I had to pull it out and the tape was everywhere. The tomas omalley the ally cat bit was the highlight of the film. There wasn't much of a plot except that the richer cats were hanging out with the poorer cats and seemed to get along.The bad guys were bumbling and predictable. Not much of a memorable film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring....","review":"I liked this movie when I was little, now I'm 13, and when I recently watched \\"The Aristocats\\" I relized how bad and weak it is. The kittens are cute. But the story is, in my opinion, a rip-off of \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" and \\"101 Dalmations\\". The songs are really weak too, and the animation isn't all that great. If you wanna see a great, cute movie about animals, I recommend: \\"The Lion King\\", \\"Bambi\\", and \\"Lady and the Tramp\\". Don't waste your money on this. Sorry Disney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, lackluster film by lazy animators...","review":"At the point this film was made (early '70's) the animation staff had become so enamoured by the sterling quality of their own drawings that they forgot that maybe they should tell a story. This film has a lot of plot, but not a lot of story--and while the voices add a certain amount of bounce to the proceedings, they aren't given a whole lot to do other than mug to the mike. As Disney goes, it's right down there in the bottom of the barrel with Black Cauldron and Pocahontas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!","review":"This is one of Disney's worst, almost as bad and annoying as Peter Pan. Don't get me wrong - I love Disney. But this is just awful. Slow storytelling, extraneous and unimportant scenes that add nothing...The main characters aren't bad, but many of them are just excuses to add a few more excruciatingly painful minutes onto the film. Whoever approved the release of this film in 1970 was obviously still suffering the effects of a rotten acid trip. Now I know why everyone warned me not to waste my money buying this one! Guess my faith in Disney's usual excellence and quality was ill-founded in this case. Wait for it on TV, but don't go and buy it unless you really like it. Otherwise, stick with Bambi or The Lion King if you want a great Disney critter movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad we only rented this","review":"I relied on my own fond childhood memories of this film when we decided to rent it for our son. The characters are still cute and compelling, and the music is ok. We were all having a lovely time until the racist stereotype of the Asian cat said something about a fortune cookie. My four-year-old didn't seem to notice, but my wife and I instantly swapped uncomfortable glances. It was a disappointing reminder of how stereotypes are learned from an early age, often through seemingly innocuous vehicles like cartoon movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even fun for Boys","review":"This is my almost 4 year-old son's favorite Disney movie at the moment. He even picked out a small stuffed cat and named her Duchess! I love it for the jazz. The music in this movie is right there with the Jungle Book, which makes it fun for adults as well as children.

It will also be my last. Usually, when I dislike a book, I give the author (and myself) another chance. But this book was so badly written that I really am not interested in a potential repeat. I will not re-tell the story, as other reviewers have done this and the summary from Amazon is pretty extensive. The story line (young woman disappears - who did it?) could have been interesting, albeit it has been done before (what hasn't?), but it just wasn't. I simply could not feel with or for any of the characters. To me, they all seem superficial, not fleshed out, and I could not have cared less what they thought or felt. In addition, the book is written very choppily and in a non-gripping, non-suspenseful style. Bottom line: forget about this book. It is not even worth getting from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roller Coaster","review":"This book is a hard one to review. I loved reading the first 90% of it.

Since my ultimate goal is to move the ranch in the direction of permaculture, I thought this book might be useful on how to incorporate some plants into that and the Potager garden design. I was somewhat disappointed. There isn't much at all about shrubs, whether or not one is interested in standard urban landscaping or something more biodynamic.Also many plants, including shrubs and trees, are edible which the author really didn't delve into either.Never the less, as I research what types of plants fit certain niches in what I am trying to do, I am sure I will refer to this book from time to time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pint Bags - Foodsaver \\"generic\\" substitute","review":"Great bag for small batch processing.

Part Alice in Chains, part Pearl Jam, this song just had to make it into my iPod. Alas, the band (or label?) will not release the song as an MP3. I went on every legal site (I don't buy pirated songs), and, nope, not available. I had to buy the album to get the song. The album is not very satisfying, but the song is killer! I felt like I was being taken advantage of since I had no other choice. It is so counter intuitive, as millions of potential fans have been turned away because the song is not available on any download sites. I'll sell anyone who wants the album for $.99 plus shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny and not worth the money.","review":"We rented this hoping for some light entertainment, and because we had heard one of the comics on XM and wanted to hear more.

This one was a bit heavier on the Christian/Spiritual angle; however, I liked that the characters not only talk about God but let their actions SHOW their love of God. I followed the interaction between Cole and Takes-Many-Horses closely so see how those male characters developed with their struggles. The introduction of Portia gave us a character we could \\"love to hate,\\" even though it's not clear yet what role she'll play (I'll find out in book 3!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tracie is such a good writer.","review":"This book had some very sad parts I almost didn't want to read them.

I don't like the idea that the Tanglewood footage was not realsed here, but it can be purchased from various bootleggers. I'm glad we have the Rockpalast footage with Don't Let Go the Coat, an excellent song that rarely gets played. This collection is alomst like the first VHS version of the Kid Are Alright, that was serverly edited from the theatrical release. All in all a good show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gazing At You, I Get The Heat","review":"Another fine video of one of the greatest rock bands of all time, with little repetition from \\"The Kids Are Alright\\".

Very well done and highly enjoyable look back at Pete, Roger, Keith, and John in their heyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a Who fan, you gotta get this one","review":"Although the sound could be a little better, this DVD is still worth getting if you're as big a Who fan as I am. The picture quality is awesome, and so is the various concert footage. Listening to the band (especially Pete) talk about their various performances is enlightening. The sound could use a little more juice, but that just means you have to turn up your stereo a little higher. Oh darn!

I opened the phone, took the Sim card out and let it dry. I was not sure it would function, but lo and behold, I let it dry for a week and the phone is back to normal. The reception is good.

The sound is slightly muffled and it sounds like callers are not enunciating clearly. Callers say I sound the same way on the phone, and they have to say \\"what\\" a lot. Increasing the volume doesn't help. Every voicemail message I try to listen to on this phone has had at least a couple words I can't understand at all. I've tolerated this phone for a full year. I am getting a new phone specifically because of the poor sound. I use it for work and can't afford the lack of sound clarity. Also, I found the menus a little cumbersome. Checking voicemail, looking up a number in the phone book, and changing the ringer to vibrate all take several steps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I like the looks of this phone but that is about it. The voice quality is so poor that I generally catch only ever 4th word of whoever I am speaking to. I set my ring tone on the highest volume but still miss calls! Which says to me that the phone is not ringing every time. I also sometimes don't receive text messages until 3 to 4 hours after they were sent.I had decided to upgrade my Nokia phone that I had had for 3 years because it was kind of outdated. But I wish now that I had not done that because I never had a problem with it. I would have gotten another Nokia but they did not make one that I liked the looks of. I got this Samsung phone completely on looks alone and I am going to see if I can take it back.

The battery life is short, the reception isn't the best, and the phone is too smaill and hard to open. This was my first phone with T-Mobile and since then I have bought a new Motorola V330 which is much better. Plus-I don't recomend that you buy any Samsung phone from T-Mobile because all they do if you have problems with the phone is the ship you a refurbished phone-not a new one. T-Mobile on top of that has the worst costumer service. I either recomend Verizon or Cingular!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"T-Mobile Sucks!","review":"Bought a plan through Amazon, never could get it to work.

I went Washington DC, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Los Angeles, Vancouver, Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, and Zhangjiakou (a suburb) with this phone and it was excellent everywhere, except in Tokyo where it couldn't pick up the signal at Narita Airport. This phone will automatically switch to the closest service provider to you, such as how the x475 switched to China Mobile or China Unicom.2) Excellent batter life. I can go for 3 weeks without charging the phone.3) Nice look. Streamlined without antenna.4) Quick loading phone book.Cons:1) Strong weather can break the signal. Last night during hurricane Katrina, i was trying to call Florida Power and Light, and when i got through i could barely hear them.Overall: If you are going around the world, you will have good reception except maybe at Tokyo Narita. Battery will last you, and no problems. Very reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm just looking to call people","review":"This is the perfect phone for me. I'm not really into text messaging or taking pictures; I just wanted a basic clamshell phone, with an internal antenna (a great, newish feature that makes the phone sleeker and less prone to damage), and good reception. I love this phone - reception is surprisingly good for T-Mobile in my area, and the phone is small and sleek. If you're looking for lots of additional features like a camera, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I expected","review":"I previously had a Motorola v300 for 2 years and unfortunately, the speaker went on it. So, I ordered this phone through T-Mobile. I only paid $50 for it which wasn't too bad.The only pro for this phone is the sleek design. It's very lightweight and so small.Otherwise, the phone is very primitive compared to my old phone. The menus are difficult to navigate through and the sound quality is terrible. It sounds like everyone is talking to you through a tin can. People have also told me that I sound like I'm very far away while talking to them. Isn't a phone's primary purpose just that? To be a phone? I was very disappointed and returned the phone a few days after I got it. I'm sorry to say that I can't recommend this phone to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"In-Depth Information","review":"This book is great for understanding how to shape a brow that best suits your face. I believe it is intended for use as a text book in cosmetology and esthetics courses, but it provides great in-depth information for styling your brows. If you're seriously interested in learning what styles and shapes suit your face type this is the book for you. I was thourougly satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This book was a huge disappointment. It was very basic and very vague. For example, it would tell you to shape the brow to make their face look longer or shorter, but it wouldn't tell you how to shape the brow in order to do that. All the pictures were small, in black and white, and it was hard to see any detail. I kept on reading on, hoping that I was going to get to the good stuff, but the good stuff never came. I truly felt like I learned nothing and it was supposed to be an instructional book. A waste of money. I was debating returning it, but it doesn't seem worth it to go to the post office and have to pay for shipping it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great daily skills practice","review":"With educational and testing standards getting more and more difficult, it is nice having a tool to provide students with practice with language arts skills. These Daily Language Practice sheets give 1st graders a daily dose of basic editing (adding capitals, basic spelling errors, punctuation). They also include a variety of other activities including sorting words, yes/no questions, rhyming words, and other fundamentals. The Friday sheet always has a different and more lighthearted activity. There is also a Daily Math Practice book and I xerox them back to back and use them as bellwork. Both are half-sheets which are completed in about 10 minutes. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better workbooks...","review":"This workbook alternates from being overly repetitive to suddenly introducing new and advanced language concepts without using a gradual introduction.

Now all you can get is the first in the series (West of Eden). This story is along the lines of Tarzan with some Battlefield Earth in there, if I had to compare it to anything. I read this series when I was sixteen in hawaii. I couldn't put it down and don't remember anything else about the trip. But I'll never forget these three books. The characters and story were simply gripping. I would encourage anyone interested in an epic alternate world journey to grab a copy of West of Eden then hope you can hunt down the rest of the books.

Well if your the author of this book, You can belive that a US army weather plane just happens to be flying over Hiroshima when a Major earthquake strikes the city (One of only about 5 major Jappenese cities that had not already been bombed to oblivion). So the Army Burns, and spreads radation over the City and then sets off a huge flash bulb to convince the people of Japan the bomb works. (Hollywood does the rest) Then thee days later another earthquake Just happens to hit one of the few Japanese cities, Nagasaki, not yet destoyed, and we do the same thing all over again convincing the Japanese to surrender. Now I enjoy a good conspiracy theory as much or more than most, however, this book would be laughable if it were not such an insult to those who were in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki when they were bombed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Borges as Borges the 'maker'","review":"This is supposedly the book that Borges thought his most intimate and personal. Each small story, sketch, parable, poem provides insight into the imagination of one of the great literary creators of all time. His ability to condense into a few lines or paragraphs - worlds of theme and question are unmatched except by his holy predecessor Kafka.'El Hacedor' 'The Maker' the title - story is of course who Homer and Shakespeare and Borges are and are not. In Borges perhaps most famous essay- story- reflection- poem 'Borges and I' he considers the relationship between the person he is , and the name he has become- and he playfully puts down the legend while understanding it is already confounded with the real passing Borges.To read this work and his work is to come alive to new possibilies in Literature in Imagination and in Life.A true creation is a great gift of life.Borges gives us Borges and much much more besides."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRIMERICKS ,A PLEASURE FOR THE EYES","review":"GRIMERICKS IS A BOOK THAT WOULD GET CHILDREN INTERESTED IN READING.ADULTS WILL JUST LOVE THE DRAWING OF GRIS GRIMLEY!CHILDREN WILL ALSO LOVE THE DRAWINGS.SUSAN PEARSON HAS A WONDERFUL WAY OF WRITING FOR CHILDREN & ADULTS.I JUST LOVE THE BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic!","review":"Item as billed, dates from the 1980s, so is something that it is preserved to this extent.

As a result I've always had a fondness for the Mills Brothers and this album allows me to remember those days with nostalgia."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for students of Borges","review":"It would be foolish not to consider all readers of Borges to be students of Borges. Thus, those fortunate enough to find this book can't help but to glean yet more from the labyrinthine mind of one of the century's great thinkers. These five lectures find Borges in his usual vein: the self-effacing, charming, owlish raconteur. His lectures never betray the rigid pedantry of academia, but rather a great, informal tour through literature, philosophy, religion, semiotics, poetics, intertextuality. A former student of Dr. Mihailescu, I was given an advance copy of the book in the summer. Unsurprisingly, I found his elegant, trenchant edit does great service to a fine work. A must."},{"rating":"2","title":"You ARE Borges.","review":"Words by Borges are your words.

No contest."},{"rating":"1","title":"A promising beginning, but ultimately a painful read","review":"I'm frankly a little surprised to see so many positive reviews of this book. I was intrigued by the story at the beginning, but as it unfolded, the characters seemed more and more wooden and the dialogue became laughable. If I had to hear Mrs. Weber call her daughters \\"my little fleas\\" one more time, I vowed to stop reading. I finally ended up skimming the last 50 pages to end my misery, as I really didn't care what happened to the shallow characters. I think Stephanie Cowell has the potential to be a good descriptive writer, but somehow this story fell painfully flat. Kudos to her for the underlying idea, which was a creative approach to telling the tale of Mozart. I would not, however, recommend this book to those who desire a more lyrical--and believable--read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and Accurate Enough for Me","review":"I enjoyed this book because I knew nothing about Mozart aside from the movie, Amadeus, which was entertaining, but apparently historically inaccurate. \\"Marrying Mozart\\" brought to life a era and person of which I had no previous frame of reference.It is true that this story was more about the Weber sisters and mother. But, the story and dialog showed real life insight into mother/daughter realationships and how a family can fall apart when the \\"glue\\" is gone or as children grow into their own. The story also describes the times, struggles, and inglorious life of even genius level musicians.While there was some sexual content (just for you parents to know before making your 10 year old do a book report), it dispersed the Amadeus movie myth that Mozart was sex obsessed (at least no more than any 20 year old man).

We've had 2 of the large capacity drives (ones that have 2 drives stripped together in a long case) go south on us in 2 years. Then we've had two also with connectors (power and firewire) get so loose they needed to be replaced.In all cases the 1 year warranty was out and therefore repair would have cost about as much as a new drive today. So out of 20 La Cie's we've had a 20% problem after 2 years. Beware of repeatedly pulling and inserting plugs in the back of these...after a while they will eventually work loose.

They brilliantly composed these pieces of music with an exceptionly smooth flow. On a down side I, personaly, would have liked softer softs and louder louds. I feel that those sounds capture the listener more effectivly.I also feel that Alexander Rahbari, the Conductor did an exellent jod of controlling his orchestra. Sohre Rahbari was also brilliant in his performance. Again i would have liked softer softs and louder louds.

All in all, I give this sound track a 4 out of 5 for an almost perfect musical score."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good composers Horrible Saxophonist","review":"I think the musicianship is extrmeley poor overall.

The repeater sends the satellite signal throughout the house. This has worked very well. The repeater's receiver, which is attached with a short cable to my XM satellite radio now picks up the signal anywhere in the house. I no longer need to attach a satellite antenna located in a south window directly to the radio. It would be helpful if there were also a receiver in the form of a headphone to make the radio even more portable in the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not be hapier!","review":"This repeater truly makes your satelite system portable in your home or office.

Attach the repeaters antenna to your unit and you are free to move your system around without being close to a window. Wonderful product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Indoor XM Solution.","review":"My house has an aluminum roof which effectively blocks the XM satellite signal.

I couldn't get reception anywhere on our main level so I put this upstairs back in the corner of a bedroom and wahlah!! I have perfect reception anywhere in my house.

It's a winner and well worth the price!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"This product does what it says - we were able to put our XM tuner in a more convenient location and keep the antennae near a south facing window.

I'd get this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delphi Signal Repeater","review":"This product works like a charm.

I didn't have enough cord to reach a south facing window (approximately 30 feet away), nor did I want wires strung through my house. I installed the Delphi XM Signal Repeater inside an enclosed wooden cabinet near a south facing window (with the antenna in the window and the wire leading through the back of the cabinet). The repeater seems unfazed by the cabinet doors and the radio gets perfect reception. The hardware interfaced with the Polk components without any problem.

Really, there was almost no set up it's so simple. Negatives include the high cost. Further, the signal I got was no better than with the XM antenna included with my unit no matter where the Delphi antenna was placed. Worst of all, it only worked for me if I didn't move. Sounds bizarre I'm sure, but this got a decent signal if I sat in my family room and never moved. Soon as I stood up and started walking around, even into a room 20' away, the signal dropped out and became intermittent. Maybe metal in my body from past surgeries was affecting signal (?)

I have used it to play Time Crisis, Point Blank 1, Point Blank 2 and Gun Fighter: The Legend of Jesse James. Before you use the gun controller you will have to calibrate it each time you install it into your Playstation. That's probably my one and only complaint about it. And it's just a minor one. But after that it's like you're at the arcade. The games I have mentioned are great. If you are into Westerns, then you should get Gun Fighter. If you love playing at the arcade, then you should choose Point Blank. Time Crisis is also an excellent game to play using this gun controller. You often find this arcade game at theaters and one can understand why. If you like action movies, then this particular game will work for you. I have tried many types of console gun controllers and this one is probably the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I recieved my video within 5 days of when I ordered it which was earlier then I thought!

However I have to give it one star because I am so disgusted with the moral, which seems to be: It's better to be in a relationship with someone who has no respect for you, no intention of being faithful, and will dump you the second someone prettier comes along than it is to be by yourself.That's sick and it infuriates me, so I cannot have fond memories of this movie. Save your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there such a thing as \\"negative stars\\" for a review?","review":"Talk about your bad mistakes. I meant to rent \\"Ray\\", and somehow this steaming pile of dung ended up in my hands. No lie, this whole movie's budget should have been used to buy food for homeless bums, at least then some good would have resulted from this putrid piece of garbage. I don't say this cause I hate gays, I say it cause I hate dialogue that sounds like it was written by a half-drunk eight-year-old. The acting by the guy named Vlad was stiffer than a wooden plank, and there are so many retarded story lines going on at the same time that you find yourself not giving a rip about if any of these people ended up jumping off a five story building. Do yourself a favor and spend two hours beating your head against a metal pole, cause you will be smarter than watching this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camp as you can get!","review":"I can sum this film up in three words: camp, corny and cheesy as hell. I was laughing all the way through, and the corniness is obviously added on purpose (at least, I hope so), but despite this, I have to see this film again. It's one of those 'must-see-twice' films that the girlies will watch at sleepovers and the thespians will probably hate it and love it at the same time. Anyway, I definately recommend it to anyone who hasn't yet seen it, and hope they will enjoy it as much as I did. You also gotta buy the soundtrack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The film every teen stage actor wanted to make","review":"Everyone else has spelled out the plot, so I'll stick with my review. You can find these characters in any theater- community or otherwise. Being a teen actor myself, I connected with the story and the characters. So, why only 4 stars? Uhh..well, it's not a perfect movie. While the leads are excellent- Fritzi's surprise solo is amazing= some of the secondary characters are weak and it plays more as a documentary than a serious musical like Moulin Rouge or Chicago. Still, every theater has a Michael or even a Vlad. A must for all musical theater fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could rate - 100 stars","review":"There are no words to describe how awful this movie was. Yes, the songs and the voices of the actors were fantastic, however the acting was atrocious. I think half of the problem was the writing. The script had no realistic feel to it at all. I found myself laughing histerically at the things the actors said, but it wasn't meant to be funny; I found the things they said unrealistic and funny to the point where I would rewind and watch them say it again. Also, part of the reason there were no good actors in this film, is because I think it is such a rarity to find a young person with amazing vocal talents, as well as a good actor. Overall, I think this movie, was awful, and had NO powerful feel to it whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG - Its Stephen Sondheim","review":"Good film, definately what performance camps are like - thousands of gay boys and the girls who love them. And then, OMG - Its Stephen Sondheim! If you're into musical theatre AT ALL, check out this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"An indie teen movie, for what it's worth","review":"This film has the feel that it was produced at a summer camp for the performing arts. The music and the dancing are good, but the acting seems more \\"indie\\" than polished.The dialogue is so painfully cliched at points that I found myself groaning aloud. How they got Sondheim to put in a cameo, your guess is as good as mine.The characters wear their hearts on their sleeves with the verve and angst of any \\"gifted\\" adolescent to the point if you critize the movie, you are as evil and repressive as the evil and repressive parents.It could have been better with decent music and a \\"tour\\" of some of the better musicals of recent years, but instead it is self-indulgent and awkward -- huh, just like artistic teens...I'm sure someone out there loves this movie. Watch Hedwig instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent first - buy later - if you like it. I wish I had.","review":"I read the reviews from the critics, and more importantly the ones from buyers at Amazon.com and I must say that I am really upset that I not only spent my money on this dreary, dry, sluggish and not very well acted. I guess somewhere along the line it was a good concept or idea, but what it turned out to be, in my opinion, was a bore-fest in \\"campy\\" humor. I will say that the lead actor, the person who plays Vlad, had the most potential. I suggest you rent this movie first before plunking down $22 on it. I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, \\"stupid\\" is accurate...","review":"I watched this movie with a few friends. One said \\"stupid, but fun.\\" The other said, \\"well, stupid...\\" Seriously, I don't think I've seen a worse movie in several years. The writing is awful, and the acting is offensive. The creators of this film had an interesting opportunity to make fun of \\"campy\\" movies and completely blew it. Do I know how this film could have been made better? No, but I'm not a filmmaker.

Had I believed most of the comments about this movie and purchased it I would have been very dissapointed! The purpose of this movie is to make the viewer laugh at the stupid situations that the director puts the cast in.

The young cast however, is exceptional with the exception of all the adult roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"silly and predictible","review":"Silly, predictable, and over-the-top, this film tries too hard in all the wrong places.

It might pass for a made-for-TV film, but nothing more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the running for the worst movie ever","review":"Stupid is the only word for it. If only they had had a writer, a director and some kids who could act. But they had none of these. Some of the kids, only some, could sing and/or dance, but none could evoke any believability. Of course they were yoked with a hacknyed, cliched, unfunny script.And please, give me a break! Having been involved in theatre for nearly 50 years I can attest that there are INDEED many gay guys, however, there are always more, by far, ego driven, \\"I am god's gift to womankind\\" straight morons.BTW, did the casing director go out of their way to cast only unattractive guys in the gay roles?"},{"rating":"1","title":"mMm... sucky","review":"Great singing...

Don't waste your time. I'm sorry I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shivers of joy","review":"Delicious. A sly, elegant retro CD served up with impeccable jazz chops.The vocalist hints throughout at Billie Holliday ... the swinging piano/scat on Let Yourself Go is a dead ringer for Erroll Garner ... the sax on 'S Wonderful is a jaw-dropping reprise of Stan Getz's best bossa moments (as in the famous Getz / Gilberto album).Lovers of updated jazz standards, and unabashed romantics, will surely swoon over this recording.On the other hand, hard-core critics who need \\"something new\\" are advised to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Homage to Blossom","review":"Stacey Kent has a tiny, girlish voice, similar in some ways to the wonderful Blossom Dearie, but without, as far as I can tell, an iota of Dearie's transcendent wit and humor. Kent's album covers, with their glamour girl sheen, reinforce the idea that she takes herself very seriously. This album makes pleasant background music, but it's not a sit down and listen kind of album. The songs don't feel lived in, and she doesn't feel as if she has enough life experience to invest them with the requisite meaning. Still, pleasant sounds are better than unpleasant ones, and for that reason I give it two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"British Trad with a (very) Nasal Accent.","review":"What's all the fuss about?

I heard it on the radio and knew I was going to fall in love. Now that I've listened through (and through), it is everything I expected it be.

The piece of fabric that attaches to the \\"seat\\" portion is so flimsy that not even a very small toy can sit there. The metal portion of the \\"seat\\" always comes undone, we were able to re-attach it the first 806 times, but somehow now neither myself nor my husband can get it re-attached in a way where the seat will stay propped open.

I was in the process of giving up most of my reading because I did not think it was pleasing to the Lord for my mind to be so entrenched in the smut that many of the suspense thrillers contain. Not that I did not enjoy reading them but it was not good for my mind and heart. I am not a prude...actually far from it but these books help me to have a cleaner mind and purer heart and reminds me of God's love and mercy.I appreciate that these books can convey a pure relationship that grows into love and devotion without the sex and lust coming first.Kudos to you Dee Henderson and God Bless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also annoyed","review":"I 100% agreement with ANNOYED's review. I am also beginning to wonder if Kindle is simply an outlet for Christian-themed books as so many of The books available on Kindle seem to be flogging The Christian agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"After reading the synopsis on Amazon and seeing how highly ranked this book was, I took a chance and bought it. The first chapter or two were intriguing, however, after not too long, I started getting frustrated with all the religious references. I am not interested in being preached to during my personal reading time and felt increasingly annoyed at the ongoing religious themes. This type of thing should be made clear in the first line of any synopsis, to avoid aggravation overall disappointment for readers looking for a new read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This book was terrible! Characters I don't care about, unrealistic and horribly written plot, and the non stop preaching was unappreciated. This book is really Christian propaganda masqueraded as a thriller romance. If I wanted to read Bible passages I would have read...well the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry- but I was disappointed","review":"I just felt like the characters, especially the leading lady, were so canned. It felt like the author was trying to impress us with the \\"perfect lady\\". Well, I would have liked more realistic characters. I'd also have liked the author to write more about how the characters practiced succesfully and unsuccesfully, their faith in every situation. Sorry- this book didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"This book was just awful! The only positive thing I can write about this book is that it was free for Kindle. First, it really should have been made more clear that this would be a VERY Christian-themed book. Not cool Amazon.As for the book itself - I can honestly say that it is one of the worst I have ever read. It is completely superficial and unrealistic. I actually hoped for main characters to be killed, just for something actually interesting to happen.And Adam - stalking is neither romantic nor heroic. You fail at life. I really wanted you to be shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!","review":"This has been one of the more refreshing books I've read in awhile. I love a good suspense/mystery novel and this book overdelieved on my epxectations. It is well written with an engaging plot. It kept you guessing the entire book, but had a good and accurate ending. I am now reading my way through Henderson's O'Malley series, and each book is a fantastic read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting book","review":"I loved this book. This girl Sara is haunted by the memory of when she was kidnapped 25 years ago. She is so afraid that she distances herself from everyone but her brother and best friend. When a new guy comes into the picture she is reluctant to let him in but he is determined to win her affection. Throughout the story, you learn details of those nine days she was captured with her twin sister. As the story goes on, she learns to let love in, and she hopes to catch her kidnapper so she can live in peace with the man she loves. This book was very touching and I felt an emotional connection with Sara. The only thing I did not like about this book was that it was a bit preachy. Other than that, I really liked this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danger in the Shadows","review":"This book was OUTSTANDING! Kept me from doing what I should have been by keeping me glued to the book! I am looking forward to the rest of the series!

I'm now onto reading the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Dee's Best but a Worthwhile read","review":"Honestly, Dee Henderson's other books are worlds better, but this one won't insult your intelligence with bad writing or nothin'... Her style's still nice, the plot's decent, it just doesn't compare to the actual O'Malley Series or even Uncommon Heroes for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one had me up half the night!!","review":"Seriously, I kid you not. This book had me reading up into the wee hours of the morning because I just couldn't put it down until I found out what happened. I read The Negotiator first and had read hints in that book about what had happened to Sara, but it wasn't until I picked up this one that I realized what I was missing. Sara's struggle to free herself from the terror and to completely trust in God really touched me. I loved the relationship between Dave and Sara and how their brothely-sisterly love stayed strong and pulled them closer rather than apart during everything Sara was going through. This book is awesome!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Unrealistic","review":"I find it incredibly hard to believe that the FBI could be misled for 25 years, and have no clue as to who the stalker is. The stalker was given was too much credit for intelligence, or the FBI is filled with idiots. Either way, it still bugged me. I gave it two stars instead of one because I liked the emotional byplay between the hero and heroine. I would think twice about reading another book by this author, but she is definitely capable of more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tricky, Amazon.","review":"I am getting getting quite frustrated with the lack of proper descriptions on Amazon lately. Religiously themed books should have their OWN category. I read book descriptions thoroughly to avoid religious themes in the books I buy, but yet again I find a Christian book under the thriller category. There are many people who enjoy those types of stories, but since there's not a return option available on the Kindle, I'm annoyed with the lack of a substantially important description of a book as \\"Christian fiction\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um... it got kind of redundant and slow","review":"It was really good at first and I was enjoying it at first. Dee Henderson didn't waist any time in getting the story going but there is just so much in between when the story starts and when the climax starts. I wasn't able to finish the book because I got kind of sick of it. After a while, it's just like, alright, we get. She's falling in love with Adam and he's falling in love with her and praying for her. Thats basically all that happens for the majority of the book. There are so many pointless things going on before even ONE suspence stuff starts. There is a little bit of suspence in it, but you really have to read to get there. I think I might just skip to the end of the book to find out what happens.So if your looking for a good love story, then this is what you should read, but not if your looking for a thriller that hooks you and makes you want to sleep with the light on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danger in the Shadows","review":"It was pretty good. Thought it'd be a little more suspenseful. The build up to a scene was better than the scene itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Preachy","review":"This book lacked any type of suspense or thrill. The characters desperately needed more personality and less spirituality. I was so sick of the constant praying and Bible versus I almost put the book down less than half way through. Unfortunately, though I thought there might be some action/suspense to it, I was sadly mistaken. Not even worth the time it takes to click the 1-click payment button."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I read some of the other reviews and thought that most people enjoyed the book...but some not. I'm 14 and I thought that this book was amazing! Some people may say otherwise...the only problem I had with this book was that its so..um..full of talk of God and it bothered me. otherwise it was a great book. Hope for more!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Christian Fiction - Not a Mystery!","review":"I'm a Christian and enjoy well written, interesting Christian fiction. I also enjoy good, fast-paced mysteries/thrillers. That's what I expected here and certainly didn't get it. I finished more than a third of the book - then had to put it aside and go to something else. Although well written, there is a great deal of repetition and going over the same background again and again. I kept waiting for something interesting (such as the kidnapper resurfacing) to happen - and it never did. Maybe it all happens later but this book is much too slow and insipid in my opinion. I feel like the time I spent in trying to read this was wasted when I could have been enjoying something more interesting and worthwhile. Very disappointed after scanning the other reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"great series","review":"Although this was not my favorite out of the O'Malley series, it was a great book. It had suspense, but was not as intense as some of her others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get a grip","review":"It goes both ways. Those of us who enjoy inspirational books find cussing or sex scenes offensive. Yet those books don't have their own category. Do what I do. At the first sign you find it offensive stop reading it and delete it. No big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"Well Christian fiction is getting better as time goes by, I bought the book with the new cover. This book is great but its not the best that I've read, the suspense is pretty tame and nothing compared to Frank Peretti or Ted Dekker books. However that's not to say that it wasn't good, because it was a really great book.I liked that it had a contemporary feel to it, with strong and developed characters. It avoided the Christian sementalities and cliches, so it was refreshing to read. Not the best but its pretty good. It has a positive message, while being warm, and chaste.Many female writers in Christian fiction tend to write with such sentimentality and predictability so much so that it makes me want to gag. Besides a lot of books tend to be about the \\"schoolmarm heads out west type,\\" which I don't like. Thank goodness for Dee Henderson and for her portrayal of a strong but loving female character in this book. I read this prequel because I want to start reading the O'Malley series."},{"rating":"2","title":"O'Malley Series","review":"This is my fourth O'Malley series novel. Dee Henderson's characters are believable everyday people to whom we can relate. I enjoyed this book as much as the first three. I look forward to reading more from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shaddows are weak","review":"Hey the book was free, so I shouldn't complain. The writing quality was marginal. All the spiritual references were a bit over the top for me and I found it somewhat predictable. Good reading for Jr. High and HS age girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"danger in the shadows","review":"Great read, I really enjoyed the details with all the action and suspense. I also really liked the drops of christianity, I have already looked for more books by this author. Take the time out to read this book you will be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"DANGER IN THE SHADOW'S Dee Henderson","review":"Just read Dee Henderson's DANGER IN THE SHADOW'S and as usual it was a book that kept you anxiously reading and guessing as to the outcome. I have been reading her books for a couple of years now and I've never been disappointed.This is a story of a young woman, Sara, who was traumatized as a child that lives with the threat of her stalker 25 years later. One stormy day she accidently meets a famous retired football star, Adam, who is quite smitten with her. The subsequent story will keep you reading until the end.Will they catch the stalker? Who is it? Will Sara and Adam be able to have a relationship? These are just a few of the questions you will be asking. I loved the book and it is a prequel to a series that is well worth reading also.I received this ebook from Tyndale's Summer Reading Program free, I've giving my fair and honest review."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Author!!!","review":"Dee Henderson is my favorite Christian suspense author. Absolutely LOVE that Amazon made one of the O'Malley books available on the free list. Thank you so much for offering the good books on the free list!Dee Henderson has a way of grabbing you within the first couple of pages and keeps you turning the pages until you are finished. Highly recommend any of her books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Prequel to the O'Malley Series","review":"I got this book for free, which is great, but realized I had already read it several years ago!In fact, I read this book after I read the entire O'Malley Series by Dee Henderson. I think it was unavailable before the rest of the series.I'd recommend this book (yes, it is Christian fiction) and the following O'Malley series. Each of the following books goes into the lives of the adopted siblings and are definitely worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's no such thing as a free book.","review":"This is the most appalling piece of christian propaganda masquerading as a thriller. I have never read such unmitigated dross. After persevering through the first few pages I did a quick count and found that there were no less than 102 mentions of god and his plan etc., etc., not to mention the scripture references etc., The book cost me nothing but time, but I feel totally ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did this win an award??","review":"If you're a Christian you'll love this book. There's endless bible passages and prayers. But where's the romance there's no development of their relationship. I guess they're both just really happy to have someone to pray for and talk about God with. The suspense is lost shortly after you begin the book. She was kidnapped and abused when she was a child and one of the kidnappers is still after her after 25yrs! (unrealistic? I think so), that apparently is the plot, that's it. There is only so much I can read about this past abuse and after a while it doesn't endear you to the character anymore. The author is just trying to continue to shock you which I find predictable and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspense.....WHERE?","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. From the back cover it sounded fantastic! The suspense did not begin until page 228!!! And even then - it wasn't very suspenseful. When you finally find out who the stalker is, it seems very anti-climactic. It basically just states this is who it is and then continues. We don't know anything about the stalker or why he did what he did...it seemed very unimportant. Also, as far as the romance goes - I don't need hot steamy[]scenes at all, but there at least has to be chemistry - a spark. There doesn't need to be sex to get that point across. However this book made the couple almost seem more like brother & sister. There wasn't much of an attraction at all. I wound up skimming past paragraphs of this book just to be done with it. Very boring, slow and uninteresting. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Even Finish This One","review":"I tried. I really tried. But the lack of suspense, and the lack of character and plot development made this read less interesting than watching paint dry. I didn't pay for the Kindle version but I wasted my time hoping that, by halfway into the book, something would happen...a little heart-pumping suspense, a little heart-throbbing romance? But, alas, nothing more than prayers and bible verses and a little platonic cuddling. Yikes!I agree with the reviewers who wish to be alerted when a book falls into the category of Christian fiction. This is my first foray into that genre--and my last (if I can help it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!","review":"The characters are boring and slightly annoying. The kidnapper/stalker doesn't even make sense. You find out near the end that the kidnapper chose this girl solely based on opportunity and wealth, yet you are supposed to believe that he spends the next two decades plotting, stalking, and spending every waking moment obsessing about this girl and wasting the ransom money to do it. HELLO!!!! It's just not believable. Plus, the book is just boring. Nothing happens. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danger in the Shadown","review":"Danger in the ShadowsThis book starts out with so much promise. Sara and her twin sister Kim were kidnapped when they were six years old. Kim died and Sara survived. One of the kidnappers is still at large and is still twenty-five years later after Sara. She meets Adam and they fall in love despite all the trials and tribulations. This book held me spellbound for quite a few chapters. Then I got tired of all the God references page after page. Then the suspence fizzled out but the references didn't. If you like me read a book for escapism and enjoyment do not buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating handbook of our world and beyond!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this wonderful, unique book by Sylvia Browne. It is more of a handbook to life and the unknown. Not only will you find pages upon pages of wisdom, you will also find meditations, and exercises you can do to enhance your own life!This book is clear, and easy to understand. I couldn't put it down. Sylvia offers her view of life, through the eyes of a very gifted psychic... and of course that famous humor that only Sylvia can bring. If your life needs answers or if you are unhappy, I urge you to get this book. It can really make a difference in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eyeopener!","review":"I loved this book! It really opened my eyes to life, death, and everywhere in between. Questions regarding life, death, ghosts, afterlife, reincarnations, and more are finally put to rest. This book brings forth an unseen world that is discernible through the eyes of Sylvia Browne. Supplemented by her own true life events and miracles within her life there is a truth that can't be denied.This book has touched my heart and soul with every emotion. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone no matter what your beleifs are. Spiritually refreshing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Preparing for the inevitable journey","review":"This is a marvelous book for anyone looking for answers to the afterlife. If you are a non-believer, all the more reason to read this book. Not only was it thouroughly enjoyable, it was very believable and informative. I was especially pleased that she mentioned our pets, and how they are there to great us when we cross over. This book gives me goose bumps when I think about it, good goose bumps. I have shared it with several of my friends, and they all loved it. The King of non-believers is even starting to cave in. Humor interspersed with no nonsense facts, made this a book you didn't want to end, or put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I love Sylvia's books. She gives us so much information. I am much more at peace with myself thanks to Sylvia. I am now comfortable in my own skin. I hope to eventually read every book she has written. Thank you Sylvia.Dawn B."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is so incredibly silly!","review":"Sylvia's ideas are so out there, they are utterly ridculous! No wonder she appears on daytime talk shows; that is where she belongs! I have done so much research into this area, and her theories are just plain stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dangerous Person...","review":"I have read four of Sylvia Browne's many books (it seems she pumps them out faster than Arnold Schwarzenegger pumps iron...) and I have to say that her writings are very dangerous. I mean, if you are looking for nothing more than a fairy tale, than have at it, but if you are seeking the TRUTH, know this before you buy any of her books, she discounts about 80% of the King James Version of the Bible. According to Ms. Browne, there is no such thing as Satan, Heaven exists, but Hell does not. If you are a fundamentalist, a conservative Christian, believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God which should be taken literally, and you are seeking guidance, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE! Better, read Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins new book on End Times Prophecy, it was FABULOUS. Even better yet? Read your Bible! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"NEW MATERIAL PLEASE","review":"As I was reading this book I noticed that I had read parts of it before.....Was I Psychic???

However the rest of the book was the pits......"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK/GUIDE TO \\"LET GO, LET GOD\\"","review":"I found this book to be refreshing. Syliva helps you learn to love your spirituality. She gives advice on how to be more in touch with God and your angels and spirit guides. She gives a beautiful prayer at the end and many little daily prayers to say throughout the day. This book answers many questions we all sometimes wonder about. Questions Syliva knows through her God given gift. I belive she is telling the truth and simply wants to help all of humankind live their lives according to God's plan and also most important she wants us to know that God loves us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for believers","review":"Sylvia does give great advice, no doubt. And she does seem to know what she's talking about. But to me, she looses a little credibility when I hear she charges [$$$] per question to ask her Spirit Guide Francine something. I know she has to make a living too, but if she's really here to help people she wouldn't charge exorbitant fees for a reading.However, I am happy she exposes the tricks of true frauds and their techniques. She is so correct on the silliness of voodoo and curses, and how they do not exist.I hope with all my heart she's the real deal. I would love for everything she says to be true, but in the back of my mind I'll never really know for sure. When I see her on TV talking to someone about there dead loved one, she'll describe them as \\"beautiful eyes, sharp features, oval shaped face, and a sweet smile\\". That could be ANYONE. EVERYONE thinks their loved one is a beautiful person.In any case, it's a good book. I recommend it, see what you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritually Uplifting","review":"I bought this book shortly before my mom passed away, it was so comforting too find out that we have a wonderful place too go home too, and that we can still visit our loved ones anytime we need to.

What a divine, holy, and perfect system! Apparently the human race needs an ongoing bloodbath of violent revenge to ascend (three feet above the ground, to be exact) to higher levels of vibration. I guess Jack the Ripper, Ted Bundy, and Jeffrey Dahmer achieved something good after all--their victims deserved it as punishment from misdeeds in previous incarnations. Even the industrialized slaughter during the Nazi Holocaust was necessary, spiritually speaking. Cosmic Law, don't you know.According to Browne, Bill Bradley would win the White House in 2000. She also scowlingly predicted a Gore victory on the Montel Williams show a few days before the election. False prophecies speak for themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superstitious horse manure","review":"More superstitious horse manure from a con artist who plays on people's fears to make a pile of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ego trip to fantasyland","review":"I like to think that I am a very open minded person. But this first exposure to Sylvia Brown required a leap of faith that even Superman might think twice about. Sylvia Brown is either the greatest Psychic and astral traveler that has ever walked the face of this physical plane....or is a borderline psychotic, who will go to any lengths to satisfy her ego. How anyone in their right mind can believe Ms. Brown's detailed discriptions of \\"the other side\\" is in itself a statement of one's desparate reaching out for help. Sylvia Brown received a complaint from \\"the other side\\" that her young son was spending too much time out of his body playing in the Hall of Wisdom! Then there's the story of Ms. Brown's grand-daughter, who follows them around the house (out of her body) after she has been put to bed.

I had seen Sylvia on Montel many times back in the day and thought to myself \\"what a crock\\". Unfortunately, this held true for this book as well. For a while she had me going, thinking that she truly believed what she was saying, until I got to the end where she makes her predictions for the new millennium. None of which have come true by 2013, and just reaffirmed my belief that NOTHING happens when you die. Your body decays and you, your spirit or whatever dies with it. There is nothing after you die, there is no conscious anything, and it's OVER.

My only issue is with the band. I have a very small wrist, so I expected to have links taken out. Once I had that done, the watch was too small. I had a link added back and now it's too big. I need to wear it further up my arm. Also, the trifold metal clasp is not curved enough to easily wrap around the wrist. The watch doesn't go in a smooth circle once fastened.

The recipe directions are concise and clearly written. I like the fact that the recipes are not overly complicated and the number of ingredients called for in most of the recipes is fairly small.

One thing they do not tell you is how spicy the resulting dish will be. \\"Red Chicken Curry with Bamboo Shoots\\" and \\"Pumpking Custard\\" are my favorites.

Unger is an unusual character to be found in his chosen profession. He is highly educated, and hails from a well to do Jewish family in Berkeley. His is the antithesis of the resume' expected from a big city fireman. The reader takes from this reading experience an extensive knowledge of the tasks, challenges and terminology of the firefighters' world.

After I wasted my precious time reading these whole pasted pages of scrabble called a book, I literally set it a blaze. I walked down by the river with my gasoline canister and dropped a match on it.

Will probably save my battery ;)I didn't realize that my fusebox had spare slots where I could simply plug the male spade into it. I thought I had to get an 'add a fuse' or 'add a circuit' but I didn't have room for one and I didn't need one anyways. I searched online many times trying to find someone who installed this on the same car, eventually I found something similar enough to learn what I needed..

I ended up using an Add-a-Circuit cable (10amp) from the local car parts store ($3). Basically all you need to do is cut the end of the escort cable and crimp it to the add-a-circuit and put in a couple 5amp fuses. Then plug it into one of the 5amp fuses slots in the cars' fuse box that only turns on when the car gets turned on, like the radio fuse or cigarette lighter fuse. Also, make sure you ground the other end of the cable somewhere in the fuse box before you plug the add-a-circuit into the fuse box.Overall this is a great cable, its a little thick, but it easily tucked into my headliner at the top of the windshield then I stuffed it down the weather stripping on the door jam all the way down to my fuse box.

By doing this you will have no problem with the leads coming loose from the mirror plug socket. I twisted and turned the mirror and the pins stayed connected and did not loosen up. I would recommend this product as it cleans up the dash area with no unsightly cable going to the auxiliary power outlet on the vehicle. I installed this for a Escort 8500 X50 in my 2012 Tahoe.Very please although I thought the price was a little high, but it works.The supplier sent me an email asking for type of vehicle etc. and a picture of the back of the mirror if possible, excellent customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value and style","review":"I was very impressed with the price of this watch.

I checked my mail today and they sent me a letter asking for $8.95 for the cost of repairs or else I won't get the watch back.

Service involves sending the watch away and it takes 4 weeks or longer for them to return it.

I've had my second watch for a month now and I've mastered the clasp. I love the style and the large face which is easy to read. The mesh band was easy to adjust to my wrist size.

From the pictures online, it looked elegant. But I was never completely sure I really wanted it. What a delightful surprise to open the gift and see that it was much more beautiful than it looks in the pictures. Incredibly well-designed, stunning packaging, adjusts easily and fits like a dream - I don't even know it's on. And absolutely beautiful. It is hard to tell from the pictures that the border of the face is mirrored rather than just a circular band of silver - that may sound too glitzy, but it is really quite elegant.

Very pretty. Very simple. Extremely comfortable.However, the mesh is a bit delicate for everyday wear. I don't know what happened exactly, but after a few weeks of wear the corner of the mesh strap caught on something and I got a really bad bend in the middle of the strap. Its impossible to shape it back together once this happens. And the threads of the mesh are super sharp when they come apart like this, so in addition to being obviously damaged, its unwearable.I have to send it back to Skagen now.

My brother purchased a watch from Skagen and I have always liked the way it looked. He didn't have any problems with his, but my experience wasn't so positive. The watch I purchased had a clasp that was unnecessarily difficult to buckle and so it was sent back and replaced. The replacement watch had a clasp that worked well, but the watch can't keep time. It falls behind 10-15 minutes per week. I would think that constructing a watch that stayed on time would be a primary objective for a watch manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"note: no second hand","review":"I obsessed over this watch for months before finally buying it, and I love it.

Also, the ring around the watch face is a darker grayish color and not silver/steel as I expected from the photo. The clasp is a bit difficult to open and close, but seems secure enough.

Not surprising that she turns out to be a good fantasy writer, as well. The book had a feeling vaguely reminiscent of the urban fantasy author, Charles de Lint, an excellent recommendation for fans of modern day fantasy. Similarly, her characters feel real, but not caught in the world of materialism, sensitive to the otherness that surrounds us all. The setting, Tucson and its surrounding environs, is evoked well, and the story keeps a good pace on a path that is comprehensible, if a little off kilter. Read and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, intriguing, incredible","review":"Terri Windling has created a fantastic story. The characters are sharp and believable, including the supernatural ones, and the world is vast and beautiful, but recognizable as our own. Windling displays a deep understanding of the beauty and magic of the desert, and somehow creates a shape around it, putting the magic of her world into terms we can understand and lose ourselves in.Maggie Black's exploration of the mysteries and magic of the desert pulls the reader in, and as we uncover the secrets of her new world we begin to look at our own surroundings differently. It is not a book that requires action or snappy dialogue to keep intrigue - instead, the detailed descriptions of the surroundings give us a crystal clear picture of the magical desert, and gives us clues into the rules - or lack thereof - of the supernatural world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wood Wife- Marvelous","review":"Having long been a fan of Brian Froud's faeries, I pictured his slightly quirky, sometimes frightening, sometimes sweet creatures when I read this enchanting tale.

The story holds you tight, sometimes with tingles up the spine...a murder mystery, love story, faerie tale, a stark and sureal look at desert life, and the life of the desert.

She presents a believable and subtly observed cast of characaters which could form the basis of an interesting novel if set in a mundane world. Instead, she places them in a heady mix of magic, mystery and suspense to produce a spectacular fantasy. Her unerring sense of place, which serves as a theme in the lives of the characters, adds to the beauty of the story. Too many fantasy books that I have picked up recently use the genre to hide mediocre character development. Instead, Terri Windling uses fantasy to transcend the limits of the ordinary novel.

I finished the book simply because I bought it, if you find yourself unable to conduct yourself personally or professionally consistently in arguments unable to interact with upset people or you yourself upset people and you don't know why than maybe buy this book, but don't count on it helping you.It's no wonder most law enforcement find themselves escalating situations because they were told to read this crap.

This book illustrates what is wrong with our governments training of law enforcement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeats itself too much","review":"This book spends more time telling what you're going to read than the actual material you're supposed to learn.

Its a powerful book, very entertaining, quite repetitive (which is a good thing), insightful and full of interesting anecdotes. By the end it gets a little annoying to go through so many cop stories, but the chapters are short and the tone and rhythm make for an easy reading. My three favorite takeaways: 1- Never speak the first words that come to your mouth, you will regret them 9 out of 10 times. 2- Empathy is the most powerful tool in communication. 3- Don't take things personal, people don't mean the thing they say when they're under the influence of anger. Learn to redirect the others person energy, be it positive or negative. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Information","review":"I work in customer service (used to work in Law Enforcement) and I always have had a difficult time dealing with difficult customers.

So many parents are focused on \\"helping\\" their kids go to the top of their class of peers from the moment they take their first breath ...

It was a light shelf and less then a 18 inches long so it was quite small. Initially I used lower grade double sided mounting tape and it worked great, in all temperatures. Then one day my cat started sitting on the shelf and after about a month of that he finally knocked the shelf off the wall. So I figured i would get some stronger tape.

It is the most impressive direct-to-video creature feature I have ever seen. Great care was taken by the cast and crew to ensure they were making a quality film. When I was a kid, even the parents liked it because the special effects were so impressive for a title such as this. The movie does still have its corny moments, but in the world of killer bug movies, this really is the best one that has ever been made.Olive Films is prepping both a blu-ray and dvd release for this film, so anyone interested in this title does not have to worry about plunking any money down for an overpriced VHS copy.

This version is simply terrible. If I wanted a console port, I would not buy a pc version. The lack of mouse support made the totally unintuitive menues even more difficult. Two out of the 3 games I played crashed and one was the only fun game, that was in extra innings. The player graphics look like arcade models and really do not look realistic. Some of the player animations are entertaining.For some reason, the game would not take the pitching imputs from my sidewinder, often requiring more than five attempts (yes my sidewinder was calibrated and works fine with other games). This interrupt the game play and is very frustrating. This has happened in past HH versions, but seems worse in this one.I felt angry and insulted that I was given a console game in the guise of a pc game.

I'm not sure what 3DO was thinking, or even if they were, but this game is simply unacceptable on many counts. The lack of mouse support, as everyone has noted, stinks. The game is no longer smooth (in fact, I think that they have become steadily worse since the last Sammy Sosa edition in 2001). The reduction in mode-of-play options was not met with favor; simply put, this is the worst baseball game I have played on a computer. I have long had distaste for EA Sports baseball games, but I can't help but think that even EA would not release such an unpolished and dated game. Once you get past the decent visual stadium graphics, there is no gameplay value. I am sadly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"One step forward, about 6 steps backwards","review":"I love the High Heat series. Every March I get the new version, excited to try the new features. To sum it up, Graphics are much better, sound is great, budget looks good. BUT many cons, playability is deplorable. This game doesnt recognize the mouse, there is no manage only mode, no one pitch mode, no online play, no hh2003 convertor, no stat spreadsheat. I played for three innings, and my team was 11 for 16. To arcade like even though I tuned it to be more geared for simulation. The menus are sloppy, and very difficult with no mouse support.Maybe MVP Baseball will be decent. This will be the last time I buy a HH game unless significant improvements are made. Every single aspect of the older versions that I loved is completely gone.All they had to do to keep me happy was use last years version, fix the bugs, the financial aspect would be great, maybe improve the graphics.

It is very easy to read and covers topics in a manner that the beginning student can grasp. It is also a thorough treatment of the topics involved for an LCA certification. It has questions at the end of each chapter and a CDrom (that unfortunately runs on Windows only) with sample exams to test your knowledge of the material. I give this book 5 stars because it is a great learning tool. However, if you wish to pursue a LCA certification, I recommend that you also review the SAIR books. The SAIR books prepare you much better for the FORMAT of the certification exams. My feeling was that I learned Linux with this book and that I learned how to take the certification exams with the SAIR books.

OK, I sent a reply asking if this was normal or maybe just an unusual occurrence that might be corrected with a replacement band. They did not reply and I did not receive any 'no reply' email, nor was the address marked as no reply. So I assume they received that email and did not reply.

I never get sick of watching these movies I was a teen when the first film came out in 1985 and it always brings a wave of great nostalgia when I watch them. The bonus features are great they have almost everybody they even had the original Jennifer explain why she was not in part two an three. It is hard to watch Michael J Fox because he has Parkinson's disease he was such a good actor it looks like he is getting worse.

Especially the first and third installment of this wild, wild ride. So the minute I saw this available for preorder on Blu-Ray I was all over it.The sound is amazing and the picture is clear and beautiful. Notice I dropped a star on the review? It wasn't for the second movie (though the second movie is worth the demotion) but for the graphics being too good. Yes, too good. The graphics were so good you could see the actor's make-up. I don't think the producers expected to see this in high definition so you can really see the make-up and masks when they are trying to disguise or age a character.I'm so glad these came in. We watched them all almost instantly and intend to do that every year or so. I love traveling back and forth through time with Marty and Doc! I'm so glad they put this together in one beautiful package.

I would love to have a time machine with Michael J. Fox in it- a box set so to speak. The trilogy covers the first time Marty sees the Doc's DeLorean future ready and plutonium hot car. Next comes Part 2 that flys the boys back to 1955 to \\"fix a problem\\" that could change everyone's future, and the final Part 3 of the set brings the boys into the Wild West for a real showdown with \\"Mad Dog Tanner.\\" The ending is hilarious and I have loved this take on the idea of moving through time since a child.

He looks like a little tweaker always wiggin' out and going crazy and Christopher Lloyd has got to be one of Hollywood's biggest inside jokes. They released him in movies like these and \\"Angels in the Outfield\\" just to see how many morons went to go see these movies with such a terrible fool acting in them.

The packaging is beyond moronic -- and that's putting it lightly. I had never seen packaging like this before and hope I don't again. Getting the discs out is a major headache and leaves them VERY prone to scratching or even breaking. There is no standard push button -- you need to kinda forcibly push down on them and slide them. Getting them back in is even worse. If you buy this, there's a good chance you're throwing your money down the drain as you'll likely end up with scratched or broken discs sooner or later.The movies, by all accounts, look great.

Parts 2 and 3 have had the top and bottom of the picture CUT OFF! Universal so far has done a pretty clean job of hiding this information, because they haven't made an official consumer alert or announced a recall of any kind, because they still want you to buy it, BUT DON'T GIVE IN! They will fix the problem in february, and will offer replacements to everyone who bought the defective copies. Howevwer, I'm afraid that there will be alot of people duped into buying it and never know that it's defective, unless they have a widescreen TV. So, buyer beware... I will personally put up with the long, painful wait to add these discs to my library. However, I think it's better than buying a defective copy and risk the mail in replacement program getting [...]up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, but...","review":"It was great seeing the Back to the Future trilogy is magnificent blu-ray picture clarity and sound but Universal spent no money on the packaging or disk graphics. The movies are fantastic and worth buying but....The cheap trifold disk holder crams in 6 disks. I was afraid I was going to break the movie trying to get it out of the holder. No effort went into the disk graphics. The original dvd release of the trilogy at least had full color movie poster graphics on each disk.This is one of my favorite movie trilogies but I was disappointed in it's presentation. Not worthy of a silver anniversary release."},{"rating":"1","title":"An inferior release","review":"Is there no quality control at Universal? Like many others who bought this box set immediately after it was released, I was very disappointed to find out (after it was released) that there were misframed shots in the widescreen editions of Parts II and III.

My personal observation is that 2 and 3 were MORE entertaining with more special effects and \\"cliff hanger\\" moments - the train reaching maximum mass as the doctor and then the female climb along the side of the train trying to catch up to the DeLorean Time Machine and finally resorting to the skate board from the future to hop in at the last second!As far as the blacked out faux paux on Discs 2 and 3 I didn't notice it. I had borrowed this set. So I'm not too upset by it and will wait until after the date mentioned to buy my set.The extra disc is full of information on the making of the movies, that most will find enjoyable.Overall, an entertaining set of movies with very few shortcomings.

Don't buy this DVD set, wait until they re-release it with the proper formatting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Scot!","review":"I watched these movies as a child, and upon re-watching them as an adult, I was thrilled. They're still awesome. The movie-making in the first film is just spectacularly good- nail-bitingly intense, funny, and well put together, without being particularly violent or profane. I dig it.The second and third movies are weaker-the second in particular, but after the rock-and-roll of the first movie, you gotta follow Doc and Marty all the way from Einstein to Jules and Vern. The first movie shows you how it's done. The second two complete the story.Watch the Back to the Future Trilogy on sick days and during lazy vacation time. Watch it when work is driving you nuts. Watch it with popcorn and candy; turn out all of the lights and laugh. It's not deep. It's not particularly meaningful. It is, occasionally, trivial and slick- but it's hilarious.

How can you go wrong with all of this commentary providing additional information on the trilogy.Back to the Future is one of the greatest trilogies of all time. It is high concept, high energy and high adventure. It is also made worthwhile by the talents of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. As much as it deals with the concept of time travel, it also deals with adverse situations and coming from a point of having very little at the beginning of part I to having everything at the end of part III. It was extremely well written and well executed and it doesn't get much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes Yes Yes!","review":"In the words of the Rock!

Finally available in High Definition! The colors are superb, and the clarity is excellent. As you've all heard the packaging is terrible. That is no joke. There is even a website with a video of how to insert and remove the discs. [...]25th-anniversary-trilogy After watching the video I felt confident I could handle it, and as soon as I picked up the set I removed one of the discs only to have one of the small plastic \\"arms\\" break off. It still holds the disc fine, but my biggest concern is that the discs will eventually be scratched due to this type of holder. Why they couldn't use the standard plastic \\"button\\" is beyond me. I hope they change this soon.

It's rare that science fiction and humor are blended so deftly, so that this story works both as suspense and as satire.As for the DVD, be sure to check the label for a small \\"V2\\". There was a major mix-up with the matting of II and III; replacement discs are being shipped as of April 2003. The V2, with the correct transfers of II and III, should be on the barcoding on the package, and also on the discs themselves. If you bought the original version and want the corrected dics, MCA has a toll free number you can call (see the official Back to the Future web site for details)."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't go wrong with B2TF","review":"you can't go wroung with back to the future. plus its classic, plus i got a good deal on this blue ray. thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic fun..","review":"This is one of my classic fav's.It's fun and has plenty of action and that cheesy humor.

I already knew that there were going to be complaints about this set before I bought it. I only bought this set for Back to the Future Part 1. The other two parts were matted versions and not true widescreen versions. I already own the Fullscreen Laserdisc versions of Part 2 & 3. The dvd versions are poorly matted with too much space above the actors heads and too much information cut off the bottom. I always try to buy fullscreen versions of movies that were filmed on Super 35( Terminator 2, The Abyss). My biggest complaint of this dvd set is that all the documentaries switch back and forth between widescreen and fullscreen. This is only a problem if you have a 16:9 tv but soon everyone will have this type of tv and Universal should have know better. Also the add on sticker that says Widescreen or Fullscreen is deceptive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phisics vs Philosophy","review":"Wouldn't it be cool to have a time machine in the back of your car? sure as snotI won't bore you with details that 600+ people have already told you about this show.

I got the set for Christmas and couldn't wait to open them. The movies look spectacular. Even though the case is annoying, the set comes with removal instructions which becomes easier to remove after time. I noticed that on the third Blu Ray movie there were many errors on the disc, the movie would stop playing and continue a few seconds later like a streaming video. I played the disc on a stand alone player and on a laptop with a BD drive. the same thing happened. I refuse to let this ruin the review. The quaility of the movies is still awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"The packaging really isn't that bad","review":"There have been a lot of complaints about removing the disks from this package, but it really isn't all that bad once you get the hang of it. It's only really annoying when you have to dig out the digital copy disks when you transfer them to your computer, and that is something you'll only have to do once. The movie disks themselves are really not that bad to remove repeatedly.As for the movies, the Blu-Ray versions of the movies look gorgeous, and the extra features are great resource for BTTF fans. The glimpses of the Eric Stoltz footage is a fun addition, and there is a hilarious outtake for the first movie that really makes this new set worth it.My only real complaint is that the image quality on the iTunes digital copies could be better. Even though the resolution is 853x460 the picture looks pretty soft if you watch it on anything larger than an iPhone screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eric Stoltz, we hardly knew thee.","review":"I'm happy to see these great films are finally coming to DVD, it's just too bad that there doesn't seem to be any footage included of Eric Stoltz's performance as Marty McFly. (One of) the reason(s) that this has been delayed for so long is that Universal was having trouble coming to an agreement with Stoltz regarding the possible usage of footage he appeared in before it was decided he didn't act enough like a teenager and Fox was cast in his place. Apparently, there was no deal. I'll buy the dvd set anyway.-Mike"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the trilogy but why do I have to go through 10 minutes of crap before I can watch the movies?","review":"This is not a review of the trilogy. I am sure most people who are thinking of getting this set have already watched the movies. If not, there are plenty of reviews out there. I am just disappointed that why do I have to watch 10 minutes of crap every time I want to watch any of the movie? That is so annoying. I paid and bought this blu ray set.

The BTTF 2 and 3 discs both have problems w/ being misframed. After returning it for another set I encountered the same problem. I called the store I purchased it from and they were not aware of any problems. Then I contacted Universal and was told that there is a problem w/ the widescreen version and a corrected version of the disc will be released sometime in February. If I wanted a corrected copy I would have to pay the shipping and handling for the discs because they screwed up. Great company backing their product. They said that the problem is w/ all widescreen discs not full frame.

What a great price for the Trilogy! Gave as a birthday gift to my husband. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the Future - Blu-Ray - Bad Packaging","review":"Positive things first...The picture on these disks is phenomenal. Universal did an amazing job moving this to HD video. The sound is also great in 5.1 HD. We watched all three of the movies tonight because it made us feel like kids again. The Delete Scenes on the disk are also fun to watch. They actually add a ton of context to the movie. (e.g. why George was late to school, What was supposed to happen, etc...) The digital copies are also working fine on OSX and Windows 7 so far. I have yet to try them out on my Zune HD or IPod Touch.Negatives: The packaging they used is horrible. The disks just fall out of the sleeve when you open the book. Why could they have used the ultra-slim cases that held 6 DVD? Cheap packing to say the least! (very disappointing!) This does not warrant less stars though, because everything else is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Same Old Re-Hash","review":"My comment about the difference in the sequels to BTTF is this: the ideal sequel--in my book--is one that expands on the original story. Movies that repeat the same plot, same jokes, same gimmicks, miss the point of good storytelling.If you want the same story, or are obsessive enough to want to repeat the same experience, then watch that movie again.In any case, I really enjoyed all three of BTTF. We got to know the characters better and at deeper levels.I recall, while watching BTTF III in the theatre, feeling close to tears when the Mary Steenburgen character almost fell off the train.I guess the moral of the differing comments here, is that everyone sees movies from their own perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disapointed","review":"We were so excited to recieve our movies only to be let down by the second and third dvd's.

What is wrong with just a blue case? that is why I am taking away a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible case!","review":"OMG, I didn't believe the other reviews that mentioned how ridiculous this case is. I figured it can't possibly be that bad. Well guess what, I pulled and pried and yanked every which way and the darn discs absolutely would not come off, even pulling at full strength! Short of completely ripping the case apart and smashing the plastic, there seemed no way to get the discs out! Let's just say there is a reason there are tons of Youtube videos instructing how to remove the discs from this absurd case. Even after watching them, it was still difficult to get it out, and once I did, I had the hardest time figuring out how to push the discs back into place! You certainly will never want a visitor or friend trying to watch this to remove the discs themselves as they will likely ruin the case and the discs trying to get them out. I am so flabbergasted at the poor design that I can't even bother commenting on the movies themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent product","review":"We all know about the trilogy. This movie speaks by itself. Great idea and loved the explanation of the deleted scenes and definitely a wise decision in not including the scene where they murdered Mr. Strickland.In the extra bonus very nice interviews and anecdotes.Regarding the package at the beginning was a little bit of a challenge to try to take the disc out of the case. I thought that was a very bad idea to do that style of disc case/holder but latter I learned how to do it. It should come with an explanation of how to take the disc out of the box without scratching the disc.Basically you have to push the disc from one corner towards the other lower corner. If you see the box has in the bottom part a system of clips that recoils when pushing the disc. Well, once you learn how to do it you will see that it is actually easier and better than the other traditional disc containers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Set","review":"this set contains three of michael j. foxx's & Christopher Lloyd's greates movies they made. the three back to the future movies are entertaining beyond anything. they all are great movies. they all are must sees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lets go back to the future","review":"This is the first trilogy where I actually liked every movie.

In case you aren't aware, parts 2 & 3 of the movie have framing errors that cut off the top, bottom, and sides of the original frame. To make matters worse, it cuts out critical, plot-important information from the frame.Universal claims to be replacing the discs in February, but I'm going to wait until the new retail package is on the shelf. Universal has been unresponsive to my emails asking when the new, corrected retail package will be available, and how they will be identified.BUYER BEWARE.

These movies are one of my most favorites and it is very dissappointing to think that Universal can do this to ruin a classic.

These movies are clever, funny, and alot of fun to watch.I owned these movies on VHS but I knew I wanted them on DVD. I bought this box set for two reasons. The first reason was because it contains all three films and the second reason is because there are a ton of bonus features. I find watching the special features just as fun as watching the movie, and there are a ton of features here. I love all of the 'behind the scenes' featurettes on these disks and the 'hoverboard test' featurette for Back to the Future Part II. There are plenty of features to last awhile...I think there are around 10 hours of features.If you are a huge fan of the trilogy like I am, there is no way that you should pass this box set up. I haven't had any problems with my set and it was worth every penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't disclose covers condition","review":"Cover was in bad shape. Water damage and spots if dirt all over.

The order arrived in \\"apparently\\" good condition. I played disc one and it was excellent. The next one was viewed several weeks later and was defective. The third one was fine. I wrote the shipper, and told him what I have just told you. He said to replace my DVD player, now four years old, because there was nothing wrong with the DVD he sent me. I have learned a lesson from this, a rather unhappy one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Fox","review":"It had been several years since I last watched Back to the Future. When the 25th Anniversary Trilogy came out, I thought I would give it a second look. The first of the series and the last are great, just as I had remembered. The second is just filler to get you to the last, but even the second one is a pretty good movie. I think it is cool that they covered past, present and the future, in \\"Back to the Future\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to the future","review":"I bought this bluray for my husbands birthday and when he went to watch it, it started skipping and wouldn't play.

Michael J. Fox is probably one of my all time favorite actors. The first one is of course the best, but I still really like the 2nd one because its take on the future is so cheesy! The 3rd one never caught my interest, but I still watch it because I think MJF was cute when he was young (even though he's old enough now to be my dad. LOL). I asked my parents to buy it for my for Christmas, but I now know that my brother's girlfriend is getting it for him, so I don't even have to worry.

Romano could have done better research on a few of these movies. He does not include Cagney on Cagney as a source and it shows. In the autobiography, Cagney discusses several things he did to train for the movies, like how much weight he lost, life experience as a fighter, his trainers, and where he got his keen ability to move like a boxer. He lost 35 pounds for City for Conquest, and that's not in the book. I lost trust for the author as a careful researcher. If he did not bother to read a source as important as Cagney's autobiography, what else did he not do? And I don't think he's ever head of Terrible Joe Moran. Don't waste your time on this rushed to print gimmick book. The table of contents is the best part.If you must have this get it our of a bargain bin or hold out for a 2nd edition, with updates and revisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Disappointment","review":"This was the 2nd of 2 sets of these dishes. The first set was 5-stars. This order was very disappointing. The color and print quality was nowhere close to what it should have been. First of all, the pattern was fuzzy instead of crisp. Second, the colors were very off. For example, the red apples were pink, the golden pears were yellow-green. My family unpacked the dishes and washed them before I got home. Otherwise, I would have returned them. The items were carefully packed and I received them within 2-3 days of my order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceived","review":"After ordering this item, I was told that it was for 8 mugs only and not a 16 piece set as advertised.

I'd only ever once found an inexpensive and worthy product that worked, then Bath & Body Works decided to discontinue it (figures) about 10 years ago. Since, I've hunted for the next best thing, spending a small fortune in vain to simply clear up my face. It's just on the chin and forehead, but still there no matter what I use (including proactiv). So I thought I'd try this line of products. Once again, I've been left disappointed as although this product softens the skin and pores it didn't do anything about the acne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!!","review":"I thought I try something new and ended up purchasing this product.

Then about six months ago, La Roche Posay changed the formula. Now there is an \\"anti-relapse\\" ingredient which wasn't there before. The whole consistency of the product has changed, the way it works changed, and when you begin using it, it no longer effectively spot treats acne. I used to be able to use this product and get results within a day! Now, if I use this product, my acne gets worse. I wish La Roche Posay was still offering their original formula, which was so effective and smelled great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acne Treatment","review":"I am 44 years old with a mild case of errupting acne. I had tried several OTC medications for a topical, but after a month, I was frustrated. I searched Amazon for another product and came across the La Roche-Posay Effaclar K Treament and decided to try it since so many others had positive results.I too am a believer in this product. The acne that I have is in the T areas of my face. In just two days, errupting acne seemed to just disapear. I'm really impressed with the product and would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Acne Worse","review":"I bought La Roche-Posay Effaclar K Acne Treatment for my wife after reading reviews, hoping for results equal to the raves. She has rather aggressive acne on her face and back, especially under her neck line. However, after careful application for over a week, the effects were sadly opposite. The acne not only resisted the cream, it also appeared to encourage even more outbreak around areas treated. She immediately ceased to use it after noting the spreading, and the situation calmed down. She does supplement with DermaCare and internal cleaners that assist a great deal, along with diet to avoid chocolate, ice cream, caffeine and deep fried foods. While this cream may indeed result in positive results for some users, I assure you, it is not for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effaclar K","review":"I like this product; it seems to work well on my skin and keeps it clear without overly drying it. It had been recommended by my dermatologist."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Thoughts","review":"I liked the characters in this story, but the book should have gone into more detail about each one. That way they become more real to the reader. Robert Jordon's wheel of time is a good example. The story line was good too, but with more depth and twist it would have been better. You have a good imagination Doranna,now make us fall in love with them. Dennis MattordP.S. I've read countless books over the years and the ones I most remember are the long indepth ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"This is a book worth reading.

Two thumbs up and a big thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best new writer in fantasy!!","review":"This is one of many books by Durgin I have read. She is a great writer. I don't have time alot of time to read, but I make time for Durgin's books.The story is about a young warrior who searches for her father after her mother is killed. She ultimately finds herself on the journey. It is packed with adventure and an array of characters and personalities. Don't pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved It!","review":"I got this title free for my Kindle. So many of my free purchases have been really disappointing so I feel obligated to review this one because it was such a good story. I just LOVE Kelyn, the main character. Having raised daughters, I have a soft spot for a strong female lead and Kelyn fits the bill. Coming from a harsh but honest land, she has a rough time venturing into the so-called 'civilized' countries, but her intelligent observations and quick thinking help her survive. And when all that fails, she has no qualms about using that staff of hers to get people's attention!This was a really good read and I highly recommend it if you like adventure and humor in your stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wolverine's Daughter (The Wolverine's Daughter)","review":"This was a very good short story and I enjoyed it emmensily.

It was fascinating from beginning to end. The female lead is such a great character--strong, capable and caring. Lots of adventure and excitement throughout the entire story.

This however, leaves me cold - stone cold. There is little evidence of the musicality nor the flowing, rythmic symmetry of Eco.

I thought this was going to be an actual play that you might go to the theater to see but it was not. It was just a mini concert. In the beginning it had a short movie about the Yolanda Adams, Donnie McClurkin, and Kirk Franklin, when they were supposed to young and dreaming about their lives, acting not that great at all, then it was supposedly to come to real time and all I saw was a mini concert. If you are looking for a \\"play\\" don't waste your money.

I was really looking forward to seeing them together. What a shock when I opened it to discover that it's printed in mouse type. That's 6 point type, the same size they use for the fine print in an insurance contract. A typical Bible is printed in 9.5 point type. So unless you're well under 40 years old, this book is not for you. For those of us on the far side of 40, reading this print for more than a few minutes will result in eye strain headaches--if you can read it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Thought","review":"I purchased this for my mom for Christmas this year and it just arrived. First, I was saddened to find it isn't actually leather. If the cover was leather it would be one of the coolest looking bibles I've ever seen. But it's man made so it's going back for that alone. Second, I purchased this particular one because of it's size. I thought a larger bible would have larger font. Absolutely not. I'm 26 w/ perfect vision and I had a hard time reading the text because of the font size they chose. Other than the two problems above, I really like the side by side passages and the feel of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"More a paraphrase than a translation","review":"In my opinion the TNIV strays too far from the original manuscripts it is based on. It is more a paraphrase than a translation. I prefer the NKJV, NIV, or NASB to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Book","review":"Another powerful book from Jason Jennings. Jennings is proving to be one of the most insightful examiners of today's successful companies. He does a masterful job in uncovering the key ingredients that go into making a business a winner in the 21st Century. It's an exciting read for managers, future managers and anyone who wants to own a business. Clever insights and practical tools. I urge you to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally some smart advice worth my time","review":"Over the years I've read one how -to -succeed book after another and then I read this one. I concluded that this Jennings fellow says it straight and smart. He has done his homework and his intense research is obvious. I much appreciated that he did not just put some simplistic ideas together but had the courage to do a book that would showcase maverick but really strong thinking. With the economy pressing on businesses these days, this book would be an investment every single manager and owner should make. It 's an investment in time that will give business people the courage to be their best and do their best.; my business will without doubt be better off because I read (and will re-read) this solid book. I would like to congratulate the author and his team of savvy researchers. Just read it yourself and see what I mean about time well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be missed","review":"Jason Jennings comes to the table with rare qualifications for a business-book author. He has the done-it-myself insider's perspective of someone who has built and run highly successful businesses of his own, with the seen-the-good-and-the-bad perspective of a consultant who has been privvy to company secrets of the successes and failures that few outside a company ever get to hear. Those qualifications must be what accounts for his gaining access to corporate leaders who have never before talked to a business journalist or author.And then he obviously knew what questions to ask. These business leaders have shared with him some of the best advice on improving and running an organization, or making a dysfunctional organization into a model of success, that have ever appeared on the printed page.This is a book not to be missed by anyone in business. In fact, the stories make such delightful reading that the book holds the promise of fascinating you even if you are NOT in business!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Less Is More: How Great Companies Use Productivity As...","review":"I've read a lot of business books before and I can tell you most of the time they're boring as hell. Jason's style of writing is cutting edge. Not only is the information extremely helpful, it's actually fun to read! A compelling read is a compelling read; whether or not the book is fiction or business-focused. It's rare, actually it's the first time, I've gotten a \\"work\\" book and read it cover to cover the first day I had it. As I was reading the book I found myself running the numbers on my companies revenue per employee to see how we compared to the competition. It's an eyeopener if nothing else. I can also tell you that I'm now looking for ways to aggressively increase our productivity - now. Thank you Mr. Jennings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Less is More\\" is a Must Read","review":"As Jennings did in his previous book (\\"It's Not the Big That Eat the Small, It's the Fast That Eat the Slow\\" with co-author Laurence Haughton), this one is full of take-away value. The companies Jennings studied are remarkable examples of what can be accomplished when everyone is on board and can connect the dots between productivity, REAL customer satisfaction, increased profits and job security.It's also interesting that the CEOs of these companies didn't just inherit healthy situations and ride them into the sunset. Some started with nothing, others were brought in to disastrous situations and some had a number of serious setbacks over the years. I was especially struck by their humility and how they treated their employees the same way they treated themselves.Jennings expertly weaves their stories together to demonstrate that real productivity is achieved by adhering to a set of guiding principles. It's hard work, but in the long run it's the only way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"let's have more of Less is More","review":"Big Objectives,Hardwork,and Truth. Is this keeping it simple,or what? Read on. The rest of Jenning's book provides clarity to a pathway of business success. Are these featured businesses an aberation to the way in which the majority of businesses both large and small are run? Cynicism in current times aside,Less is More gets it right from the get go.Presented succinctly and with passion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You","review":"I really enjoy this song.

I will purchase this scent again (in fact I intend to stock up a few bottles). It is not a loud fragrance and I find myself drawing my wrists up to my nose sometimes just because it is so inviting to smell.

This book is a must read for all librarians. Although it is a bit outdated being a few years old, this book does a great job at explaining to the reader all about the different careers available to librarians. The details about what you should do in library school in order to prepare for the job market are very helpful. The author gives recommendations about what courses to take, internships to go after and more. She also mentions some aspects of other library related careers that you may not have considered. As a college librarian, I bought this copy before I went to library school and I still pick it up every know and then as a refresher and to see what she has to say about certain aspects of life as a librarian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy with caution","review":"I was really looking forward to this CD...

The pages contain the traditional Greko-Roman deities to the Norse and Celtic gods, the Hindu avatars of Vishnu, obscure Haitian Loa, and Mesopotamian gods like Nebo and Ishtar. This is the book for mythology lovers. This book has it all.The entries are arranged in alphabetical order and also include different titles or specific address to a deity, what the deity was associated with, explaining key events and stories. This dictionary is concise and well researched. The myths surrounding the deities are summarized to the key points.I think if the entries were arranged by culture or location first then alphabetical might be easier to use.Overall, this is a wonderful tool for mythology, religion, or simple reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic","review":"As an inexpensive starting point for getting to grips with Director its not bad.

I know people heap praise on Blazing Saddles by saying this movie couldn't be made today or people are too P.C. but this movie is just plain bad as well as offensive.

The first time I was too doubled up with laughter to remember anything. Brooks and his cast of comedic stars made bad taste funny and fashionable. The much-missed Madelyn Kahn, the stressed Harvey Korman and the bulbous Dom De Luise created classic characters that linger in the memory while helping Mel Brooks take on (and shatter) the 'epic' western. The film is too well-known to review here but you will find something new with every viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie for Dad","review":"Blazing Saddles was one of my fathers favorite movies of all time. I remember as a boy he would laugh so hard he would have to run, not walk, to the bathroom. Now that he has been deceased 9 months moments like watching Blazing Saddles with him take on new meaning. My old man used to laugh everytime Mel Brooks came on camera. The absurd, yet womanizing mayor portrayed what most of us think of politicians perfectly. Gene Wilder was at his best in this film, \\"Little [..] shot me in the a**.\\" Sheriff Bart is the ultimate straight man in this film. In all the Mel Brooks movies I dare anyone to find a better one (which isn't to say there are not some close seconds).In my humble opinion Blazing Saddles is a true classic. Off colored comdey without taking it too far. This is not toilet bowl humor. No, only good laughs that are off color yet not disgusting.This ones for you Dad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blazing Saddles","review":"The ultimate in directing, Mel Brookes does an unbelievable job of both directing and writing for this film. It looks and feels like a real western, but it isn't, it's the most brilliant spoof ever created to date. It's very funny, If you're thinking of either buying or renting this movie, I strongly suggest you do.The story is about an african american \\"slave\\" (Cleavon Little) who is to be hung, but Hedley Lammar has other plans for him. He sends Bart to Rock Ridge. He hopes having a black sherrif will drive all the people from rock ridge in order to run his railroad through it. But Jim (Gene Wlder), who befriends Bart, has different plans for the town."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, OK DVD","review":"I wish this DVD had more features, e.g. a \\"Making Of\\" Featurette, but the hour interview with Mel will have to do.

Didn't sell... a mixed mercy, but I have it now in my library so that makes the B.S. experience worth revisiting, and in a time of strangling political correctness, I'm proud to say there is no single frame of video in the film that doesn't piss somebody off.

Madeline Kahn's Lily Von Shtupp is, without a doubt, one of the best examples of how a brilliant comedic supporting performance can take on a life of its own and steal an entire movie. Kahn's Lily is a spoof of Marlene Dietrich's seemingly absurd casting in 1930's and 1940's Westerns. The whole movie is one of the best examples of Mel Brooks' trademark style---crazy chaos somehow weaving a cohesive tapestry by the end of the movie, and, somehow making perfect sense. Madeline Kahn will be missed by so many, but her brilliant work will live on (hopefully forever) in films like this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the funniest movies of all times, with a message","review":"Many people love this movie for its raunchy off colored humor. Many people feel it is tooracist in nature to be funny. Mel Brooks felt the best way to teach a lesson was through laughter. If you take predjudice and laugh at it, does it not lose it's power. Watch this movie with that point of view and it is funny all over again. The performances were keen. The writing sharp. Richard Pryor contributed much to the script. Throw away your predjudices and laugh at stupidity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best edition so far...","review":"...due to the animated menu, \\"Black Bart\\" TV ep, tribute to Madeline Kahn and particulary the new doc on the making of the film--it has the same audio commentary from the previous edition by Brooks but it is funny just the same--I would feel silly reviewing the actual movie because I would think everyone with the exception of the extremely humor-impared has heard about this movie, so buy this one and give your old one to that uneducated friend in the hopes (s)he can be saved!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blazing Saddles rules!!!!!","review":"This movie has one of the greatest fart scenes in movie history!I recomend this to anyone!Rated R for strong language including racial slurs,sexual content,crude humor and violence.[Note to parents:If you are concerned about letting your child watching certain movies check my reviews so you see what content is in the movie you want to see if your child can watch.]"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of Mel Brooks Best.

A bad one. This is coming from a big parody fan. Most jokes are unfunny and the characters aren't nearly cartoony enough, with the exception of Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks himself. The main villain couldn't be less funny. I think a good parody requires a hilarious, over the top villain and the movie completely fails in this respect. I judge parodies by how often and how hard they can make me laugh and this one only made me chuckle every ten minutes or so. That just isn't good enough. The funniest jokes involved Gene Wilder's character and his hilariously exaggerated reflexes, but there aren't many of them. The ending is ridiculously silly even by parody standards.I am a much larger fan of Brooks' later works such as Spaceballs, Robin Hood: Men in Tights, and Dracula: Dead and Loving It. In my opinion, they are all superior to Blazing Saddles."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't find this movie funny at all.","review":"I don't find this movie funny at all.

And yet this is the worst one I've seen. I've seen all but five, and only missed the ones that aren't really important, like LIFE STINKS. BLAZING SADDLES has a good cast, lots of funny people, and people who work well with Brooks, like Gene Wilder and Madeline Khan. But there's about three good jokes in the whole film, and if you blink, you'll miss them. One of the most embarrassing movies I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my taste in humor","review":"I've watched this movie several times over the years and I just cannot bring myself to like it even though it is one of my Dad's favorites. To be honest, I don't like any of Mel Brooks' movies. The biggest problem with the movie is that is is just plain dull. The second problem is that it is not funny and relies on gimmicks such as the excessive use if the n-word. Slim Pickens and Gene Wilder are the only bright spots in this otherwise dismal flick. The HD DVD transfer is ok, but definitely not among the best like Serenity and Training Day. This is probably the last time I'll ever watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie great, blu-ray poor","review":"the movie is great, fun to watch even it's as old as it is.

If they had added those scenes into this version of the DVD movie, the DVD would have been called the 30th Anniversary \\"Extended\\" Edition. This is how the major movie distributors rape the consumers. They will keep releasing Blazing Saddles in a multitude of different formats until, finally, when people are completely exasperated, they will release an edition that has both the theatrical release and the \\"extended\\" version. Why did they not do this from the start ? Greed. Do not buy this version of the DVD if you have any other incarnation of this movie (on DVD, VHS or Laser Disc).

Some of the greatest comedians working with one of the Twentieth Centuries greatest directors.

There is something quite subversive about this film that he never quite managed before or since.Cleavon Little as Sheriff Bart is right on the button, especially in his initial reaction to the townsfolks bigotry (\\"Oh, Lordylord!!! He means it!!!! Do what he say!!!!!!\\"). Gene Wilder is at his absolute peak never missing a laugh and even getting some quite unexpected giggles from some rather mundane lines.

If you would like a good laugh, you must buy this movie in it's Widescreen format. This film was made in 1974 looks new and beautiful due to it's fantastic transfer. It's a great comedy classic from Mel Brooks and the laughs just keep on a commin'. Wonderfully scripted and still funny after all of those years, what a treat! Harvey Korman is just fantastic he steals the movie. The transfer is just stunning with great thanks from Warner Bros. It's about time this got realeased and so here it is.

And in the end, I do disagree with some of Thornton's conclusions. However, I have to admit that this is one of the most insightful New Age texts I have ever read. It was very challenging on a personal level, and I learned a lot about myself while reading it. Thornton is certainly thought-provoking, intelligent, and a capable writer.

These classic songs need a voice to compliment them and Rod's definitely doesn't. Secondly, here we go again with Clive Davis trying to put Rod Stewart into a Barry Manilow mold! Deja vu from the first American Songbook. Many others have recorded these same songs over the years, and there are many others who do them justice...but Rod is not one of them. My advice is don't waste your money. If you want to hear these songs sung like they should be and deserve to be, buy recordings by Tony Bennett, Linda Ronstadt, Linda Eder, Rosemary Clooney, Michael Feinstein, Harry Connick, Jr. or \\"The Chairman of the Board\\" Frank Sinatra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Rock And Rollers never die, they just flash back...","review":"Right, Rod...what next?

The penchant for aged, gutless rockers who can no longer make great or even decent rock and roll to hide behind this sort of pseudo-sophisticated, coma-inducing drivel is a trend played out to its most disgusting with Stewart. And who in hell pronounced these boring, trivial, sentimental ditties The Great American Songbook in the first place? Obviously people who have never heard of Bob Dylan, Randy Newman, Paul Simon, Jackson Browne, Warren Zevon, Bruce Springsteen, Brian Wilson and Chuck Berry.

They are hitting on the people who pay for their music and this does not seem fair. I feel robbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even A Good Copy","review":"Sitting in a movie theater a while back, I heard Rod Stewart's first oldie album and I thought that this was very different from the Rod Stewart I saw perform at Big Surf, in Tempe Arizona many years ago. Then I realized he had simply stolen the concept and part of the track list, from Bryan Ferry's \\"At Time Goes By\\" album, which came out in late 1999.With this sequel, Rod Stewart completes the caper by including more tracks from \\"As Time Goes By\\" and, well, the album title too. He teams up with Queen Latifa and Cher, perhaps because he needs to. The cover of the album shows Mr. Stewart looking kind of embarrassed. He should be.If you want an album of romantic music from the 1930s, performed by talented musicians then don't buy this one. Take a look at \\"As Time Goes By\\" by Bryan Ferry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, just awful!","review":"I'm glad that a current pop star would sing this material, bringing these classic American standards to a new audience...but I'm not happy that it's THIS \\"singer\\"! The man has no voice at all, he sings out of tune, his diction (in a phony sounding \\"American\\" accent) is terrible, and his \\"interpretation\\" of material that cries out for personality, communication and emotional commitment, is monotonous, uninvolved and flat.But who am I to say? The man makes scads of money...Maybe his ugly sound works for his own songs, but not for these!Harry Connick Jr. does it better, not to speak of Sinatra, Tony Bennett... Avoid this disc!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rod Stewart a Crooner....NOT!","review":"I just listened to this cd at a friend's place and am glad I did, as I certainly won't be buying it.

Stick to the rock n' roll Rod!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rod cashes in","review":"This is a pathetic attempt by an aging rock star to recycle tunes that are so much better when performed by artists who truly embrace this style of music. Rod was a great rock and roll voice but he's out of his league here. He sounds like he's on lithium and adds nothing to these tunes.If you like Rod Stewart listen to Gasoline Alley. If you like standards like those here buy a Frank Sinatra CD. This one is elevator music at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"I've enjoyed Rod Stewart in the past -- I bought this after having seen Rod stand in with Paul and crew on Letterman recently. He was great. I love these songs (a major draw), and he does them justice.

If CD Number One was bad, this is worse.Rod Stewart's interpretation of these classic standards is once again, thoroughly inept. I can't understand who this CD would appeal to, except for people who have no concept of what big band music was about, or jazz.Do yourself a favor. Instead of buying this album, buy a copy of Frank Sinatra's Greatest Hits instead. Sinatra has a much stronger voice, and sings many of these same songs the way they were meant to be heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emperor's New Clothes Redux","review":"I do love many of Rod's old hit songs, but he can't sing the great standards on this CD as well as they should be sung. His Louis Armstrong voice is too harsh for many of the songs. I'll concede that some singing styles take a while to grow on you. For example, I now love Cyndi Lauper's \\"At Last\\" CD and the way she uniquely covers every song with a powerhouse rock voice, and I've learned to like Joni Mitchell's completely changed husky vocals. Unfortunately, because of those two revisionist singers, I didn't realize that I should first listen to this Rod Stewart CD before shelling out money for it. He did pick fabulous songs, and to give him credit, he enunciates well so that every lyric is crystal clear. The orchestra is great. But his voice lacks the mellowness that these classics deserve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rod is gone forever","review":"I honestly thought this was some kind of joke recording. What a total embarassment! I saw the TV commercial for this piece of crap a while ago and Rod looks like an old drunk. Rod's work with Jeff beck and the Faces was GREAT! How can he stoop so low?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is pathetic","review":"I do not need to buy this album in order to review it: unfortunately, its being played all the time everywhere I go. I like the songs, themselves.. but Rod Stewart's rendition is about as genuine and soulful as a bum's rendition on the subway. He sounds like someone who has chain smoked for 50 years and thinks the background music can cover for him. Lee Scratch Perry is another oldie who doesn't sound all that hot either anymore - but at least he has a great show, is a fantastic writer & producer (and what is Rod exactly?)...plus you KNOW he's stoned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Listening to Rod Stewart singing \\"Someone to Watch over Me,\\" is like watching someone like Kenny Rogers in a Shakespearean performance, or Richard Simmons try to reach the hoop in a slamdunk contest with Michael Jordan. Stewart is simply way out of his element.As someone who started his career singing rock/blues songs with bonafide musicians like Jeff Beck, Stewart has really forgotten his roots. Stewart's voice is painfully paper-thin, and somehow, Stewart manages to sound like jazz voacalist Ann Richards.This CD is something that Clive Davis or some A&R; guy dreamed up to sell CD's to woefully ignorant boomers who think that Stewart's doing something new. Do yourself a favor and buy any CD by Frank Sinatra or Tony Bennet instead.This CD only serves as proof that most popular music is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Time goes by...The Great American Songbook: Volume II","review":"I was very disappointed to receive only a CD, when the title clearly states \\"The Great American Songbook : Volume II. I expected a book with lyrics and music along with the CD. I am very upset about not having the notes and words written like they would be in a songbook.

How many pop stars have since recorded collections of standards? Everyone from Toni Tennile to Cyndi Lauper. Of course Linda, Toni and Cyndi had something in common -- lovely, radiant voices and -- to varying degrees -- a stylistic grasp of what these songs require. Rod has no voice and no style, and listening to this nightmare of a CD is like getting your ears flossed with barbed wire. I saw him perform one of these numbers on the Today Show and I never saw a performer look so embarrased and forlorn. Even Rod knows this is a dreadful mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Rip-Off!","review":"If you want to hear a *great* CD with these songs, sung by someone with more talent and style than Rod Stewart, check out the CD \\"As Time Goes By\\" from Bryan Ferry. Stewart is just ripping off Ferry, who did these same songs about two years earlier - and did them better. Stewart does not have the class or elegance to sing these songs. Thumbs down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my this is bad","review":"Rod Stewart lacks the style and heart to make these songs his own. What made performers like Sinatra great was they truly emboldened the songs they sang with a depth and character. They made them their own. Rod Stewart is just a stand in who doesn't contribute anything new to the performance of this music and his signature voice simply kills legendary hits like \\"I'm In The Mood For Love\\".This album isn't about bringing a new vision to the performance of these classics. It's about Rod Stewart trying to milk one last cent out of a fading career. If you want to enjoy a modern restyling of great jazz and vocal favorites, pickup any CD from Diana Krall. She delivers soulful, extraordinary performances in the tradition of Ella Fitzgerald, Mel Torme, Nancy Wilson, Ertha Kitt, and Frank Sinatra. That's how it's supposed to be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"** PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS CD ! **","review":"If you loved Rod Stewart - as I did - go out and buy the box set \\"5 Guys Walk Into a Bar...\\" the fabulous Faces retrospective.If you love the Great American Songbook, as Mel Torme called it, go out and buy any album by Torme, Sinatra, Fitzgerald et al and leave this set for fauning Oprah audiences.

This was such a sorry production. The famousRod Stewart voice was absent throughout the album.It was sappy, sentimental and dull from start to finish.I bought the album enthusiastically expecting his famous,unique, raspy, gutsy interpretation of the old standards.I was sorely disappointed. It was just another boringcollection of standards. One song just drifted on to thenext like a long, dreary run-on sentence. Each cutwas indistinguishable from the next.Listening to this album was just like going back to afamiliar place after twenty years and realizing things havechanged so much for the worse.

Sure, anyone can record these songs, but the significant duplication strongly suggests that Ferry had an idea that Rod thought he could better capitalize on. Spare yourself the soulless Stewart crooning. If you want a modern pop singer doing authentic but fresh renditions, buy Bryan Ferry instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's become of the Great American Songbook?","review":"Oo God, one more time!This is a collection of the cream of the cream of the Great American Songbook by a rock'n'roll singer who contributes nothing at all to American culture. This rate #1 is to express my deep deception about the successful album series.Over exposed material which has been treated so many different ways by so many different vocalists with artistry should be treated respectfully.I am not a dictator but I would vote for a Law that would impose respect for some art expressions which represents the treasure of American culture.More than that, the series success reflects lack of understanding of the music context by people who should search for entertainment in a more valid and truer way.That's the deal: there is truth missing, there is a sensation of a money-make production. Mellow arrangements, neglectable performances, lacking creativeness.

The book draws you further and further into the world it creates in the way of a current slowly drawing a swimmer into a whirlpool.

Few could run a rack in the simple uncomplicated manner of the Babe. This book conveys the importance of pocketing balls in the correct sequence to ensure run-outs without moving the cueball all over the table - a lost art to the modern nine ball player.

Not only is the content of the book fairly weak, it's also full of technical inaccuracies. Considering the level of play that Cranfield was at, it's interesting to note that he apparently has no grasp whatsoever of the actual effects of english and throw. While a good player of any of the other cuesports might find this a useful introduction to the strategy of straight pool, I think a beginner may find this book does irreparable harm to his understanding of basic fundamentals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here: 'Bible' redundant, old hat","review":"Pool players: if you are anything above a low C player than this book is really a waste of time, and exposes no unique opinions/strategies/skills/drills that you will find useful. Basically the book rides on the coattails of the authors' professional achievements; sadly these do NOT bring with them a knack for either teaching OR writing, as sorely evidenced in this thin texts' lack of content. Time would be better spent with Cappelle, Fels and Koehler. These three will say all this book says and much, much more. Good luck with your runouts...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very mixed bag","review":"Covers some aspects of Straight Pool...but never in enough depth or clarity. More worth your money are Capelle's \\"Play your Best Straight Pool\\" (everything you can imagine about the game) and Fels' classic \\"Advanced Pool\\" (not quite as in depth as Capelle, but with good sections on the mental aspect of pool, plus several racks analyzed shot by shot). To be perfectly honest, I junked Babe's book a month after buying it; I simply had no use for it alongside better books like the above-mentioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicholas is Superb!","review":"All of the 3 French Nicholas stories are really fun but the Five Crayons is an especially good one.

The Swell Season album misses on all of these marks.They actually re-worked a few tracks from Once, and unfortunately, didn't improve them at all. I'd rather listen to the originals.And the new songs are almost all Glen singing, and just aren't very interesting.I bought this, listened to it twice, then simply gave it to my friend, who actually felt the same way about it.Stick to Once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a \\"Swell\\" fan!","review":"I ordered this CD to hear more of Marketa Irglova -- she's great.

I believe it is rated byNew Yorker in top hundred best sound tracks of films Just beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to listen to","review":"Released before the movie Once popularized the music of the eclectic duo of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova. Some are earlier versions of numbers heard in Once such as 'Lies' and 'Falling Slowly', but most are original to this album. The title cut is an instrumental (piano) piece. Both albums share a quiet combination of mostly lead guitar and male vocal with vocal and piano highlights from Irglova, although they trade roles from time to time. The music is soulful, relational, reflective at times, angry at times and revolves around real people and situations. Worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glen Hansard The Swell Season","review":"Bought only because of cut #4 from movie \\"Once\\" and love the entire album.

I found myself going to the net to grab tabs for songs. Then I went in a store and was going to buy the soundtrack . . . and stopped. I saw the Swell Season standing there. I took a risk and bought it instead.I am glad I did.This album is even better than the soundtrack. The souls are bare, the production is tight, and there isn't a single flaw. I have fallen in love with these two. They just compliment each other so well, it's breath taking.If you love singer/songwriters who write with their soul laid out in front of you, buy this album immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than \\"once\\"","review":"Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova make a real-life ending to the movie \\"once\\" with its satisfying but unresolved ending. They do the songs they liked, tart them up with excellent production values and add a few other tunes. Has a quieter, shinier feel than the movie soundtrack, sometimes a bit draggy. It almost comes out whole, but being part of a movie soundtrack and the rest added, it has a \\"parts of the sum\\" feeling. There are definitely some great tracks here if you want to just pick and choose. I wonder what's next for these two?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"The Swell Season is brilliant music from the amazingly talented Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova... Having heard his work with Irglova as well as with the Frames, he is undeniably talented in both mediums - Swell Season is a bit calmer, more melodic, and more like catchy folk music. The Frames bring a slightly harder edge.That said, I unequivocally recommend the Swell Season as essential listening for any Glen Hansard fan.I became a fan of Hansard and Irglova after seeing the movie Once. Others might view it as an exaggeration to call the soundtrack to that film a masterpiece, but I'm a huge fan and have yet to recommend it to someone who didn't absolutely love it. I enjoyed both the music and movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"LLD","review":"I have owned and carried my S&W Model 411 (.40 S&W) since 1995 before and since retiring from law enforcement.

Historically, Loomis only relies on inaccurate Thermidorian sources written by individuals anxious to exonerate themselves and blame all evils of the revolution on Robespierre and the Jacobians. He also continually distorts, invents and rearranges facts. If you want to learn about the actual events, there are many accurate sources by legitimate historians such as David P. Jordan, Norman Hampson, J.M. Thompson and R.R. Palmer. Then you will be reading genuine history, not the twisted fantasies of someone posing as an historian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading in the extreme","review":"What good is it if a book is well written if it is misleading in the extreme when it comes to historical accuracy. The distortions Loomis foists on those unfamiliar with the history of the French revolution is a disservice, and his book should be labelled as outrageous fiction.

Favorable, 2. Balanced pro and con. 3. Critical but based on reasoned judgement and 4. Hostile and absurd. Loomis is a prime example of the latter, inventing many incidents out of thin air. In one case, he took a priumary source and omitted one word that altered the entire meanng to the opposite of what the writer intended. Loomis was deliberatly falsifying history, an unpardonable sin for a legitimate, which Loomis is not. Instead, he is merely a sensatioal writer of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless anit-history","review":"This book should be avoided by anyone wishing to learn about history.

Well, how about a \\"history\\" that sticks to historical *fact* rather than meandering off on some four-hundred page incredibly biased rant? How about a \\"history\\" that doesn't laud murderers who murder for opportunism while deploring murderers who murder for ideals? How about a \\"history\\" that takes into account the *multivariable* reasons for the Terror--hyperinflation, the threat of popular revolution, civil war in the Vendee and Midi, foreign war against every country in Europe?

Palmer for a start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest writing","review":"If one is writing fiction, then one can freely tamper with the FACTS, BUT IF ONE IS writing history, or attempting to write history, it is an essential duty to remain honest.

There are a lot of problems with this program. I used to use Rand/McNally's Street Finder, but they don't currently have a PC version or one compatable with XP. My advise - Keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product, blows away those \\"cheap\\" models","review":"Before I purchased this model, I had a couple of the 30-40 buck 500/1000 watt units from a local bulk item store. They were average for small items, but whenever you tried to get near the max load rating (500 watts), the thing would beep and turns off. This 1000 watt model can be pushed a bit over 1300 watts, and keep on going. To put 1000 watts in perspective, I can power my 21cu.ft. top/bottom refridgerator (.8 amps/110v running, 1.2 max), 7 cu.ft freezer(.8amps running, 1.1 max, sump pump battery charger(1.3 amps), and my 2.8ghz p4 desktop computer with LCD all at the same time(1.1 amps), without getting to the max load rating.The quality of this unit puts the cheap-o's to shame.

Our neighbor has built our kids a big swing set but doesn't have typical dimensions. So, this was the closet thing I could find. Turns out, it falls a little short and is a tad too wide. However, I'm not going to give it a bad review because it doesn't fit the necessary dimensions we need. It is of great quality, tough, think, and has great grommet support at the corners! We've decided to keep the tarp, despite not being able to use it for what it was intended for. Based on some other reviewers, we are going to try and use it for an outdoor viewing screen! We can host some great BBQ and a movie parties this summer and use that as the screen. It's a true white so there shouldn't be any issue with viewing the movies. Also, there was some sort of film or residue on the tarp after opening it, which I am assuming is stuff to keep it from sticking to itself. That though, it minor in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read","review":"The author draws his audience into a subject he is obviously passionate about. The origins of North Korea's personalty cults are explained as well as their Juche philosophy in a clear, easily understood way. Defector interviews add first-hand experience to the story.This is a long book - over 700 pages - but it's a very good read and will add to anyone's knowledge of North Korea. An enjoyable and informative book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough, thorough, thorough","review":"Everyone here has pretty much covered what the book is about. But it's so well-referenced - more than 100 pages of endnotes. There seemed to still be some aspects of North Korean life Mr. Martin was unable to access, but it's about as good as any Westerner will likely be able to do. The Kims are generally portrayed as crazy in the media at large, particularly Kim Jong-il. The book illustrates how, while both men were and are very flawed, they seemed to know exactly what they were doing. One is left with the feeling Kim Jong-Il isn't going anywhere, but after that is anyone's guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"The standard reference","review":"This is the most comprehensive and insightful book about North Korea currently in the market. Martin has extensively researched and traveled the country. If you've been there, or you'd like to take a trip from the comfort of your armchair, Martin's book is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book, I have come across about North Korea","review":"An incredibly detailed study of North Korea today as told by a reporter who obviously has studied the subject in detail.It was fasinating to read how a political system can so twist a society.The only criticism, I would make is that many of the interviews could have been out out from the main book and put into the notes at the end as the book did tend to drag out a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under the Care of the Fatherly Reader","review":"Never did I think I would pick up a book on North Korea, nor one that is 800 pages long, but I could not put it down. Articulate, very readable and extremely informative, Martin does an excellent job of putting a human face on this little-known country. The complex emotions of its citizens: adulation, disgust, and hopelessness to a little hope reveal much. So little is known about East Asia, China included, this is a must read for anyone interested in Far East Asia and beyond."},{"rating":"2","title":"a truly excellent, nuanced book","review":"One can tell, while reading this book, that Bradley Martin has passion for the subject and has spent a great deal of time trying to capture the full story of North Korea. It starts with the founding of the state, describes the Korean War, then goes into detail about how Kim Il-Sung built the \\"Worker's Paradise\\" and how it all started to go so wrong. Along the way, it provides some great, detailed, and nuanced descriptions of the cult of personality, the structure of society, the famine, the evolution of policy in North Korea, the evolution in citizens' attitudes, and the sad dysfunctions of leadership and the culture at large.The book definitely is a bit scattershot, especially towards the end as Martin prints transcriptions of interviews he had with various defectors. But even then, the book is extremely readable and immensely interesting. Anyone who is at least a little bit interested in North Korea should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for a class on North Korea","review":"Using Brad's extensive, information-packed book as our textbook, my senior citizen class of quite worldly residents of the coast of Maine were captivated with the information. After the first week, four or five on them came up to me personally to say what a fascinating, excellent book I had chosen for their textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling insight into North Korea","review":"For anyone interested in North Korea, this is the book for you. The book starts by chronicling the history of modern day North Korea and the rise to power of Kim Il Sung and his son Kim Jong Il. The second section of the book contains numerous interviews conducted by the author with North Korean defectors. From lowly workers at the bottom of society to the high officials in the North Korean system, this book paints a clear picture inside this elusive regime. The book culminates in a section regarding the present and further situation in North Korea, with detailed accounts on the young Kim children.It's an absolutely fascinating read that even the casual reader will enjoy, and is an incredibly relevant read in today's world. Easily the most comprehensive book on North Korea available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't meet my expectations","review":"I thought, after reading the reviews, that this would be a book I could really appreciate.

You learn right away the one little screw won't hold it aligned and it flexes in the middle of a cut changing a circle into an oval. Tightening further just pulled the screw head thru not allowing it to tighten at all! I finally had to drill holes and put TWO bolts thru it with wing nuts to make it work at all.

Excellent.","review":"Two words: great reading.If you've ever enjoyed the hallowed pastime of sitting around a campfire telling ghost stories, then this book is for you. These urban legend-style tales will chill your blood. While some are simply catalysts for meaningful reflection on life's complexities (Father and Son, Inc.; The Dying Man) others pack a powerful punch that will leave you breathless (The Roomie; Tickles).I was convinced to get my hands on Black Raspberries after reading a free sample story from the collection titled The Room, a spooky little journal-entry vignette about a man inexplicably imprisoned in a room with no windows or door who does not remember how he got there.

There are many well crafted sentences about the spiritual life, how to surrender into trusting God to take care of your life, about the hidden saints who help our life on Earth work, how to use our free choice, how to live in community with others, how to relate to believers and nonbelievers, how to handle being falsely accused, and how to be humble with power. You can taste a whole way of life behind the story which might be worth living or open it at random and find some messages that relate to challenges we meet in daily life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story, But Gets Maudlin at the End","review":"I remember reading this book from a 1980's edition. The illustrations were all in black & white. I liked this version of the Golem because it give a background into Jewish life in Prague in the Middle Ages, and how the Jews were pretty much at the mercy of the local populace and how the Jews were required by law to be second-class citizens.My problem with the book is the last chapter, where the wife uses the Golem for some far-out treasure hunting project, breaking the \\"safety mechanism\\" in the Golem (in the original story the Rabbi just gets careless and uses the Golem for \\"help\\"). The part where the servant falls in love with the \\"evolving\\" Golem was silly. The story doesn't need a romantic subplot, and I can't see a love-struck teenage girl being attracted to a large clay statue.Nonetheless, the illustrations are great and any kid who likes Harry Potter ought to like this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly slow response, fabulous tone and resonance","review":"These strings are some of my favourites. They're rich, full, and warm. Slightly slower response time, so if you're trying to play that crazy flight of the bumblebee song, use something else. If you want a beautiful rendition of Jesu, joy of Man's Desiring, these are great! Crisp enough for fairly fast playing, but they are a bit slower than, say, Thomastik Dominants. They also don't change pitch as much as true gut strings with variations in temperature and humidity, and they're fairly stretchy -- so tuning takes more turns/hz than steel core strings.

Jody Marken(Brittany Murphy)is the main character in the film and you guessed it is a virgin, she is the daughter of the towns sherrif Brent Marken(Michael Biehn)and decides not to wait around till the killer strikes again but instead to launch her own investigation to figure out the killer's identity and discovers a few twist on the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tame disappointment...","review":"Okay, so the DVD box and some of the reviews I read claim that this version of \\"Cherry Falls\\" contained footage \\"they couldn't show you on cable.\\" Where is it?? Tame by any slasher fan's standards, this film takes a titillating idea (serial killer stalks virgins, so town's teenagers have a big orgy to save themselves) and makes it into a big yawn. The plot developments are laughable, the characters are cardboard cutouts, and the villian couldn't scare Miss Muffet. Not enough gore, not enough scares, not enough sex, and not enough production talent by half.

Even if you do not have a yoga practice or intend to give birth at home, it is worth its weight in gold, just for the birth stories. It is so very important for women to have exposure to birth stories and images that will provide a contrast to the frenzy and chaos that is widely shown in/on popular media as being a normal part of the birth experience. Somehow, the truth that only an extremely small number of babies being birthed need anything AT ALL besides calm loving parents, a warm, dimly lit room, and theperfect nourishment of their mother's breast is usuallyforgotten.

What I did not like was that the answer, the only answer, is to birth absent of trust and interdependence within the community, and her constant mantra that self-suffienciency was the sign of a true and mature adult.A Note to Jewish readers: this woman claims to be a Jew ending a cycle of violence by not circumscising her son(s), yet in the prayer to conceive him, she and her husband pray to not only more than ONE G-d, but also to Jesus.

But finally my dad and I went to go see it the opening weekened. It was a really enjoyable movie. In my opinion it was not scary, but very well done and Dakota Fanning was exccelent. I liked the whole plot, I mean the movie could have gone to a ghost story to a monster movie, but instead it went in the best direction it could have. There definently was some creepy parts and the ending was intense and made you think at the end. The reason this was a four star movie because I had seen the ending before in another movie and that the red herrings didn't fool me for one second even though they tried. The whole movie I was on the edge of my seat wondering \\"how is this going to end\\". But don't let the ending stop you from going. Its a good ending just one you have seen before. Go see it and enjoye your self."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"This video had no sound and when I contacted Amazon, they admitted their was a technical problem with it.

I thought the ending was really weird though. It had me scared a little bit and I never get scared. It was a great twist on the other hand. I definitely recommend it.

He kills innocent people and goes after Dakotta Fanning. But is he really made up, or is somebody hiding something?That is for you to find out. But it was a little to weird for my taste.

This pretends to be a horror movie, then reveals itself to be a psychological piece, and never once scares, surprises, thrills, or engrosses anyone I personally know who has seen it. It's sadder than it is suspenseful, and in the end such a painful waste of time I was astonished that it ever got made, let alone made with the participation of the big names it lists in a sallow (s-a-l-l-o-w) effort at validation.So thinly plotted was Hide and Seek that it can be sketched out in haiku form, condensing two irretrievable hours of viewing time to five seconds.Ready, kiddies?Mom--tub-based death scene;Dad and girl move to country;Playmate---real?---kills lots!Yep, that's about it, folks...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This movie wasn't what I expected. It moved along at a decent pace with supernatural undertones, but took a sudden turn that I should have expected but didn't, which caught me by surprise.Dakota Fanning gave a sublime performance and De Niro had a couple of really creepy moments that were 180 degrees from the understated performance he started out with.

I can't think of anything worth writing about this movie, except maybe,just maybe, if you looked at it for decorating ideas then perhaps that's all HIDE AND SEEK has to offer, other than that ITS a bait and switch. Robert DeNiro what were you thinking? He's a fabulous actor,but this must have been embarressing for him, if not well then I am for him and for every other actor in it. HIDE AND SEEK was truely a waste of time, instead I could have been cleaning the toilet . Wait till it hits the TV or let some body else rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst of the year","review":"I saw this movie, because of the buzz over the shocking ending that supposedly was delivered as a seperate reel to movie theaters a day before it was released to keep the ending a secret. What a big waste. Deniro, and fanning are great actors, and i have no idea why they were in this film, or why this movie was even made. If you've seen secret window, or fight club, you've seen this movie. The ending takes forever, but it it so obvious. If you have half a brain, you can figure this movie out in the first 20 minutes. I figured it out, and unfortunately i was correct. Just a horrible, horrible waste. So obvious, and boring. Dont waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmmmmmm","review":"Interesting reading the reviews of this. Sounds like everyone was expecting on Oscar caliber movie. I guess I've learned never expect too much from previews to a movie.I wasn't expecting a great movie and was pleasantly surprised. It was a pretty good thriller. Robert DeNiro and Dakota Fanning are great as usual. I really don't want to give away anything about the movie. I'll just say it's about a father and daughter who have lost the wife/mother and move out to the country to try and pick up the pieces of their life. Unfortunately some strange things start happening. It's a little creepy at times and gets pretty exciting the last half hour. On DVD or HBO I would definetely give this movie a look see."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Hide And Seek\\" is suspenseful!","review":"\\"Hide And Seek\\" is suspenseful!

On of the worst movies of 2005."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative GAZILLION stars","review":"I'm going to keep this short and sweet. You need a brain transplant if you like this movie or didn't get mad watching it. Everyone who sees this should be hopping up and down in fury like a rabid monkey, pointing at the screen going \\"Oh my god! That was horrible! I can't believe this!\\"Here's the bottom line: If it's 'horror', and Robert DeNiro is in it, it's bad. I've been suckered enough by his presence(\\"The Godsend\\") in a thriller and this is it, I'm done with him in this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Seek' this movie.","review":"First off, I'm not going to give away the plotline or alternate endings because that isn't fair to those that have yet to see the movie. It spoils everything. Let me just say that this movie is definitely worth seeing. I was hesitant because of the reviews I read here, but this is not worth the horrible comments people have been leaving. Dakota and Robert show some good acting here, they both give an element of creep to the movie by the way they deliver their dialogue. I was interested the entire time, I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen (I didn't read any spoilers) It's great that there are four alternate endings for the movie as well, it gives the viewer a different angle for each of the ideas that weren't used for the original. I would give this DVD more like four and a half stars. It wasn't perfect, but it sure makes a heck of a psychological thriller to me, even if the plotline has been seen before."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOOKS GREAT BUT LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING!","review":"Proof that almost anything billed as a scary movie can succeed at the box office. Robert De Niro loses his wife and Dakota Fanning loses her cute-as-a-button demeanor in this utterly forgettable fright flick. De Niro plays a widower whose daughter has a sinister \\"imaginary friend\\" that comes with a body count. The DVD includes a making-of featurette and 14 deleted or extended scenes, four alternate endings among them. Director John Polson and screenwriter Ari Schlossberg offer commentary for the full movie and the deleted sequences.There are very few scares here. Not a terrible movie but a good time waster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boogeyman tops hide and seek , Constantine tops both","review":"Not worth the hype at all.This movie was dragging for the longest.I was disappointed that I didn't go and see Boogeyman.People , just wait till it comes out for rent.It's not worth $ 7.25 to sit in a uncomfortable chair for an hour in a half and watch a non-scary movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I enjoy watching this movie.

Bet you will be wondering.","review":"This is a great horror film and it's not cheesy like most similar types of movies. I don't want to say anything to give the movie away so I will make it short. I have to say this is one of the most unpredictable movies that I have ever seen. Robert De Niro and Dakota Fanning were both very believable characters. I bet you can't predict the ending! I would highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or effort","review":"This film is blatanly obvious. There is no real suspense or mystery surrounding the plot. It's quite a shame that Robert De Niro would be involved in something like this. Dakota Fanning is a wonderful actress for her age and this film does not do her justice. It is a shame, really. This film does not scare, thrill or satisfy. I would stay away if you have not already watched it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly weak","review":"Dakota Fanning is the best child actress in Hollywood but even she can't save this movie. Robert DeNiro is a legend but he just seemed all wrong for this part. I never once saw him as a father and his character seemed to treat the daughter as more of an experiment than anything else. A lot of things happen in this movie that defy logic. If your little girl suddenly started looking like she's been to hell and back would you scratch your head and spend hours writing in your journal?The character of Elizabeth Shue was ridiculous. I've seen women move in on widowers before but this characer behaved like a she'd just found the last man on earth.When the twist came things picked up a bit but the climax and the little coda at the end were lame in the extreme. Hide and Seek isn't worth buying. In fact, unless your video store is offering a rent-one-get-one free sale, it's not even worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid!","review":"Im a monster fan not a horror fan but i gave this a try but it stunk there was no Charlie dont watch this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Blue State Fairy Tale","review":"This movie is really a fairy tale in disguise--and like all fairy tales, it communicates an important moral. The moral of this story is that its not advisable for highly educated, urban elites (played by DeNiro) to move out to the country (e.g., Red State land). If you do, then you will almost certainly loose touch with reality, become a psychotic basket case, terrorize your children & neighbors. The end result is that your more stable, Blue-state friends (who had the good sense to stay in the city) will have to put you out of your misery when they come to \\"help\\" you. As a result of seeing this movie, I plan to move back to a blue-state, post haste, before this happens to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"They did it again. (sigh)","review":"I've seen this before. What immediately comes to mind is What Lies Beneath. They are so much alike that they even have quirky couples of the same kind living next door to misdirect you. The only blessing is that Dakota Fanning pretty much keeps her mouth shut throughout the film. I really hope that Amy Irving will be given a more prominent role in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert DeNiro is Charlie!!!!

This movie is a lot like Secret Window..rip off!! i'm just glad i got to see this for free..CLICHE after cliche in this one..worst storyline ever..i just can't believe DeNiro read this and thought it was good...Save your $$ ..this movie should have went straight to dvd....terrible. the one star is for Dakota Fanning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of My Time and Netflix Postage !!!!","review":"I received this movie the other day as a Netflix film. I am glad I didn't have to pay for the return postage or it would be in the trash. This is one of the worst, if not the worst thriller I have ever seen. How in the world can a movie starring both De Niro and Dakota Fanning be so horrible? I am still amazed. This movie is worthless!! This will be a scar on the careers of both De Niro and Fanning. First of all if it would have been for netflix I would have never finished the movie. I tried to watch numerous time and each time I fell asleep. I NEVER fall asleep during a movie!! This movie does not develop as a good thriller should. It doesn't bait you, it has no twist. Finally in the end your left thinking \\"that is one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen\\".

It hasn't. Watch it and see:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprising Ending? There's A Whole Load Full Of Similar Movies Like This.","review":"The actors are great, only problem is that the movie didn't ultilize their full potential. As in surprise ending, predicted it in the beginning and firmed my prediction after 30 minutes. Nowadays audience are harder to trick, more or less I suppose, because of the many movies out now. Most ideas that movies base themselves on, plots, settings, etc are already taken in past movies. Its very hard finding originals nowadays and still there's no definate originals even if they try. I'm already seeing a limit to songs as it is. Nowadays, people just remake songs over again to bring it back, other words? They're running out of ideas.I did sort of got scared in some parts, but again its just the surprise and not really anything else.You should watch this if you want to know whats it about etc, because its not a HORRIBLE and totally time wasting movie since they do have to great actors in there, its just not all that great. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"DeNiro and Fanning are better than this!","review":"Thank god I waited for this on cable. Horror movies these days just aren't scarey. They think if they throw in a little kid saying some creepy things that don't make sense until the end, and have some writing on the walls in blood, it makes for a good thriller. That is just not the case. This movie did exactly that and was not at all scarey. Not to mention it totally stole its ending from The Sixth Sense, which actually was a good thriller. Dakota Fanning and Robert DeNiro are such talented actors, what are the doing starring in this crap!? Don't see this if your expecting a scarey movie, it's really weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst De Niro film in years","review":"This film was very irritating in that it attempted to create suspense without a real plot. The acting was good, but the storyline was just poorly developed and it almost seemed that the people making the film really didn't know where to go with it. Is that why there were 4 or 5 alternate endings? And none of the alternate endings were any better than the original one.If this film cost $3 million to make, I'd bet De Niro probably got $2.5 million, the other actors split most of the rest, leaving nothing for the script writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"You stole my story!\\"","review":"The performance by Dakota Fanning is what gives this completely unoriginal flick two stars.

Rent this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW, was I dissappointed with this movie","review":"I'll be quick and to the point, which the movie was not. It was horrible.

Like The Ring, you are sitting there wondering what is really going on as you watch the movie. The whole time as I was watching it, one question would always come to mind. \\"Who is Charlie?\\" because you know that he's not 'just' an imaginary friend, created from the mind of a child. He's real. And closer than you think. You have to see this movie. Brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"What is this? Or better yet, what was it supposed to be? This is not scary. What is scary is how DeNiro's career must be on the down slide. This movie is so stupid.

Stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow this was great, when I saw it in 99 when it was called Fight Club.","review":"Ok, let's get serious. This movie is a waste of time and money. If you've seen Fight Club you've seen Secret Window and Hide and Seek.. Different actors, same story. Sure they changed a few things around, like location. But that's about it. In all honesty I wish you could sue Hollywood for putting this crap out. It's completely unoriginal. I have a good belief system now anyways. If it isn't directed by Kevin Costner, Clint Eastwood, or Mel Gibson. It's nothing but a waste of money. What is seriously sad is, I was just messing with my girl and said \\"Watch this movie be exactly like fight club and secret window\\" five minutes into it. I then made the prediction that Robert DeNiro had split personalities and that he was Charlie. Wow. I was right. I gave this 1 star just because it had Robert DeNiro in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A slow moving,dark mysterious film.","review":"The first 20 minutes or so didnt seem very good but as i got into it, i found it quite a good film.

Dakota was really good, but Denero didn't seem to fit the role. Movies like this usually throw up false leads and then tie them together with the ending. Too many of the leads in this movie turned out to be nothing but false. There were too many loose ends. The basic idea for the ending was good but it's already been done and done better. If your a big fan of movies like the Sixth Sense and Stir of Echoes, this one would be good to watch just for comparitive purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another waste of talent...","review":"Both actors are great, just not in this movie. I do believe they were hoping for a movie along the lines of Sixth Sense or The Others, it didn't happen. I kept hoping it would get better but it failed there, and the suprise ending, really wasn't much of a surprise.

This is 90 minutes of your life you don't want to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth seeking","review":"I have a list of plot twist cliches that Hollywood, or any filmmaker should avoid like the plague if they want to make a movie worth watching.1)It turns out the hero is stuck in a limbo between life & death2)The hero has multiple personalities (at least one of which is also the main villain)3)The whole story is a dream.4)The hero is really a ghost and doesn't know it.Just in case anyone reading this is actually interested in watching Robert DeNiro destroy his career by acting in his 2nd bad \\"thriller\\" in as many years (\\"Godsend\\" was anything but), I won't tell you which cliche is used here. Odds are you'll figure it out yourself in 30 minutes or so of watching this movie.This movie is also emblematic of why people have been staying away from the theaters in droves & are now evading the video stores. There is nothing fresh to offer.And lets face it, on a hot summer day there is nothing less enjoyable than sitting and watching mold grow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where have I seen this before?","review":"This movie was a big disappointment for me. I had been in the mood for a good scary movie and this looked like it might be the one. But not very far into the movie I started getting a sense of deja vu. I recognized this plot. This was pretty much the same thing as the Secret Window. Personally, I would rater be watching that movie again because at least it has Johnny Depp in it. All in all it wasn't that scary. It had a few moments that made me jump, but I expected more out of it. The main reason I didn't like it was because I had it figured out a half an hour into the movie. But if you haven't seen Secret Window you just might like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy!!!","review":"This was good...another must see. A good rental.

He and his daughter played by Dakota Fanning move to upstate New York. It doesn't take long for weird things to start happening. For a psychologist I found it odd that De Niro's character seemed to have little insight into his daughter's psychological issues and seemed at a loss with how to deal with her apparent imaginary friend. Little things like that make films less believeable. Quite frankly Dakota Fanning's talent is the only reason to watch this film. You're likely to be disappointed and very unsurprised at the so-called twist at the end of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hide and Seek is neither fun nor scary...just plain dumb","review":"Robert De Niro (Meet The Fockers, Meet The Parents) brings his daughter, Dakota Fanning (the upcoming War Of The Worlds, Man On Fire) to a uptsate country house after Fanning's mother takes her own life. Soon after they move in Fanning starts to tell her dad of her imaginary friend named Charlie. De Niro starts to become more and more worried about his daughter and strange things happen. The end is another one of those twist endings we all love....sometimes. I think De Niro and Fanning did a good job though this movie is neither scary nor suspenseful...it has its moments.

Honestly, how long can we carry on this story line for? How rich does LaHaye want to get on the back of a Christian story. The first book was not bad, but with each sequel, the story became more diluted. That takes us to this book. In the name of George Lucas, LaHaye has written the great atrocity of a prequel. Not enough steaks on your plate? So in the prequel, all of the characters are still alive, but the world is going down the tubes. Really, do need to read this book to know what happens? I knew the story before I read it, not I feel like crucifying myself for spending the money. Enjoy the meal I bought you Mr. LaHaye for paying $20 for this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the point of this book?","review":"The Rising was an okay novel- as far as prequels go-, but all it really does is show you how Nicolae Carpathia came about and tells you a little bit about Rayford Steele when he was younger. There wasn't much excitement and the book could have been written in half the length it was. As far as I can see, this book will only be enjoyed by the hardcore Left Behind readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rising","review":"After reading the entire Left Behind series this book answered many of the questions concerning the origin of Nicholae Carpathia, the Anti-Christ. The book illustrates how easily someone can be influenced into believing he or she is all powerful. An entertaining read as well as educational, making me aware of political influences we see even today."},{"rating":"1","title":"the rising","review":"I believe Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye are milking the interest generated by the the Left Behind series. They should allow this topic to go quietly into the night. Instead of promoting the message of the gospel which is salvation of one's soul, they are promoting the greed, materialism, and pride of the world. We as Christians have enough to overcome with our faith without having obstacles placed before us by our own brothers in Christ. Swallow you pride fellas and find a different topic to write about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"With great enthusiasm I bought this book, hoping for a continuation of the \\"Left Behind series.\\" Wrong! This book was boring and a waste of my money. To be fair I must say, a few chapters were somewhat entertaining when dealing with the explanation of the creation of the soon to be little devil. I am being very generous by giving this review one star, but there is no other option."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am very disappointed with the chronological direction!","review":"I was so looking forward to book XIV advancing the characters into the Millennial Kingdom (Christ's 1000 year reign on earth) but, instead, the reader was thrown back in time to the early lives of the \\"Left Behind\\" characters. The first book failed to inspire me. The second book has been left unread and untouched for months now in my bookcase. Oh the heights thou has fallen Mr. LaHaye and Mr. Jenkins. My impression is that you have ceased to care about the reader and are more interesting in churning out Christian pulp fiction for profit and fame. Even Mr. LaHaye's introduction to the first book of the \\"Babylon Rising\\" series seems to beg and plead for the book's success. I highly enjoyed that series but why plead? Let your work stand or fall on its own merit.Please, gentlemen, let's see the progression of the \\"Left Behind\\" characters and not a regression. Let's advance the characters into the Millenium! Now, I am the one who is pleading. :"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good God!...","review":"LaHaye and Jenkins are beyond greedy...Please let this series go away...The writing is beyond poor...The series could and should have been done in no more than 3, count 'em, 3 books..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read this book as quickly as I had the other 12 left behind books. But this time I was reading quickly not because I was engaged in the action and excited by the characters but because I was wondering where the story was going to get good. I found the background provided on the characters to be pretty inconsequential. It didn't really shed any light on who they were when \\"left behind\\" began. Rayfords past felt irrelevant and Nicolae's past- while disturbing- was not surprising. A main character from the 12 original books is not even mentioned in this prequel and I was really looking for him. Glad I got it from the library and did not buy. If I wanted to share my excitement over this series with someone I would certainly have them start with \\"Left Behind\\"- book 1- not this prequel for fear they would not be interested in continuing with the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Christ Conspiracy or The Suns of God","review":"This story is getting a little tired and drawn out.

(just curious where in John's Book of Revelation they got that from....)I tried reading it, I really did. But I like plots that are actually sensible, characters that have at least TWO dimensions if not three, and written as if the author actually knew how to write a book. I guess some people, apparently millions, don't really care how terribly written a book is.however, I will tip my hat to the authors, they've figured out how to make millions of dollars. Write crappy books geared towards right-wing Christians who hate the UN and you'll make millions....I'll start working on mine now..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The barrel has officially been scraped.","review":"Bad bad bad. Bad theology(These books are VERY anti- Catholic)and bad writing. And yet they have such a HUGE following.Why? And why is there a need for prequel books to let us in on what happened BEFORE the Rapture. I REALLY hope that LaHaye and Jenkins aren't planning on stretching these books out as long as they did with the original Left Behind series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost as good as the National Enquirer!","review":"The Left Behind endless saga started with a bang but then went on, and on, and on, and on, and on, ad nauseam. The dreadfully inane writing of \\"Left Behind\\" - particularly that found in the last half of the series was so embarrassing that I can't imagine why anyone would want to buy any further books from this money-making scam. There are absolutely no other books in the \\"religious\\" genre, other than the Book of mormon (that was clearly written by a lunatic), or the Purpose Drivel merchandising scam that even comes close to the insipid Left Behind Series.To be honest, I just returned from the grocery store and almost had to go back and buy some expectorants when I saw \\"The Rising\\" on sale at the checkout stand. The only positive thing I can glean from that experience is that this book was located, appropriately, next the National Enquirer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rising is a disappointment","review":"I really liked the Left Behind series and looked forward to reading the new prequel\\"The Rising\\", but this book was definitely a disappointment for several reasons. The character development was slow and tedius, and by the time the book picked up the pace there was little interest in what happened to the characters. We are to assume that since this book takes places years before the Rapture that the timing is probably during the 1960's, but the characters have all the modern technology that exists now, such as the cell phone, computers, email,etc. It was distracting and odd that the authors would do this. I found Nicolae to be a totally ridiculous and unbelievable character, and in the end think that it would have been better to have left his childhood to our imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT spend your money!","review":"I read the entire Left Behind series and ejoyed it very much. It was fast moving & very interesting. This book, on the other hand, was extremely slow and boring. I purchased it on CD. The unabridged recorded book containes 9 CD but half way into disc 4 I quit. In addition to the VERY slow story, the reader is dull and lifeless. If you completed the Left Behind series consider the last book THE END. Don't spend your money on The Rising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent series","review":"Best series ever!! I recommend it to all. You don't have to be a religious nut to love this series.

The first two were fairly intriguing but the rest I was only able to browse thru after relatives finished. I tried to give this one a chance but I would say \\"The Omen\\" was a better plotted book on the same theme and is probably as near to the truth on what will actually happen at the end of days as the LB series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing beginning to a disappointing conclusion...","review":"When I first began reading the Left Behind series, it was so rich with adventure, and really got me interested in the Bible and its teachings. Unfortunately, as time went on and the subsequent sequels released, I lost interest fairly quickly, but kept reading to find out what happened to the characters. The end of the series, 1/2 scripture 1/2 novel, was cheesy. But I figured since it was a prequel, it had a good shot of being pretty good. The writing was unprofessional and predictable (a family so religious it scares Rayford? go figure) and the character development actually had me disliking Rayford through most of the book. And the side-story of Nicolae's mother and Nicolae's birth and raising was really unnecessary. Overall, it felt like filler and now it's confirmed: they're going to milk as much wealth out of this series as they can, even if that means ruining it forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagining the Unseen","review":"Frank Peretti disturbed the inspirational publishing industry with novels that saw the unseen spiritual forces at work. Jerry Jenkins does the same in this prequel, reminding us that what we see isn't all that's going on. The conception of bad-guy Nicolai, though sanctified imagination, makes you think. However history will eventually happens,invisible forces, good and bad, will be at work. Jerry's end-time novels repeatedly make that point."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rollicking Good Time","review":"A wonderful rendition of a superb opera in the classical tradition. Superb staging and excellent interpretations of the characters by a cast who very obviously loved what they were doing. The artists are having great fun, and that is what drives this opera.I had reservations about the \\"serious\\" music of a comic opera. No more! Outstanding vocal combinations.Knoxville Opera performed \\"Il Barbiere\\" this spring, and took the stock references of the traditional performance and instead made mimed references to Elvis, M Jackson, YMCA, Kiss, \\"the Karate Kid,\\" pole dancing, and so much more ... no change in music, but only in the mimed, frozen scenes. The audience was howling. I have never had so much fun at a performance.This opera is so open to contemporary references ... it is timeless. I'll take it with Rossini's references to his own times, and take it with a wonderful maestro's reference to our own times. Works either way, and the music is timeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music but a poor production","review":"I was disappointed with this DVD!As soon as I saw the overture with a young, stiff, seemingly terrified Claudio Addado at the conductors podium I got uneasy vibes. Then, the fact that the production was a movie did little to reassure me. Add to this, that the audio was lip-synced to the video (and rather poorly at that) further downgraded my enthusiasm for this production.The characters had costumes that were overdone and seemed, to me, to add very little to the intended comic effect. The comedy, in fact, seemed to be almost slapstick at times: contrived, not to mention chaotic.So, were there no redeeming features to this production? Yes, the music of Rossini: wonderful tunes, good voices and the orchestrated aspect of the opera was well done despite the above mentioned distractions.But surely there must be a better Barber of Seville on DVD out there somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think this is the worst barber I've ever heard","review":"Herman Prey lacks of enthusiam an carisma for the role of Figaro.

The printing is very large, which can be useful, but I would have preferred smaller font and a smaller book. My biggest problem with this book is that it didn't have the words useful for travelling (such as reservation), which rendered it almost completely useless for me. It has an example sentence of how to use each word (I am no judge as to the correctness of these sentences), which probably would be useful for learning the language, but not to someone who just wanted to be able to get around Italy. If you are looking for a companion for travel, I've had good luck with the Cortina Dictionary Series (German and French). I definitely cannot recommend this book for travelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality of language and editing","review":"I found the dictionary to be very well organized and clear to read for high school students.

Dismas Hardy and Abe Glitsky seem depressed and burned out. It seemed neither one wanted to do anything about anything.

This book focuses on police corruption and an attack on Hardy's longtime mentor David Freeman. Less a legal thriller than other books in the series, this books notches up the action in which the Hardy and Glitsky face several tough choices that will factor in books to follow.This is great reading, and well worth a four star rating.

But the excitingpromise is never reached. The author spends so much time tryingto be \\"politically correct,\\" his personal goals get in the wayof a good story, and the book is disappointing.Only for a few, so be careful about how much time you put intothis one."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! DO NOT READ the first 4 pages of part one","review":"In The First Law Lescroart did NOT separate the prologue from Part One. Therefore he gives the ending away. And between that and the first few pages of the real beginning of thebook everything is given away. The criminals, their targets, their motivations and their MOs. No mystery left.I never read prologues for that very reason. I do NOT want to know the ending or anything for that matter before it actually happens. I'm disinclined to read further. What a waste of mymoney. I'm Disgusted!So DO NOT READ the first 4 pages of Part One. As reviewer Tucker Andersen states as a consequence of this unannounced prologue, \\"Thus, there is never any real mystery of whothe murderers and criminals are...\\" So what's the motivation of reading further? Lescroart's writing is not that hot to where I'll read it regardless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not His Best","review":"I have enjoyed the Dismas Hardy/Abe Glitsky series of books very much. This one however, although containing all the characters left a lot to be desired. As others have said, the prologue pretty much tells you where this book is going and then it seems to take forever to get there. Having made the trek you are left wondering if it was worth the effort. The first law may be survival, but the way it is portrayed in this novel leaves a bad taste in the mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packs an Emotional Wallop","review":"One of the most thought provoking and emotional novels I've read in a long time. I agree with some of the other reviewers -- it's about time a novalist who can write with as much substance as flare surfaced in contemporary fiction. The story starts off a little slow, but once you hit about the 75th page, you find yourself on a roller coaster that won't quit. A novel of crime and intrigue and revenge with totally unpredictable and immaginative plot twists. You honestly don't know the whys or the whos untill the last chapter, and then they fall into your mind like the last piece of an amazing puzzle to reaveal a very, very cool story. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven's Wager","review":"Ted Dekker has rapidly become my favorite author. Heaven's Wager cannot be put down once picked up. It is powerful and intriguing. When it's over, you'll want to take a few days and just continue to soak it all in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands above mere fiction","review":"If you understand what the author is doing (I got there about mid point on this novel) you cannot help but to find inspiration in Dekker's mastery of fiction. Heaven's Wager is a great story the gains steam as it goes along and ends with a bang, but its the truth behind the story that lingers and that, to me, is its real beauty. You can hardly compare this with a Grisham novel because it reaches far beyond simple entertainment to a treatment that which is beyond. In fact, if you have no sensitivity to that which is beyond, you probably won't find this novel as gripping as I did.The fiction out on the street tends to blur together at times -- everyone retelling the same old stories with new characters. It's so refreshing to read something that engages on a different level. I'm halfway through Dekker's newest novel which he co-authored with Bill Bright. It's even better. Thank God for new writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"Life was going well for Kent Anthony. He was happy married with a great son, and he had just finished the project of his career at work, which should earn him a multi-million dollar bonus. Out of the blue, his perfect world is slowly stripped away. While he goes about plotting his revenge, his mother-in-law Helen starts praying for his soul. But will her prayers be enough to reach Heaven?This book starts out very strong with some great writing, and I was quickly drawn into the story. However, part way through, it lost its way. After page 150, I had the basic plot figured out. Any surprises I figured out pages before they happened. And the climax was incredibly weak; it left me shaking my head instead of emotionally drawn in like I should have been.This book rates two stars because of it's great beginning. It's unfortunate that the rest of the book couldn't live up to the promise contained in those first pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good read....but good theology?","review":"So, a modern Job story? A story that displays God's sovereignty? I agree it was a good book. I thought about it when I wasn't reading it. I couldn't put it down when I was. But do you all freely agree with his theology? Just because it's in a fiction book do you think that God really works that way? Job was a God-fearing man. His ungodly children died...b/c of Satan. I don't remember a time in the Bible that God killed off a bunch of Christians so that an ungodly man would turn to him. Just because an author can craft a great book doesn't mean he's always right."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Age God but but theme stupid","review":"The majority of this \\"Christian\\" novel could have almost been written as a New Age one, with the people feeling in contact with the Universe or whatever.It's the theme that stinks: someone \\"up there\\" really cares and does terrible things to you to make you love Him.What really made this theme all the more stupid was, just after I finished the book, a TV program came on where a grandfather had beat his children and grandchildren & had incest with them for years until they killed him.Are we supposed to believe these terrible things are to make you love Him, too? With a \\"God\\" like this one, I don't need Satan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very detailed book with a good ending.","review":"This is the first book i've read from Ted Dekker and overall I enjoyed the book. It goes into a lot of details during the book and at times the reading seemed long but after you get into storyline you really feel what the author is getting at. The last third of the book was great and I was unable to put it down. I always enjoy finding good Christian Fiction books, and this is no exception. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a good story where God's Power shines, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story With Spiritual Dynamics Throughout","review":"Heaven's Wager combines suspense, intrigue and spiritual warfare into a compelling novel.The protagonist, Kent Anthony, loses everything he holds near and dear, much like Job of the Old Testament. Unlike Job, Kent was not a believer at the time. The losses in his life pushed him further away from God. In spite of that, God keeps working on him in a variety of ways.The spiritual battle rages on while the other human events of the book play out.It all combines into a page turner story. I have read several of Dekker's novels. Every one of them has been very good. This is no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent war story over a man's soul","review":"This was my first Ted Dekker book. Everyone kept telling me that I should read Dekker because he is a beautiful writer and his stories are compelling and thought-provoking. It seems they were right.This book started with a bang and kept my attention to the very end. I did not feel it was a \\"page-turner\\" or a \\"gripping\\" novel. I have read much more suspenseful and captivating stories, which made me forget to go to sleep at night because I was so into the book. This book was not like that. But it is a heart-warming story about the fight over one man's soul.I will definately be reading more of Dekker's work. I am a new fan.

I picked this up because I loved the thought of the ex-teacher revealing the life of a former student through his memoirs and her memories. Too bad that isn't really the book. Elizabeth Stone uses Vincent as an excuse to write her own autobiography- and believe me, her story makes you long to hear Vincent's all the more. Perhaps his diaries were very vague or his family reticent of having his life detailed - both understandable. But, given that, there isnlt really a worthwhile project here. I got so bored that I kept skipping pages looking to find Vincent's story and all I really kept finding was hers. Ugh! A vanity project all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"author biographical","review":"While I really enjoyed \\"A boy i once knew\\" I wish it was more about the boy. The novel does follow the live of Vincent and his diaries but it lacks a true sense of who he was. Oh we get plenty about his life, where he went, and his death but I didn't connect with Vincent as much as I did with the AUTHOR. Now this isn't a bad thing at all. Overall the book is really great but I learned more about the author and I got to know her more than I did about the books main character. Was this intentional? I don't think so but if you haven't read the book yet, when you do, try to look at the bigger picture: a teachers own self exploration vicariously through her students' diaries. Very well written and again I enjoyed it very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"a boy i once knew....","review":"A large brown box appears on the doorstep of teacher, Elizabeth Stone's front door. Inside she would find the journals and inner workings of former student, former human being, former AIDS patient; Vincent.This book was extremely slow going. I felt that it asked too may questions and sort of implied the story rather than to tell it. Yes I am aware that Miss. Stone only had the journals as a reference yet I still believe this work could have been executed in a way as to end up with a much more impressive piece of writing.In reading \\"A Boy I Once Knew,\\" I also came across a variety of typos and errors thus proving the type of effort that went into the book.Stone also seemed to focus much more on her life than Vincent's, the one she meant to be preserved.When I look at this book as a whole I can't help but wonder if Vincent was made into the person he wanted the world to know.

If I hadn't seen the TV show then I would've hated this book. The author's style frequently alternates between bad poetry and abundantly annoying alliterations (see what I mean?!), the characters are flat, and the storyline goes in different (just stupid) directions than the series. If you've already seen the series then you may want to read \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\" just so you can imagine the actors acting out the scenes in the book and by comparison you'll have a better appreciation of how good the show really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Am a big fan of the TV Show and decided to read this series.

I would recommend reading it, then trying the show, or vice versa,Dexter: The First Season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rooting For the Bad Guy","review":"Dexter brings us a new and rather novel bad guy.

But a serial killer with a sense of morality, killing people who have otherwise escaped justice.He is a brilliant sociopath, a mix of the Lone rnager meets the Marquis de Sade, and yet thorughout you find yourslef wanting him to figure how he will deal with his secret and keep it hidden, while working through the problems he faces tracking killers and trying to be as normal as possible.It is different from the show (I have watched the first season of the show on DVD, and it is also good), and the differences makes it worthwhile to read even if you have seen the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"While the words are awkward at times, the Dexter character carries the book","review":"Darkly Dreaming Dexter comes off as awkward in places, as if the author is still searching for their voice, but the Dexter character is such an original delight that the sometimes-floundering passages are easily ignored.

There are of course many similarities to the show, but the books do a much better job at really capturing Dexter's personality and inner thoughts. Things that were subtly hinted at in the show come into much sharper focus in the book (such as LaGuerta's apparent crush on Dexter and his obvious discomfort), and the reader gains more insight into how Dexter ticks. The most enjoyable part of this book is that Dexter's wonderfully macabre sense of humor really gets a chance to shine. The plot doesn't run parallel to the show by any means, so it's more like an alternate adventure for Dexter. If you love the show and you love sarcastic wit, you will love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darkly Dreaming Dexter - Dream On.","review":"I fell in love with the Showtime series \\"Dexter\\" from the first episode. I was so impressed by the basic concept and Hall's brilliant portrayal of a CSU blood splatter expert being a serial killer - and perhaps the only one with a conscience. I was very happy to learn that the series was adapted from a book rather than directly screen story to screenplay. I rushed out to buy \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\" and settled in with anticipation of a great read. I was shocked to find the book devoid of the depth and characterizations found on the program, and that about 90% of the show's plot was the invention of Showtme's screenwriters. This book was so shallow, devoid of action with a plodding empty plot, lacked anything that could grab the reader's imagination - or interest, and had virtually no appeal. SticK with the Showtime series \\"Dexter\\" and forget the books in the 'DDD' titled Dexter series. A major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply Disappointing Dexter","review":"Having watched Dexter Season 1, I decided to read the source novel in preparation for Season 2 coming out on DVD. I was Deeply Disappointed. This is a readable page-turner and most of the core elements of TV Dexter are here, but the novel lacks the depth and wit of the TV adapation. The Dexter, Deb and Harry dynamic is the same and their whole backstory is here, but all the other characters are two-dimensional compared with the TV adaptation. Rita is introduced but falls away after a few appearances, LaGuerta is shallow, Doakes is shallower still, Angel is almost entirely missing, Rita's husband Paul is not here at all, and the character of the Ice Truck Killer / Tamiami Butcher is not well fleshed out (excuse the pun). The charm and personality of Dexter Morgan is present here, but much else is missing.

The Show was actually much better by far. I have yet to see the 2nd season, I am waiting for the dvd release. But I have moved on to the 2nd novel. It is a good read. Basically if you have to choose between the dvd or the book.

I found the strange, twisted life of Dexter Morgan increasingly interesting, so when i found out that it was based on a book, at the risk of spoiling either book or show or both, I read the book, Darkly Dreaming Dexter and was pleasantly surprised. The show followed the book just enough to maintain consistency, yet left the book to be a really good read. So good, I bought the second book, 'Dearly Devoted Dexter' and watched Dexter continue his downward? spiral. This book left me looking forward to both the next installment of the show and the next book.

I was simultaneously charmed by Dexter and bored by the plot. (The television show turned out much the same way.)Dexter is witty, charming, and manages to connect with the reader despite the fact that he's dead inside. Jeff Lindsay's character development with Dexter is brilliant and results in an engaging, endearing serial killer.The plot, conversely, is dull, tired, and uninspired. Not the worst thing I've ever read, but nothing to write home about. I was glad that the length of the book was relatively short -- and it still managed to seem endless at times.Ultimately, I would recommend the book with the caveat that the plot is something you have to get through in order to enjoy the company of Dexter for a few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"So True that the Ending Ruins It","review":"Sure the book had some stereotypical characters, but it was breezy and a quick read and Dexter did have some interesting observations about people and life.But the ending WAS implausible.

(I label Dexter that because he is a killer, albeit of people one could understand, for the sake of the story,need to be killed.) I bought the book for my Kindle because my teenage son had been bugging me to watch the t.v. show online. I thought he would enjoy the book, once we had established it wasn't based on the t.v. show.

The protagonist, or \\"hero,\\" if we can call him that, works as a splatter specialist for the police in Miami. He is also a serial killer that only kills \\"bad\\" people. I found the narrative voice extremely disturbing. This man feels no human emotion or attachment, and goes through life pretending to be human, as he puts it. He knows how to mimic normal human relationships. But every now and then, he has to kill someone. He finds other serial killers to kill. No matter how much this might make him a sort of \\"good guy,\\" the truth is that it would only be a matter of time before he feels compelled to kill someone else. I found it just so bleak. I did not like this hero. Having said that, I did find the story unusual and a worthy mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Dexter From \\"Showtime\\"","review":"I purchased this book thinking it would be a continuance of my beloved Dexter from the \\"Showtime\\" series. If you love blood and gore running rapid this may be for you. I like the characters and how they were established on the TV series. I didn't like the way his sister Deb was portrayed in the book; she knew that Dexter is a killer, how does that fit in with the story line? In this book Dexter doesn't kill his serial killer brother Brian; moreover, he watches as Brian kills LaGuerta, and in the end he lets his brother go. I like Showtime's Dexter character that follows Harry's code and I'll leave the books for those who like a more sinister, evil character."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least a good TV series came out of this","review":"I watched the first season of Dexter and couldn't wait to read the books that spawned it. I got the first two books out of the library and eagerly started reading number one. The sinking feeling came on page 8. This is the passage that caused me to despair.\\"No,\\" he said.\\"Yes,\\" I said.\\"Oh, no,\\" he said.\\"Oh, yes,\\" I said.He screamed, \\"NOOOO!\\"Despite this I continued on. The prose is fairly average. The characters are painfully stupid. Dexter only seems smart because everyone around him apparently flunked out of elementary school. The commentary on Miami traffic is actually kind of funny. It did have occasional tense moments, only spoiled by the fact that I couldn't bring myself to care what happened to anyone, not even the main character. On an amusing note, there is inadvertant homoerotic banter between Dexter and Masuoka. If you must read the book, see if you can find it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great character, low-quality read","review":"The Dexter character is great, and Showtime made him even better (deeper, funnier, more layers) than he is in the book.

It's weirdly fascinating and very clever. I laughed out loud on several occasions, but yet felt creepy doing so. It almost makes me nervous that the author seems to so thoroughly know a sociopath's thought pattern....eek!!

Well... yeah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh - Mostly Mediocre","review":"This is one of the rare cases where the TV show substantially outperforms the original material. I'm a fan of the Showtime series so I decided to pick up the book - bad idea. The writing is poor and the characterizations are thin to the point of transparency. Someone obviously saw the potential in this (admittedly, the concept of a serial killer preying on other serial killers is great) and turned it into a decent show, but the book was incredibly underwhelming. The show takes its time and fleshes out all the characters, while the book trots along at breakneck speed (and with twee prose) and wraps up unconvincingly.

The author has created such a memorable character, who we like in spite of ourselves--and he has such a distinctive voice. The story is told in the first person, and the story can admittedly get a bit flimsy sometimes. But it doesn't matter, because Dexter's distinctive declarations (sorry, couldn't resist) are so enjoyable. I could practically *hear* him speaking. And with such an original idea--the author pretty much turns this genre on it's head. I usually don't read crime novels, but made an exception for this. Now I'm looking forward to reading the next novel in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darkly Dreaming ending","review":"I bought this book after enjoying the TV series on Showtime. I thought the book and TV would be similar but different, and they are. I like the language the author uses, at least in the first 2/3 of the book. But the book gets just so far and then he hurries up to finish telling the story and the style goes out the window. It's like the author had a page limit he couldn't go past with this story. I've seen similar comments in reviews of the other Dexter books.I've also seen reviews that say the other books are equally similar to the TV show, I was hoping for something more in the books. I don't think I'll bother reading the rest of the Dexter books, but I will watch the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"The TV Show is Better","review":"If you are looking to read this book because you are hooked on the tv show, then you may be surprised. The book Dexter is a bit more cold and crazy, though still funny at times. What surprised me most is that the tv show was actually better than the book. I can't remember the last time (if ever) that I have come to that conclusion. The story is quite different, but a lot less things happen and before you know it. . . the book is over. I won't be giving away any spoilers, so you'll just have to find out for yourself. I would give the tv show a 5 star rating and the book a 4 star.The one thing I really hated about the book were the constant repetitive ramblings about the fact he is a killer and why he even bothers to pretend. Over and over pages are wasted saying the same thing. By book #2 I am just skipping over these pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter on the prowl","review":"Dexter is a serial killer mostly likely to bring you donuts. Blending in with the rest of the world is not difficult for him any more since he has been practicing all his life. With his camo in place and his other skills sharpened he is ready to take on Miami.I liked the book better than the recent TV show. Dexter has a great personality... a fake one anyway. The story is fast paced and hard to put down at times. The ending is well written although a bit telegraphed. I enjoyed it enough to buy the second in the series to see where it all leads."},{"rating":"2","title":"An original and engaging anti-hero","review":"Having been introduced to the show before even knowing there was a literary basis for it, I had high hopes for this book. I was not disappointed. Lindsay does a superb job of engaging us with his now iconic anti-hero, making Dexter a fully realized human being who is charming and repulsive in almost equal measure. Though some reviewers have expressed a preference for the televised version, I think this book makes a solid companion piece that will fit nicely on the shelf of any fan of the series. I'd also urge anyone who enjoys the deliriously twisted world of Dexter to check out Crimson Orgy, a new novel by Austin Williams that blends dark humor and jolting suspense/horror to great effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have seen the Showtime version first, you still won't be disappointed!","review":"I was nervous that reading the books after seeing the first two seasons of Dexter would ruin the book for me. Not so. They are done differently enough such that I was surprised with the ending. The books take off on a very different direction.I'm both a fan of the show and of these books. Very well written.Of course, you may find yourself disturbed that you find a serial killer more delightful that many humans, but that's just the chance you'll have to take."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissonant Dexter","review":"Dexter is a sociopath who isn't a sociopath. His moral compass is broken, but it is still there. I couldn't quite buy into the anomaly protagonist that the author tries to explain throughout the story, but at the same time I found the concept intriguing and full of potential.What I didn't find intriguing was the way the author makes almost every other major character in the story a bumbling fool. Perhaps it was to make Dexter shine even more in comparison, or maybe it was to frame the condescending (yet unemotional) perspective of Dexter? Whatever the reason, the story was ultimately a hard sell with such a cast of flaccid personalities.I am hoping that these shortcomings are something that Jeff Lindsay can overcome in future installments, because even with the lackluster initial release, I believe good storylines can be worked around Dexter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter - all round lovable guy and serial killer. A very original novel","review":"I have to admit I had never heard of this novel before I watched the TV series \\"Dexter\\". I then got this to see how different the literary source was from what I'd seen on TV - and the answer was - not as different as I'd thought it might be.I can see why this novel has attracted attention. It's a mystery novel that breaks the accepted boundaries of \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys\\". I have to say though that I preferred the ending in the TV series to the book, but I'm happy to have read the book and it always bought a smile to my face when I recognised lines in the novel that had been lifted wholesale into the series. This is a dark book, but for the mystery genre it's also a rather startling and original work.Dexter - The First Season"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rare case","review":"I liked the alliteration. However, this book is one of those rare cases where the show \\"Dexter\\" is much better.Dexter is a lot more rational and sensible. Definately more delicious and thought-provocking. In the show, that is.In the book, it's a bit different. There's a force that drives, rather compels him to kill. Supposedly, it's the dark passenger. In the show, that is something that's within him. He recognizes it as part of himself. In the book, like I said, it's a bit different. A bit of a supernatural aspect drifts into the book.Still, a fun, easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still enjoyable after watching the series first","review":"Perhaps I'd have given it a 5 if I had read it before watching the series. Unfortunately, it was hard to shake the characters I've come to know and love from the television. Not all the characters are represented in the same fashion within in the book.However, I know the show came out of the book. And what the book did well was develop the character of Dexter. Usually as readers we don't connect with and essentially fall in love with a serial killer. But Dexter is... different. Endearing? He struggles to fit in and be seen as normal, which many of us have experienced even without such a dark secret such as his.It's hard to call him a bad guy. He has redeeming qualities. And he has a Code that he adheres to.If you enjoy suspense thrillers, police dramas, etc. and are looking for something different - I'd recommend checking this one out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"If you tend to fall for the \\"bad guy,\\" then your are going to absolutely love this bad guy. Darkly Dreaming Dexter is the first is a series of books that feature Dexter Morgan as the main Character. This book is dark, dramatic, thrilling, hilarious, and romantic.What makes this book so truly enjoyable is the amazing character development of the main character, Dexter. Once you know Dexter, it is impossible not to like him. Dexter is a serial killer who only kills the bad guys. He is driven by a force he calls the \\"dark passenger.\\" This book keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. It is an easy, interesting, fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The show is only part of the story","review":"I love the series, and I now love the book. I finished the first one in the series and truly enjoyed the journey. The book and the series are similar through the first half of the book, but they take two different courses half way through. From what I hear, the rest of the books are different from the show. That means twice the Dexter to enjoy. Check out the books, and you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"execrably written","review":"From the first clatteringly awful paragraph, through the remainder of the incredibly poorly written first chapter, a potentially interesting and frightening story is transformed into annoying drivel through which I could not skim quickly enough. Perhaps the author should hand over his story ideas to someone possessing some capability with the English language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but stereotypes and clich��s","review":"290 pages of police thriller clich��s.A family of cops.The cop is a killer.The good female cop is stuck in vice as a hooker, but she'll make homicide detectiveThe lame female cop is already detective.Neighboring police districts arguing over jurisdiction.Stereotypes: every serial killer had a trauma as a child, every traumatized child grows up to be a serial killer.Given that the author's bio states he's already working on a 2nd Dexter novel, I guess it's not too much of a plot spoiler to say that the ending sets us up for a sequel with most of the same characters.On the positive side, it's only 290 pages and there were so few words on each page, I thought I must have picked up the large print edition.For a book so filled with clich��s, the only fitting end to a review is to say it's a shame so many trees had to die for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"no depth to dexter","review":"If you want a quick and easy crime read, then you should enjoy \\"Dexter\\". However, if you are looking for a skillfully crafted, plot twistin' good time, move along. Once the \\"serial killer that kills serial killers\\" idea sets in the story drags and lacks the depth it needs to make you want to read more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply, disappointing drivel.","review":"Having read several of the first glowing reviews on Amazon, I was very anxious to read this book. I ordered it with several others, and made sure to read it first. I guess I didn't read enough of the reviews. The story line is an interesting and unique one, but that is where the positives end. The book is short. The characters are flat. The plot in unbelievable and filled with cliches. The writing is remedial. Worst of all, however, the book is very boring. The author spends most of his time hammering home the point that Dexter doesn't have normal human emotions or empathy. I found myself saying \\"Allright, I understand Dexter is devoid of humanity lets move on\\" about every fifth page. The ending leaves plenty of room for a sequel with most of the same flat characters. Needless to say, I won't be reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"It's perfect! I live in Brazil and it arrived at my home one month after I bought it, that's is, within the time set when I bought it. No damage at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but not Thrilling","review":"Darkly Dreaming Dexter is witty, entertaining, and at times outright hilarious. I enjoyed the humor, but the plot was predictable almost to the point of annoyance. I found the book to be more entertaining than mysterious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I don't know why people are reviewing this book so low. It's a really great read. If you've watched the show then you will know what's going to happen mostly through out the whole book. I found myself trying to imagine what part of the show that the author was explaining. The only big difference is towards the end of the book and I'm not going to spoil it for anyone. Overall it's a really good book to read as well as a great series to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"so intriguing","review":"I watched the showtime show before reading this book, so I may be partial to the show (which is just so well done), but the book was very good, very interesting. The premise is awesome and the content just makes you want to read more. It's not quite as involved as the show and it's different plot-wise, but definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Darkly Fresh Perspective","review":"I've been watching the TV show for several years and finally got around to reading the book. Definitely worth the read even if you have seen the show. What I love about this book is that the focus is mostly on Dexter's thoughts and perspectives as he tries to navigate through everyday life. Harry's Code is the set of rules by which Dexter lives and it helps him to fit in and appear normal. Watching Dexter live by his code (which some people would find horrifying) and also watching apparently \\"normal\\" people who follow the letter of the law but intentionally damage other people for personal gain is good food for thought over what makes anyone a \\"good person.\\" Overall, this is great writing that is often witty and never dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth reading once.","review":"Dexter is an very intriguing character. It's a shame that the author is not better at fleshing out and conveying his creation. The alliteration gets a little bit wearing after a while, and a character as dynamic as Dexter wouldn't sound like a sixth grader in his internal monologues. I am still going to give the next couple of books a try, it's possible they will get better as the author gains experience and better gets to know his character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deadly Dexter","review":"Many people claim that when a movie or TV show is based on a book, the book is always better. However, in the case of Darkly Dreaming Dexter, I believe they are equals.I was only recently introduced to the character, but I watched both seasons in about 2 weeks. I decided to pick up the books after that.I don't want to give away too many details, but the show did differ from the book on several key points. I view this as a good thing because no matter which you encounter first, it keeps both experiences fresh.If I had one complaint about the book, it'd be the length. It weighs in around 300 pages or so, but it could've hit 500 and still would have felt right. Thankfully, Jeff Lindsay wrote two other books to continue developing Devious Dexter's darkness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkly Dreaming Dexter 1st book is a \\"cant put down book\\" OK!","review":"The first of the Dexter's book series is probably the best book by far. I have read all the other dexter novels but, this one is all you need to read in order to fall for this incredible character. A mix of love and murder in great balance. Wonderful reading, and a different way of seeing a \\"murderer\\" I Love Dexter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong start, weak finish","review":"Jeff Lindsay writes well. He's fun to read. Unfortunately, his plot development doesn't stand up to his writing abilities. Anyone can pull a rabbit out of a hat to solve a mystery which is exactly what Lindsay does here. He solves the mystery by introducing a new character with just pages to go. I felt cheated and disappointed. Perhaps his other books are better, but I doubt I'll take the time to find out. P.S. Is there really such a thing as a blood splatter expert?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different than the show","review":"I bought the book after watching the 1st season of Showtime's Dexter. I loved the book, even though the series is very different. Even if you are a big fan the show, you should get the book and see where it all came from. The book is a very detailed and dark easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored out of my tree!!","review":"Okay - I have never not finished a book before sending a review - but what is up with this book?! This was reviewed in Time Magazine as a \\"must read\\". PLEASE! I was expecting a fabulous sinister dark scary delicious novel. I am instead finding silly childish writing that is boring me to tears. What happened? The only reason I am even giving it 2 stars at mid novel is that \\"Dexter\\" can be occasionally funny. Not sure if I will even finish this book.Man - what a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just started it.","review":"I love the television show and someone told me the books are great so I had to check them out. I have only read a few chapters, but it is very well written and forces your mind to relive moments in the show. Great book so far even though I know how it is going to end. Can't wait to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining Read","review":"This book is very entertaining. Having watched the show first and going back and read the book, I can see how the show creators saw a robust character and ran with it. If you have not seen the show, it will be entertaining with a great amount of character development. If you have, you will notice the show is true to the book to a point and then takes a different direction. Either way, it will keep you guessing until the very end on what happens to Dexter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leave the lights on....","review":"I read this book over two days on a business trip...at one point, a flight attendant touched my shoulder and I jumped in my seat! It is absolutely CHILLING....if you have been a bad person, I suggest leaving the lights on and double lock your doors...afterall, Dexter has his own set of killing criteria!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Different!","review":"After reading previous reviews, I was curious to see how a novel of a self-proclaimed serial killer could work. I definitely think it works! Dexter is a very different protagonist, emotionally scarred from childhood and the reason is revealed to us. I do wish the author had delved deeper into Dexter's thought processes and the other characters. I do look forward to the author's next Dexter book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Predictable Dexter","review":"This book is interesting, and well-written, and a pleasure to read. Dexter's POV perspective is engaging, thought-provoking, and amazingly believeable. That being said... the plot of this book is like it was written by Charlie Kaufman's fake twin brother from Adaptation, for god's sake. Anyone who's ever watched an episode of a mystery show or read a single mystery book will see the end of this a million miles away, and groan. If someone came up to you on the street and held a gun to your head, and asked you for the plot of this book based on this premise, this is what you'd blurt out. I hope the second one has a better plot - otherwise, these just are just clever gimmicks without much substance or subtext."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd, amusing, and pretty cool...","review":"A lovable serial killer? So it seems. Dex is a fascinating character. In a world of compromises and justifications, somehow he can love this righteous serial killer right? THe book moves at a fast clip (although a bit more action might have been welcome in the middle) and has a comic sensibility. It is also surprising and the mystery is geniune. I commend Lindsay on something odd, amusing, and cool. I look forward to July's new Dexter book."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is original?","review":"A serial killer who helps the police solve murders?? Didn't we have that character last millenium in Hannibal Lecter?? And like Lecter's creator Thomas Harris, Jeff Lindsay becomes an apologist for serial killers with logic that goes something like this: \\"If you've been badly abused as a child, and you attempt to appease your homicidal psychoses created by this abuse by killing people that you deem worthy of death by torture, then it's acceptable to be a serial killer.\\" PLEASE!! Harris made a mistake when he tried to rationalize the monster Lecter's bestial nature by explaining it away as the result of torture by the Nazis. Lindsay tries to convince the reader to wallow in his psychopath's unapologetic killings by turning him into a nihilistic crimefighter. Neither explanation works.I only made it through the first third of the book, so if I missed some major shift in character later on, others will doubtless take me to task."},{"rating":"1","title":"a really stupid book","review":"dexter is one of the most unbelievable ideas ever developed and shows how hard up the publishers are for new material. it is so stupid that even matt damon wouldn't star in it. there is no plot, no seriously believable characters, numerous plot tangle ups, and a fabulously poor ending. i mean, can you really think that a scientist for the cops does cut up murders on the side, and no one suspects?? and that his sister also a cop just looks the other way?? this is total crap and most likely will never even wind up in a low grade comic book.david g sutliff"},{"rating":"1","title":"Morbid Trash","review":"I admit it. I fell for the hype. My mistake but not to be repeated.The hype, in my opinion, comes from the premise of a \\"good guy\\" serial killer. I don't buy it.Dexter has a warped sense of everything and one can only hope that characters like him do not exist in real life. On the other side, perhaps they do. In any case, I have no desire to read about them.This is sick stuff and I hated the book. Understand he is writing a sequel. Won't be on my list to buy.I do not recommend this stuff - maybe it should appear as a short story in the National Inquirer. Perfect fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"I still haven't rec'd the item and am not too happy about it!!!!","review":"I can't review the item because I never received it. I am pretty disappointed that the person I bought the book from sent it \\"book rate\\". We Alaskan's generally get pretty poor service thru the USPS unless the item is sent air mail. I'll probably get the book in June and it's the first in a series so needless to say I'm not too happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appaling!","review":"First of all, I confess to having read only the first chapter. It was recommended by a librarian whom I repect. While the author appears to be an original thinker, I cannot see any reason to waste my time on such material when there are other books more worthy of my attention. Call me a snob, but this sort of writing, to say nothing of the subject and its hero, is beyond my capacity to enjoy on any level.What really gob-smacked me was a \\"collector\\" hardback for $225 (as I recall).Nancy Eckert"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dexter is better on TV unfortunately...","review":"Great story line, wonderful characters and setting, problem is, it is not written well at all!! Jeff Lindsay has a great imagination, but terrible writting ability, almost painful to read. If I had not watched the Showtime series and enjoyed it so much, I would not be able to read the book. Truth be told, I am having trouble with it regardless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkly Dreaming Dexter is Devilishly Delicious","review":"Lindsay does a fantastic job of turning the tired serial killer genre on its head. His creation of Dexter, a serial killer who only kills bad people, is near perfect. I enjoyed Dexter's dark humor and sardonic wit; a few times I found myself laughing out loud. Add the southern Miami locale and you have the perfect summer read. I can't wait for the next Dexter adventure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise can't save bad writing","review":"Okay, in the interest of full disclosure, I'm not generally a reader of murder/suspense books. I picked this up because I thought the premise was interesting and read some decent reviews. A serial killer who goes around killing other, \\"bad\\", serial killers. Could be great, right?The premise is good, but the writing is just terrible. I couldn't even finish it. I get it -- the narrator (Dexter) has no real feelings but he can fake them really well. He doesn't recognize/acknowledge other people's realities, only his own. How do I know this? Because the author tells me this (in pretty much these exact words) over and over again starting on page 1. A little bit of \\"Show, don't tell\\" would have made a world of difference here.It's too bad, I really wanted to like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read.","review":"Definitely different, having a serial killer as the sympathetic protagonist. There seems to be a rise of the anti-hero but at least Dexter knows exactly what he is, and you are so told almost too many times. Dexter is a fascinating character-I kept thinking of Harlan's Cobin's Win. Unfortunately he's the only really well drawn character in the book; the others seem flat and stereotypical. The ending was a bit unsatisfactory but the story was tight and well plotted. There is a book two in the works and I'm certain I'll see where the series goes from here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"Snarky Television show? Yes. Worthy of a quick read? Not so much.I picked Dexter up as an \\"airplane book\\" - i.e. a few hours of brainless reading. Unfortunately, the suspension of disbelief required to stick with this for a few hours was a bit too much. Dexter tries just a little too hard, and the jumps in logic are just a little too far to make this a book you want to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, different, and delightful","review":"Dexter is a great character. Definitely different from your usual protagonist. I found myself charmed and creeped out all at once. I look forward to the sequel. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I found the ending less than great; but I still recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter Kindle","review":"As my first Kindle purchase I was disappointed this book wasn't lendable.

Its not a bad thing at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Monster's Inner Dialog (not monologue)","review":"Dexter is the kind of guy you would laugh with at the office water cooler, and scream about when you realize too late that he's your worst nightmare -- if you're a serial killer yourself, that is, and therefore subject to his gruesome curiosity. But what makes this book's \\"protagonist\\" so appealing is his delicious inner dialog -- with himself and his \\"dark passenger.\\" Selfish, pragmatic, brilliant, and deadly, Dexter is James Bond with even less conscience; a hysterically clueless ingenue in the world of people, and a ruthlessly capable monster in the world of silence and shadows. The story is every bit as carefully crafted as Dexter's meticulous compulsions. A great read from cover to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Idea, But Little Substance","review":"DDD is an interesting novel. Our main character is not a police officer wrangling against prejudiced superiors and nasty street thugs to find the criminal--he's a criminal himself. As a criminal, his Camus-like approach to life and relationships make this character hard to like and believe. Lindsay clearly has a knack for comedy and sarcasm, and Dexter is a perfect voice to add color to an otherwise shallow plot.The other characters are very flat and trite. The plot doesn't really work, and there's a touch of made-for-TV twists in the story that make the reader a bit embarrassed that Lindsay didn't think this one through more thoroughly. I won't be likely to read the next installment in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST EVER.","review":"I was so disappointed. I pounced on this book hungrily, couldn't WAIT to read it.My problems with it:Boring and repetitive. Barely a shell of the show, hardly a good read. I had to force myself through it. I honestly don't see why they decided to make this into a show, I guess it was a pretty good decision since the show is so freaking amazing but yeah, the book is riddled with poor writing that could have been fixed with a good editor. Words are used over and over again and gives the impression that the author has a really poor grasp on writing. It really seems like Deb blushes every other page, it disgusts me. The book plays on her sexuality in a way that just makes me feel like a huge creep. Things that were gasp-worthy in the show are diminished and played down in the novel. The ending was likewise poor, I felt that the people who adapted this for the show did a stellar job of cleaning up a messy novel. Would Never Read Again. Anyone want my copy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea. Poor Implementation.","review":"I really wanted to like this book. The idea is great--very original and funny in a dark, dark way. The book starts off in an interesting way and Dexter is an intriguing character I wanted to get to know. However, the other characters in the book are mere charicatures. None of them act like real human beings. Even Dexter is a bit flat. I never really understood why he did what he did or believed that someone like Dexter could actually be so coherent in conveying his thoughts to the reader. Still, the plot kept me going. I wanted to see where it was going. But the ending of this novel was just awful. It was both obvious and completely unbelievable. I was pretty disappointed in this book because I think the premise is much stronger than the delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter is totally different","review":"I have never read anything like Dexter. The other reviews cover the book very well. I never heard of the television program. I really enjoyed this very different character. I have purchased the second book and will read it soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than Just Chocolate","review":"This is a well written and researched book. Both Mars and Hershey were fascinating in their obsessions. Mars with conquering and dominating and Hershey with creating, owning and operating an ideal community. Mars had no life or dimention outside of the Mars Company and his sons seem to have no life in or outside of the company."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secrets Behind Chocolate","review":"I chose to read this book for my economics class, and the story drew me in from the very first chapter. The reader gets to see how both Milton Hershey and Forrest Mars grew in their businesses, starting out at the very bottom and working their way up to billionaires. It was inspiring to learn that these now major companies started out as little family owned businesses.After Emperors of Chocolate, you will never look at a candy bar the same way again. So much goes into the process of creating a single bar and getting it out onto the shelves for people to see. The only problem with this book is that you can't resist grabbing a chocolate bar for yourself each time you go to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to read for chocolate lovers","review":"This book starts off a little slow, but it does pick up and gets very interesting. It's a great book for people who love chocolate that want to know some history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but getting dated...","review":"There is no doubt that this is nothing short of a fantasic book. It's a very fast, fascinating read. It's especially interesting if you're interested in business, and some of the inside secrets of successful businesses. The other reviews on this board should be enough to convince anyone to buy this book.My only complaint? Since it was written in 1998, the business world has changed a lot. It would be very interesting to see how Hershey and Mars have handled the last four years, and that's not covered at all. This book is in need of an update, and it's disappointing that there seems to be none forthcoming.Like good chocolate, it leaves you wanting more..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chocolate Secrets","review":"When I first got the book, I thought it would be just a bunch of graphs, scales and statistics because I got it for my economics class, but I couldn't have been more wrong. I actually enjoyed reading it because no one knows what really goes on inside the chocolate business; it is all a mystery to me (though I do like chocolate). I found out that there are people who would get jobs in the factory just to find out secret ingredients and there are others who endeavor to keep these secrets from them. She went in depth on the processes of the production of chocolate and gave information on the real story behind Milton Hershey and The Mars Family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for chocoholics!!!","review":"I initially decided to read this book for my economics class for two reasons: First, I love chocolate. Second, my friends who already read it said it was a quick read. They warned me, however, about the first chapter; it was the hardest part to get through. When I read \\"The Emperors of Chocolate\\" for myself, I really enjoyed the first chapter about the Mars company's response to the Gulf War.\\"The Emperors of Chocolate\\" attacks all sides of the chocolate industry, from the way chocolate is made (I craved chocolate all through Chapter 8, \\"From Bean to Bar\\") to the cutthroat nature of the competition to the scientific and advertising methods used to make customers buy candy after candy.I really enjoyed this book; it was almost as good as a Hershey or Mars candy bar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"This book was fascinating! It's more than an expose-it's part social history and part biography of two great visionaires, Forrest Mars and Milton Hershey. Chock full of intersting factoids. Learning about the secret to Hershey Kisses and how they used to be wrapped will knock your socks off. Wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down...","review":"I knew nothing about this book when I picked it up at the bookstore.

I began reading Friday night and stayed up ALL NIGHT LONG until I finished it Saturday at 10 a.m. I haven't read a book this good in years!! I can't believe how much I learned about chocolate and about the candy business. Hats off to the author, for a mouthwatering read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Katie C.'s Emperors of Chocolate Review!","review":"I found this book to be amazingly entertaining and easy to get through, considering I was assigned to read it for an economics class. Not only that, but i am not a reader. I could literally sit down and read this book for longish periods of time and remain interested. I don't know if that's because it's about chocolate or because of Brenner's intriguing writing style. I also found the characters very interesting, and I was really surprised to read about the school/orphanage that Milton Hershey started and gave so much to. Anyway, I recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Informative view on 2 tasty companies.","review":"Hershey and Mars, 2 of the most financially successful companies in the world are portrayed in this informative and delightful book.I never knew Hershey was a caring man, who gave to the community and Mars, well..other than having alot more money then Hershey , was overall a jerk who wouldnt even give his kids some of his tasty creations.Come on, if your dad was the man behind the company who makes snicker bars and m&m's, wouldnt YOU expect something?Well guess what, *eats a snicker bar* I can eat one without being related to a jerk. :)Good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"History Never Tasted So Good","review":"I loved reading Joel Glenn Brenner's the Emperors of Chocolate (a look inside the secret world of Hershey and Mars) and not just because it gave me an excuse to try many different chocolate bars. The business side of the book is fascinating as the two companies, with entirely different philosophies, vie for dominance. For these business stories alone the book is worth reading.An added bonus of the book is a new way to look at chocolate. As a Canadian who worked in the States, I learned why I did not eat as much chocolate as I did in Canada and why Hershey bars have that (to me) peculiar taste and why there are no Smarties, only M&Ms in the United States. You can follow along in the book as each new product is introduced with your own taste testing. History never tasted so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent view into the world of chocolate","review":"This book was one of the best books I have ever read. It went into detail how competitive the chocolate industry is and how chocolate influences our daily lives. This book can whisk you away into a world different from ours, a world of taste, a world so full of wonderful things, the world of chocolate. The author does a great job of keeping the suspense flowing and the numbers were absolutely breathtaking. The whole time I read the book I could practically smell the bars comming of the belt, and taste the chocolate from the wrappers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sweet Read","review":"The Emperors of Chocolate is a light paced read that will ensure your always reaching out for a candy bar. The balance of personal, historical, and educational facts regarding not only chocolate but the two mighty paragons of power that produce it leave you wrapped up in the book. Keep a chocolate bar handy and don't stand for an hour infront of the candy display trying to decide what to get now that you know the scoop. This book is a real must read for anyone who's ever craved the magic of chocolate."},{"rating":"2","title":"M-M-M Good","review":"Personally, I think \\"Nestles makes the very best chocolate\\" (remember that old commercial running on Saturday mornings during \\"The New Casper Cartoon Show\\" in 1965 or so with that dog who sung that jingle and snapped his mouth shut?) Anyway, this book was so great I had to have my M&M's and/or Kisses handy. Hershey's chocolate tends to be a little, just a wee bit now, gritty and if you drink a Coca-Cola or eat ice cream along with it it gets hard and isn't melting. Such is the nature of chocolate I guess. They both have great products, but when it comes to chocolate Holland and Switzerland wins hands down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Insider View","review":"Please spare me the research aspects of all thats been written before. You understand little of the inside workings of Mars, especially the insights of Forrest Sr. This book contains the known cream, but little of the substantive \\"meat\\". Few will ever really know Mars, or how it works, and unfortunately this author is one of these. To know Mars, to work for the company, is to know the consumer, as the consumer is key to the success, Little new light is shed on the shadow known as Mars in this diatribe."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Emporers of Chocolate","review":"This nonfiction work has all the components of a potboiler...intrigue, spies, tumultuous family relations, business practices gone awry, philanthropy efforts and best of all, how chocolate came to be... This book begins with what seems to be a completely irrelevant story. Until you begin reading futher and realize that the story's beginnings came from before the turn of the century. Brenner is able to digress within her chapters of history and not lose the thread, giving the reader a clearer understanding that while you are enjoying the candy, battles have been waged over it. Highly recommended for those in the throes of their chocolate love affairs...those that see chocolate as less than ideal might still be intrigued by the power struggles to be an emporer of candy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside the world of Hershey and Mars","review":"If you enjoy the wonderful treats that Hershey and Mars brings into this world as much as I do you will find this book quite fascinating.

I love SVH and SVU, and I started reading Sweet Valley twins when I was in the fourth grade. I am now a college student, and this book was horrible. Not only is it soap-opera like in the way that William White NEVER DIES, but Jessica is portrayed like a complete airhead. And didn't Alison die in an earlier Thriller? I know the thriller and super editions never continue what's going on in the series, but they should at least be true to what went on in previous thrillers. Anway, my advice to Francine Pascal is STOP William White. Now I have to decide if I want to torture myself with part II to find out what happens. I've already almost bought it twice, but then I remembered how bad part one was, and I left it on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My god....","review":"This book was the stupidest book iv'e ever read.

REALITY CHECK!!!","review":"Okay I love SVH & SVU, but this is too much. I would give this -3 stars if posible.

I can not rationalize why Francine Pascal would ressurrect the annoying William White. He is not terrifying, disturbing, or even disarming. He is lame. He is also dead. Period. I wish the thrillers had somewhat of a plot connection to the regular books, but they never do. You just have to ride them out. This book is preposterous, and not even entertaining. And there is a sequel. Oh boy. Anyway, I dont recommend this. I was disappointed the first time William White came back, now its just annoying. Surely the author can imagine a new antagonist, and a new set of circumstances. This book was very disappointing. I cant wait until March."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have for Jason Fans","review":"Eric Morse's Friday the 13th's Mother's Day is the first book in his four book Friday the 13th series, in which Morse discusses what happens after Jason goes to Hell. In this book, the question of what ever happened to Jason's mother is answered! This alone makes the book worth the money. Morse, with his writing, is actually able to catch the essense of the movies in these books, allowing them to transend being \\"just for kids\\" to the rank of must have for any Jason or slasher fan! Morse will make you feel that you are actually in the book, that is how well he writes. Don't question yourself about the purchase, I guarantee that if you really liked the movies, you will love the books. They are a great lead into the upcoming release of Jason X!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Great Book!","review":"This book was really good. It actually seems like a Friday the 13th movie.

People who said that the plastic that holds the screen broke also said that they washed their unit in the dishwasher. I read the instructions which also said to avoid using the dishwasher. So, I NEVER put mine in the dishwasher and have always washed it by hand. After a few months of use the plastic that holds the screen just broke making this coffee maker useless. This serious defect, plus the lack of warranty coverage by the new manufacturer makes this a \\"never again\\" purchase for me. I also have a Bodum brand chambod french press. The screen holder is metal on the Bodum. It goes in the dishwasher. Its great. No more BonJour for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbreakable? Depends on the part...","review":"Sure, the canister isn't glass and won't shatter when dropped. But the plastic pieces that hold the filter together are a joke.

However, the screen on the inside simply falls apart over time.

If you disassemble the filter head to clean out the screen you will notice that the screen itself and the housing are cheap and thin feeling.After using mine about twice a week for two months the filter assembly broke into about 5 pieces and now the press is basically useless.

Poorly designed. Sure the carafe is unbreakable, but what does break into pieces is the plastic piece used to press down the coffee grinds. This happened within one month of purchase. I returned the press (I paid the shipping, which was high), received a replacement, and again within less than a month the same part broke. Obviously can't handle the heat and pressure. Of course customer service claims this has never happened before. But for the identical part on two different presses to break? Come on. Save your money and do not buy this product. The Bodun is infinitely better, as its press part is metal. Should have bought that one in the first place and not wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another broken screen housing.","review":"\\"Unbreakable\\" sounded good to me, a french press to take camping would be great.

You get what you pay for - pay a little more and purchase a Bodum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breakable french press","review":"When they say 'unbreakable', they are referring to the plastic caraffe, which is probably very durable, although I never dropped it. However, the construction of the plunger and filter is poor. It is almost entirely plastic. Mine broke after about two weeks. The first time I put it through the dishwasher the plunger broke within two days. I'm going to drive over the caraffe now and see if it's really unbreakable. Don't buy this press, get the sturdy glass bodum one and just be careful with the glass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ours broke, and it didn't take long","review":"Believe me, we handled the item carefully, because we treasure our morning coffee. It didn't take long before the carafe broke (no, we didn't drop it or bang it in the sink) and --- after we mended it with crazy glue --- it was only a couple of weeks afterwards that the plastic mounting for the filter/plunger feature disintegrated. So disappointing. And not a jot of sympathy from Customer Relations. Don't buy this. It's a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so unbreakable","review":"I've used this french press a handful of times and like so many other the plunger broke which makes the press unusable.

Carafe is unbreakable; Filter assembly definitely breaks. Filter assembly broke after about a month's usage. Purchased product at Bed Bath and Beyond and they offered a flyer with a 1-800 number for culinary parts and said they would be unable to assist me any further. Tried the number and the Gourmet Depot Company representative informed me there were no replacement parts for this item. I have been retrieving the broken plastic parts from the sink after cleaning and carefully fitting them back together for use until I decide on a replacement. I definitely would not purchase this product again. I will also be more careful with my purchases at Bed Bath and Beyond due to this experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screen breaks quickly - Manufacturer Doesn't Offer Warranty","review":"The press worked great for a 2 weeks, However, the screen housing broke. I called the original manufacturer & they explained they sold Bonjour division to Meyer. CSR did say that they replaced this part \\"without question\\" when they owned the Bonjour line. The new Bonjour owner, Meyer (also owns Circulon among others), offers no warranty and could not take an order for the part since it was out of stock for next month at least. They said I could call back in a month and they'd order part for me, but it would not be covered under warranty. I have 2 Bodum presses & have nothing but good things to say for their products.So - if you do buy one of these, watch for small cracks where the screen mount attaches to the press rod.

My broken piece back in the box, with a form letter saying that I \\"did not\\" HAVE A WARRANTY! The limited warranty is attached to the product!To top it off the letter said it enclosed a 35% off coupon to use with it's site Potsandpans.com....Guess what NO COUPON enclosed!I have had one of these presses in the past and it was great, butI am wondering if the company and manufacturing changed.Recommendation DO NOT BUY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbreakable - True - Crumbling Press - Also True","review":"I have had this product for 2 1/2 months now. I use it every morning to make coffee. Last week I noticed that the plastic holding the screen had cracked and a piece fell out. I had no idea how that happened as I hadn't dropped it. Last night we ran it through the dishwasher and the plastic press is literally crumbling into little pieces. The Carafe appears to be nearly indestructible. But the press is complete [...] and unreliable. It is as if the plastic is just trying to crumble or break down. It is suddenly soft and brittle.I have only used this thing every day for that last 2 1/2 months to make coffee and usually hand wash it with Dawn. I will never buy another one.

In addition to the glass nature, I didn't care for the metal frame of the Chambord either.I do like the style & appearance of this Bonjour. Also, love the unbreakable carafe. HOWEVER, neither of those features matter much when you end up with many fines in your coffee cup due to the terrible plastic & rubber filter assembly design.I recently discovered the Bodum Brazil model, purchased it here on Amazon (during the \\"3 for 1 Promotion\\" & LOVE it. This model doesn't require removal of the carafe which results in a reduced risk of breakage. And, not only does it look even better than this Bonjour, the metal (not plastic)screen filter offers the PERFECT cup of coffee (especially when using Costa Rican coffee)!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A marvel of marketing, but a lousy French Press","review":"What a piece of junk.

The carafe may be unbreakable, but the rest isn't. After 3 weeks, the seal around the strainer came loose so it wasn't filtering out all of the grounds, but that wasn't a big deal. After 4 weeks, two of the plastic bars holding the strainer in place broke in half, so there's no way to use it at all.PIECE OF JUNK! But you get what you pay for.

It came apart, in pieces, under normal use. It is now sitting in my office waiting for me to come up with a solution to my situation. This happened after only three weeks of use!I have contacted Bonjour and received replies directing me to their FAQs, two times. I don't want to spend the cash to send the entire product back to them only to receive a replacement that will disassemble itself in a few weeks.If you buy this, you might want to buy the glass type also. Then, when you break the carafe, you can use the press from the \\"breakable\\" one with the unbrakable carafe. This was a bad product choice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plunger is crap","review":"Note that only the carafe is claimed to be unbreakable. The Bonjour plunger, on the other hand, disintegrated after fewer than a dozen uses.

My high hopes were short lived as the plastic portion of the filter started cracking after a few months of very infrequent use and then broke into half a dozen little pieces in a little over a year. It appears the manufacturer placed their focus on creating the unbreakable carafe while neglecting filter quality all together. I am now left with a carafe- just a carafe."},{"rating":"1","title":"coffee luvr","review":"I have owned this coffee press for little over a year with occasional use. I initially purchased it for a camping trip. This morning, out of the blue, the filter assembly disintegrated. The plastic around the nut melted!!! Ugh.

I had it for about 2 months before the press mechanism fell apart.

Occasionally, I break a glass, but I make sure that I always have an extra glass on hand. When I decided to get a smaller French press, somehow I wound up with this product. True, it is unbreakable, but if you buy this, keep a strainer nearby because you will need it for all the grounds that make it into your cup.

I figured unbreakable would be great for me, since I'm really clumsy and I knew I'd be using it at least twice a day to make coffee for me and my roommate. It ended up getting a leak on the bottom within the first month (I have no idea how that happened, it cracked on the bottom), and then the actual press just fell apart. The plunger isn't attached to the press, and the press is in 3 different pieces that I put together like a puzzle when I want to use the press.

I didn't even drop it yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total piece of trash - don't waste your money","review":"After about a month of light usage, I noticed a small crack on the supposedly \\"unbreakable\\" carafe. I was not rough with it in any way. Poor design, I guess. As the crack grew, the unit also predictably began to leak. On top of all of that, the plastic parts holding the screen together cracked and fell apart. I'd expect something like this to last more than three months. Bad product - put your money into something decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless","review":"The whole plunger/ screen broke with a month and it doesn't keep coffee hot while steeping. I even warmed the carafe before starting the coffee. By the time it is ready it is med hot, but cools quickly after that. Back to the glass for me. Also tried to get them to replace the filter and they said the warranty only covers defects in manufacturing. I would call this a defect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filter screen broke after two months of very little use","review":"As others have written (in 2005!) - the plastic on the filter screen completely fell apart after a couple of dozen uses - always hand washed, never abused.

Since it had a tendency to periodically come apart and had to be put back together (not always easy), I might have overtightened it. I replaced it with a Bodum stainless steel strainer pot of the same size - literally as it turns out since the strainer fit the old pot too. Both pots are described as borosilicate but the Bonjour feels more like plastic to the touch than the Bodum. The Bodum costs $10 more evidently due to the use of a stainless strainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Disappointing - Poor Customer Service","review":"I was really looking forward to pressing my coffee.My kit arrived and I was able to make one pot before the screws fell out of the push strainer.

I was given this book and thought it would be tales about life in Haines, Alaska. The first chapter and last chapter were the only worthwhile chapters in the book IMO. Ive been to beautiful Haines and was hoping to read tales about the wildlife and natural beauty, instead I got a book about people dying. Death and the author's religious beliefs were too much for me. Again and again while reading this I thought why do I care? Imagine writing about 30 people that died in your town over the years and tell about how they died, what they did for a living, and then making a reference to God that is this entire book. I cannot believe that this was published. Alaska is not a main theme in this book and it could easily be set in any small town on the water in America. I can't recommend this, but if you ever have a chance to visit Haines jump on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for family","review":"My husband and I enjoyed this little book so much that we bought copies for my mom and his dad.

No alcoholism, no drugs, no despair, I don't think there's any cursing, either.I guess as an obituary writer Lende feels it is her job to clean up and sanitize the mess of life, but in book length?In fact, this account reads like one big obituary of a small town in Alaska-- a pleasant, uncontroversial bromide for the living."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you lived here, I'd know you name","review":"The is a wonderful story reminds me of \\" Northern Exposure\\".

Researching and writing obituaries. Anniversaries of loved ones dying.

Oh, and it broke too...","review":"I figured when I first heard about the BPA problem with plastic that the press I had couldn't possibly be made from BPA because surely they knew that heating the plastic or storing hot liquids in it astronomically increases the amount of BPA that's given off (leached into your coffee/tea). I was curious to know whether my press had any BPA in it. I called the manufacturer. They said that the plastic container part did contain BPA.BPA is linked to a whole host of issues, among them are obesity, problems with infant and fetal brain development, breast cancer, etc. Why on earth would a company knowingly put BPA in a product designed to hold hot liquids? How irresponsible is that?!Oh, and if the BPA thing isn't enough to kill it for ya, the plunger on mine broke the third week I had it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbreakable ??

I travel frequently as part of my job and I travel for pleasure at least four times a year, and my BonJour is always packed in my bag with sufficient coffee to make the trip enjoyable. The reason I gave this press only four stars is the plunger/screen is part plastic, and the plastic breaks down after six months or so of constant use. I now only use the press for travel. I do use a 3-cup Bodum for my daily morning coffee at home, but the glass is easy to break so I will not take it on trips. The BonJour Hugo is a good product at a very good price. Just be gentle with the plunger and it will serve you very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable, easy to clean, pefect for when you want only...","review":"...a single cup...small enough that it makes a nice travel amenity...however, bear in mind that three cup, in this case, amounts to only about a half a cup for most people...so you might want to consider the \\"8-cup\\" version...I've had mine for almost a year now and I'm quite happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breakable \\"unbreakable\\" French Press","review":"While the pot seems to be unbreakable, the plunger is not.

This is fine for metal screen holders, but this plastic one cracked and soon broke into small pieces.I'm going back to Bodum. Their glass carafes can break (and be replaced), but I never really liked the plastic carafe on the BonJour Hugo -- it quickly began showing minute scratches, giving the impression that it wasn't completely clean.

As I use this on my sailboat, the fact that is an unbreakable product is key. The design is better than my home one as it has a filter on the pouring side, which keeps any grinds in the press (out of my cup).The service from the Beaver Creek Shop / Handy House was excellent. No whining about shipping to Canada and at an excellent price.

It fell to pieces in four or five weeks.I have a Bodum 3 cup for which I have had to replace the carafe. When I bought this Bon Jour, I asked about spare parts. The clerk whipped out a coupon for a parts place. All they carried was the carafe--advertised here as \\"unbreakable\\". I found a toll-free line to the company to complain.

Much of it makes so little sense that it is amazing he printed it. He also does the decoding in Italian, which I feel should be in French. He implies by doing so that Nostradamus targeted an Italian audience for the quatrains. In reading the decoded verses, it appears that he groped to put together many of the sentences, making them sound almost incoherent. Insummary, I would say that he is indeed onto something with his decoding scheme, but he sorely lacks a deeply conscious, esoteric understanding of what is hidden beneath the quatrains, as well as the intepretation of the platelets (which contain many symbols of the tarot)."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Manuscript?","review":"I have communicated with a World-Known authority on Nostradamus, and he has told me that no such 'lost manuscript' of Nostradamus exists.

When the foam microphone cover disintegrated I bought a Jabra Earwave boom headset out of desperation and I find the earpiece more comfortable and even though I wear glasses the \\"over ear\\" design works fine but the best part is the microphone, people hear me clearly and conversations are easier now.

However, the ones that I've ordered through Amazon are defective. There are sharp, little nubs sticking up on various places of the sole where the foot is placed--very uncomfortable. All three pairs of this sandal model that I received (after several exchanges) have had this problem. Some pairs were worse than others. I'm about to return the third and final pair. It must be a manufacturing defect, as none of the other Tevas models that we own have this problem. Hopefully, the pairs of sandals that we returned are taken out of distribution (i.e., not passed on to other customers)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality is poor!","review":"Idea is great, but connector is cheap and any jarring or swift removal/disconnection will ruin the tangs that create the connection. Mine lasted about 4 months. I bought another from Jabra , a different model, and it had the same tangs for Nokia connections (maybe the 2.5 mm. plug would be better)... it was dead in five months. These are poorly made items! Period.

One thing I've noticed is the connector to Nokia phones is fragile. I dropped my phone once when it was connected and the quality noticably declined (same with the included earbud). After that I had people had a hard time hearing me, just as another reviewer had mentiond. I also had the problem with loosing the gel covers. I went through 3 of them, and they repeatedly fell off. The last failure mode is the earpiece itself. It got caught and completely fell apart. I am using a retractable earbud now that has a standard plug with a Nokia adapter. Much better quality than I ever had with either this or the included earbud. Also, the Nokia adapter is replacable, so I've eliminated one failure mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do the job while driving","review":"The only nice thing I can say about this product is that it has a comfortable earpiece. Their ear-gels do fit like a glove and are quite comfortable. However, I couldn't hear through mine very well. Furthermore, the microphone had to be practically in my mouth in order for me to be heard. That may be because I frequently drive with the windows open, and even with the windows closed my car is slightly (but just slightly) noisier than average.

According to Jenji Kohan, the show's creator, the writers were getting \\"bored\\". It shows in spades. The characters shamble through increasingly uninteresting and crude scenarios. The show's dark, satirical wit is gone in favor of poop jokes, porno, and lazy sex scenes. The characters still treat each other with the requisite malice and distaste, but the spark seems to be going out. (Thankfully I'm in Season 4 now and things are back to normal.) The production values are shoddy, the humor is weak/scatological, the satire is diluted, the new characters are boring and killed quickly or hang around far too long (one S.

I have had to return season season 3 twice and finally went to Ebay and payed a few bucks more for a WORKING copy. Then On season 5 had the same problem but gave up on trying to get a GOOD replacement. I truely think Amazon bought up a huge amount of bargin sets and dumped them off on the public.

The show is ok because compared to numerous other and terrible programming on Showtime (akablowtime) its alright. They call it a dark comedy but its not really dark either. To be honest everything about this show is pretty misleading, the fact that people call it really good with good acting is misleading onto itself.

Unfortunately, after I laughed once or twice per episode in season 3, I realized all good things come to an end and that is what I think now of Weeds. The storyline of selling weed, gangs and the upkeep of the community turned more into a \\"Days Of Our Lives\\" venture rather than a good fun-loving comedy/Satire.

While the writing in the first two season was deep, consistent, mature and kept the story line, this third season has pretty much decimated any good the first two seasons had. The series took on a bad, bad puerile collegiate-preachy tone that's pretty disheartening at times. Characters have become flat, insipid and inane. Situations tend to solve themselves rather trivially and almost in a sit-com fashion. I truly think this was originally a 2-season show that has been artificially drawn out due to the immense popularity the show enjoyed in its first two season. Nothing short of an atrocity. A true shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Season 3 is kind of boring and uninteresting...","review":"I was addicted to season 1 & 2 but Season 3 is kind of boring compared to the first two.

Several times while reading it I was tempted to toss it aside and pick up something more worthwile, but I plodded through it to the end.The author, a linguist, has an admitted distaste for \\"traditional\\" rules of grammer. (Which explains why he butchers grammer throughout the book.) He decrys the degradation of literature (and music), but at the same time his own writing style is casually-styled (he even admits this at the end) and even vulgar throughout. On top of this, there are numerous places in which he misuses words (e.g., \\"anymore\\" instead of \\"any more\\" on p. 115).From another author on another topic, errors like that would be overlooked. But, for a LINGUIST writing a book lamenting over the degradation of language???In the end, I had to give him two stars, simply because I agree with the premise of his book.

The types of Teresian prayer are covered, with exercises for reflection and prayer. Judy's exposition of discernment in the interior life is exceptionally well done. The book ends by pointing to the purpose of a lively interior life - to know and assent to God's will for our earthly, exterior life. This book is accessible for one who is new to Teresa, while also adding new insight and order to one more familiar with her works. Her writings are extensively and appropriately quoted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it...","review":"I was very excited about this book because it was toted as a book that reveals the characters of the people involved with this murder.

I haven't tried a flavor of those I haven't enjoyed. These are a poor substitute. The flavor is incredibly artificial and nowhere near either chocolate chip or graham cracker. Where it missed the mark, it landed somewhere between too salty and too sweet. The texture was another major sticking point for me. It somewhat resembled the feel of raw cookie dough, or perhaps more accurately, silly putty.Pass on the Big 100 line entirely and go straight to the Big 100 Colossal.

However, he could have been more discriminating in choosing them.

To my mind, the best part of this DVD is not the main feature, which rises above the average fairy tale genre, but the bonus features. \\"The artist in me\\" is a wonderful short (maybe half an hour long) that features a number of female artists including a renaissance court painter, an African American woman, and a 19 year old painter and teacher, as well as kids having a great time doing and talking about art. There is also an interactive game which involves placing famous paintings on the walls of the castle with a short art history lesson about each one.

The animation was, as Nutcracker was last year, reminiscent of a computer game. But Rapunzel failed where the Nutcracker sparkled. The story lacked charm and in some cases, rambled. Many of the characters were at best redundant-- the Kelly incarnations which in the Nutcracker were endearing, appeared to be nothing more than marketing tools for the doll in Rapunzel and came across as annoying.If the movie's producers want to see the difference between a cartoon classic and a forgettable piece of animation; they need only look at their entrancing debut film, and their disappointing follow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh man...","review":"As a babysitter, I watch many movies that if I wasn't a babysitter, I'd never watch.

This should be on the technical specs which are crap on this site."},{"rating":"2","title":"best earbud ever made","review":"I really like this handsfree set. It is very comfortable in my ear with the different size gels and also you have the option to use right or left ear. The microphone is just next to your cheek. I can move around with it and will not fall off or rub against anything close to my face. The audio is great. I can also take it anywhere with me. Not just in the car! I highly recommend this earset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, but that's it!!!","review":"The Jabra EarBroom has become real popular...I had a plantronics headset with my previous phone, but since I changed phones and needed a headset with a 2.5mm jack I thought I'd try the EarBoom.I travel often and found that the ear peices really didn't fit snug and stay in my ear. When I talk to someone, they can hear much more background noise while I'm driving than you could on my Plantronics headset. The voice quality from the ear peice is okay, but as I mentioned it feels like it's always about to fall out. If you're in a quiet room, the sound quality from my voice mic still isn't very good. I'll be heading to the plantronics site, their quality is good, but the ear pieces fell off of my headset frequently.....at least people could hear me and I could hear them clearly though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Order For Nokia Phone","review":"Although it is not indicated in the description, this item is NOT compatible with a Nokia phone. I ordered & received it only to find it was not compatible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure it fits!","review":"I recently purchased one of these for use with my Sprint Touchpoint 2200. I just cannot find a good fit with any of the eargels provided. After a while they start to hurt and I am currently looking for another headset with a more comfortable earpiece. Also, depending on where I am in the room (or rather, where my phone is pointing) there is a background hum that can get rather loud (especially if the phone is in the recharge cradle). I'm not sure if this is due to the headset, or if it's a problem with my phone. The people I call also complain about a very faint echo if I use the headset. Also, I find the volume in the earpiece way too loud even on the lowest setting on my phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Jabra, but not this product (mic doesn't pick up)","review":"I have used a Jabra earset on my nokia 5100 for years and love it. By far the best headset I've tried. So I expected similar quality when I bought the earboom for my home phone (with a 2.5mm jack). The sound quality is excellent and the ear gels work great, but people can't hear unless I yell. I've tried taking off the foam, twisting the mic closer to/further from my mouth, up and down and no luck. This is especially disappointing because I am indoors in a quiet room and people can't hear. If I had thought to keep the packaging it would be on its way back right now. But my Jabra earset for my 5100 (with built in adapter) works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing stinks","review":"If you're gonna buy an earpiece that's gonna last from Jabra, then the EarSet would be the best one. It works, don't get me wrong, but I would rather just wear one where I can talk into it and not have to worry about having the microphone in the right place and all of that kinda stuff. With the EarBoom, the mic has to be in a certain position and all of this other stuff. That's my opinion, but maybe others take care of things better than I do. Don't buy it if you're destructive like I am. Guilty as charged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable, inconvenient","review":"The gel inserts on the Jabra is quite uncomfortable, at least for me. It's a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear, and forget about jogging wearing this. Also the insert comes off very easily, and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears, you need to find the other sizes of the insert. Sound quality is mediocre, as callees often complain about wind noise from my end. I'm not happy with these."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it.","review":"First of all, none of the included earpieces gave me a comfortable and stable fit. Secondly, the short boom mic is not good enough for use in my car, as the other party always has problems hearing me well. It has been relegated to someone's desk here at the office, and I haven't seen it get much use there either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable and callers complain","review":"Eargel pieces are VERY tight fitting in the ear. I do have smaller ears so those with smaller ears should be weary. I tried all the gels and none of them don't make my ear hurt after prolonged use. Initially it feels fine when I stuffed it in my ear, but after like 20-30mins of talking, my ear starts to hurt. Another gripe is that my callers complain that I sound distant and they have a hard time hearing what I say. I have to talk pretty loud (no inside voices) which would work fine on the road, but I also try to use it at home with my roommate sleeping so inside voices just don't cut it. Boom is flimsy and overall I regret purchasing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"great sound, flimsy design","review":"I owned two of these EarBooms. The fit was comfortable and the sound very good. However, after a month or two of use, both sets cracked the plastic where the boom enters the ear piece. I imagine this came from adjusting the boom position, which put strain on the plastic. The plastic used for this is not strong enough to take the stress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works okay . . . if you don't mind shouting.","review":"This device fits snugly in the ear, and I can hear the party at the other end very clearly. Problem is, others can't hear me unless I shout. Very frustrating! In fact, it's so annoying that I'm returning mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gus is never not funny!","review":"Not quite as good as Lonesome Dove, but I did like it! I do wish it would have covered more of the time between leaving Austin and ending up in Lonesome Dove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comanche Moon","review":"If you have already read Lonesome Dove, then you will understand everything in this book and will enjoy it just as much. If you have not read Lonesome Dove, it would still be a great book, but I feel that Lonesome Dove sets up the characters much better. Highly recommend this book however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comanche Moon","review":"This book was an exellent western novel , where every chapter somethings happening. Some of the things that I liked about it were that it started out really good.And when the Civil War broke out none of them joined.It was really good that Blue Duck got kicked out of his fathers camp.Incredibly captain Inish Scull survived all of the tortures.Another good thing was that Newt got to stay with the rangers. Five things that I didn't like about the book were when Long Bill Coleman hung himself.And the comnanches had a great raid that led all the way to the ocean and killed everything in his path.It was also sad when Clara didn't get to marry Gus.Blue Duck kills Buffalo Hump and doesn't aloow him a peaceful death.The book was just a little to long.Someone who would enjoy this book was someone who enjoys a good western novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Novel Dissapointment","review":"LM made a mistake when he wrote Lonesome Dove first,that was a first-class can't put down read.I then found Streets Of Laredo and Dead Man Walking entertaining, but started finding the loose application of history disheartening.Once again, history is a bit distorted in Moon, just a minor example being that this novel must be set somewhere between 1855-1860, yet he keeps refering to Winchester and other repeating rifles, which are still somewhere in the future, after the Civil War which has not happened yet. This may seem like nit picking, but as a fan of the historical novel, I like my fictitional characters to interact with history, not change it, and if one was to make a time line with all four of these novels, I'm quite sure there would be some glaring gaps. I'm sure LM is great at sitting down and telling a story, but I believe that Lonesome Dove just got too big for him, this is a good read, not a great read, which makes it a dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all as good as others","review":"This book was weak in comparison to Lonesome Dove and Streets of Laredo. Just not enough action and the narrative is tied too much to characters that aren't as good as those in the other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-Par","review":"This book is haunted by being a middle volume. Mr. McMurtry's writing is excellent but the story really goes nowhere. It takes the Lonesome Dove characters and gives them some advevtures for their middle years. Woodrow Call and Augustus McCrae are full fledged Captains now. The time spance of the novel is too long and the stories are too disjointed. Characters are introduced and dropped. An example of this is Captain Scull, who is given much time in the first half of the book ( and is quite interesting in a Theodore Roosevelt sort of way) but is reduced to a caricature in the second half. This book was in dire need of some editting. I liked \\"Deadman's Walk\\" and I loved \\"Lonesome Dove\\". This book was best summed up by Woodrow Call's las line \\"It may be over but it wasn't fun\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could not read it fast enough","review":"I saved this one until I went to the Grand Canyon, figuring to read about hard country in a hard country portion of the USA. It was a perfect setting for a magnificent read. Call & McCrea, their adversaries and allies come to life in technicolor. Spent one day hiking the Canyon's South Rim, stopping to rest and read and what a way to enjoy this great portrayer of the American West. Don't think it would have mattered where I read it as it was quite a treat. Being in the Grand Canyon was just a bonus. I have yet to be disappointed in a McMurtry novel and these characters are full of life, color and verve."},{"rating":"1","title":"foolishness","review":"A friend thought I would enjoy this book since I enjoy reading so much. I did read it though every time I turned a page I wondered why I bothered.Such foolishness is a disgrace.About the best thing about the book is that no one has to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frank Muller does it again!","review":"I listen to a lot of audio books, but this was one of the best.. I rate it evenly with the Green Mile by Stephen King in Quality Audio Books... Not only is Larry's style at his best in this book, but it almost seems as though it was written for Frank Muller to read.... Frank Muller is the best of the Audio book world, and this is one of his best of the best... I liked the first 2/3 of the story much more than the last third, but still, overall it was incredible! Larry!!! You must get Frank Muller to read ALL your books!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The book did not meet expectations.","review":"Most readers of this book have probably already read Lonesome Dove, and thus were expecting the legend of Gus and Call to be filled in. It wasn't. How did Gus and Call become known as the greatest Texas Rangers that ever lived? Beats me. It seems all they did was keep from getting killed and bury the bodies of those who were killed. Maybe that was McMurtry's whole intention--to reveal that Gus and Call were really just a couple of overrated Texans. This explains the scene in Lonesome Dove where Gus and Call went into San Antonio to look for a cook, and noticed that no one remembered them. It turns out there was nothing to remember. I almost wish I hadn't read Comanche Moon, because it deflated my impression of Gus and Call significantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, I couldn't put it down.","review":"The story picks up about 15 years after Dead Man's Walk and ends about 10 years before Lonesome Dove. Great story, great characters, but it just didn't have the great ending McMurtry usually delivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"one of our favorite authors and a good read but of course it is in conunction with greatest movie ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I could not put this book down. I wish I had known about this book before I had read Lonesome Dove. However, that being sad, I made me go back and read lonesome dove and then the streets of Larado."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!","review":"Brought me up today on how Gus & Woodrow got to Lonesome Dove. Never understond why Jake Spoon was such a turd, now I know, should of hung him before Dove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed Feelings","review":"Comanche Moon is a good book. Maybe I should begin by getting that statement off my chest. It draws many of the characters from Lonesome Dove together and the stories McMurtry places them in are generally worthy of their greatness. But there were very discernable problems with this book beyond the flaws in the long story that made it the weakest volume of the Lonesome Dove series. What kept frustrating me was how the continuity was wrong. By this I mean facts that should have meshed instead contradicted one another between the various books in this quartet. That is just about unforgivable. I hate when authors do that because it weakens the reality of the novel and reveals it as \\"just a book\\". I could go on and say some more things here that are critical but the fact is, I did like Comanche Moon and was glad to spend time with those I got to know in the immeasurably superior Lonesome Dove. Read this for what it is and don't expect a return to Lonesome Dove's perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gus is back!","review":"I particularly enjoy getting into Gus's mind with respect to his views on life and death. Gus has a way of putting all things into perspctive. It is a simple perspective, but right on target. McMurtry also has a unique gift for keeping all of the charachters in his stories tied together and contributing members to the total story-no matter how small the role. Once again, when you get to the end, you wish there were more adventures to follow with Gus and Woodrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile, though not gripping","review":"Perhaps it is unfair to judge a book against a classic such as Lonesome Dove, however this is a hazard faced by writers of sequels (or in this case prequels). While much of the book was fascinating, such as those parts dealing with Inish Scull, Ahumado, Blue Duck and Buffalo Hump, it almost seems that McMurtry has run out of interesting things to say about Call and McCrae. While Lonesome Dove captivates from the start, Comanche Moon, like most good but not great books, allowed me to start feeling drowzy around midnight. Certainly this is a worthwhile book and at 700+ pages, it is well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comanche Moon, good but not consistent.","review":"I loved Lonesome Dove. I also enjoyed the sequals(and prequals). I found that I could hardly put Comanche Moon down. It is a good book but be forewarned if you are a stickler for details, you may be disappointed. There are too many inconsistencies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio Review","review":"I read/listen to everything that McMurtry writes. Previous audio cassettes of his work were very good. The narrator of this work ruins it. He seems more impressed with tonal quality and over working the narrative. Occasionally he forgets to over act and the quality of the book comes through. I hope the publisher goes back to one of the narrators used on previous tapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent saga of the old west.","review":"Frank Muller's presentation of Larry McMurtry's Comanche Moon was outstanding. McMurtry introduces us to additional unforgettable characters like Inish and Inez Scull. Comanche Moon further develops the characters we already knew - Call, McCrae, Buffalo Hump, Blue Duck and all the others. Muller is the best audio presenter I have ever listened to.I hope this is not the last of the story of Woodrow Call and Gus McCrae. There is a space ofe time between the end of Comanche Moon and the beginning of Lonsome Dove.Please Larry give us some more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another masterpiece","review":"A handsome tale brimming with unforgetable characters who are funny, unique and most importantly believable. Can easily stand alone from Lonesome Dove. Looking forward to reading the two other accompanying pieces to this wonderful frontier tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not Lonesome Dove","review":"A weary tale with some interesting character developement (but not much) that seems to fill in some of the questions preceeding Lonesome Dove, but whats with all the torture (he seems to relish it) and story lines that go nowhere?I couldn't wait for it to end which it did finally with out resolving much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak sequel","review":"Two of the most charming and lovable characthers of Western lore are transformed into a couple of meandering and stumbling saddle tramps in this weak sequel of Lonesome Dove. The premise is absurd. The story is written with a comic book flavor and features a Saturday morning cartoon villian. Where did the inept heroes gain their frontier experience that we read about in Lonesome Dove. Here? In this large comic book? I was not convinced. This story is no good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"As a huge fan of \\"Lonesome Dove\\" and \\"Streets of Laredo\\" I was really pleased to stumble across this prequel that is every bit as epic as \\"Lonesome Dove.\\" McMurty has such an unbelievable grasp on wild 1800's Texas and the West, and I also appreciate his fair treatment of Native American characters as he portrays good and bad people of all distinctions. I REALLY like the way he writes women, too, Maggie especially. The light this one sheds on the characters of the Rangers, especially Woodrow, is just a pure enhancement of an already amazing saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"McMurty goes slumming; drops Gus and Call into a comic book.","review":"When Larry McMurty is on, he's really on (witness Lonesome Dove and Streets of Laredo), but when he's off -- ugh. Comanche Moon is way off. The characters are caricatures, the situations are implausible, the writing is weak and unconvincing. The only possible silver lining: Maybe McMurty will feel a need to redeem himself and invest some effort in a more worthy segment of the series for the readers he cheats with a very dim Moon."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Holy Fire: the Story of the Fathers of the Eastern Church","review":"Out of the three chapters I read before giving up, only one was good.

I definitely would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Crime Drama!!!","review":"This is a great crime drama about a top lady in the fashion industry doubling as a jewel thief.It's a must see and should be on DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this controller if you love to LOSE!","review":"The controller itself is made of decent quality. The sticks are accurate and recenter themselves well, the analog shoulder buttons have a nice tactile feel, and the buttons are responsive and not mushy. HOWEVER, Logitard was smart enough to put a sleep mode function into the controller. So, if you're playing a game where you switch between keyboard and controller (BF2 for example) and it's been 10 minutes or so since you've used the controller. When you goto use the controller you'll quickly realize that the controller is asleep! What makes it even better is that you have to COMPLETELY exit the game and restart to get the game to recognize the controller. And there's nothing better than have 10 guys yell at you over TS because you have to restart the game in the middle of a match.Go Logitard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with madden","review":"With Madden 08, this game maps button 7 and 8 to start and select, and you can't do anything about it.

I was wrong, I'm still using the Logitech Dual Action for the simple reason of I need to be able to use the RT and LT. Those two are only recognized as a Z-Axis control, and its impossible to program them to anything else. Really was a waste. I now have this controller collecting dust, because it will never get used. No point in returning since, by all rights, its not defective. It just doesn't work as I expected it to. My opinion if you don't want a headache DO NOT buy this controller. Get the Playstation style since the R2 and L2 buttons work perfectly on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well at being a controller AND an air conditioner for your hands","review":"The Logitech ChillStream Gamepad looks very similar to an XBox 360 controller in button and control placement. It feels a bit hollow, but that is because it has fans that blow air on your hands while you play. This air flow does help nicely when engaging in a long gaming session.I use this controller on a Windows 7 (RC) machine, and I did not have to do anything special - plugged it in and it worked.The size is a tad smaller than an XBox controller, and as an XBox owner, I could feel the difference, but it wasn't enough to cause any problems - just noticeable.PROS: Works well, gives all the controls that one would find on a console controller. Fan does help cool the hands.CONS: Feels a bit hollow due to the fans. USB cable instead of wireless.OVERALL: I'd recommend this controller to anyone looking for a good \\"XBox style\\" controller for the PC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alternative to expensive Xbox controllers!","review":"I am a trackball fanatic when it comes to my desktop, however playing FPS games was getting quite tricky.

I kept waiting for something to happen, something, anything that would give a spark to the show. The only characters that were interesting were the Queen and Rumpelstiltken. Don't get me wrong, I like the concept of Fairy tale characters living in modern times; which is why I kept watching, (though I fast forward the last three episodes) but the writing did nothing that would make me want to watch this show again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Network-Style Writing Turned Me Off","review":"I was happy until episode five when the searchers learned a boy was in a mine because they found a candy bar he had dropped.

I started getting into it on a long plane ride, and it took me about 3 episodes to get into it, but it is a mysterious collection of fairy tales with a twist, all centered around a main story line which is a cursed town in this realm....very good series, I am hooked. A friend of mine doesn't like how many characters they bring into the show, and how it is hard to follow if you jump in. I am trying to get him to watch it from the beginning because that is probably the only way it will make full sense.

I love the combination of fairy tales all strewn together so flawlessly. Also I love how the actors actually play their characters WELL which is saying a lot because nowawadays alot of fairy tales are being adopted to screen and not all of the actors in those adaptations actually try and give a good acting performance. They just look depressed, emo, or stupid. So it's nice to see a show where it feels like all the actors are giving splendid performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"The book is an easy read, which is the only positive thing about it. But don't bother. The book never describes why children are the better day traders other than stating in the last sentence they would be. The German born author spends more time ranting about American politics than describing his trading philosophy - which is buy a basket of stocks in the day's hot sector rather than picking only one (this is related to hopscotch somehow). However, in the last chapter he states futures are better for day trading than stocks but does not go into any more detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Zinc product ever","review":"It's crazy these are discontinued.

I'm sure they all help reduce the length of a cold IF one sucks 3 or 4 a day very early-on in the virus process. Then one might as well save the rest of the package for the next cold, because they don't improve things after the first couple of days.

First of all, if your child does not want to do the homework, they are going to conveniently \\"forget\\" about assignments. As far as communicating with the teachers about assignments, that will last a few days, then the annoyed teacher gives a lecture about \\"teaching your child to be responsible\\" (in other words, I don't have time to make sure your kid writes down the assignment every day for the whole year). The punishment/reward system does not work for a child who looks at homework as the punishment. This book contains the simplistic advice you would find in any woman's magazine. It will not work, especially with older children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Common sense. . .","review":"Here's the plan: 1. know what your children's homework is (communicate with their teachers) 2. stay on top of whether they're doing it 3. use a system of \\"consequences\\" (reward/punishment) to reinforce their study behaviors.

I had either 27% or 5% body fat, I'm not sure which. I knew I wasn't at 5% for sure, since I'm not a world class athlete and do have some fat on me from a lack of physical activity since having 3 kids, so I figured that 27% had to be accurate. But then it started acting weird and shutting off by itself while I was using it or losing the memory, so I put in a new battery. It seemed to be more consistent after that with readings in the range of 27%, but then the malfunctioning happened again the next day. I can't say if the readings were ever accurate, since I had nothing to compare it to, but the malfunctioning made it a definite return to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Indeed, this device is very attractive from a visual aspect. However, I will attest to the fact that it will give you an accurate reading to within .1% of someone's body fat.

When first purchased it allowed me to enter my height in Feet and inches and my weight in pounds. However after a few days it randomly switched to Kg and cm. No matter what I try it will not switch back. That would be forgivable were it not for the gross inaccuracy of its overall performance. When I first used it I was told I had 26% body fat, later that same day I met with a trainer at my gym who, using calipers, measured my body fat at 15%. In short this thing sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had read the other reviews before purchasing!","review":"This is clearly NOT accurate!I'm 5'7, 125 lbs... and this thing claims my body fat percentage is 26% (\\"slightly overweight\\")!Other methods of measuring (and common sense) suggest that this instrument is off by atleast 5%It's cheap.

I am 6ft, 175Ibs have a 33\\" waist (around the belly button), workout 4 times a week (running/weights) and this little device consistently tells me I have 28% body fat. It's saying that of my 175Ib frame about 45Ibs of it is pure fat. Absolutely ridiculous! I'm actually much closer to 15% body fat based on more accurate devices. I mentioned \\"dangerous\\" in the first sentence because some might actually believe the numbers rendered and go on crash diets or meal/supplement plans.In my opinion, this product is not worth the $20 I spent and I do not recommend it.

Seriously wrong. Apparently, if you have any muscle mass on you, it doesn't work. I'm five foot seven, one hundred forty pounds. I work out somewhat, and have about maybe 10 to 15 pounds max of extra lean muscle mass compared to someone of a similar build who doesn't lift weights. A good amount muscle, yes, but no one will every confuse me with a body builder or professional athlete. Measured by trainers at the gym with fat calipers, I'm about 12-13% body fat.This machine gives me around 21-22% body fat. This is wrong, by the simple fact that the more accurate fat calipers are almost 50% lower, and by the fact that I can still fit in my size 28 jeans.What's worse is the lack of consistency. In the morning, my body fat will 21.7%, and by night, it will be 21.3%, making it completely useless even for measuring change.This is product is laughable and should be avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"A portable analyzer that works fairly well","review":"This analyzer works fairly well for a portable unit.

I'm usually drawn to sexy/sweet/girly perfumes. For example, a couple of my faves are Britney Spears - Fantasy, Ralph Lauren - Hot, Beyonce - Heat, Victoria's Secret - Sexy Little Things Noir, and the other Paris Hilton ones I previously mentioned.

Bernasconi uses a refreshingly direct style, free of preciousness (unlike his colleagues John Sallis and David Krell). For this he deserves our thanks. Unfortunately, the book itself does little to justify Bernasconi's reputation as one of the big guns in contemporary Heidegger studies. Most disappointing is the unconvincing chapter linking Being and Time to Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, notable for sloppy argumentation and faux classical erudition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting & Well Written","review":"Checked this book out for a water crisis research paper I was writing. This book is interesting and well written. It is full of great statistics and facts.

I love most of Mann's movies, especially because of the way he layers in awesome music. If you saw Heat, you remember how the music was great and set the mood of the scenes just right. This time around, there is something missing. The songs I liked the best were 2 new songs I heard from audioslave (another reviewer mentioned this), but they aren't even on the soundtrack! Same with the Jay-z opening track. To top it all off, the electronica mixes/covers of Nina Simone's Sinner Man and Phil Collins' In the Air Tonight were just weak. Try the originals of those songs and you'll see what I mean. Those would have rocked. I keep waiting for another soundtrack like Heat. Collateral didn't have it (only a few good songs there) and neither does this. Sigh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drop the techno beats and you have a winner!","review":"I loved the movie and true to Michael Mann directed films, there was great music. The problem is that while the movie has instrumentals of some hauntingly great music, the CD always has some kind of techno/electronic beat and/or bass line that takes away from the music in the film. \\"One of these mornings,\\" \\"The anthem,\\" and another song I can't remember suffer from this mishap. Don't get me wrong, I still love the songs and listen to them often, but the change from movie to soundtrack is kind of...well...not cool. You get some great Latino, disco, and dance songs as well.

I originally had this sound track on tape and enjoyed it very much. However when I placed this CD in the player, I thought I had the wrong CD. The music was over-run with background noise. The quality and frequency range was the lowest I have ever heard on a compact disc.

I will probably not be buying any music CD'S over the internet again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original Miami Vice is much better!","review":"This soundtrack is not as nice as the original Miami Vice. The artists listed on this soundtrack are not familiar to me since I've grown up listening to Genesis & Phil Collins Etc. I believe this movie would've been much better with the same characters such as Don Johnson, Philip Michael Thomas, Edward James Olmos, Saundra Santiago Etc.

The serious design flaws aren't simply manufacturing errors. The most common problem, the earpiece unit comes apart quite easily. This generally causes the unit to break entirely as the wires disconnect from the earphone.Most commonly, I've had complaints from callers that the headset makes me inaudible or fuzzy sounding.I've switched to a different brand. I liked the Jabra ear gels, which I found comfortable. However, the shortcomings in the quality of the headset makes this a choice of which to be wary."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost useless in a car","review":"This is a nice little device when I used it at home, when i was not moving around and in a quiet environment. However, in a car, moving at any speed above 30mph, the quality stunk. First, the sound I hear in the earpiece is very tunneled, like the other person is speaking way to close to the phone, and there's a lot of background noise all of a sudden. But that isn't tooo bad. The worst part is that the person on the other end has a hard time hearing me. They tell me it's like i have all of my windows open (which I didn't). I know it's not the reception of the phone because I'd unplug the earbud and talk fine w/ the normal phone.One other thing that annoyed me, is that if i have it plugged into the phone (Startac, w/ Sprint PCS), when someone calls it only rings into the earpiece, so I can't tell if someone calls unless I have the earpiece in all the time, OR I plug it in after someone calls - not very convenient when on the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earbud works great with minor modification","review":"I've been using the same Jabra earbud for over 2 years now (in fact mine is so old, it's the original design with the microphone built into the earpiece), and it still works great, with one minor modification. The ear gel kept falling off when I removed the earbud (leaving the gel in my ear), and also fell off all the time in the car, in my pocket, and everywhere else. So, after the second time I lost my ear gel, I glued the gel on the earbud (with \\"Household Goop\\"), and it's been working great since. The reception and transmission have been fine with my Motorolla phone, and now I'm buying one for my wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Microphone problems","review":"I agree with a previous review, that the microphone on thesedevices are useless.

She takes us on her journey of self-education which, for someone like me who knows very little about the stars, allowed me to keep pace with her discoveries. Her writing is descriptive but not overly flowery; I appreciated the directness and succinctness.My only regret is that she did not share more of her experiences in dealing with her husband's slide into deep depression. Her description of what she went through seemed muted, too measured. Didn't they argue? Wasn't she angry? Didn't she feel helpless? She touches on these but I would have liked her to go a bit deeper.Nonetheless, it is a very well-written, engaging combination of memoir and scientific discovery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forensic Psychology","review":"Some chapters were too long.

The book served its purpose as a very general, basic introduction to the field, but if you are looking for a reference text, as I had hoped this would be, this book will likely fail to meet your needs. I found the bibliographic references to primary sources in the literature to be the best part of the book; without that, I probably would have given the text one (1) star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adequate Forensic Psychology Text","review":"I would agree with the previous poster that this test is best intended for an introductory course for Forensic Psychology. Its function is to provide the basics and foundations of the many and varied role Forensic Psychologists face and are utilized in the criminal justice system. It's not overwhelmingly long, and written in a clear, concise manner that the student can find very manageable. This test was used in my Forensic Psychology course at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, MI in the summer of 2008. It serves its purpose for allowing psychology and other related social science background to see if the forensic realm of psychology is a field that they would find interesting to pursue. The authors give lots of real life examples of each subject in the chapters, as well as data to support their arguments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forensic Psychology","review":"This book is dry and far less interesting than I hoped it would be.

After being recommended the album on a popular Radiohead forum, I thought I would give it a go. I regret even searching Amazon for it now. From start to finish, this album did nothing but hurt my ears. Jittery beats and piercing screams echo about all over the place and there are absolutely no melodies or music to speak of. Basically, it's just screaming. Looped screaming, distorted screaming, echoed screaming. Every type of screaming you could imagine. And it isn't even backed by music! Just the same jittery beat looped over and over. Tick tick tick. Over and over and over again. I thought my brain was going to explode after a few seconds of this tripe.Be VERY wary of the artist's description. It's NOTHING like you think it's going to be.p.s.

If you like adventures and mysteries, well you don't have to think twice about this book. We are telling you this book is great. For example, polar bears feel that they can fly when they slide on thin ice. This book is a very good book. The characters are funny, like Jack who is smart and likes books a lot. If you like the book, well, you and him have something in common. So pick this book because it is awesome! --Juan Figueroa, Jerry Albor, Sergio Rocha and Cristian Garnica in Ms. Marik's 6th grade class"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheerful, Imaginative Fun Reading","review":"O.K., so this book isn't \\"The Sound and the Fury\\". But it's cheerful; the siblings treat each other well; there's a touch of adventure, and it's a little sciencey, although in a very superficial way. There aren't any farts and boogers, faeries, or super dumbed down fantasy elements. It isn't frantic or hyper. The vocabulary is age appropriate and the length is good. If you don't like polar bears, well maybe the next one will take place in Rome or the Amazon basin or on the moon.Of greatest importance, my grandkids love these books and read them like crazy. It's nice to walk into a bedroom when one's asleep and see one of the volumes, with a bookmark in it, on the bedside table. You can read them together, or let a more advanced reader try it alone. Either way, very satisfying.So, while I wouldn't recommend a steady diet of these, (the formula can get a bit threadbare), the Treehouse books certainly seem to have a place in a new reader's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"P O L A R B E A R s don't dissappear!","review":"MY 2nd GRADER read it to the FAMILY! we all LOVED it!

I felt that the author really did not have the years of experience necessary to write a serious book about serving and etiquette. The section about \\"Turning your tables--tricks to get people to leave your station\\" is ridiculous.

No one that actually takes their job seriously would actually do any of the things suggested in here.

I CAN'T BELIEVE I FINALLY FOUND THIS VIDEO!!!","review":"I saw this on HBO about 100 years ago. I have been searching for this ever since.

AMAZON.COM ROCKS!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"About The Adult Version","review":"It was rated PG and *is* available on laserdisc (with shower scene in tact)..I've owned it for several years now. I too saw it on HBO back around 84 and was mesmerized. In a way it is alot like \\"Babe\\" A delightful reunion with that inner child we thought we lost along the way . This is an overlooked Classic (and I'm thrilled to see it has such a following.) Hopefully this will coax Mr. Lucas to begin opening his repetiore to a longing DVD audience. *I* for one, will repurchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"twice the fun","review":"Haveing been born in 1982, I grew up with this movie. I thought, and still think this is the best cartoon movie ever made. Its themes and characters are easy to follow and very lovable, from our hero to the villin. If you have not yet seen this movie I strongly recommend seeing it before it is forgotten forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the R-rated version?","review":"I recently bought a copy of this movie from Amazon.com, and was disappointed to find that the video was the G-rated version.Back when I originally saw the movie, I saw a version theat was more PG/R rated. Synonymous Botch (The Bad Guy) was a little more vile, referring to the heros as \\"poophead-turdbrains\\", and included a classic shower scene in which you can see Botch in the shower, and he utters \\"Ooh, Crunchy...Nutty...Chewy! I'll have to look in there more often.\\" You can't actually see where he is digging/tasting during this shower scene, but it is left to your imagination. So overall I was disappointed.If Amazon unearths the more unsavory version, I would buy a copy! (5 stars)Without the insults, this movie rates 2-3 stars at best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Make this a DVD!","review":"I agree with some of the reviewers that Twice Upon a Time should be made into a DVD. There are lots of fans of the movie. I watched and taped it when the Movie Channel aired it years ago, and I am not tired of it yet.The story has a beginning, middle and end, rare these days. While the animation is funny on the surface, it is a good parody on life. Characters are recognizable and done really well. It has a classic American ending.The \\"R\\" version--the complete version--is the only way to really understand that this film is a real piece of art. Watch this film and you'll see why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"Fits the Camry perfectly and was bolt-on so you don't have to take it to the shop.

They are amazing, wonderful and worth the price, except...they ALL freeze and stop constantly. At first I thought it was my DVD player, so I played them in another brand DVD player. Same crap. They stop and freeze for minutes at a time, then come back. This is so irritating I don't know where to begin in expressing my frustration. They seem cheap and thin, am I the only one having this problem? Despite the wonderful content, they suck because you can't watch them without nearly constant interuptions of stopping and freezing.

The programming holds open the main menu thereby preventing most DVD players from launching \\"screen savor mode\\" this resulted in an optic laser burn out on my changer player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Trek at it's best","review":"There's not much I can say about the remastering of the original series that hasn't been already said. Its like watching Star Trek for the first time, again. I completed my set with the purchase of Season Three. So I must mention the packaging. This is the best packaging of any Star Trek DVD set that has come out of Paramount. And that's usually where Paramount cuts corners. But not this time. The clear and chrome plastic clamshell outer package is first rate. You'll want to leave all three seasons displayed on a shelf for all to see. They look that good. Each package includes plastic (not cardboard) episode cards making it easy to find the episode you're looking for without exposing the DVD discs to dust and fingerprints. But you better hurry.

Ship details are now more discernable, planets are now much more than simplistic hazy spheres, and special effects are much more enjoyable. If you're of the nostalgic sort and like everything just the way it was because, \\"darn it, you don't mess with a classic\\", then this isn't for you. But if you can appreciate a well-done cinematic enhancement that brings new life to an old favorite, then you will be quite pleased.

All except that one for me, but some are better than others of course, here are my top fives from season 3:Wink of an EyeThe Tholian WebThe Savage CurtainFor The World Is Hollow and I Have Touched The SkyThe Enterprise Incident.If you are an old Trek fan, you cannot go wrong with this season...but any old Trek fan should already know.The re-mastered effects are great by the way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio poor-Menus not user friendly","review":"As some reviews have indicated the audio sound quality is poor with intermittent sound drops in scenes. The menus are hard to navigate. There's no \\"play all' choice. So there's alot of fumbling with menus and selections after each episode that is once you figure out how the menus function. The scenes, the costumes and the people are all beautiful in HD. The incredible amount of detail that is lost and unseen in this and many other episodes and movies in general for over decades and decades until HD in very sad. We're just now able to visualize what the real scenes and sets and costumes actually looked like.

All I can add to the other negative reviews (other than my agreement) is that concentric ripples of light and dark emanate from the diodes.

Also doubles nicely as a bookmark when you're done for the evening. Battery life seems very good.My only complaint is that the plastic used to create the light diffusion is very easily marred. Within a few days of use there were all kinds of smudges (which is to be expected and not a big deal), and also lots of small scratches just from gently pressing it against the pages I was reading. Also, it can be a little unwieldy to manuever in the dark when you're trying to hold the reader and shuffle over to the next chapter or page. Not impossible just takes a little getting used to IMO.Still, you will be hard-pressed to find a better booklight that can cover a wide range of popular paperback and hardback sizes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed product","review":"As other reviewers have noted, this product emits a light that is too dim for easy reading.

The moire patterns were weird and slightly green. Maybe my unit was faulty, but there is no way anybody could read anything on the high setting, much less the low setting. The brightest part was on the edge, which meant the light was aimed squarely at my sleeping husband. It really needs more diodes, but that would be such a battery drain.Second problem, no AC adapter was available.Then there were other problems like it was too small and dim for a standard textbook, and way too large for a paperback. The included clip to have it hang on the page didn't work, it was constantly falling onto my lap when I put it on my beloved tilted rolling reader's table. Also, like the other reviewers have said, it scratches up immediately, as well as fingerprints get all over its surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"LightWedge way too dim","review":"The LightWedge has a gorgeous design, but the light is too dim for reading. The directions say that if the light is too dim to make sure all the batteries are working and inserted properly. I did this many times and still the light was too dim on the brightest setting.

Now that she has passed on, I wanted to give it to my mother in law who is also elderly. After inserting new batteries and turning it on, I realized that the light is not visible when other light is available. It provides a \\"glow\\" in a well lit room. The only way this Lightwedge could be effectively utilized is if it is placed over a page in a room without light.

Urbanization is encroaching upon Midway, a southern plantation home; so the owners, descendants of the family who built the home during slavery, decide to relocate the house and a number of out buildings. The house has much character (as do the collateral family members) and a resident ghost.

It has many funny moments that still make me laugh out loud, but it also has romance and sports, too! And there's just a sweetness to it that you rarely find in movies. If you are not generally a Warren Beatty fan, let me say that I'm not, either. In fact, this is the only movie of his I've seen where I enjoyed his performance, but I loved him in this. Julie Christie is beautiful, of course, and there are many stellar supporting performances headed up by Charles Grodin and Dyan Cannon. I've never seen the original version of this story, but if the remake is any indication, it must have been something out of this world. This movie is suitable for the whole family, but that doesn't mean it's simple-minded.

Here are some boating factors for the Brunton Echo: (1) This can cost $13 more elsewhere (before shipping). (2) Lanyard support and case is handy, and (3) customer reviews seem good for the price and seem accurate. (4) Another factor is 7x magnification - the max advisable for boats (given motion, a higher magnification is much harder to use). (5) The clarity here is really good for a budget scope, and (impressively) one can use it (likely) while wearing sunglasses or goggles. (6) Single-hand use is easy. (7) Five stars from me in the low-budget boating category."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little monocular for the money","review":"I was looking for an alternative to Nikon's excellent 5X and 7X High Grade Monoculars when I found the Brunton Echo 7X18 Pocket Scope.

And I've always had the feeling that, like most cartoonists producing daily strips, Larson's well ran dry after several of his collections hit the shelves. The eight slim Far Side collection rehashes his familiar body of characters (Tarzan, bears, ducks, domesticated dogs, and the shallower end of our gene pool) in situations much less \\"zany\\" and endearing than you might recall. The gems are few (and none funnier than the classic \\"Midvale School for the Gifted\\" strip you've no doubt seen on many an educator's office wall), and most of the gags that land are of the slightly-bemused chuckle variety here.

The entire story line was a Poe story mixed with your generic teenage drama. I was expecting an intriguing story, after hearing only good things about the author, but I was let down. The majority of the book was introducing the characters and setting, and when the action finally developed at the end of the book, the plot was insultingly simple. The long beginning leads you to think there will be a complex story line, but instead it develops the same as many other teenage drama books. Also, the book gives the appearance of being a book for older, high school aged teens, the language seems to be geared more towards younger, elementary school aged children.

It is only in the last chapter that she actually enters the haunted house at night- when the ghost comes out. All that happens is wind, whispering, scary plaster faces, and one character tripping. Oh, the horror. She finally finds out why the ghost was there and tells it to leave. The ghost's reason for staying was basically a re-enactment of a Poe tale.

It didn't say what it WAS compatible with here on the site, so I didn't know. And I'm a guy who's just trying to start a small home recording studio. Now I have to return it and go through more trouble. Once again it wasn't stated what systems it was compatible with. So for those who don't know and are trying to find out, it's compatible with Windows XP, Vista, and Mac."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"They advertised it as if it comes with some good audio editing software. It doesn't, unless you count demo's of Ableton (Blah). I expected Pro-Tools, and got Ableton. Ableton, by the way would have been junk, even if it hadn't been a demo. I got a pro-tools demo that doesn't work with my OS (Win7). If I wasn't so lazy, I'd have sent it back. If anyone wants to buy it for $10 off the price, if you have audio editing stuff to work with it, it's probably perfect. I wouldn't know yet, cause I've had it for 2 months, and still have never been able to use it. The hardware works with Win& but you have to get the drivers off the net.

This is my first audio interface, but I only spent about an hour or so to figure out how to use it. Ableton software is also very easy to install an use, which is another plus. I have Vista 64 bit on my PC, and everything works without any problems. The only annoying part is that if the PC goes to sleep, you need to turn the interface off & on again once the the PC wakes up to be able to use it, but no big deal in my opinion. I like the design as well, so overall it is a good product in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"M-Audio has poor suport and don't know there own products","review":"1st Bad review of all time.

They then released drivers and they do not work. M-audio tech support said sorry maybe in 6 months well be able to fix it. There sales department is misinformed and their tech department is not knowledgable whatsoever about MACs. The product does work on my PC but the included software is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid if you're running Vista...","review":"I don't write a lot of reviews, but this thing is such a pain and M-Audio are so obtuse that I had to write one. I knew that the Vista drivers were in beta when I bought it, but I figured that would not last long. Well, the last update was in June of 07 and they will not give a clue as to when the official driver will be out. The beta drivers suck and I have had nothing but glitches and problems. The hardware is all plastic and OK for the price, but without proper software it's almost useless. I just ordered a Firebox, hooked it up in 5 min and it works 10x better. If you're running XP this might not be an issue, but the truth is the $100 more for a firebox is worth every penny. M-audio and Mackie are both dropping the ball on software support lately and it's going to cost them in the long run. The forums are full of people telling them that, but not a lot of results yet. We all hate Vista, but that's life. Get your drivers up to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"Software seems sketchy. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. Very unreliable.

I've been using this on my 64 bit Windows 7 desktop and my 32 bit Windows 7 UL30A ASUS laptop with Adobe Audition. In both instances, the drivers worked like a charm and only required me to configure the device in the Audition's Hardware settings before I was ready to record.

This movie is about two things and two things only -- Jennifer Connelly's breasts. Period; end of story. It's why the movie was made, why she was hired for the part, why she wore that clingy white top, and why it even made it to video. Guys, you know I'm not lying.That's why I gave it four stars and not five -- I couldn't divide five evenly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, It Definitely Has Jennifer Connelly In It","review":"I watched this movie for the first time in many years the other day and had to come to this board to see the comments. Just as I thought, a lot of guys oogling Jennifer Connelly. And with very good reason. This movie was the worst in the John Hughes collection, but I can't tell you why because I didn't care a thing about the plot or the lead male character or the robbers or even John Candy, of whom I was a very big fan. I just know that Jennifer Connelly is an absolute doll in this movie, whether it be on roller skates or on a mechanical dime-store horse (especially a mechanical dime-store horse). In fact I think she comes across sexier here than she does in The Hot Spot, where she shows even more of her assets.Alas, today Jennifer Connelly has gone the way of Calista Flockhart and lost the babyfat and become a serious actress, even carting home an Oscar, but her role in Career Opportunities will be the one remembered by fans years from now."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny","review":"well it looks like i am one of the few girls that liked this movie. it was funny, and yes most guys will like this because jennifer connely is definetely not bad looking. many people think it's stupid, but i thought it was cute"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious - who knew Target could be so much fun??","review":"This is a great movie, simply put. The acting isn't award winning, nor is the direction, but this movie works...it's funny, and the chemistry between the two leads is perfect.

Even the parts of the movie where the guy is alone in Target, he does enough to keep the story and humor going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sole redeeming facet: the Goddess, Jennifer Connelly","review":"This is one of those movies that is vastly improved by muting the sound and turning the subtitles on.

Although lame in parts overall it should certainly have you watching it through more than once (providing to don't mind John Hughes' kind of humour) Jennifer Connely of course looks great too"},{"rating":"2","title":"Career Opportunities - A Fun 80's sleeper with nostaligia!","review":"As John Hughes movies go, this is as good as the best of them. Jimmy who lets everything slide off his back and models himself to be everything he isnt, is fun to watch and reminds me of all the times I wanted to pump myself up to be larger than what I was. Jennifer Connely is great, and there is a cameo by John Candy that is one of the films funniest moments. There is something about this movie that captures a piece of the eighties, and that makes it enjoyable as well. This is one of those films that get you in a good mood when you need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ferris Bueller Works The Graveyard Shift At Target","review":"John Hughes must have had real confidence in his script that he had to dole it off to someone else to direct. This flick is lame to the extreme. The material is razor thin and even at 83 minutes it feels like an eternity. Frank Whaley, a genial young actor from the late Eighties and early Nineties whom I usually like,comes off as somewhat obnoxious. High points are a luscious young Jennifer Connelly who would be hot reading the phone book, William Forsythe as the redneck maintenance supervisor, and John Candy as the Target personnel director who almost hires Whaley as an executive instead of as a minimum wage clean-up boy. Candy wasn't always the most discriminating in choosing his parts but he was smart enough to take his name off the credits of this turkey. To quote Herman's Hermits a must to avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"ARGUABLY LIGHTWEIGHT, CHARMING NONETHELESS","review":"Sure, it is lightweight, but the charming Frank Whaley carries it with zest. Beneath the antics lies a nerd-driven harmless male fantasy with a few well-made comments on the class system that defines adolesence. Worth watching. Worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfunny movie not worth the price of a ticket","review":"This was the bomb movie of 1991. It's about a guy who gets a job in a Target, and is promoted to being the night crew assistant manager, and about a girl who decides to get herself locked inside the store after it closes. This is supposed to be a classic John Hughes movie, but it falls flat as it's either an old plot, or the actors/actresses weren't right for the movie. It's boy meets girl, and they spend the night trying to get acquainted with each other, hoping their hormones will be their guides. Let's face it this was even worse than \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\", and I think that was the ultimate bomb, so this is how bad I feel about this. I feel that they should've just shelved this, and left it there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"Little did I know as I watched this movie that Jennifer Connelly would be a huge star or that a Target would acutally open in my neighborhood in the years to come. But even that doesn't mitigate the bad taste I still have in my mouth from this movie.Try not to watch it if you're in a career slump or in between jobs or depressed! I was all of the above at the time, and watching this was the worst punishment I could have inflicted upon myself.This was surely the last hurrah of 20something-bashing, you know, the kind of uneducated diatribes in which this demographic was perceived as lazy, unambitious, boring, and jaded. In reality the 20somethings were in a slump in the early 90's because of a recession and a poor job market, not because of any lack of ambition on their part. But you wouldn't know it to watch this movie. It does great injustice to GenX."},{"rating":"1","title":"Widesceen version is not anamorphic","review":"I saw this in theaters when I was in high school and thought Jennifer Connelly was the most beautiful woman in the world. I don't think I saw it in it's entirety again until I bought this DVD.It's not one of John Hughes' best work, but it's still relatively amusing. I'd give it three stars except the widescreen version isn't anamorphic so watching it on a widescreen television looks weird. You still see rather thick black bars across the top and bottom and the picture is stretched horizontally so everyone looks a little thicker than normal. I know some widescreen movies still have bars, depending on the aspect ratio. I thought I may have inadvertently changed the settings on my TV/DVD player but when I played another disc, everything was fine. Therefore, the transfer on this DVD wasn't done very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written,keep your attention Sci-Fi Novel.","review":"If youre looking for a Sci-Fi novel that you will want to read more than once then this is it. It takes you through the story of mankinds reserrection from destruction by an alien race.

I really cant understand how anyone who knows this is Science Fiction, could not enjoy this saga, its not real or necessarily about perceived \\"good writing\\" its just damn good entertainment. I am not a member of Scientology or am I ever likely to be. I put this book up with another saga as being the best books I have read, Hawaii by James A Michener. Now you can go figure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book","review":"This book was awesome! It had a lot of action. It also had a good story line. I would recommend it to anyone who likes science fiction alien stories. It is a really long book and starts out slow but it picks up about a quarter of the way through. It is worth it. The book was awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorites","review":"I really liked this book. The story is really exciting and it was hard to put down. It's one of those books that once you pick it up it pulls you through, makes you want to read one more chapter and then one more. The characters, action, events and generally uptone beat makes this one of my all-time favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay clear of this one!","review":"It would be wrong to compare this simple and predictable story to any of what the REAL sci-fi writers are producing.

It's a waste of time, at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who would buy this dreck?","review":"Do yourself a favor, and skip this one, unless you like reading really badly written books.Used bookstores sell this junk for about 50 cents. That may be more that this book is worth.I wonder how many Scientologists have been told to post great reviews here and to buy the book to drive the numbers up, exactly like they have for other books?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite What Some Might Say, It Is Very Good","review":"Many people really hate this book. I don't really understand that. It is very long and it is a little contrived sometimes, but it is really great fun overall. The main reason I don't give it 5 stars is that last part is a little inconsistent with the rest and kind of throws it off some.Yes, there might be some mild Scientology kind of sticking out here and there, but nothing that is going to freak anyone out or anything. Trust me.I liked the movie, even though it was not popular. I think if more people read the book first as I did, then they would have liked the movie better.I think Hubbard meant for people to have a good time with this book. It should not be over analyzed for hidden meanings and scientific rigor. Come one people lighten up and have some fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Introduction to Hubbardian Psychosis 101","review":"A long winded, mechanical plot, with as many improboble twists as the core secret in Scientology, that you ifested with the spirits of dead space aliens.Rx for those considering purchase - Read some Heinlen And run like blazes.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining if you don\`t take it to seriously","review":"I have read BE three times and will read it at least once more hopefully. I felt that it was to drawn out after psychlo was destrayed. If it had ended right there with Jonnie Goodboy Tyler and Chrissie living happily everafter it would have been a great SF Novel as is I would still recommend it if you just want to be entertained for a couple of days. You should also read the introduction written by LRH in Oct 1980 in which he states that he wrote this novel just to amuse himself"},{"rating":"2","title":"Battlefield Earth","review":"I was hesitant many years back to read L. Ron Hubbard's SciFi books since I wasn't a fan of his sciendtology. However; I am glad I didn't let that stop me reading his other books. I was impressed with the science fiction he wrote and read all books in that genre. It really is sad what they did with this one when they transferred it to the screen. By far the worst movie John Travolta was ever associated with. The book is worth the read though. Perhaps someday they will make another of his books into a movie and do a better job of it. Be sure to read his \\"Mission Earth Series\\" if you like plenty of low brow action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battlefield Earth","review":"I have not yet received my order.

The book began well and has an interesing premise, but the story quickly dissolves into a simple, predictable plot. There are very few characters for a book of this size and even these few are relatively two-dimensional. However, my biggest critique of this book is that Hubbard simply takes too long to tell his story. This book could have been much shorter without losing any of its essence (this shows how much extraneous material the book contains). This is one of those books that makes you wish you had done something else with the time you spent reading it. I don't recommend this book and fail to see why it has attained such popularity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, if not Worse...","review":"...than the movie. The characters are stale, annoying, and spend most of their time being either really stupid or really lucky, or both.

Hubbard tried everything (except interesting dialogue and believable characters) to keep my interest, but failed. I was mildly amused by the Earth-centric nationalism (humans are nice, aliens are evil), but was baffled by the lapses of internal consistency. Example: an indestructable aircraft that could withstand multiple direct hits by thermonuclear devices but was disabled by one man with a socket wrench. Things that make you go 'hmmm'. Sometimes you CAN judge a book by its cover.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battlefield Garbage","review":"Although I suspect this review will not be published, I must say that I think Battlefield Earth is the worse novel I have ever attempted to read. Granted, I only made it through half of the book, but by this time I was so nauseous from the sentimental, pro-American drivel that I simply could not finish. I read it whilst working in Ethiopia where there was little or nothing to do in the evenings. It is a testimony to the book's quality that I prefered to bore myself to death than read about 'Jonny Goodboy Tyler'. The name alone speaks volumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book only John Travolta could love","review":"I enjoy reading SF. A lot of SF. I picked this book up because I enjoy reading from the \\"golden age\\" of SF. Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke, and dozens of others. Battlefield: Earth is as far from \\"golden\\" as possible. Stupid characters. Idiotic dialogue. 1000 year old planes flown by \\"cave men\\".The movie perfectly reflects the book. Avoid both at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"...Scientology Claptrap","review":"I've never been able to make it more than half-way through this snooze-fest, so I won't attempt to review it. I would, however, like refute the opinion that this book has no connection to Scientology. At some point it is revealed that the reason that the Psychlos are so evil is because at birth, they have an aggression device (or something, who really cares) implanted in their brains by a sinister cabal of Psychlos called the Catrists. That's Psychlo Catrist. One of Scientology's main tenets is that the profession of psychiatry is evil and responsible for most of the evil and sickness in the world today (or something, who really cares). For those of you playing along at home, we have:psychiatristPsychlo Catrist.Please, stop the inanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!","review":"How in the world did this become a science fiction \\"classic?\\" This is drivel, junk, crap! Is it only Scientologist propoganda that keeps this book in print?I had my doubts about the book as soon as I read the author's introduction. It was the most arrogant, self serving piece of writing I had ever read. Hubbard constantly criticized other authors and books, and he insisted he and his choice few were the only ones who wrote good science fiction.Then I started the book, and I couldn't make it past page 250. I finish almost every book I read, no matter how much I dislike it, but this one I just couldn't continue. The writing is plain bad, written in the style of a high school student. I still gag thinking about it.So please, stay away from this sewer of a book. Maybe it will go out of print soon if you do, making the bookstores a much safer place for the unsuspecting browser."},{"rating":"1","title":"I laughed, I cried, I kissed 3 bucks good-bye","review":"I laughed at the STUPID plot. I CRIED that I wasted the 3 bucks I KISSED GOOD-BYE when I bought it at a used book store. The only people who would want to read this drivel, would be hardcore scientologists. If you want good sci-fi, stick with Frank Herbert, Isaac Asimov, or (one of my fav's) Piers Anthony. I'd just as soon read one of the Dick and Jane books as read another one of Hubbard's. Unless you are a fan of Dick and Jane, I suggest you make like their dog and \\"Run, Spot, Run\\" far away from it. Oh, I did find a good use for it. I used the pages to help start fires in my grill.

There are bad books, terrible books, and there is Battlefield: Earth. I won't go so far to say it is the worst book ever written, as I have not had the displeasure (nor do I ever plan to) of reading any of Mr Hubbard's other \\"works\\". I am firmly convinced that the glowing five star reviews that appear elsewhere were written by brainwashed Scientologists. That is the only explaination that I can come to. Stay Away! You have been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I ever read","review":"I read all kinds of fiction novels from mystery to fantasy to science fiction and even historical novels. Never did I read a book that captured my imagination like Battlefield Earth did. I was glued to its pages. Just couldn't put it down. Whatever you may think about Hubbard, Battlefield Earth is science fiction, action, adventure and suspense at its all-time, hands-down best. After I finished Battlefield Earth, I picked up the Mission Earth series by Hubbard and was not disappointed. I highly recommend both these novels to anybody who is looking for a great read, they can lose themselves in.

Hubbard obviously has the support of his followers...they all give him 5 stars .

It never did. The writing is so immature, the dialogue so insipid, and the characters so one dimensional, its as though Hubbard wrote this book in three days while consuming pot after pot of coffee. Even the main character's name is cliched--Jonnie \\"Goodboy\\" Tyler. Are we to assume he is a good boy? \\"Thanks for the hint Mr. Hubbard. You can go back to playing with your Nintendo now.\\" B.E. is one of those long winded novels that when you finish it, you kick yourself for having spent the time reading it.

That's all it is.","review":"I have only two explanations for the number of 5-star reviews for this over-sized dime novel. Either the Scientologists are ordering their flock to put good reviews on the Net, or mass hysteria/stupidity has enveloped large parts of the nation. \\"The best book ever written?!\\" My God! Hubbard can't even get his subjects and verbs to agree. Of course you can't really trust reviews that still use the idiotic neologism \\"sci-fi\\", so that knocks half the reviews out of contention. People, I beg of you. Avoid this book. Waste not your time precious. L. Ron. Hubbard's work is just a mediocre imitation of the work of Philip K. Dick. And this book is the greatest example of his mediocrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an amazing dissapointment!!","review":"My brother read this book some ten years ago and this past summer he told me that is was an incredible epic adventure. I wasn't at all, put off by the incredible length (somewhere around 1,050 pages). In fact, that encouraged me even more. I love a book you can really get into. But this book never got my attention. I assume L. Ron Hubbard can write an interesting book, but Battlefield Earth wasn't it. But I have to give it some credit. It did have maybe 3-5 interesting \\"action\\" sequences. But you'd think a thousand page sci-fi novel would be loaded with action. And you'd probably expect a 1,000 page to have an amzing 200 page climax or something. But as a matter of fact, after about page 600, the action stopped. The last 400 pages were just a bunch of pointless sh*t. In conclusion, this is the book for anyone who likes books that have almost no action."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best, You'll be sorry it ends","review":"This is a great book!.

My memories of it were so good that I decided to read it again 15 years later. This time I could not get past the first 100 pages. The dialoge seemed so sophmorish and the story so simple. The characters also acted in a way that seemed very unbelievable. If you are looking to torture yourself, see the movie and get it over in 2 hours instead of the days it will take to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"I enjoyed the style and premise of the book but eventually just put it down and stopped reading it for one simple reason:The good guys always win, the bad guys always lose. This theme becomes so prevelent and predictable that the battles are literally the most boring parts of the book. All the bad guys get mowed down, one good guy gets shot in the arm, hooray for humanity, repeat for every fight. It's like every Stallone/Van Damme/Chuck Norris movie all rolled into one rather cheesy book. He did a lot of this in his Mission Earth books as well, but there it was intentional and funny, in Battlefield Earth it's serious to the point of just creating a ridiculous story.Maybe 1 star isn't being completely fair overall, but this one aspect was enough to make me stop reading, so I figure it's justified."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book only a cult member could love...","review":"Battlefield Earth is, without a doubt, the worst book I have ever managed to finish reading in my life (if it was so bad why did I finish? It's a long story involving a prolonged hospital stay with no access to TV or radio). This book was written with a plot, characterization and storyline that a three year old (and only a three year old) could appreciate - 2 dimensional characters, a fifth rate plot, and third rate writing. Don't waste your time or money - there are so many better things you could be doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battlefield Earth","review":"I tried to read this book but could not finish it. Like all L. Ron Hubbard books, and those attributed to him by his followers, this one was not very good. Hubbard, and those who write in his name, do not seem to be able to tell a coherent story. They are always filled with absurd silly characters and even worse dialogue. One gets the feeling that Hubbard was one of those people who simply thought too much of his skills. When one becomes a religious icon, it's hard to edit the words they produce. All the words springing from the mind of such an individual are sacred aren't they? In Hubbrd's case, no. All of his works are in great need of editing. Though I must admit, this book in particular would have made an OK comic book. Maybe.Erik"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best books i have read","review":"This is one of the best books that I have read. One of my friends at work told me about it, I read it (loved it) and got my wife to read it, she is halfway throw it and loves it.

Despite its length, I can usually finish it in three days or less. It's that riveting.Jonny versus the Psychlos.Humans are no longer the dominant species on Earth. As a lark, one psychlo takes a human, Jonny, and teaches him quickly through technology.One thing leads to another and Jonny begins teaching other humans, they learn of their past, and set about expelling the Psyclos from Earth.Full of action, and rags to riches. Enough to satisfy anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"UTTERLY DISAPPOINTING","review":"Old L.

My 8-year-old niece has written more thought-provoking stuff than this.I read it because I thought there would be SOME redeeming quality about the story/author, having read all the miserable reviews of the movie(which I did not see).

ALOT","review":"I did. I thought it was smart, action oriented, and with cool characters. One problem, though. I WAS 12 YEARS OLD.I re read it as an adult(18, not 78) or rather , tried to re read it. The silly, sexist and obvious book might as well have tagged the characters with GOOD and EVIl in huge capital letters, cause it's so obvious which one is which. The book is so lean on making the hero great that it's insulting.Still, I gave it 2 stars, cause if you're 13-14 you might like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apacolyptic Child's Play","review":"A friend of mine recommended this book to me, saying it was a classic. While the begining was mildly interesting, the overall story just didn't jell for me. There were so many inconsistencies...eg. A gigantic alien war plane that could withstand a nuclear assault, but was blown up by the hero with a simple wrench? I might have suspended belief had the characters been even the slightest bit interesting, but Hubbard's hero, Jonnie, has all the depth of a pizza pan. The story dragged on after about page 200, and the narrative was reminiscent of a Hardy Boys novel. So, while I might recommend this book to a young reader, I would advise others to steer clear. There are simply too many other good books to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"And a child shall lead them...INTO THE ABYSS!","review":"I think I can honestly say Battlefield Earth is the worst novel I have ever read.

How this novel ever get published is a mystery to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of two books...","review":"...I couldn't finish...I wish this site had negative stars, as it would get a bunch...I forced myself, over a long period of time, to try and finish this thing...I trudged through over nine hundred pages, and could take no more...The only reason this became a 'classic' is that the Scientologist each bought multiple copies...No other reason makes sense...Flee from this one, folks..."},{"rating":"2","title":"David and Golieth meets Star Wars.","review":"Everyone loves a hero, and never before has there been a hero like Jonnie Goodboy Tyler. The Psyclo empire all but eradicated mankind from earth in a single barrage of poison gas, not for conquest, but for ore and wealth. Jonnie begins the story living amongst the 30 or so human beings that are in existance in North Americal in the year 3000. Through an endless set of improbable, but exciting and fun events, Jonnie not only frees himself from slavery to a particularly evil Psyclo but also moves on to take on the entire Psyclo empire.

This is without a doubt one of the best books I have ever read, mixing in an unforgettable blend the sci-fi of Star Trek with the adventure of Indiana Jones.

One of my all time favourites"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Science Fiction Epic","review":"I love this book. I've read it four or five times now and find it better each time. The only reason I don't give it five stars is that it IS a bit hokey (i.e., simplistic). But, its sheer massiveness and level of fun outweighs that. A science fiction classic that is well worth reading. WARNING: under no circumstances watch the movie -- that thing sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever written","review":"This book is awesome! Don't believe any of these negative reviews. The book may look long, but I finished it in two weeks because I couldn't put it down for a second. It's great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, capital B BAD","review":"Way over long, considering how one dimensional and boring everyone is. I kept reading thinking it HAS to get better, it doesn't. The movie will have to be better because they have to have cut 80% of the drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Science Fiction","review":"A friend recommended this book to me. I was a little reluctant to start reading a thousand pages by an author I had never read before, but it was worth it. The book is fast paced action for almost the entire thousand pages. The setting is close to home but with sprawling potential. The only drawback is that the characters are all under developed. However, on the whole I would definitly say, \\"read it.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I can't stand two things in regards to this book. The first is people comparing it to that John Travolta crap nebula of a movie. The second is people dismissing this book as \\"scientology claptrap\\". The latter of these people have never even read this book, they just have a problem with Hubbard. Yes, I realize the religion is stupid but this book is quite simply amazing. I read it once a year just to make sure I don't forget salient points. I hate religion including ridiculous scientology, but there is a reason this book won best sci-fi of the century. Read it with half a brain cell and you'll see why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and boring","review":"This is a very long and boring book. Actually, some of the concepts and some of the action is good. If the book were half as long and the characters more believable it wouldn't have been bad. It is dated though and women basically don't exist, not even alien women unless they are in servile roles. Probably all SF from this time period suffered from that so this book can't be blamed for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"This is so bad it is laughable. I mean, this is Ed Wood Plan 9 from Outer Space bad. The plot has holes you could drive either a Vogon Constructor fleet through, or perhaps even one of the Galactic Patrol's anti-matter planet weapons. To be avoided at all costs. Just rubbish. You are far better off with a novelisation of the V tv series, or something, for this sort of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Cure for Insomnia","review":"So bad. Crazy plot, unbelievable characters and 9th grade writing. This has to rank close to the bottom of all Hubbard's work. I got my copy at a used book store. Right now is is outside, propping up the corner of the doghouse. At least I got some use out of it! Avoid this book at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE OF 5-STAR REVIEWS","review":"I was given this book as a Christmas gift this year. After one hour, I stopped reading it. I've read more interesting bus stop signs that this drivel. The character were totally on-dimensional and the story ws severely lacking. As for the good reviews it gets here, they're more likely from Scientologists. I should know since they use to come and buy the books in bulk where I used to work. When we reordered them, we sometimes got back the very books we sold. This method made it seem Hubbard was a best-selling author. Now it has been adapted to the Internet to make look great on this review board. If you want a great Sci-Fi book involving the mind I HIGHLY RECOMMEND William Gibson's \\"Neuromancer.\\" Gibson is a FAR better writer on his worse day than Hubbard on his best one."},{"rating":"1","title":"WATCH OUT!!! It's Abridged.","review":"This version is only 8 hours long. The box even says it's abridged. The unabridged version is 45 hours. I hope I helped out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Roller Coaster","review":"Battlefield Earth is like a great roller coaster - full of ups and downs and twists and turns. About 3/4 into the book, you find yourself thinking the story is over, and yet there are still approximately 300 fun-filled pages left! Hubbard has created a true \\"space opera\\" - bold and big and full of excitement. You'll admire Jonnie Goodboy Tyler's intelligence and resourcefulness, Chrissie's determination and support of Jonnie, and even Terl's good-natured greed and total underestimation of man, the \\"endangered species.\\" Good-natured Scots and Russians are thrown in for you enjoyment. For those of us who have math phobia, Hubbard offers an explanation that just might explain our fears! Just as a great coaster is worth the wait in the queue, this book is worth the 1,000+ pages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Science friction, not science fiction","review":"I thought I would read this book before the summer movie came out. Checked out the rating (4-1/2 stars) and took the plunge. What? This has to be one of the all-time worst science fiction books ever written. The plot is entirely ridiculous, the characters are one-dimensional, and the science (whew!) is rotten. I only finished the book for the entertainment value of seeing just how far L. Ron Hubbard could push the ridiculous. I've been reading (and occasionally writing) science fiction for forty years, and this is the lowest ebb of the genre, the very nadir of its class."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one star is a dying one.","review":"I don't understand how any professional, honest reviewer gave this lump of nothing positive words. Please, please readers - you must understand that any five star review of this book contains more creativity than the story itself. If those are honest reviews, I'm curious about what other books they have read. One star for this scheisse is too generous. I think I read about 200 pages. The writing and characters were so empty; the white spaces between the words overwhelmed the words themselves. It was so bad it made me angry. I ripped it apart. Battlefield Earth, no, more like Bumblebee Enema."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I have been a reader of science fiction for many years and generally enjoy it. However, this is the worse book that I ever read to completion. I found the characters stilted, the plot totally unbelievable, and the writing mediocre at best. I've already spent more time on this review than the book warrants..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time.","review":"The only reason I gave this book one star is because there is no lower rating available. I would have to suspect that Scientologists have been enlisted to give this book favorable ratings in order to put the book in a good light. Hubbard's halting disjointed writing style may be tolerable for a 4th grader but not for anyone of any intelligence. Not only that but he just keeps going on and on and on with this horrible plot and shoddy character development. If you want to read something by a Sci-Fi writer of some note check out \\"Ender's Game\\" by Orson Scott Card. This awful narrative would have been better suited to a 6 or 7 page short story in a magazine with very low circulation."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read, maybe not for everyone, but unique.","review":"BE is unique, a product of a unique writer. Hubbard is certainly not Asimov, nor is Asimov Hemingway or Gogol. Each author and story must be considered individually and taken as nothing more.BE's plot, prose and characters captivated me. I read the book in one week. The development of the alien characters is the book's single greatest strength. BE is rife with amusing, quirky alien personas that kept me picking up the book. In fact the human characters are almost secondary in terms of entertainment value.If you like technically oriented, scientifically sound sci-fi this book might not be for you. At least check out the first 100 pages. Don't confuse BE with Scientology. You wouldn't even know they are by the same author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"For the first 25 pages or so, I couldn't really get into the book. After that, the book was in my hands every train ride to and from school. It is a fantastic book that really makes you feel like you are there, and you almost want to be there to be a part of it. It gives you that same feeling you get after you've just seen an amazing movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the all time best sci-fi books writen.","review":"This story is an all time great. The way it incorperates feelings and emotions makes you feel like your standing there watching everything. This book will make you turn the page again and again and once you've finished you will read it again. Why? Because only a great author could do something like this to his readers"},{"rating":"2","title":"This should be on every sci-fi fan's bookshelf.","review":"BATTLEFIELD EARTH ranks up there with Heinlein's \\"Starship Troopers,\\" Herbert's \\"Dune\\" and Dan Simmons' \\"Hyperion\\" as books any sci-fi fan just HAS to read. (I'm itching to give my whole list...) Hubbard's unique flavor comes from his mastery of satire. Imagine Voltaire writing science fiction (well, he did a little... ;). There are honestly some new, simple takes on old ideas herein that leave you thinking \\"why didn't I think of that?\\" The tapes are great if you are one of those people who can listen to such things while you drive. You may find yourself circling the block to hear the next passage..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexist macho science fiction","review":"Unbelieveable! I find it hard to believe that I have so little to do that I was able to finish this book. I think I was hoping Chrissie (the hero's significant other) would ever become less of a void.

My advice: stick to Simmons or Bradbury."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could this book be any worse?","review":"I had to abandon this absolutely VAPID bit of trash after forcing myself to read six or seven hundred pages.

Can we be more inane?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Human Nationalism","review":"Immediately finishing this book, I actually thought I had enjoyed. I later realized that I had succumbed to a pathetic form of hero worship that the book expounds fully. Some credit should be given for the creation of the \\"Psychlo\\" species, but the book and the author disgust me to no end. First of all, the book is entirely too long, it is not a \\"saga\\" as Hubbard claims because the book is too intellectually sterile to deserve such a title. The book praises humanity and the supposed \\"triumph\\" of the human spirit incessently, and by the end of the book the reader finds himself simultaneously revolted and bored. Moreover, the author is predictable and the great majority of alien species have little depth. At the end, the alien civilizations follow the human example and adopt a democratic system, as if that has proved even marginally effective. Please, save yourself valuable time and read Asimov or Clarke, just read anything instead of this trash. A tremendous disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULLSVILLE!!!","review":"I just couldn't finish this book. The story falls apart after the first hundred pages, and the characters and plot are so dull I kept falling asleep. I kept hoping it would get better, but after page 500, I gave up. I felt like I was watching a never ending b-movie. Overall--a very unpleasant reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Half OK, but the book goes overboard in the end.","review":"I just finished reading this book, once you get past the major battle in the first half the author goes overboard. That the low tech humans in the book could overcome the all obstacles the author puts before them is totally unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readable, but flawed","review":"As a typical Campbellite hero myth, dressed up in a sci-fi cloak, this book is engaging enough. It has enough of a plot and adequate characterization to sustain its length.However, it fails as sci-fi. True science fiction, in my opinion, needs a hook, a concept that justifies its status as speculative fiction. Arthur Clarke has a mysterious spacecraft, Rama; Grege Bear has a physics-defying structure from the future orbiting the earth, and Herbet blends politics and a Messianic religion to create Dune.Battlefied Earth, unfortunately, has none of these. The story could quite easily be transplanted into a mundane setting: make the Psychlos invading Romans, and Johnny and his clan the subjugated Celts of 56 BC, and the story could remain precisely the same. There is no food for thought, no mind-expanding concept. Just typical pulp sci-fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I've never liked juvenile-male science fiction, and this ranks down there with the worst of them. If you get part way through the book and keep going in hope it gets better- DON\\"T BOTHER, it never does - 1000 pages of poorly written cliches."},{"rating":"1","title":"a mistake","review":"I sat down to read this after seeing the trailer for the movie and having a friend suggest it to me as being a good book. That was a mistake. I read half of it before I had to put it down in disgust. I later found out that the reason my friend liked it was that it was stereotypical of the genre to him. I have to agree with him. It has the stereotypical hero, villain and plot. There was no creativity to be found in the book. The writing style was atrocious. With as bad as this book is, I could never suggest to anyone that they read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks","review":"This book helped me through a difficult period in my life. Namely, insomnia. After reading the first few pages of this book, I was quickly asleep. Anyone who truly thinks that this book is good science fiction is either a) stupid or b) a Scientologist. And while there are many stupid people out there, I don't think that there's nearly 300 of them who want to review this book for Amazon. In fact, there are more 5 star reviews here than there are for some Shakespearean plays, and even than for most Tom Clancy or Steven King books (all three of the aformentioned writers can, by the way, write, unlike Mr. Hubbard). This book seriously sucks. I can't stress that enough. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOOONNNNGGGG!","review":"I remember reading this book years ago, when I first got into reading Sci-Fi and had no idea about any of R.L. Hubbards \\"ideals\\" (I was just looking for a good book). All I remember is that the book was good at first but then kept going and going and going....Halfway through the book I was wondering why it hadn't ended yet, 3/4 of the way through I was wishing I had never started it in the first place and then before I got to the end (after about 800 pages) I didn't even care what happened to the characters...I put it down and walked away. It could have ended great several times throughout the book. Maybe he got paid by the word, like Dickens. Never did finish it. I hope for whoever does manage to get through the 1000+ pages that the ending is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I think Hubbard's maxim in writing this book was: \\"Why do in a paragraph what you could make a chapter\\". This book is unbelievably wordy and it was totally unneccessary. In one portion of the book, the main character sits down to a chinese feast. The author fills almost an entire page with a simple list of what he ate, separated by commas (Chicken rolls, fried noodles, ect. Ad nauseum).The characters are totally one dimensional and worthless. The plot is flat, predictable, unbelieveable and boring. The technical details are rediculous.I was lured by the excellent reviews on this site, but frankly I can't understand them.

Dont waste your time with the movie it is more of a parady that \\"if the military jets still worked\\" and werent rusted and old as in the book.

The beginning was cool, but it went downhill from there. I can understand that the author was trying to make Jonny some kind of epic hero (which sometimes works well, as in Dune and Star Wars) but here it just did not work. And how did a planet of 10000 humans overthrow an empire of a billion planets. Somewhere it was explained, but I forgot what exactly it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Elsewhere","review":"The writing in this book is just bad, more like a first novel than a classic.

This book was 1,000+ pages of one-dimensional simplistic drivel. Spare yourself and read Heinlein if you want to read a classic sci fi novel. I'd suggest The Red Planet and Starship Troopers (nothing like the movie)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivations of Perspective","review":"To label this book as 'most favored novel,' as 2008 presidential hopeful Mitt Romney has, is to disclose the source from which you derive your perception of future possibilities. Any 'most favored book' is such because it stands out in the labeler's mind. The labeler carries the ideas and concepts of the book with them throughout their life, using them to develop a personal perspective.

Now, as I look at it again after all these years, I realize that it's actually much, much worse than that. As mentioned in another review, this book would've made a decent comic book or cartoon. But it is NOT good sci-fi, in fact, I don't think it should be classified as sci-fi since that would stink up the whole genre. I tend to classify it as a juvenile scribling which is best left forgotten. L.

My copy of this book said, \\"soon to be a major motion picture\\" - the book was about 15 years old. Only Travolta's deep pockets and belief in Scientology allowed this for this movie to be made.

It had action and adventure in it that I liked, but it also had some boring descriptions and I got lost on the part where he made the pods in Psychlo's heads go onto a metal plate. Other then that though, I thought it was a very interesting book. This is my first book by Hubbard, and I'll make sure I read some more of his. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A 2 Star - which is all Hubbard deserves","review":"As with most of Hubbards work, this is intended for a very young audience, mostly male, and his development and treatment of characters reflect that. It is truly a saga - from both the writers perspective, and the perseverence it takes to plod through it. I made it through, mainly based on my belief that the recommendations I'd heard were justification enough... but alas, it was many days wasted. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand what all the fuss is about...","review":"The movie was terrible. The book was just as bad.It's the year 3000 and Earth has been invaded by alien Psychlos who have more or less exterminated mankind...The idea is a good one but, in my opinion, terribly written. The book reads like a badly written essay. Events happen too quickly and much to easily. I find the thought that a highly advanced alien race can be so easily deceived by people who for hundreds of years have lived as little more than cavemen completely laughable.As with the other LRH books, I cannot understand what makes people give this book such high marks. I'm not SF snob, but this book insulted my intelligence. LRH does not hold a candle to Asimov, Calark, Bova or any of the other more serious SF writers.Chances are, it doesn't matter what I say, you'll probably read this book anyway. Do yourself a favor, though, borrow a copy first.Anyone want mine for free?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh....Wanting it to End","review":"Imagine if you will: a fourteen year old with a word processor, trapped in a basement with nothing else to do. What do you get? Battlefield Earth! You can avidly pinpoint when Hubbard uses Scientology in his writing (i.e. the \\"Pychlos\\"), and all you have to do is look at how he rabidly dislikes modern psychology and psychiatrics. The characters have silly names and are two dimensional. Really, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulp sci-fi. No other way to describe it.","review":"I had to force myself to read half of this book. I thought it was boring and predictable. It got to the point where I was thinking to myself, this is what this or that character is going to do, say, or think next. What a waste of time reading this pulp fiction. 2 stars is too high, but really, 1 star is too low - give it a star and a half."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away!!!","review":"I am curious if Hubbard can write about Scientology, because he sure cannot write interesting science fiction. This book is one of the all time worst novels I have ever read. All the characters are boring, the plot (after the first hundred pages) goes nowhere, and the prose is like that of a ten year old having seen Star Wars for the hundreth time. Sometimes you can judge a book by its cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"This was a great book to read on the kindle! It is one of my all time favorite books. It is very entertaining, exciting and really flows well. I couldn't put it down for several nights of little to no sleep. I highly recommend this book for everyone that likes sci fi or action and adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorite Books","review":"This book was a very exciting read. You could really get inside the head of each of the charachters. The pace and plot were masterful. The worlds he created were rich and full of life.I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's mystifying","review":"Hubbard's self-agrandizing introduction is much more entertaining than the book itself, so do yourself a favor and stop there. Not only is the story flawed, completely unbelievable, and overly simplistic, it's just written badly. Suspension of disbelief is stretched past the breaking point early on, and it only gets worse. Had this book been a 300-pager, it might have worked because the premise is actually quite intriguing. Alas, apparently El-Ron's editors were complete frauds. No editing of any kind was present here -- and it is sorely missed -- so we have a grim tome whose only redeeming quality is never-realized potential. Please don't take that as any type of endorsement. The potential itself is not enough to warrant any effort at reading this book. And believe me, there's considerable effort called for. You actually have to work at finishing this thing. Don't bother. It's just plain bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at best","review":"The idea behind BE is interesting (Earth after an alien race has taken over), but the presentation is amateurish. All of the characters are completely one dimensional, the leaps of logic are glaring and the book is badly in need of an editor (apparently no one was willing to tell ElRon that he needed to edit this thing down.)BE is a classic example of \\"pulp fiction\\" (i.e. quickly written, poorly thought out magazine filler) and, from it's length, ElRon apparently thought he was still writing for 1-cent a word.If you want some GOOD SciFi see Asimov, Heinlein or Bradbury, this is far from their level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battlefield Earth","review":"I just finished reading this book and I think that it is one ofthe best science fiction books I have read. In my opinion it topsDune."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the movie, and then rent the video.","review":"I found this epic to be slow, with few surprises, and not much of a bang at the end. Looking back, I am sorry I spent the time reading through its 1,000 plus pages. Not much of a page turner, although I can see how it might appeal to a young audience. The characters and narration have a very one-dimensional tone--dumbed down for mass circulation--or maybe this is as good as Hubbard gets. Either way, I recommend reading something else. This one's just not worth the trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad plot, thin characters, dull prose","review":"This book encompasses all the weaknesses of L. Ron's science fiction, and extends them by going over 1000 pages. The plot certainly reminds you that Hubbard made his biggest literary splash in the pulp magazines, and he should have stuck to them. He simply didn't know how to write characters that readers would be interested in for more than ten pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BELIEVE THE REVIEWS!!!","review":"Unless the majority of these 5 star reviews are coming from teenage adolescents, there is something alarmingly wrong with the reading level of the general public. Battlefield Earth is the posterboy for the perverbial trash novel. The narration is the stuff of a cripled writer's self indulgent wanderings, the characters so shallow they drown in their own mediocrity, and the plot so tiresome, you need a bottle of no-doze to stay awake. Put this one on your \\"In Another Lifetime\\" reading list. You will thank me unless you pass on to the next plateua in iliiteracy hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy SF","review":"L Ron Hubbard is fondly remembered as being one of the worst of the Golden Age SF writers. He lives up to his reputation in this huge mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"People are over-examining this book","review":"This book was not meant to be a \\"deep\\" sci-fi novel like Asimov's and others. I've read Asimov, Frank Herbert and many other sci-fi greats' work, but this is different. It is more like an epic adventure story than a traditional sci-fi novel. It is to be enjoyed on another level than most other sci-fi. I loved the story and had a hard time putting this book down both times I read it. I have no feelings for or against scientology, so that isn't affecing my review. If you like an exciting story, and want a break from \\"traditional\\" sci-fi, read this book. If you think you are \\"above\\" this type of story, fine go find something else. I for one would reccommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was awful","review":"I thought this book would be in the same genre as Aliens, boy was I wrong. It was so poorly written I couldn't believe it ever got published. And what is with all of the 5 Star reviews, No way it deserves even 1 star but that was the least I could give."},{"rating":"1","title":"30s Pulp","review":"if you enjoy 1930s style pulp sci-fi, this book is enjoyable. If you want a book with some scientific accuracy, fleshed out characters and interesting writing you will hate this book.The story centers around Jonny Goodboy Tyler, the hero and perfect example of everything that was sold as manly in the early part of the last century. One hopes the book does not display the author's opinion of women- all the female characters in the book are mere servants to the men, be it with the humans surviving at a stone age level or the within the galactic society of the aliens.We are also treated to some rather weak jokes (such as the alien lawyers whose distant ancestors were sharks) and bad science (radiation can be washed off with water).Over all I was very dissapointed in the book. It felt like Hubbard was reliving his early years of writing, but had forgotten that in the intervening years the genre had evolved and people actually expect their books to have some literary merit nowadays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably drab","review":"In the prolog, the author brags about how he was known as one of the publisher's most prolific writers, moving from genre to genre as needed. I've been reading Fantasy and Sci-Fi for over 20 years and this is one of the weakest books I've picked up. The basic premise of the story is sound, but the author drones on and on clearly trying to fill pages. In many books, this is accomplished by building character definition and drawing the reader into a world that is crisp and inviting. However, several times in Battlefield the author drives the story to viable closure and then just restarts again in a new direction to fill more pages. I recommend you save yourself some time and choose a different author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair, but not good.","review":"Complete brain candy. That's not necessarily a bad thing. This book is great if you've got lots of time to kill and don't want something that makes you think too hard. Probably the hardest thing about this book is keeping your place in it. Like all of Hubbard's books that I've read it could have been a third as long and still told the same story. Complete space opera, but if that's what you're into then it's worth getting. If you want something more substantial or meaningful try 'Doc' Smith. ; )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not more Hubbard!","review":"I refused to read L. Ron Hubbard long, long before I ever knew what Scientology was. I stumbled across some claptrap or other with his name on it, said \\"Awful\\" and went back to Bradbury, Asimov, Vonnegut and Heinlein. I tried to read this tome, I really did, but it was just terrible. Hubbard might have been really innovative in the 30s and 40s, but compared with the greats who have come after, he's nothing special. This particular work was, like everything else with his name on it, an overblown, confused, chaotic mass of STUFF--not one page of which made any sense. I gave it about six chapters and never did get hooked. If you want classic SF, spend your money on one of the great names of the genre. Shut your eyes and pick out a Robert Heinlein book. You will be much better satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool alien stuff, zero substance.","review":"If you like alien stuff, simple plots, long books with lots of action packed testoerone, this is a book for you.If you prefer literature where characters are complex and well developed, and plots that are complex and unpredictable then you will want to pass on this one.This novel was about action, aliens, and one-dimensional characters going on and on in (often ludicrous) conflict after conflict. On this level I was mildly entertained (I did bother to finish the book).I was bored with the characters, especially Johnny Goodboy Tyler. At times I wanted him killed off just to end the misery. I was begging for a plot twist, for some simple element of intelligent story development. I have seen better writing from a ninth grader.This was the first and very last book of Mr. Hubbard's that I will ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impossible to put down.","review":"I have read this book twice. The first time I got through the 1500 or so pages in TWO days, doing virtually nothing but read. It is that hard to put down. Some may be scared off and wary of Hubbard's scientology background, but to them I would say \\"Put it out of your head and unbiasedly treat BE like the great story it is\\". This is the only Hubbard book I have ever not hated. An incredible contrast to his other work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was fun!","review":"Some people have complained that Battlefield Earth has no artistic merit. True, but if you were looking for a deep, thoughtful book, why would you pick one with aliens and stuff blowing up on the cover? I read it and it was very entertaining. It is better than a lot of other sci-fi/entertainment novels because of its creativity and detail. L. Ron. Hubbard took a worn-out post-invasion story and and made it into an inspiring epic. For a book of its size, it did not drag much and was a good read. I am glad I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is horrible!","review":"The text was simplistic and unchallenging. The women in the book (as well as in the film) were weak afterthoughts - their only role was to be rescued. The book droned on for entirely too long. Rather than being a deep sci-fi novel, it was more of a man verses beast story that happened to involve aliens.I was throughly unimpressed and disappointed. Had it been possible, I would have given the book no stars at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Placement is a pain","review":"I was excited to see that Jabra had come out with a hads-free device that used a boom microphone, but was disapointed almost instantly. The range of adjustments it provides is encouraging, but I could never get it to fit just right. It was never tight enough on the ear, to keep out the road noise and annoying in the way it kept the mic resting against my cheek, adding noise to the conversation. When I would adjust it one way it would throw it out of adjustment another way, because of the design Get the Jabra hands free adapter that is entirely in the ear, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware, the ear clip breaks very easily","review":"Having purchased the Earwrap three weeks ago, I was extremely happy with it, especially the clarity of the calls and the noise cancelling technology. The earwrap clip that wraps around your ear, however, would appear to be a chronic problem with this model. Mine broke in half just today. I talked with a friend who purchased the same model and all of his clips have broken on him as well within a few months of purchase, and the unit comes with three. Hopefully they will improve the material used in the clip because, that aside, it's a great handsfree unit...But that doesn't do much good when it ends up in your lap because the clip broke..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wouldn't fit, then it broke","review":"I lost my generic earbud headset and bought the Jabra EarWrap as a replacement, with high hopes. The unit appears to blend form and function, offering the convenience of a compact hands-free headset with a boom mike for increased outbound audio quality.The reality of the headset was very disappointing. I was unable to secure the headset to my ear in a way that prevented it from flopping around my face with the slightest head movement. I eventually achieved almost satisfactory results by giving the flexible ear attachment hook a good squeeze (it's pliable) each time I put on the headset. This worked until the attachment hook snapped near its base. I returned the headset to my local retailer who reported that the broken ear hook was a recurring problem with this headset design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Audio, Crappy Earhook","review":"I found this phone to be comfortable and the sound quality is great.

And when you use the in-line volume control, it can make half of the stereo sound drop out. I've seen other headphones with in-line volume control do that, but usually only after months, not right out of the box.On the plus side, it doesn't have that irritating \\"cord management\\" thing, where one of the ears has a much longer cord than the other, forcing you to either leave your mp3 player on your left side (which makes SO much sense, since so many of us are left-handed) or have the cord cross in front of you.

So use revivogen with other products. That is the secret. Minoxidil grows thicker hair but like revivogen it will not work by itself bec of DHT. Same thing with revivogen.

As for the proprietary cards, I've found that all the complaints are really moot. The cards are only about [money] more than other \\"standard\\" name brand cards, and worth it for the picture quality.

There's a small but sometimes significant delay between pressing the button and the shot being taken, and the camera does take quite a few seconds to recharge between shots--longer, it seems, than with a conventional camera, especially if you've set the camera to take more detailed, memory-intensive, shots.

I personally like the slim cameras. The time it takes between pictures is WAY too long! Then the screen turns black if you wait too long to take the picture so you have to hit a button to turn the screen back on and that takes another 3 seconds. The zoom feature sometimes doesn't want to close. Also the batteries come out easily because they aren't very secure. I've taken very good care of this camera. I only dropped the camera one time and now I hear a noice when I shake the camera like something is lose inside. The screen now turns black and won't take any pictures.There are better options out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Camera for the Money","review":"Being someone who just takes pictures for fun, I wanted a digital camera that was little bit more than a point-and-click. This camera offered that. The menu is easy to use and for an amateur, it is very easy to get accustomed to. The pictures come out pretty well. The only thing I wish I had on it would be a stronger zoom but for what it does offer, it's not bad. Uploading the photos from the camera to the computer is very easy also. Again, this camera is great for someone who is looking for digital technology but is not exactly the most camera savvy person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera at a Great Price","review":"The Fujifilm Finepix 2650 is a great camera.

It's pictures have always been pretty good and it was very easy to use. I brought it with me on a trip a couple of weeks ago, and when I turned it on, the LCD screen just had a couple of grey lines going across it. After an exhaustive search for solutions to this problem (including phone conversations with the helpline, email inquiries, and a thorough internet search,) I have pretty much determined that it is unfixable (unless I want to pay $90 to have fuji fix it... but wait, can't I buy a new one for that price? oh yeah, so that doesn't make much sense, does it?)I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work right","review":"I thought this would be a good starter phone for my nephew, but when I put batteries in it and tried to take a picture, the screen would go blank.

Technical suport was awful and would not process the warenty b/c the registration had been lost (not my fault- theirs). Bust buy wouldnt do anything because i paid for it by a giftcard. I do not recomend the best buy store to anyone.

I've never been impressed with the photo quality though. This model is too fragile... drop it once and it is dead!

Of course, being a newbie, I have nothing to compare it to, but I'm having a ball! Since it is my first digital, I was impressed with the fact that I was able to use it within minutes of receiving it. I haven't got all the details down pat yet, but I'm working on it. The basics came very easily and I'm not a professional photographer or a computer expert. I've taken short movies as well as pictures, which amazes me!

The LCD screen is just horrible. I had to adjust it to the highest brightness to be able to see indoor and sunset photos, and readjust the brightness to view the pictures taken. When I found the great shots I was looking for on the previewer, I'd go home and download shots that would come out much darker than expected. I'd use the software to lighten the shot, but the quality of the shot would go downhill.In my opinion, I should be able to see what the shot's going to REALLY look like, so I know I've got the right one, before going back to the computer.Also, not so sure 2MP is enough for me.

Unfortunately, the book's presentation isn't simply pedestrian---it is completely muddled. Many elementary points are presented via circular arguments which simply left the students baffled and confused. It is a real pity to see an elegant subject like general relativity butcheredso thoroughly. In retrospect, it would have been far better to first have them read Rindler's ESSENTIALRELATIVITY, and then give them selected excerpts from the elementary track of GRAVITATION by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate","review":"This book is adequate at best. The best thing about it is that it is short. It really leaves out all the physical reasoning behind general relativity and gives the equations necessary to do computations. If this is what you want, then this is definately the book for you. Better books are \\"A Short Course in General relativity\\" or more advanced books like Wald's General Relativity, Misner-Thorne-Wheeler \\"Gravitation\\", and several others.

The first edition tried to introduce (the mathematics of) general relativity, in the \\"geodesics\\" method - i.e., taking the shortest route possible between two points, teaching you the mathematics and basic physical postulates and nothing more. But while the first edition used modern differential geometry, this volume has been entirely re-written in coordinates!!! This means you'll be given the old definition of a tensor as a set of numbers that transform as ... and thus taking away the book's only merit, being a modern, quick, short introduction to the mathematics of GR. Sorry, but even if I wanted a sea of indices (which I don't and no one else should) I could have picked up Weinberg's book.

Now I see reviews on the Target website saying it came down in the rain. I can see where rain would cause it to collapse.

Its characters are very fascinating. The characters I liked were William, Malcolm, the Curries, and Madam Phipp. William is a Narraganset Native American. He was very smart and had a good memory. Malcolm was funny. He was a lady's man, always trying to please women. The Curries are William's English family. They treat William with great respect. Last, but not least is Madam Phipp. She is not easily tricked. The style is excellent. It could change people thoughts really smoothly even though it is kind of confusing. The setting was okay. It let you know what time it was, the weather, and the place. The theme isn't really that clear. I rate this book a 2. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading historical fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plan Boring","review":"Saturnalia is an extreamly BORING book because it doesn't get you into the story.

I would recommend Saturnalia to no one because it is just boring. I just wanted to throw it into a fire because it was so dull. The reason I didn't like it is because I thought the author could of explained the characters better and it was just not detailed. The plot was stupid and the theme was dumb and the style, setting were just really bad. I repeat never read this book to you or anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"All over not a good book!!","review":"Saturnalia was not a good book in my perspective. It had a little bit of humor but not much. It's not that gripping you felt like you could stop reading the book at anytime. It jumped from character to character too much so you would think it be fast moveing but it was really very slow moveing. It was about the Colonial Boston which made it even more unappealing. And so you probably allready know I didn't like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring dont read it","review":"This book i have to say was very boring!! I could never follow along, and i wanted to sleep through it!! I would not recommend this book for any age!! Well maybe an adult!! It maybe a good book for a class to read together like mine did. But i would not read it by yourself . I did not like the whole book put together!! It switched off from characters like every minute!! I could not tell who was narareting this book.

I guess you might find this interesting if you had thechance to read it on your own time, but when it is drawn out for twomonths, it is the most boring thing in the world.

Don't read this unless you have to."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was an okay book.....","review":"Saturnalia wasnt really the type of book i would want to read unless I had to.This year as a class we read Saturnalia.This book is about a apprentice boy named William. The characters in this book we're very discriptive but for the others like plot and style,well i thought it was very slow moving and to dull. Saturnalia was pretty boring in the beggining but when it got to the end where they were trying to figure out all the problems it got to okay. This book is a book where you have to read it in one day to make it interesting because if you stop in one part and another and another it would get very dull and plain.I think all the book SAturnalia needs is a little bit more adventure and a bit more style to make the book come alive with excitement and adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had some funny parts but mostly it was boring","review":"Saturnalia has some good qualities, but also some bad. It is kind of slow moving, so sometimes it gets boring. There is one character, Malcolm, who makes the book a lot better than it would be without him. There are a lot of funny parts with him in it. He was my favorite character. There is a lot of good imformation on colonial time stuff,so if you are looking for a book to read about social studies, then this is a good book, but I wouldn't recommend it for fun reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall not a good book!!","review":"Saturnalia was not the most interesting book in the world. The only thing I liked was the characters. One thing that I really didn't like was the style in which the author wrote because it was confusing and got boring after a while. Taking place in Colonial Boston made it even more unappealing. The book did not have very much action and so that made it unexciting. I still have to say that the characters were good but that is all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm the only one - who found this dull","review":"Rachel Lee was unknown to me when I picked up this book at the used book store.

As the Beeb's Sue Barker said afterwards, it's sad that someone had to lose.One fascinating segment during a change-over shows two of Roger's serves superimposed: the service motion and the point of contact with the ball are identical in both cases, but the ball goes to opposite sides of the service box!The two discs include the warm-up, the entire match, the award ceremony, interviews with both contestants, and footage of Laver, Borg and Sampras congratulating Roger afterwards.Boris's fellow-commentators are Andrew Castle and Tim Henman.

This computer uses a lot of electricity (600 watts) your electric bill will go through the roof!! And the noise this machine makes is unbearable.

I also wanted to learn a lot more about ion propulsion but this was only lightly touched on. There was not a single illustration or graph in this book.

This is the first book I've read by Bittner and, although I enjoy a good historical romance as well as anyone else, I thought this one was truly dreadful. I give it two stars only in recognition of what seems to be historical authenticity - the details of Lakota life were what kept me reading.But apart from the author's obvious respect for the culture she writes about, the plot is predictable, the characters are shallow, the mixing of gory realism and spun-sugar fantasy is just weird, and the writing, though better than a lot of what gets into print, is too often downright amateurish. Maybe some of this will be corrected in the final edition (I read a reviewer's copy).I'm sorry, but this book just doesn't doesn't make the cut. Bittner can tell a story, all right, but let's be honest about what this is - a very humdrum romantic fantasy dressed up in authentic period detail"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Stalking Wolf's vision told him to seek out the woman, Star Dancer, who was blessed by the White Buffalo.

It has been years since I have found such an amazing author as this! It follows history closely. Shows how things were made and the pride of ceremonies.

Finally the only way we could keep them running without a lot of breakdowns, was to scoop the poop and sprinkle some Oxyclean on the pellets on the 1st rinse part of the cycle to clean the pee. We still had to sit with them to make sure nothing stopped in mid cycle and left it full of warm stinky water. We are giving them away, donating them.

Oh yeah, this review was supposed to be about the dvd. Just like my review, this dvd seems to have been created as an after thought. It's terribly produced and very home made. The cuing is awful, and the instructor does not repeat the warm up moves on both sides of the body. The other negative review sums that up pretty well. I got nothing from this workout - the moves are laughingly bad. I didn't have the patience to make it past the 12 minute mark, but played part of it again to give my husband a good laugh.

This game [stinks]!!! Simply put, this is NOT a PC game, its a port from a console game. The camera control is the worst in PC gaming history. No ability to save in the game so you will be playing sequences over and over and over and over. The hand to hand combat would be cool if the camera didn't have a mind of its own and result in your death over and over and over. Don't even attempt this game without a gamepad, the keyboard and mouse controller are terrible. The shooting interface is so bad you might as well not even use it. graphics are only fair for the system requirements.If you want a great Indiana Jones game get The Infernal Machine.If you're into self torture and repeating the same sequences over and over and over and over, this is your game. If you want a fun gaming experience get something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll be sorry!!","review":"This has to be the worst game that Lucas Arts has ever released. The movement controls are the worst I've ever experienced in any game. Paired with the endless fighting scenes that are hard to control, you'll want to tear your hair out. You have to go through seemingly endless screens just to load, save, or quit.But the worst thing is that there's no quicksave mode, so if you die near the end of a particularly stupid level, you have to go back and start the whole level again. Endless frustration.The last Indiana Jones game, \\"The Infernal Machine\\" was superb, one of my favorite games of all time! It was highly playable, with wonderful puzzles and great controls. \\"Emperor's Tomb\\" is as close to the exact opposite as you could get."},{"rating":"1","title":"No strafe controls? What were they thinking.","review":"I'll add my voice to others here pointing out the bad controls for this game. Specifically the lack of sideways movement makes navigating near walls confusing if not downright dizzying. Stopping the character puts the camera into automatic \\"freelook\\" mode allowing you to pan the view all around Indy. The problem is that when you resume action, the camera and Mr. Jones are reconciled in nauseating, Blair Witch style flurry of camera movement.On behalf of every gamer I know I'd like to send the following message to game developers: QUIT SCREWING WITH THE GAME CONTROLS. We're sick of it! Potentially good games are being destroyed by these \\"creative\\" control systems. Indiana Jones is just one more victim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mature Rating for this game.","review":"It surprised me that the rating is still pending for the Emperor's Tomb. After playing the Infernal Machine and then seeing trailers and screen shots for the Emperor's Tomb I have no doubt about the rating it should receive.This is a MUCH MORE VIOLENT game then other Indiana Jones' games. Indiana can now use chairs, tables, etc to bash his opponents over the head. He punches alot more with a great deal of hand to hand violence. Including punching and knocking people off roof tops so they fall to their death screaming.Parents should really take the time to view to see if it appropriate for their child. It is far more violent then other Indiana Jones' games and is perhaps the first time I have considered not purchasing a game due to its violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy controls","review":"If it was not for the controls, that game would have been great! Graphics are gorgeous. The story holds you spellbound. Fist fights are fun. But those controls are a real killjoy. Even after hours of playing, you can't get acustomed to the fact that Indy's movements are based on the camera position and not Indy himself. So if you happen to have Indy facing you (wall behind his back), he'll move forward if you hit the backward key, go right when the left move key is punched and vice versa! And as soon as the angle of the camera changes, all movements change. It got on my nerves so much that I quit playing the game 4 levels through.Piece of advice: go the official web site, download the demo and try for yourself before buying the game.Great disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Potential","review":"The game play for Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb is very poor. As others have said, there is no save option in this game, and the exit and loading screens are very confusing and unnecessary. The camera panning is horrible. You have to move the mouse and the keys to control the character and it takes a lot of getting used to. Although the sound and graphics is excellent, and I had some fun with the fighting, it's too much of a hassle to control the character.I will echo what someone else said about the tram sequence being one of the most pointless in PC gaming history."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dissapointing game for Indy","review":"When i heard about the release of this game i was very excited and anticipated a great game.

My problem with it is that there is entirely too much dependence on Indy's whip to get around. In some cases getting to the object I needed took so much effort that it just wasn't worth it. Also, the inability to save at crucial parts is non existant, the player is forced to go all the way back to the beginning of the chapter to try whatever he was doing again.

This book and it's methods not only saved me and gave me a new outlook on the issues, but helped me to deal with the important issues first and to help my son to turn around which he did willingly almost all on his own in about 2 months of time using the methods in this book. 7 years later my 15 year old son is giving me trouble, I dusted off the book and within a day we both had new attitudes and ways of dealing with each other to respect both our needs! I highly recommend this book and approach. It allows you to grow up independent, respectful young adults and keep your sanity too! Regain your life and find some peace. Good luck and good reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book and funny too!","review":"This is a great book! It teaches about lying but in a funny way. One of the lines paraphrased says that \\"and they cubs told the biggest whopper ever told in Bear County.\\" That always gets a laugh in our house - \\"whopper\\" is quite funny to a toddler! But after you explain it, it has a new meaning and really provides a way to explain lying. This book has brother and sister playing ball in the house when they're not supposed to and wind up breaking mama's favorite lamp. Then, they lie about it and lose mama's trust. After they apologize, they don't do it again but they learn that they have to regain their mother's trust in their word all over again. It's a fantastic book to teach about lying and the results thereof.I highly recommend this book -it's read almost nightly in our house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaching but not preaching","review":"The Berenstain Bears books are my son's favorite this month (preferences at this age die quickly). Each of the books has a nice story to tell, with a morale that is not hard to communicate to a 3 or 4 year old. The good illustrations make reading the stories fun and the format of thebook is perfect for travel, when you don't need a 5 pound children's treasury to carry along as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Wonderful! This book shows Brother and Sister are bored. Sister mentions some ideas, but Brother doesn't want to do any of them. Finally Brother tries to kick his soccer ball past Sister, but she blocks it.

My mother used it as a teaching tool for why we should tell the truth. My only note is that Amazon needs to update the Authors Info.

Everything from his background to his discography, and the discography is not only a list, it tells all about his songs and albums. The only reason I did not give it a 5 was because it did not have too many pictures, and the few it had, I did not think they were that good.

The padding on the top of the case is too thick and it presses the keys when you try to close the lid. I wasn't going to force it closed. Everything sits in the case upside down if you use the backpack straps, which were really uncomfortable. The plastic part that clips after you loop it through the case was digging into my back. The case was empty and it really hurt. I can't imagine if my bassoon had been in it. I wouldn't reccomend this case. Only if you could somehow have the padding on the inside reduced and only use the hand and shoulder straps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bassoon case","review":"I purchased this along with the shoulder straps so my son could carry his bassoon home from school like a backpack. The case the school provided was very heavy and awkward to carry. This case is lightweight but very sturdy, and his school-issued bassoon fits tightly (which his instructor said was good). The best feature is the shoulder strap attachment which we bought separately. It is true that when using it as a backpack that the case hangs upside down, but so far that hasn't proven to be a problem. The external pocket easily fits all of his music books, reed case, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"My dogs loved it!","review":"I have two dogs - a jindo and a lhasa apso, varying greatly in size, personality, and likes.

The first thing I noticed was that everything seemed more focused. All the songs had a very formulaic structure, which certainly isn't a bad thing in rock music. Where South Of Sideways struggled to keep the listeners attention, We're Not Robots makes up for ten-fold, with urgent vocals and big sing-a-long chorus'. A year ago I would have told you that Edgewater were a boring and immature group of musicians, but after listening to We're Not Robots, I've changed my mind.Some people have compared the style on Robots to that of an early Linkin Park. I say, what's wrong with that? Linkin Park have put out some of the most solid records in the rock music world. In any case, though, it'd be hard to draw much comparison to Linkin Park, aside from some well placed digital tracks and dreamy chorus'. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's too bad..","review":"I waited for Edgewater's sophomore debut with baited breath! I really thought they could top the wonderful mixture of songs on \\"South of Sideways\\"....didn't happen. I have to say I was really disappointed with this album.At least in the first album the music flowed right along with the clear-as-a-bell lyrics, this album is full of screaming and herky-jerky riffs. It's almost as if they couldn't decide what sound they wanted, every song is a jumbled mess of chords. The album sounded like a mixture of Linkin Park and Jet. It's too bad, I hope their third offering is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edgewaters new album","review":"The first song is GREAT, but after that the album just doesNOT compare to the first one.

Piszkiewicz is not a historian and his attempt to hide behind psuedo-historical wording still cannot hide his obvious bias against von Braun. I wrote my MA thesis on von Braun and his Team and these men were not Nazis. Von Braun gets labeled (Neufeld for one) as an opportunist, like that is a bad thing. If I had to choose between the USSR and the USA, darn right I would go with the Americans. Thankfully, von Braun and his team did come to America and were the foundation of our booster program that led to the incredible Saturn V which landed Americans on the moon. Von Braun is a great American Hero, warts and all. There are numerous books out there much better than this shallow attempt at character assassination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wernher Von Braun: The man who sold the moon","review":"the author had a hidden agenda when he wrote this book of linking Von Braun to Nazi atrocities. That agenda clouded his ability to write a clear perspective of Von Braun's career. He brings in other historians with a similar bent and refers to their opinions when making his points.

The only saving grace is a few bits of information that if surfaced on the US space program not found in other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A New History?

A pragmatic and egocentric character. A potentially dangerous man.A very good book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fair bio..","review":"The author of this book had (as a previous reviewer stated) a hidden agenda, I think, in writing this book...Mr. uh, Piszkiewicz (?), obviously doesn't like Mr. von Braun, and was out to paint him in a bad light.

He took rocketry from the simple missiles used by the military all the way through the space race years to finally achieving his dream of putting men on the moon with his Saturn V rocket. He was overall responsible for arguably humanity's greatest ever achievement, that of putting a man on the moon.Unfortunately, Dennis Piszkiewicz seems to have made it *his* life's work to smear Von Braun because of his SS officer past. But the only crime against humanity he is able to link Von Braun to is the fact that slave labor was used by the Nazis to manufacture the V2 rockets that Von Braun designed. Cue another best selling book about the Nazis.Unless you're vindictive and Nazi obsessed like our friend Dennis here try another book instead of this spiteful rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"David Wilhite is a bore.

It cooks my food well, it weights hardly anything and it's AFFORDABLE(about 1/4 the cost of other mess kits). I don't normally use the smaller sauce pan, but I like having it to keep in my Bug Out Bag or loan it out to friends. I have been rough with these pots as well, cooking over roaring fires and cleaning them out in rocky creeks. I normally use steel wool to clean the outside of them off when I get home. The handles on top of the lid come loose sometimes, but after a turn or two they are snug and tight. The handles on the side can be a little hard to get to stay put, and often fall back against the pot. I was worried about them melting but they show zero sign of such.

That is all it is worth at best.Everything about the pots, pans, lids and handles are cheap and poorly made.Cheap cheap cheap. Made in China cheap.I am so glad I am only out a twenty spot on these emabarasingly poorly made pots and pans.If you are looking for a good, non-stick, anodized set of cookware for camping, hiking, and/or backpacking - purchase something else.

I got neither.Freewheeling tells the story of Richard Grant Jr., a man who was born into a wealthy family, was uncertain about his future, but succeeded anyway because of his last name. What I thought would be an inspiring \\"rags to riches\\" success story turns out instead to be a biography of a guy with little direction who had a love for cars and boats. Richard's father, Grant Sr., appears to be the real inspiration in the family. It would be interesting to read a book about his life and his ascension to success and fame.Grant readily admits that his last name helped him.

As the previous reviewer noted, it also gives a nice look at some of the early relationships between Lincoln and his cabinet. There is also a good chapter from the Confederacy's point of view and a closing chapter on how historians had viewed Lincoln and his decision regarding Ft.

There is no way on earth you could get me to buy anything past season 2. Season 1 was excellent, season 2 had a few edits but nothing too noticeable. Seasons 3, 4 and 5 were edited to such a degree that the show was no longer enjoyable. Paramount, you blew it! Do yourselves a favor and look elsewhere for the proper versions of the show.

It is the 11th book in the fantasy Redwall series. What is interesting about this series is that most of the books are stand alones.The peaceful animals that inhabit the Abby of Redwall are under attack by mysterious creatures known as Marlfoxes. These deadly creatures can appear and disappear at any given moment. And on top of that, the great Tapestry of Martin the Warrior, the great jewel of Redwall, has been stolen.It's up to the squirrel warrior Dann Reguba and the squirrel maid Song Swifteye with the help of a shrew named Dippler to get the tapestry back. They must cross the hidden lake and penetrate the island castle of Marl.This book was one of my favorites in the series because of the shocking endings of each chapter. They left me wanting to read more. I recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"my review","review":"The author of my book is Brian Jaques and the name of the book is Marlfox (Redwall,) It is a very good fantasy book.The plot ofthis book is that there are some creatures trying to get to Redwall, but there is one problem (the marlfox.)This book is very good and I think that it is sutable for people ages 10 or up just depending on the kid's reading ability and whether or not he/she gets scared very easily. I would recommend this book because there is a lot of suspense and a little bit of mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marlfox","review":"The title of my book is called Marlfox. The author's name is Brian Jaques. The type of book this is, is fantasy.This is about four groups of people trying to warn the Abbey of Redwall that Marlfoxes are in Mossflower. The four groups met the Marlfoxes by being attacked by them. Marlfoxes can dissappear to get away from their enemys. The Marlfoxes are trying to steal a tapestry from Redwall Abbey that has Martin the Warrior on it, which is Redwall's most valuable possesion. The four groups have to warn Redwall and fight off the Marlfoxes.I really liked this book because it has alot of action and its somewhat funny. The Redwall series of all. I think this book is the best suited for people who like action and fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Best series ever!","review":"Hey, my name is Dana. I absolutley LOVE the Redwall series. They are immensly intriguing. I found all 11 of them very difficult to put down. I bring my books with me everywhere. I, honestly, have read all of them atleast 2 or 3 times, some of them 4! Brian Jacques is the main writer who's inspired me to become a writer myself, through his work. I hope he continues to write more & more great storys. I have no doubt in my mind that he will!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought that Marlfox was cool!!","review":"I have read most of the Redwall books and I think that Marlfox is one of the best.

I was captivated by his in depth descriptions of charactars and his vivid imagination.The books get better and better as the series progresses.If anyone needs a great book, you should start this series with his book titled, \\"Redwall\\". Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marlfox","review":"No beast living can hide from thee o, thou who treads invisibly o'er hill and vale, Marlfox! Marlfox! Marlfox! No book is a match for Brian Jacques's Marlfox! It will keep you waiting to see the next page and the next. This is one book you won't want to put down; then you'll read it again! A long time ago a vixen and her mate were cast out from Redwall and never seen again. Thirty years later, the seven offspring have come to kill all those who cast out their parents. The seven vixen have axes made of magic silver and an army and each time they come from a town all you can hear are the screams of agony and pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the 1st Redwall book","review":"I think Marlfox could've been MUCH better. It seems that very few of the Redwall books are as good as the original and I think Marlfox is a good example.The Marlfoxes are ruthless and cruel characters, and the heroes must, as usual, defeat them. Past lessons, cruelties, and triumphs of the previous Redwall books seem to echo throughout. Padding, and tons of it, are also throughout the book in the form of songs which I got so tired of finding that I skipped past them and back into the story. I wouldn't recommended Marlfox to someone new who wants to check out the series, it's definatly not one of Jacques best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jacques continues to write amazing new stories","review":"An evil new prescence has arrived in Redwall, the Marlfoxes.The Marlfoxes are out to harm the creatures of Redwall.

If you've never read a Redwall series book you are missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book!","review":"Marlfox is a great book. This is proboably one of Brian Jacques best. It is a mysterious and eerie book. If you love redwall you do'nt want to miss this one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, magical book","review":"This is a great book for anyone waiting for the next Harry Potter book. Marlfox is like Harry Potter with just a bit less magic and with, well, animals instead of people. Exciting, amazing, and suspenseful, are the perfect words to discribe this book. When magical foxes (Marlfoxes) who can disapper and reappersteal from the Redwall Abbey, it's up to a band of four unlikly friends to retrive and return the Abbey's prize possesion: the taprestry of Martain the Warrior. All of the creatures in Redwall have there strenths and weaknesses, and I'm sure you can relate to (at least) one of them. This is my favorite Redwall book other than The Outcast of Redwall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marlfox Review","review":"This book was very good. The Redwallers need to defend themselves from yet another evil villain. This time it is the fleet, speedy, and possibly magic foxes from Castle Marl. It is very exciting.I do not want to give anything away so I will just say that Brian Jacques has written another amazing book about the animals from Redwall Abbey. He has made many great books in this series, and this book is just as good, if not better, than the rest. It was my favorite book that I've read this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jacques New Book Is EXTREMELY Good!!!","review":"I just read this book and WOW! It blew me away! Jacques has the gift to take a familiar plot, and make it seem totally different. From the evil Marlfoxes to the cheerful Noonvale players, Jacques astounded me. I highly reccomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great suggestion of a beautiful heroine!","review":"This book gives voice to people that girls are able to lead a daring group into an escapade that not even a man would risk. A heroine, hero, and friends go to banish evil from the Woods for once and for all. Who knew young ones like me could save the day? Brian Jaques did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooky, creepy, fun!","review":"This is one of my faves, playing around with the mysterious. The marlfox named Mokkan seemed to be the major villian. I liked the reputation the marlfoxes had, and how the other characters had heard terrifying stories about them. I also like the continuity used in this book and others written by Jacques. In this one Arven, a character who has appeared in two other books, is mentioned as an abbot. Also, read Salamandastron before this. A secret in Marlfox will appear quicker to you if you do. How? Find out for yourself! MUST READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RIVETING!","review":"The book Marlfox is about a group of mystical foxes who travelto Redwall Abbey in hopes of plundering and taking over. Their planis to take their treasure back to Castle Marl for their evil and greedy mother. Can the simple country folk of Redwall survive this vicious attack? What I really like about this book is the fact that the plot twists around and has you thinking one thing but something totaly different occurs. I also like how the author goes onto such detail describing the great feasts that Redwall often has. This is a wonderful book with deliteful characters, I give it a full five stars. I would recommend this tale to people of any age who love adventure and comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Mr. Jacques at his BEST!!!!","review":"This is an excellent book filled with adventure and fun. I enjoyed the plot, the characters, and everything else. It brings a new twist to Redwall and adds a couple of new characters, such as the watervole, the osprey and Malfoxes. I enjoy both the vermin and the Redwallers. One tip for BJ though... there should have been something to do with Salamandastron. It would probably enhance the plot. This book leaves you at the edge of your seat and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marlfox-A Tale From Redwall","review":"Marlfox is a great book! It is a tale about the evil MARLFOXES who have chosen the most precious target(besides SALAMANDASTRON) in the MOSSFLOWER WOODS, THE REDWALL ABBEY! When I read this book it gave me mixed feelings. I recomend this book for readers who don't mind violence but like their imagination to flow till the end of the book.

She likes all of the Redwall books, plus the Warriors, Guardians of Ga'Hoole, Survivors, and The Named (Ratha)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not that good","review":"There are a number of things that I do not like about this book; the lack of any major battles (like the one in \\"The Long Patrol\\"), the absence of hares,etc. This book is definitely not as good as others in the series. It was somewhat of a disapointment. I would not reccomend it to anyone but a true Redwall fan. If you are new to the series, read \\"Redwall\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's getting old Mr. Jaques...","review":"I could stomach Pearls of Lutra. The Long Patrol was so-so at best. By the time I hit Marlfox, I was sick to death of the same plot...you've got the rhyme, the evil and horrible vermin, the cute but annoying Dibbun, the brave hero with Martin's sword(who is NEVER a female), and the Zen master abbot/abbess. I've heard that *Legend of Luke* is much better, but it'll take a lot more to get me to read it than Mossflower or The Bell Maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst in the series","review":"I have been a fan of the Redwall franchise since '96 or '97. I've read all of them, but I have to say this is one of the worst in the series. It's like reading Mattimeo (one of the best ones) again, except it's a lot more boring and very predictable. Another thing is the characters, they aren't very appealing, like Florian, he's kind of like Jar Jar from Star Wars. Also, the parent's in this book seem like they did not care about their kids exploring alone. I mean, they hardly talk about them, What's up with that? And another thing. Why does every adventure (excluding the ones with Martin the Warrior) have to take place in the land of Mossflower? Jacques has to expand to some foreign land, or something. The only reason I that I would recommend this book would be to fill in the gap between the 10th and 12th novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far out-do's them all!","review":"I can only say one true thing... WOW! Marlfox is a facinating tale of the Redwall characters. As a novel of redwall I feel that this book outdo's them all! YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!

Much better than the ones I have had before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foggy","review":"The fit is comfortable but it fogs even though I applied anti-fog gel on it at many times. I eneded up using my old snorkel set on my vacation since this one had limited visibility. I would not buy it again, it is not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The mask and snorkel I received was by BodyGlove, not PROMATE, as advertised. I did not actually use the mask, as it arrived after I left for my vacation (through absolutely NO fault of amazon or the dealer), so I don't know how well it performs. Unfortunately, the mask was a little too small for me, so I will be returning it. Otherwise, I love the bright pink color!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great on all accounts","review":"it was comfortable, no water entered the mask or the snorkel, and i liked the price too. I took it snorkeling in the warm waters of the Mexican Riviera and it worked wonderfully. I even dove down to a depth of about 10-12 feet to grab a conche shell & came up w/o any water in the snorkel. However, if you push/breathe air out of the snorkel (i.e. exhale) while it is submerged then it will fill with water. But, if you hold your breath then it really does keep its seal. Would recommend this. And, I enjoyed the feature on the mask that lets me exhale out my nose. I've never had a mask like that before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the Money","review":"The ProMate Snorkel was an excellent snorkel: great seal on the mask, sturdy clasps on the head band, good anti-fogging properties, and an awesome snorkel with valve that REALLY WORKS!A truly excellent mask for the price.

Better to buy one and bring it with you on your next trip then rent one, fo sho."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but Fogs Easily","review":"I recently purchased this snorkel for my 1-week trip to Maui. I snorkeled every day of the week, and everything went very well. Really liked the big-ness of the actual goggles themselves. Also, the pink snorkel made it easy for other members of my group to keep track of where I was above water, which is important especially if you plan to snorkel way out from the beach! However, this snorkel features the ability to blow out air through your nose, and because of that then it makes for goggles that can fog pretty easily. I tried using sea drops, which only worked marginally well. Funny enough, plain old spit seemed to work even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Water Free","review":"First off I'm not an expert at snorkeling, but I have spent a good amount of time snorkeling. This is one of the better mask sets I have used. The Snorkel is wonderful. The automatic closing never had any problems keeping the water out, and the purge on the bottom did a great job if water did get in, which was only when I let the snorkel out of my mouth. The mouth piece is very soft and didn't cause much fatigue. The mask sealed well to my face, and I never had any leaks. This is an amazing mask /snorkel set and highly recommend it for anyone from novice to intermediate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great snorkel mask","review":"The mask is comfortable and the snorkel works excellent closing when going underwater. Found it best to use snorkle on left side so mouthpiece is at the correct angle. Does not leak at all and able to snorkle for hours at a time without it being too tight or discomort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought for my trip to Hawaii","review":"Product came in time for my trip to Hawaii.

Price was right."},{"rating":"2","title":"like it","review":"my husband worse it for his first-ever snorkel experience & did quite well with it. He said it was comfortable, he didn't get water in his tube, and he snorkeled for well over two hours. I have a similar one for women & i can say that I didn't get any water in my tube even when I dove down to 10-12 ft. That is, if I exhaled, I did get water in the tube, but as long as I held my breathe, it was fine. The mask also has vents so you can exhale through your nose."},{"rating":"2","title":"This snorkel truly is dry!","review":"Just got back from our wedding and honeymoon in Riviera Maya, Mexico, and couldn't have been more pleased with the snorkel and mask. I bought the set a little over a week before we left. We invited our families down with us, and everyone who swam in the ocean tried out my snorkel and mask (we cleaned them first, of course), and were very reluctant to give them back to me! My nephew who was previously afraid of being in the ocean was thrilled to use this snorkel, and overcame his fear rather quickly.It was awesome to be able to go under water with the snorkel, without worry of ending up with a bunch of water in your throat. Honestly, I kept forgetting about the purge mask feature, so I can't really comment much about that...although my husband tried it out, and said it worked well. I definitely recommend this set to anyone looking for a reasonably-priced snorkel and mask."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"The title of this book, as well as the description, strongly suggest that it covers circuits. Unfortunately, it appears that in this case, the meaning of \\"circuit\\" has been hijacked by PLC industry practitioners and assigned a jargon definition that most closely approximates the existing words \\"Program\\", \\"Algorithm\\", \\"Procedure\\", or \\"Sequence\\".As you can see, none of these words has much to do with describing:a: the complete path of an electric current including, usually, the source of electric energy.b : an assemblage of electronic elements.which are both meanings of the word \\"circuit\\" that can actually be found in a dictionary.If you are a USER of certain families of PLCs, perhaps this book will be of some use. However, at $50, I would strongly suggest just reading the PLC manual.If you intend to DESIGN a PLC, this book will be of absolutely NO USE, whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total ripoff","review":"The title on Amazon is: \\"Christina Aguilera: More Than a Woman by Christina Aguilera\\".

I was wrong. This was an amateur production with the ENTIRE film taking place at the dinner table. Yes...the entire film. I was expecting at some point the audience would see the scientist (main character)at work, play or doing a love scene. But no, all we see is dialogue, dialogue, dialogue. The discussions at the table (which are with the main characters family) range from healthcare, science and relationships. There are some funny jokes made from one family member but overall the film remains a the same pace. A bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concert if it could be heard clearly","review":"I was anxious to watch this DVD but I was dissappointed when I played it. The picture quality is not great, but it is to be expected from an import. The problem is that the audio track has a background hissing that gets louder as you increase the volume. Very annoying and makes it hard to watch this concert.

I have three book collections and I was looking forward to adding another to my library but I was really disappointed when I opened the box. The quality is fine (you can never go wrong with a Wiley cartoon)- but the quantity is not worth the price. Advice for future purchases - check the technical specs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Production quality wipes away the smile","review":"This hilarious little booklet contains the funniest Non-sequitur comic strips containing the \\"What She Said/What He Heard\\" theme.

What a shame the production values weren't as high as the comic value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny but skinny","review":"The book is so funny because it is so true! Great illustrations that really add to the humor. This stuff is worth posting on the breakroom wall or on the refrigerator at home. Only complaint - the book is too small and too few pages. Miller's illustrations deserve a larger page, and I would have liked to see more content ... for that price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighthearted look at the differences in gender","review":"This is another one of the books in the \\"Male and female fundamental incompatibility\\" genre. Expressed in the form of cartoons with text, many of them have the \\"(S)he said, (S)he heard\\" form. Some of them are quite funny, relationships between the sexes have always been difficult, and so while there is a great deal of exaggeration, in most cases there is a germ of truth inside the humor.

It shows a lot of Hawaiiam scenery, and gives a historic perspective, as it was filmed shortly after Hawaii became a U.S. state and before the really big tourist boom. It also features Coco Palms, the best and most famous resort on Kauai, that was damaged by hurricane Iniki in 1992 and has yet to be rebuilt.

The music isn't the usual bad Elvis movie music and the scenery is to doe for. The storyline could come from any family - a son trying to be independent, a father who wants son to follow in his footsteps, a dropdead gorgeous girlfriend who just isn't what HIS folks had in mind, outrageous friends and an airhead, over-protective mama dead-set on embarrassing the son at any given chance.

Blues, and had a worldwide smash, cementing the musical-comedy path which his film career doggedly followed for another eight years.The film isn't a bad one. The comedy playing by Angela Lansbury and Roland Winters is nicley turned; Elvis sings well, even on the lesser numbers, while the scenery steals every scene.

Elvis sings, dances and sleeps right on the beach along with his adoring flock of girls. The real treat is that this is the movie with the two most adored Elvis love songs: Can't Help Falling in Love with You and Hawaiian Wedding Song. If you want good clean fun, the King at his best, and unspoiled Hawai'ian settings, this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for my daughter.","review":"I bought the DVD as a birthday gift for my daughter, so I haven't watched it myself.

Many of Honolulu's landmarks are recognizeable in this film, such as Diamond Head and Ala Moana Park.One of the great things about this movie is how much fun Elvis looks like he's having while doing it. Even the comedies made nowadays look as if the people involved with them wished they could get them over with so they can get to the nearest pro-al-Qaida rally. In sharp contrast, Elvis looks as if he's doing the movie to have a good time and he wants to take you along for the ride as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Hawaii is a classic","review":"If you love Hawaii and were lucky enough or young enough to visit there in the 1960's or even 70's, you will enjoy this campy Elvis movie that was somewhere between his early days and when the movies started to become a bit much if bad. Hawaii used to actually look like this and the movie was really filmed there! If you look up Blue Hawaii on Google you can get the history of the filming there. I give this DVD to first time visitors to Hawaii so that they know what it kind of used to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD make a classic better","review":"This is one of Elvis' best movies and the DVD gives the viewer a much better look.

It appears they decided to lighten it up, although I'm not sure if they were going for full out comedy. The result is a strange mess that succeeds neither as comedy or as detective mystery. Warren William overplays the detective hired by various people to locate a horn full of jewels. Bette Davis overplays the femme fatale, and various character actors overplay the rest of the gang looking for the horn. The mystery is a bit confusing, despite the fact I have read the book and seen the superior 1941 version. I guess you could kindly say this version is offbeat. It was too offbeat for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad Satan didn't meet a director","review":"I have tried to watch \\"Satan Met a Lady\\" quite a few times now, because I have seen some good performances by the lead, Warren William, but this is one bad movie. I don't know what happened, but William just weirded out on this awful version of \\"The Maltese Falcon\\". Bette isn't much help, Arthur Treacher slightly better than Bette. Those who made this picture must have had some vision in mind, but the message remains arcane. I don't understand why Warren William is directed in this bizarre way--it seemed a suicide mission in terms of outlandish histrionics.

This latest work of Cook started out as just boring, soon escalated to annoying and ended up thoroughly disappointing. Cook needs to stop producing books from the same tired mold. (strong, competent yet mistreated female Dr.; poor little sick child; neanderthal-thinking men; profit obsessed & ruthless hospital administrators and insurance companies as the villians) We have all seen this in his past works and Toxin is yet another churning out of the same old theme. It worked well before but its time to move on. Has Cook's fame and notoriety have left him out of touch with his reading public?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too rich to think?","review":"From the past experience, Robin Cook's books are entertaining to a point, not usually the best character developer, and almost all stories were formed from a same mold, but, nevertheless, entertaining... This book was first came from the same model; second, out of charcter characters; third, single, one-dimentional storyline; fourth.... I'm sorry that I can't say enough unpleasnt details in such a small space. Also, the abridgement of the audio book was poorly done.

Very disappointed was the review from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER THAN CHROMOSONE 6","review":"I enjoy Robin Cook's books - I think I've read them all. This book is one of his better ones. The plot kept me interested throughout and the descriptions of the slaughterhouse bothered me, but not enough to give up beef. I think there is nothing more tragic than having to bury one of your children, especially the way Kim's daughter Becky died. (By the way, the synopsis of this book says that Kim's SON gets sick and dies. Where did that come from?!?) I didn't buy the sudden reconciliation of Kim and Tracy, though, and the ending was pretty weak.

My guess is that Dr Cook worte it during a depressing period in his life. It shows the dark side of life, where profits are everything.One question remains in my mind: How true is it?

The protagonist is supposed to be an ego-driven surgeon but he is more of a sociopath than anything.

The premise of tainted meat stands but the plot is unbelievable, the ending dangles and why would a cardiac surgeon go around beating up on people and risk breaking his hands?

The only thing I got out of it was the insight on how burgers are made."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good theme, but ridiculous...","review":"An informative disclosure of the dark side of the meat industry. It also made me scream. Not at the industry, but at the ridiculous acts of Dr. Riggies.I just cant believe a well educated professional who was told as one of the best surgeon could act like an irrational bull. All those phsicological explanation made by his wife did not justify his destructive actions. Dr. Reggie does not has a head of calm and precision he supposed to have. How could he make a self-defense killing become a fully certified murder by running away from the scene with leaving the weapon behind intentionally?The total effort just make his accuse to the meat industry weakened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxin","review":"Cook suffers from an inability to write dialogue. This was the worst. How could we feel sorry for Kim and change our own meat-eating ways, as was obvious that Cook was trying to do, when we could in no way ally ourselves with the main character. As are many of Cook's characters, he was brash, rude, arrogant, and totally unbelievable. It's time for Cook to quit preaching and start writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cook Cooks up a barely digestible concoction","review":"I admit. I have been a big fan of Dr. Cook. In fact I will read his next book as soon as it comes out - out of habit and because he has entertained well in the past. But face it, the man is burnt out. His characters are cartoons whose dimesionality makes Bugs Bunny look 4-D! In his recent books he is pushing an agenda here or his opinion there. Well that is his prerogative. He can choose to write fiction that is fairly boring. How long his loyal readers are going to suffer...I may read his next book, but after that...well lets just wait and see. In the meantime - just buy irradiated burgers and fire up that grill."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Toxic Novel","review":"Dr. Cook is a good writer, but for some reason he \\"mailed it in\\" with this novel.\\"Toxin\\" is a diatribe against managed care, the meat industry and the soul-less corporations that corrupt our government. Those are worthy topics. But for some reason the author could not decide whether he was writing a suspense, or a comical farce.No explanation is ever offered for how a paranoid man with zero impulse control and no grasp of social norms and no faith in the local social order ever became a respected surgeon.The reader is left asking \\"Do I care about Dr. Kim Reggis?\\" And if you have to ask, then the question is a resounding \\"No!\\"Leave \\"Toxin\\" in the dump.Marty Bacon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been good","review":"The book starts out promisingly, but goes rapidly downhill from there. The characters go from interesting to cardboard in the space of a dozen pages, and the additional bad guys are way too assuming that they can't get caught. The most interesting character in the story is the hired hitman from Chicago, but he plays naught more then a bit part in the last 1/3 of the book.I spent the last 1/3 of the book flipping pages because everything was too unbelievable at that point. In the end you're left with not much more then a diatribe against the meat industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the trash","review":"Cook has written some good books and that's why I bought this one - loyalty. I felt betrayed, ripped off and angry. A great topic, which could have been a great novel, was ruined by an author who could not possibly care about his readers. I kept waiting for something really interesting to happen. As the book drew to its end, I became worried and then suspicous. I couldn't believe what was happening - the story ended with many questions unanswered. It was as if the phone rang while the book was being written and the author just stopped. I will never buy another Robin Cook book. I considered giving this book to someone I didn't like, but I couldn't bring myself to do to anyone what Cook did to me. I threw it in the trash and NOT the recycling bin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxin was a huge dissapointment for this reader.","review":"This book was purchased in hardcover with expectations of the usual level of quality of the Robin Cook novel. A waste of money was my reward. Within the first two chapters the reader knows who the bad guy is, what will happen to the main characters and all of the main players who will be involved. The anger of the main character was the sole focus of most of the writing and became old so fast. I forced myself to read the first 150 pages and then could bear no more. I am disappointed that the editor and publisher let this one out when they had to know how poorly it was written. One can only assume that they were willing to ride on the name of Robin Cook. This is insulting to the reader as it assumes that we will read any drivel they put in front of us. As a result, this reader will never put out the money for a hard cover Robin Cook novel again. It will either be paperback or better yet, the library for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"quick read, shallow story","review":"Cook has the idea right on this one, but doesn't seem to know where to follow through. First he's focusing on the managed health care dilema in our society and then he decides that the USDA and slaughter-houses are a better target. Finally, he thinks that by throwing in a hit-man he'll keep the reader's attention. Sorry, no dice. It was a quick read with no real substance that I cared about."},{"rating":"1","title":"ROBIN COOK'S WORST YET!","review":"I HAVE READ A COUPLE OF ROBIN COOK'S BOOKS BEFORE TOXIN BUT I THINK THIS IS THE WORST YET!

It makes you wonder if Mr. Cook was abandoned by a meat-packer, deadbeat dad or something. If there has ever been a more annoying, unsympathetic protagonist than this wacko cardiac surgeon. It's the first time in my life that I wanted to jump into the book and slap the dickens out of a character.Cook has never been a grand master of his art, and is not a prodigious talent, but, at one time, he was good for a fun, exciting read. But with inane plotting, lifeless characterization, a total inability to involve the reader in the concerns of the protagonist, and bland, unsatisfying conclusions, turkeys like Toxin & Chromosome 6, God help us, are likely to leave the reader bored and uninspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Subject, Poor Storytelling","review":"Mr. Cook had a good subject when he set out to write this book. Unfortunately, he could not offer a complete story. As always, Mr. Cook offered good attention to detail in telling this story. I grew up in a beef producing state (Nebraska) and his description of the slaughter process is accurate. Mr. Cook's main point in the books seems to be that the USDA does not have an incentive to monitor the meat industry because of a conflict of interests. However, after Mr. Cook makes this point, it seems that he did not know what to do with his characters, Dr. Kim Reggis and his ex-wife Tracy. The premise that a member of the American Beef Alliance would hire a hit-man to squelch bad publicity went from the absurd to the ridiculous. Hopefully, Mr. Cooks next book will have an ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Cook is in dire need of an editor or a ghost-writer.","review":"Robin Cook has always told a good story, filled with good science. His writing skills, particularly in terms of dialogue, have always been weak, but he hits a new all-time low with Toxin. Has this guy gone his entire life without ever having heard two normal humans converse? No one on the planet speaks the way Cook's characters do. I've read all of his works, have enjoyed most and have learned a little something with each experience. But Toxin was the end of the line for me. A first-class stinker all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor execution, poor characterization, poor ending","review":"I'm sure I've read worse books than this one, but not many. The characters in the book were so exaggerated they were unbelievable, and their actions totally unrealistic. I forced my way to the end, hoping it would redeem the book somewhat for me, but the ending was the worst part of all. Talk about lack of resolution.The book also suffers from poor research. I'm surprised he hasn't been sued by the beef industry for his representation of them in this book. If things were really as bad as he makes them out to be, people would be dropping like flies.If you want to read a good medical thriller, try Michael Palmer. He is a much better writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful!","review":"i've read at least 15 Robin Cook books by now, and i really dont know what happened with this one. this has got to be one of the worst pieces of fiction i've ever read. the characters were one-dimensional and fake, the dialogue utterly fake and forced, and the plot, while okay in broad strokes, was in its details totally contrived and unbelievable. i kept going only to see if there was going to be some sort of interesting plot twist....

The first chapter starts out realistic enough and as the book progresses the characters seem to develop superpowers to conquer the world against the evils of the meat industry.

I found the characters to be quite unbelievable and hostile to one another. It also had waaaaay too much ranting about today's managed health care system. It will become quite obvious that a doctor wrote this book if you do plan on reading it. It seems that the only intention is to scare the public about the meatpacking industry and insurance's limitations if you get really sick. Like a previous reviewer said, it is more a non-fiction than a fiction book.

I can appreciate that Cook is attepmting to try and make a statment woth the story, it is very editorial but certainly not interesting or realistic.It is fast paced, simply because the writing is sooooo simple. So childlike. The \\"hero\\" a surgeon, is not someone we root for, he's a big pain the the neck. He is to worried about running around looking to punch someone or point a finger than be at his gravely ill daughter's bedside. and of course he finds all the impossible answers in the most unrealistic way.Please don't waste your time with this immature drivel. go read some Nelson Demille or Stephen King and see what it is like to create a real character."},{"rating":"2","title":"After reading this book you can't avoid becaming vegetarian","review":"I was really fascinated by this book, and as a vegetarian myself I couldn't avoid feeling relief. Apart from the problem of meat itself I think we are too used to consider every food as normal, but we should think how it can happen that food once so difficult to buy now is so cheap. Obviously there must be some problems, either concerning safeness or concerning suffering for people or animals. I'm not really a vegetarian (at least not yet), but I just avoid eating meat because of the suffering during life and death of animals. In any case I think we are so little natural in our way of eating so much meat, we can't avoid having some problems. Perhaps this book can make people think about this topic and I'm grateful to Robin Cook for this.

The story was very much predictable and there was no twists and turns that would have made the book much more unputtable. It could hardly be expected off a well educated and well placed surgeon to go about punching people who were just going about doing their duty. The part about Kim transforming himself into a punk to gain employment in the slaughterhouse was not very convincing. At one point I had to roll my eyes when Kim hands the gun back to Tracy before going into the slaughterhouse.

As an avid reader with a love of medical thrillers, i found this book to be unbelievable, not in the story it tried to tell, but in its writing. The main character, a heart surgeon named Kim, was combative and completely unlikeable. He and his ex-wife entered into long dialogues in the midst of a great tragedy involving their young daughter that i found unrealistic. He repeatedly resorted to physical violence with his colleagues and anyone who opposed him, refusing to listen to characters who seemed infinitely more reasonable.

The main premise is interesting, but the characters are poorly developed and their reactions to what takes place are ridiculous. The reader soon detaches from any empathy for the main character, due to his completely ridiculous personality and his tendency of \\"bopping\\" everyone he doesn't like, on the nose. Pity the poor meat inspector who disappears into the rendering vat...should we call the cops ?...nah, her severed head wouldn't convince them that anything criminal is going on. Give me a break! Mr. Cook should have written this book under another name and spared himself considerable embarassement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"The book has obvious agendas, and trying to make these work the author sacrifices the story to them. Obviously, Robin Cook has a beef with the beef industry and the managed care systems. While his criticisms may be valid, they are so overblown that the reader is initially scared silly by the conditions, then finally turned off to the book which seems to be just a propaganda piece written for Dr. Cook's beliefs. While I suspect the conditions he writes about might actually occur, hopefully very rarely, the way it is done is so disgusting that one can't possibly enjoy the book.

It was a very lopsided indictment of managed healthcare as seen the eyes of a dangerous egomaniac. The indictment could have been summarized in less than ten pages. The story of Kim Reggis could have been a great one, if only it had been completed. This book brings nothing to a conclusion.

There is not a choice for zero stars.","review":"What happened to the ending? I expected more from Mr. Cook after his other successful stories. Although the information about food safety was very informative AND SCARY, this plot was boring and predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!","review":"What happened to the ending? I expected more from Mr. Cook after his other successful stories. Although the information about food safety will stay with me, this plot was boring and predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"It'll make you stop and think.....","review":"The first few chapters are difficult to get into, but once you grasp the horror of the situation, it seems to pick up and stumble along. The scenario seems a little far-fetched, but the basis of the story is spine-chilling. I, for one, have taken a second, and even third look at the meat that I put on my table.... One point of interest, tho - there seems to be disagreement (reading the other reviews, both formal and informal) as to whether Kim's offspring was male, or female. I know that in the version I read, it was his DAUGHTER that dies - what gives here? How much of the rest of the plot changed??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good medical background, bad character development","review":"Predictable plot, unbelievable developments and very weak character development made me want to return the book after the first couple of chapters, but I stuck it out. Unfortunately, it didn't get any better, and now I'll never buy another Robin Cook book again. At the very least, I'll read more into the 'rave reviews'. \\"Gripping medical background\\" must mean \\"weak characters\\", I suppose."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Ending!","review":"The idea of the book was not to bad. The beginning was very slow and a bit boring. It seemed as though Mr. Cook introduced many characters and did not develop them. It was very interesting to read about the meat industry. It definetly makes me think twice before eating meat. If you have a weak stomach this is not the book for you. The ending was very poor. The reader is left hanging and wondering what has happened legally to the main characters. The book overall seemed choppy. There also seemed to be no real climax. Read a different Robin Cook book this one is by far the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poorly writen","review":"I have read all of Robin Cook's books, and have noticed quite a decline in the past few titles. However, Toxin certainly is the worst written in quite a while. An interesting and potentially fascinating look at the subject matter is lost by poor character development, dispicable dialogue and irrational actions. Along with the revealing information on E. coli and the meat processing industry, this book is also a commentary on the American medical system. Obviously, the author is not pleased with its current direction, but he does not use realistic examples to get the point across. Perhaps Dr. Cook should take a breather; I wouldn't mind waiting a few years for his next title if it could be well written.Bottom line: a struggle to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was great","review":"First off your synopis is wrong. Dr Reggis did not take his son Seldon to eatat a fast food joint. He didn't have a son, he had a daughter and her name was Becky and she was 10 years old. I think you should change it.I think the book was one of his best. I'm wondering if he is going to do a sequal to it because of the way it ended. There was a lot of really great description of a slaughterhouse, after reading Toxin I don't think I waill ever eat hamburg again.Robin Cook really knows how to tell a story and keep you interested in it from page 1 to the very last page. I do read a lot of medical thrillers and I can't really say who I like the best because they are all so good.I don't have much to say except to read this book, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"This is the first Robin Cook book I've tried and I certainly will not make the mistake again. Not only is Cook's prose awkward throughout, the plot gets more and more preposterous as the book progresses. The doctor goes to a TV reporter with information about a missing USDA inspector, finds human blood in the place she disappeared and is chased away from that spot by a knife-toting killer. The reporter's response? No story here. The same doctor is attacked again by the killer in his home. He and his wife barely escape. She suggests they call the police. No, he says. They wouldn't do anything. The doctor sneaks into a slaughterhouse under the pretense of being an illegal Mexican alien (with blond hair). But he speak only a few words of Spanish and uses English words like \\"pristine.\\" It just goes on and on. I don't mind suspending belief a little, but the author gives his readers no credit at all in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Toxin\\" is exciting, suspensful and thought-provoking.","review":"This book is a blend of edge-of-your-seat excitement and heart-rending tragedy. \\"Toxin\\" is emotionally gripping and thought-provoking. For me, it has also been life-changing. I have not touched meat since reading this wonderful, fascinating story. I highly recommend this intelligent, exciting, fascinating thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Did I Read this Waste of Time Book?","review":"This book was a total waste of time. The dialogue was terrible, the characters unbelievable, the construction awful. If there was a rating below one star or even minus stars, that's what I would have chosen. I kept hoping for it to get better and it NEVER did. God forbid I should pick up another Robin Cook book. Toxin was so bad I wouldn't even put it out on a table at a yard sale if for no other reason than to protect others from reading it. I hope Dr. Cook is a better doctor than writer -- if not he must be plagued with malpractice lawsuites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"Here's the book:Managed Health Care = evil! Meat industry = evil! The protagonist of the book = out of control nut case with no character development!There, I saved you a few bucks. There is no story here, just a rant disguised as a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritatingly Cliche-ridden","review":"I wanted to slap the protagonist, slap his ex-wife, slap his girlfriend and, until she got sick, slap his kid (what 10-year-old do you know who says \\"fabulous\\"?). These characters are some of the most unsympathetic and poorly fleshed-out I've seen in Cook's books. In order to make us care about his causes, he needs to make us care about his characters. The egocentric surgeon, the bimbo girlfriend, the resentful ex-wife, the spoiled, manipulative child, the uncaring, evil corporation - we've seen these cliches a million times."},{"rating":"1","title":"E-coli and the Doctor","review":"This book is about an crazed, but loving, doctor, who is willing to risk everything to put a meat processing company out of business, due to the death of his daughter. He is the target of a hitman, and is fleeing for his life. His ex-wife joins him in his little escapade.This book is good, in that it builds suspense really well. The authors choice of words, and how he describes the environment is undescribable. He makes you feel as if you are the Doctor at the slaughter house.Overall, the book doesn't appeal to me much. It has a very ubrupt ending, and doesn't allow the reader to fully appreciate the end. The author could have done a better job with that. Also, the book assumes a lot. It assumes that the reader knows about the different groups incharge of inspecting meat.I would recommend this book to those looking for a new type of sci-fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put me off my burger","review":"Reading books like _Coma_ and _Brain_ will make you a Robin Cook fan. Reading a book like _Toxin_ will just put you off your burger.It was a very interesting and promising premise. However, the annoying main character and the stereotypical supporting cast made the book, uh, less palatable.You'll learn some fun science, though! FYI, not every 0157:H7 infection ends like this. People do recover.Go read his earlier work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up!!","review":"My first RC book was Shock and it indeed shocked me-it was so two-dimensional and flat and cliche, i couldn't believed it was published! Then i saw some reviews that mentioned it was probably the worst book by RC so i decided to give him another go. Unfortunately i'm once again disappointed. Totally. I mean i didn't even managed to get past the first 100pages!! It makes me wonder how did his novels become best-sellers. The characters are totally 2-D and almost stereotypical. Dialogue and writing style just seems really flat to me and it just feels unreal. The characters were unlikeable and it just felt like a re-run of an overused theme, overplayed B-grade movie. Don't think i'll waste any more time on his novels again. Lesson learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick Read but Disappointing","review":"Aspects of the book were suspenseful and quick-paced. However, in general, I felt that there were too many plot deviations that weighed the story line down instead of enriching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic Toxin","review":"While I normally like Cook, this novel is just awful. The characters are one-dimensional, the plot is absurd and the tone is so thoroughly preachy (And not good Spurgeon-like preachy, more horrifying Joel Osteen-like preachy.)that I kept waiting for a collection plate to pass. I can only assume that the author got an undercooked burger at a restaurant and decided to slander the beef industry as pay-back. Not worth wasting your reading time on this cowflop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxin","review":"is what happens when a man with a god complex grows a conscience and thinks he's Shakespeare.

The author either doesn't trust his own dialogue or the intelligence of his readers because it seems like EVERY verb is followed by an adverb. If the writing was better, we wouldn't need something like \\"sarcastically\\" after \\"said\\".The story? Eh. I didn't find the main character very believable and a lot of it (including the romance) seemed contrived. I don't think that actions of the hospital staff were very believable. Read it and see if you don't agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking to kick a fast food hamburger habit?","review":"There are already lots of reviews on this book so I'll save the critique and be brief. If your an avid reader it won't take you long to go through this one and when you come out on the other side you'll have been entertained and, unless you have an iron stomach, you'll be repulsed at the thought of a pre-made hamburger patty. It's not the best book I've ever read, but it left one hell of an impression. I'm giving it 4 stars because I enjoyed reading it even if it was a little bumpy and because any book that can keep me out of a drive through for a solid year deserves some recognition."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of robin cook's worst","review":"this might be nearly the worst in a LONG line of really bad books---- by robin cook. horrible dialogue, anachronistic sentences, poor character development (unless you read all his books, because then its good character development, i.e., theyre all the same), unbelievable situations, really poor science (science, whats that??) and unbelievable MDs who become a wikipedia entry on things they know nothing about --- did i mention the worst caricatures that ive ever read? the bad guys are fat and boorish, the worst bad guys are no speaka da engleese mexican (really racist, did i add that?) the moralizing drove me crazy reading it!that being said, if you like \\"dirk pitt\\" like dialogue and nubile \\"dirk pitt\\" women, then it might be hard to put down.found this in a recycle bin at my mom's house, read it on the ride home, should have left it in the recycle bin..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many Cook(books) spoil the burgers!","review":"This is my first, and last, Robin Cook novel.

See me fall asleep while eating a hamburger and reading Toxin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbeleivable-- literally","review":"Don't give up eating red meat because of this book!!! You can't beleive the story-- don't beleive the message! I read this book cover to cover hoping it would get better and it never did. The main character, Dr. Kim Reggis, is a complete wacko-- so over the top that I actually found myself saying \\"Like I'm sure that would happen!\\". One specific incident had me particularly puzzeled. How did Carlos, the knife wielding Mexican killer, kill the USDA inspector, then chase the good Dr. all over the slaughterhouse before tripping an alarm which automatically called the police who apparently arrive moments later only to discover the entire scene has been cleaned up and no sign of the violent struggle or the means by which the inspector was killed exists. Finally, OJ find out where Carlos was when Ron and Nicole were killed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robin Cook should stay away from his word processor.","review":"This so-called serious novel about the meat industry had me laughing out loud at several key points in this book. I mean really, how many times does this guy punch somebody out? Then he decides to hit a police officer, but he's still able to go free in the end. Excuse me? After that, of course, while his only beloved daughter lies there, dying in the hospital, what's a good doctor to do? Instead of being at her bedside, he runs around and hits more people! What a joke! A great unitentional piece of comedy, and the writing is so bad, my sides were splitting. Thanks for the great laugh, Robin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story poorly told","review":"This could have been a great story with real suspense but instead ended up being a laughable and cliche'd parody of itself. Robin Cook may be a good doctor, he is not a writer, the characters are shallow and monochromatic and the dialogue is juvenile at best. My eleven year old daughter and myself both thought it was poorly written and developed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing subject, horrid writing","review":"A compelling subject to be sure - I may never go to Burger King again. Too bad the writing is so sophomoric - at times I felt like I was watching a 3rd rate soap opera. As for the ending, Dr. Cook must have had a golf date he couldn't miss - it makes Patricia Cornwell look like Jane Austin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Ending","review":"The story and the plot is great, but the ending screwed up the whole thing. Like the other 2 books i have read by Mr.Cook, it makes me wonder if Mr.Cook had run out of time or idea at the end. The book just end at the begining of the climax. I was very disappointed when i reach the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good subject, rushed ending","review":"I really enjoyed the subject matter of Toxin. With the E. coli outbreaks in the past years, it hits pretty close to home. What I didn't like about the book was the rushed ending. It felt unfinished. Where did Kim and his ex-wife go? Was he still facing murder charges? No one ever said anything about the missing safety inspector, whose head was found in the basement of the slaughterhouse. Also, it took a long time for the actual action to start. The daughter dies almost at the end of the book, which is when they started uncovering the conspiracy. The book seemed very rushed and seemed unfinished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting till Cook got tired near the end","review":"I had trouble sympathizing with the good surgeon and his whining about billings and HMO's. However, Cook did portray the prima donna aspect of the surgeon quite well. And I know of what if speak as I work in a hospital (although a Canadian one). However, several bits at the end troubled me and made me think Cook was eager to finish this book off (maybe his beeper went off?) The ending was unsatisfying, not in the way his characters handled everything, but in how several plot lines disappeared. And how was the good surgeon and his ex-wife going to escape the country after the news was released? And how come no one cared about what happened to the veterinarian? And why did Cook tar the entire legal system (and hence justify the surgeon's reluctance to go to the police) with a quick throw away line about the O.J trial? Next time, turn your beeper off and finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad execution of a good plot","review":"The plot to this book had terrific potential. While I am not squeamish, I felt that the some of the graphic descriptions where not necessary. Dr. Regis' character was arrogant while his actions were predictable for most of the book. This book ends abruptly without letting the reader know what happens to the main characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I remember why I hated micro","review":"If you think that it is impossible to make an exciting story about food poisoning, you might use this book as evidence. The story linearly follows Dr. Kim Reggis, cardiac surgeon as his daughter acquires a disease associated with a toxin-producing E. coli. His temperment, like much of this book, is so stereotypical, it could have been written by machine. Rude hospital administrators, indifferent emergency physicians, Barbie girlfriend, callous ex-wife, you have 'em all here. I really can't find a single character with whom I can relate, or even like. I have no sense of the guts of any of them. The action is so sedate that a shoving match between the good surgeon and the knuckleheaded ER doctor is about as exciting as it gets. The writing would get a B- in creative writing 101. Find a better page turner to spend a couple of hours with. Maybe I'm being unfair, though. Perhaps this is the best one could do with a villain named O157:H7."},{"rating":"1","title":"This man is not a writer!","review":"Robin Cook knows his subject, and the plot could well be developed into a thrilling movie, but I was continually frustrated by the stilted, wooden quality of his writing. His characters are poorly developed stereotypes who speak in unnatural voices, and instead of showing a character's feelings through subtle behaviour and quirkiness, Cook tells the reader what a character is thinking - a sure sign of amateurism. I finished the book only because I wanted to know more about E. coli, but I couldn't wait for the story to end. This is not good writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only interesting aspect is meat production info.","review":"I read this 1/3 of the way, and then just skimmed ahead to read about the description of the slaughterhouse and how beef is produced for consumers. Otherwise I had no interest in the storyline at all. However, this is not Cook's fault. His storyline was about a egotistical, stubborn surgeon. His character did not interest me at all. The reason for this, though, is because I have met many surgeons in my life and I have found them all to be just as unappealling and snobbish as the character in the book. So, to me it seems as if Cook did do a good job portraying the surgeon, but I am just put off by people of such a nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MEDICAL THRILLER IF THERE EVER WAS ONE","review":"HAMBURGER AND CHEESE BURGER LOVERS SHOULD BE WARNED: BY THE TIME YOU'RE DONE READING THIS BOOK YOU'LL WANT TO BECOME A VEGETARIAN.

In the book Toxin there is a food poisening going around in the meat. Even such a basic and boring topic, Robin Cook makes it into a suspensful thriller. Taking medical related topics such as this and making it into a very good thriller is just completely amazing. I recommend that everyone read this book, it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toxin by Robin Cook","review":"Fortunately all of us are not alike.

You never know quite what to expect from the charactors, because they are always changing, and most of them are just plain annoying. No loose ends were tied up, and no one who reads this book will eat for months. It's simply disgusting. Not only that, but depressing and not worth the time spent reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Start on one topic, shift to another, don't complete either","review":"Cook starts two different stories tied trogether with a tragedy. Enter a meltdown by the lead character. Grow tired of writing and stop before you finish either story. There is a faint reference to some sort of resolution at the end of the story but no clear determination as to what the story ending is. A bad book of a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cook turns out sour dish","review":"Good idea gone awry. First 150 pages were sluggish. Middle was better but the ending stunk.

The last 50 pages got silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cook's worst book. Horrible ending to a feeble story.","review":"This book is nothing more than a rip off. It could and should have been better. Dr. Cook should stop preaching and go back to writing. The ending was the pits. It's like Cook became tired with the story and quickly ended it. Not his best but possibly his worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robin Cook, you are getting tiresome","review":"I am growing quite weary of reading Robin Cook's expose on managed health care. The first half of the book dwelt on managed care and that a physician's daughter should get preferential treatment in a hospital emergency room. Dr. Cook, welcome to the rest of the world and face the problems the other 99% of the workforce faces---layoffs, long waits in doctor's offices, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have left it on the shelf!","review":"This book has been on my shelf for years. I should have left it there. I normally like Robin Cook's books, however this one was awful. He spent the first half of the book whining about managed care and the second half of the book describing the meat industry as if it was something akin to organized crime. There was a total lack of character development throughout the book and the ending was so poor I had to check and make sure the book was not missing any pages.

His doctor was totaly unbelievable. Very little story hidden between long orations about the USDA and the meat industry. It's sad because this man has written some real page turners in his time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Robin Cook effort yet","review":"I have been reading Robin Cook for many years, some good, some fair but this is the first one that was so poor I couldn't finish it.I found the actions of the main character so over-the-top as to be cartoonish. 1/3 of the way into the book, there is very little story developed. As other reviewers have pointed out this seems to be more of an attack on the meat industry than anything approaching quality fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible audio book","review":"My review is of the audio book adaption of TOXIN -- which is terrible. The production is awkward at best. Lots of overly dramatic music and often in inappropriate places. It's almost as though the person responsible for the music wasn't paying attention to the script. It's truly painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most unbelievable book I've ever experienced","review":"Besides using exaggeration to the point of absurdity (eg, Americare's unwillingness to treat patients in anything but a robotic, uncaring manner), Cook has not the faintest idea of how parents react to the loss of a child. I have worked in a hospital for over 5 years - I deal daily with the Managed Care fiasco AND families in grief. There was NOTHING realistic about either of the many scenarios he presented. The only reason I gave the book 1 star is the description of meat processing - I am again a vegetarian."},{"rating":"1","title":"should've been a non-fiction","review":"Toxin is not a very good book. What starts out, seemingly, like another Robin Cook thriller quickly turns into a rant about managed health care and the beef industry. There's also several gaps in the story, like he started writing it, got bored and left, then came back later and started forgetting where he was going the last time. The ending sucked. There was no finalty, to wrap up, not even something to think about it. Shortly into the book you're left scratching your head about the characters. The main two, Kim and Tracy, don't act like typical parents, or any of the other situations where you'd expect normal people to act...Toxin is a scary book. You'll stop eating (hamburgers) for a while. Cook makes really great points about managed health care, the USDA, and fast food in general. Just think it might've read better had Toxin been a non-fiction book about those subjects than trying to slop some half-baked fictional story around it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but depressing book","review":"Unlike other Cook's characters I love, I didn't really like the main character from this book, Dr. Reggis. Althought, it's quite understandable. When I first bought the book, the cashier told me how it changed the way she looked at things.. don't remember exactly what she said but it was something like that. Well, very true, indeed. I have nothing major against big industries but this book's added another 'something' to my existing feelings about big industries. The book itself was excellent but somewhat frustrating because of the behavior of Dr. Kim Reggis. Another great one from Cook."},{"rating":"1","title":"just a very bad read","review":"I have read a couple of Robin Cook books and thoroughly enjoyed them but this is the first one I actually purchased.

I was compelled to read it because of the nature of the subject- e-coli and the meat industry. I was interested at first, but as others have stated previously, there is no ending. Cook leaves the readers hanging to no end, and they must conclude for themselves what happens.

We saw it first as one of the stories on the Scholastic video \\"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\\" and after watching it numerous times I knew we needed to possess the book.\\"Rosie's Walk\\" is essentially the tale of a sloe-eyed chicken that goes about her business in absolute ignorance of the pursuing fox and his travails.Done in strikingly garish yellows, oranges and greens (it *was* published in 1971 afterall!) it grabs a toddlers/preschoolers attention and captivates it. As noted elsewhere the artwork is very detailed. There are numerous touches that remind me of colonial stitchwork and we think this would be a good selection for the at-home library."},{"rating":"1","title":"hen or rooster?","review":"The \\"hen\\" looks like a rooster. I think that would be confusing to three or four year old children who have seen animal pictures in other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"32 words in the whole book, bit slow for a 3year-old","review":"Someone in another review mentioned how much their 4-year-old enjoyed this book. I can't fathom how that is true. There are only 32 words in the entire book, and I can see how a very small (barely verbal) child (say 18-30 months) might enjoy it. But there's no way it's suitable for kids that are talking fluently.Also, honestly I don't know what was going on with art in the late 60's, but that mustard/brown palette had to go (think shag carpet). It's not a terribly pretty book. I was pretty unimpressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Rain...You Gotta Love This!","review":"I've never reviewed a book here before, but having just returned from a long plane trip I had to say how Hard Rain made my flight! From beginning to end I was hooked. For anyone who likes thrillers set against colorful backdrops...you gotta love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Rain gets deeper","review":"This is the second of two John Rain books (Rain Fall came out last year) and it is even better than the first, which is saying a lot! This is great brain candy that can surprise you with the eloquence of the writing.Rain is a complex and interesting lead, and in the second book we get to see him dealing with the ambiguities inherent in the life of an assasin. Great summertime fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"REAL","review":"Both Hard Rain and Rain Fall are excellent martial arts, espionage silent but deadly thrillers. Eislers description of Japan, as if it is another character in the book, is near perfection. I have been there seven times and his perspective illuminates my memory of this beautiful nation.What is also incredible is the explanations of martial art techniques that John Rain uses to subdue his opponents. Eisler, being a martial artist himself, describes the blow by blow action of some of the best fight scenes Ive ever read. Being a black belt in Judo as well as Brazilian Jiu Jitsu I am constantly reminded of the skill and effectiveness that comes from those arts by reading these books.A must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No sophmore jinx","review":"Pretty solid follow up here. It is a little predictable at times, but it has a great noirish feel and the anti-hero is not a \\"superman\\" but a flawed and conflicted guy with some years on him. Bottom line, if you liked the first one, you'll like this one.EDIT AFTER READING THE WHOLE SERIES: This is probably the least \\"tech\\" and most \\"muscle\\" of the series. This was Rain in his most brutal and physical story. Perhaps my favorite of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This author has such great reviews from the Amazon reviewers, which I can usually trust, but I found myself starting to skip pages about a third of the way through -- so it just must be me. It seemed to me a great portion of the book dealt with the descriptions of John Rain performing his SDR's (surveillance detection runs)through the streets of Osaka and Tokyo. I felt like I was reading a travel book. The action scenes just didn't make up for having to slog through his scenic narratives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jason Bourne move over","review":"Move over Jason Bourne. John rain is back! More cunning than Bourne or many other \\"hit men\\", this half-American half Japanese misfit dazzles us once agin with his meticulous tradecraft,and his uncanny ability to make his stealth murders appear as death from natural causes.In Hard Rain, Eisler gives us further insight into the psyche of his cool killer, John Rain. This protagonist's motives, as well as his angst, are well developed and wonderfully presented. Eisler's descriptions of Tokyo are acurate almost to a fault.John Rain is a cunning killer. His life as a freelance assassin is perceived by Rain, both as a source of personal pride as well as the etiology of his painful isolation. In time he could easily become the new iconoclastic character of this genre of novel.If your looking for a good read, Hard Rain is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Rain","review":"Hard Rain is Barry Eisler's second book in the John Rain series. It is riviting! If you're toying with buying this book and haven't read his first book, \\"Rain Fall,\\" STOP! Order and read that one first. To a greater extent than in the Vince Flinn Mitch Rapp series and the Tom Clancy Jack Ryan series, Eisler's books aren't self-contained stories, rather they are an immediate continuation of the total John Rain story. It's harder to understand fresh, characters that he developed in provious books than it is with the other two authors. If you've read the first one, then be prepared to be absorbed big time with the second one."},{"rating":"2","title":"light, absorbing spy thriller with insights into Japan","review":"I've read the first four books in the John Rain series. All entertaining page-turners with good action, suspense, engaging plot lines. Insights into Japanese culture and martial arts set this series apart from garden-variety thrillers. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be missing something","review":"I found this book to be average at best. While the plot and characters are thought out fairly well, I found myself yawning and my mind wandering through much of the book. Eisler has a ways to go before he can measure up to the likes of Robert Ludlum or Dan Brown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps Getting Better","review":"The Rain novels are a fascinating read. The hero, John Rain, is a complex, flawed man. As assassin with a conscience. Quick to dispatch the bad guys, never quite sure who the good guys are, if indeed there are any in the dark world he in habits. Read the whole series. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best novel I have read in ten years","review":"\\"Hard Rain\\" is perhaps the best novel I have read in ten years. Although I originally thought I wouldn't have much interest in a novel set in Japan, Eisler's excellent writing and compelling characters pulled me into the story. A great, great read that I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I found his endless descriptions of the Japanese metro areas to be meaningless space fillers and irrelevant to the tale.

Don't waste your money. Cheap plastic bottle doesn't have a removeable top, so you have to squeeze it very hard while holding it under water to fill it. The bottle is so flimsy it split apart all the way down the seam the second time I tried to fill it for my daughter to use. Bottle also has to be squeezed harder than any toddler could manage to dispense water into doll's mouth, so I had to do it for my daughter. You also have to have the doll on the potty while giving her the bottle, as water flows out immediately AND Doll won't stay on the potty without falling off unless you hold her there, so it takes 2 adults to potty this doll."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST","review":"I AM A TRUE GOODIE MOB FAN AND THESE REVIEWS ARE DISAPPOINTING ME.

This lp is in another direction for the group as compared to the other two releases. The two songs that puts you at the brink of crunkness is \\"Get Rich To This\\" and \\"I.C.U.\\". The Mob also takes us into the club with their verion of \\"The Dip\\" which is something they've never done before, but never the less is a good addition. \\"Cutty Buddy\\" also pulls you in with the smooth vocals of Sleepy Brown on the chorus. The \\"All A's\\" quartet dug a little deeper to bring us hip-hop/rap at it's finest. The one thing that's apparently missing is the production by Organized Noize which would have easily made this a classic as the others. Goodie got it for the hardheads, ladies, gangsters and just ordinary people.

But now they're \\"Getting rich to this\\". this CD is a complete 180 from there more home-grown roots in their '95 release.

It instantly covers up mistakes (or anything you don't want people to see) - there is no need to wait for it to dry. It also covers things up more quickly than regular wite-out, it covers them up better (nothing leaks through), and you can cover up more things in a shorter period of time. Unfortunately, for me it worked well for a short period of time and then it stopped working. The witeout tape stopped dispensing and ended up getting tangled up inside the dispenser.

Because of the proximity of islands, nearly all sailing in the VIs is by line of sight (and night sailing is prohibited for charter boats). Your main interests in the guide will be things like which harbors have mooring balls and which are anchorages, prevailing wind direction/shifts at anchorages, recommended anchorage depths, what's on shore and how to book for dinner etc. The guide has plenty of that info.

Considering that 95% of all anime is based on a ludicrous premise and then pretending it is normal, parent swapping hardly seems that far fetched when compared to giant robots and/or psychic powers. After all, excepting something that isn't normal as an operating truth is kind of the point. I think this series trys to show how easy it is to get confused by emotions. Also, this series made me laugh out loud quite a bit. Although I must admit that I just didn't care about the characters as much as the ones in series like \\"His and Her Circumstances\\", \\"Maison Ikkoku\\", \\"Boys Over Flowers\\", or \\"Fruit Basket\\".

I was able to get used to it, but I don't know if it was an overall benefit to the book.I did like that the book kept the serialized form and didn't try to make larger chapters from the material.

There is no cough suppressant in here to speak of, but once you have some moisture in your throat again, you instantly feel better.

It is really very helpful to a new student to be able to practice with a better player or a recording, to help stabilize the pitch. These are so fast that not only can you not keep up and play with a nice sound, it is discouraging when you thought you were well on your way to mastering a piece, to be told in so many measures that it is meant to be twice as fast. Sorry for the blistering review, and I know you can buy software to slow things down but this should just be geared for beginners in the first place.

RCA gets points for supporting Divx, commercial skip and HDMI out.However, this model is missing features and has a couple bugs. My biggest gripe is that RCA removed the \\"Split Title\\" feature which is a useful way to perform basic edits and to free up disc space. Also, the title screen doesn't always display correctly when playing finalized discs in other DVD players. Lastly, it seems to prefer +RW discs as I constantly got errors trying to record to plain +R DVDs.I would suggest looking at LG's line of recorders, or last year's Sony GX315."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I've had this machine for a year now, and you know that scene in the movie \\"Office Space\\" where the guys take the printer out to a remote location and beat it to smithereens?

Now it has taken to erasing what I've recorded when I try to access the disc or turn off the machine. Sometimes I cannot turn it off and have to unplug it to get it to reset itself and unfreeze. (It's not an Apple product, is it?:-)Most aggravating of all, (since it is a minor thing that could easily have been made right but was not,) is that the clock does not keep proper time.

I double checked visually and could see the fan twitching ever so slightly but not actually running. I am currently packing it up to return to Amazon. Shame, the unit seemed like it was solidly built and worked good on the two discs I tried on it (Memorex RW+ 2.4x and Ridata RW+ 4x). Due to other poor reviewes I decided not to exchange and hope for a good unit. Even with the fan not running I think this unit should not have been running so hot; it was uncomfortable to the touch.

The Commercial Skip is a thing of beauty. It doesn't work all the time but it does 90% and it makes watching previously recorded shows commercial free. The picture is very very good. Sharp and colorful. The remote is a bit awkward but I use my Harmony remote with this so that's a non-issue.I've had this unit for almost two months and between my kids and myself it's been used pretty heavily.

I consider myself to have eclectic tastes; I watch all kinds of movies made from all over the world. But I have to say that the memory of \\"Harold and Maude\\" still makes me cringe after 30 years. It has a following that is obviously very passionate about it and I risk my Amazon rating by giving it a bad review. Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort's characters are extremely annoying. And I'm sorry, but the idea of a 20 year old and an 80 year old being romantically involved is, how shall we say, contra naturum. Taste is personal, but as C.S. Lewis asked in the \\"Abolition of Man\\", if a waterfall is sublime to one observer and mundane to another, which is it in reality? Can it be both sublime and mundane? In the case of \\"Harold and Maude\\", the answer is a resounding 'no'. It is a most mundane effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Condition","review":"I loved the product.

This film is definitely an acquired taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite simply the most charmingly quirky movie I know","review":"On the face of it, a movie about a suicidal teen who develops a semi-romantic attachment to an ancient woman seems about as \\"niche\\" as you can get, but don't overlook this film. The relationship between Harold and Maude is truly endearing, and is as heartbreakingly dear as it is comedic. Through Maude (Ruth Gordon in a role that will forever define the agelessness of the human spirit) we get a truly unique perspective on life, told in such a gracefully sweet way that we cannot help but fall in love with her. If you like Igby Goes Down (a modern interpretation of Catcher in the Rye) you'll get much the same feeling from Harold and Maude, which is not so much a \\"coming of age\\" movie as a funny-but-deep look at love in all its splendours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Sleeper of ALL TIME","review":"Funny, sad, inspiring...This movie is awesome for the thinking crowd but no thinking is necessary.

Must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"THEE best","review":"How can anyone complain about the soundtrack of Harold and Maude? Cat Stevens was a perfect pick. This movie is colorful and creative. It deals with meaningful issues such as self fulfillment, the spontaneity and wonder of life, death. The movie is commical but what moved me most of all was the bond between the characters. This is a think-outside-of-the-box movie and the character bond that I'm talking about is quite provocative (if you so choose to frown upon it).I felt lifted after I watched Harold and Maude. It's a movie for idealists and people who enjoy symbols and hidden meanings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, wonderful & wonderful!","review":"In an age of cynicism, bitterness, and pointless movies about horny teenagers, this film is a breath of fresh air. Movies like this simply do not get made anymore. People who hate it miss the point, it is about love and life and enjoying who you are. Movine and wonderful, and Ruth Gordon is darling.

A diamond in the rough.","review":"This movie was made quite a few years before I was born and I would never have known about it if not for AMC's constant rotation. I admit that the macabre humor perplexed me at first, but the superb cast pulls it off wonderfully. Vivian Pickles, who plays Harold's blissfully clueless mom, is so funny that she could've stolen the movie from the two title characters if she had appeared in more scenes. One of the movie's funniest moments is when she signs Harold up for a dating service and then tells him, \\"They screen out the fat and the ugly, so obviously this is a firm of high standards.\\" All the other great things about 'Harold & Maude' have already been said by the other reviewers. I'm glad that this film is so beloved by so many people. It's a great legacy for Colin Higgins, who wrote such a beautiful book in 1970. Sadly, he passed away in 1988."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOP Who-Am-I film","review":"Harold is a young man looking for identity despite the pitfalls of his wacky privelaged family.

A friend of mine and I went as often as our parents and our money let us. As a result I became a cult follower and a Cat Stevens Fan for life. I've rented the movie over the years and was never able to find it until now. I plan on purchasing it so that I can share it with anyone willing to view it. Like others have said it sends a message, a powerful one. In it's own unique way. You have to see it to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming of age movie like The Graduate, but nothing like it.","review":"You're not going to believe all these reviews. They all say \\"the greatest\\" \\"best movie ever\\" \\"my favorite\\". Well, it is one of my top ten along with Silver Streak and Cool Hand Luke, Amadeus and that old standby Casablanca. H&M, however is nothing like any of the other movies. It stands alone and the music is so well suited to the movie you'll never hear Cat Stevens again without thinking of Harold. (Sort of like visualizing Anne Bancroft in The Graduate when you hear S&G sing Mrs. Robinson.) This is one movie you can watch again and again just to keep you straight. And Harold is not one to go straight, but then you'll have to see for yourself. Great flick. If you are debating whether to get it. Don't. Just buy it.Darrell Batchelder"},{"rating":"2","title":"I pretty much agree with everyone","review":"It's been fun reading these posts by people who were so moved and entertained by this movie. I saw it when it first came out and have had Cat Stevens' songs in my head ever since. It's one of those personally affecting movies that prompts fans to quote from it, and my favorite moment after all these years is (as it is for some of these other writers) Maude flinging Harold's charm into the river, because now she'll \\"always know where it is.\\" That was my first taste of movie profundity, and I've never lost it.If you haven't seen the movie yet, you can probably read some of these posts and not have it ruined for you. There's so much to laugh at and marvel over in it, and of course, those songs. . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, so-so DVD","review":"At last on DVD, but what a shame nobody took the time to clean up the video. My time-worn VHS tape looks better than this. Never liked Cat Stevens that much, but his music suits this movie. Still, its great to finally have this on DVD.

Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, though flawed, black comedy","review":"OK, the characters other than Harold and Maude (Harold's mother and uncle, the priest, the psychotherapist) are a bit two-dimensional, Maude isn't consistent with her own beliefs, and the ending is, uh, ambiguous, but this is truly a great movie. It abounds with messages - surprisingly uplifting messages, given its plot - but it doesn't hit the viewer over the head with them.The photography of the San Francisco peninsula is stunning, Cat Stevens's music is great, and there are dozens of scenes that had me laughing until the tears came - while wondering whether somebody had just stuck a knife in my gut.Funny, sad, hopeful - with all its faults, a great movie. Everybody should see it at least once.I don't have a television; therefore, I don't own a VCR, but I own this videotape."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite films.","review":"A delicious, heartbreaking comedy that's not afraid of emotion and sadness, about thelove affair between a death obsessed 19 year old, and a life obsessed 80 year old.Amazing performances by Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon, not to mention the wholesupporting cast.Beautifully shot, and with transcendent use of Cat Steven's songs asscore.A film I simply never tire of seeing again.This is finally being re-issued, on blu-ray and DVD by Criterion, so ifhistory is any judge of quality, I'd wait for those.

Harold and Maude is one of the few movies where giving away the beginning (or in fact any part of it) can change your expectations. You really have to have an open mind to watch Harold and Maude. It's a cult classic; an esoteric film directed by Hal Ashby. With themes ranging from the serious (suicide, the draft) to lighthearted (suicide, the draft), Harold and Maude run the gamut of emotional situations. Just watch the movie, you'll see what I mean. You have never seen a movie like this one, nor are you likely to ever again. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheep!","review":"Everyone does love this movie- and I don't know why.

Man, that's always an easy way to get laughs or whatever, it's like throwing a little red-headed girl into a sitcom that's lost its edge. The wacky Maude appeals to the lowest common denominator within this \\"cult\\" genre. She's a tool to manipulate your viewing, it's not good filmmaking or good storytelling.

I love this film. It says that life is a chance to try new things, to experiment, know matter what the conventional wisdom is. Cat Steven'd song states it perfectly: if you want to be free, be free.kcrosby1@bellsouth.net"},{"rating":"2","title":"A slightly dated cult classic","review":"\\"Harold and Maude\\" is one of those movies that's hard to categorize. It's a black comedy, an offbeat romance, and a little morality play all in one. There are some really hilarious scenes - my favorite is the part where H&M; outwit Harold's uncle, a crazed militarist - and also some touching scenes between the two protagonists.I can't quite give this movie five stars, however, for several reasons. First, the production quality is mediocre at best. Second, while Maude's antics are amusing at a distance, she's not really all that loveable. A lot of her \\"advice\\" seems too much like warmed-over late 60s \\"do what feels good\\" drivel; apparently it's OK to steal cars if you're 79 years old. The Cat Stevens songs are often intrusive and annoying . And finally, the scene with H&M; in bed, presumably after having sex, is just ... creepy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I really could not get into this story.

The plot was cute, I guess, but it was very short and the ending was terrible. It was nice that it showed that two people are capable of loving each other despite age, but it seemed to imply it was only for the insane. This movie was an insult, depressing, and a waste of time.

Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon give such brillant and believable performances. As you watch the film you entirely forget the age difference and find yourself believing that yes, \\"Harold loves Maude\\". The music of Cat Stevens adds an undercurrent that not only is this Romeo and Juliet of the early 1970's but also an extension of the counterculture movement of the 1960's. Maude, though old enough to be Harold's Grandmother, is a free spirit that decries the materialism and rigid social conventions of the day and personifies the counterculture movement. I only wish that a sequel could have been made; something like \\"Life After Maude\\" where we would find Harold making a profound and beneficial change in American culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harold still loves Maude","review":"I had forgotten just how much I loved Harold and Maude and I must say the added commentary on the new Criterion Collection Blu-ray version gave me even more insight into the production of the film.

Great dialog and an innocence you don't find in movies these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could take refuge in the atmosphere of Harold and Maude.","review":"This coming from someone who only recently discovered H&M, I probably don't have much to add to the praise. With all the over-the-top special effects that pollute films today, the unassuming quiet simplicity of this eccentric little film is a breath of fresh air. The love story was very sweet; the concentrated shot of positivity very uplifting. These points make the film commendable; what makes the film incredible is the atmosphere it creates - audio visual candy. You don't even need to follow the plot to appreciate the pure art that it is. Calm beautiful images juxtaposed against calm beautiful music. The two meld to create a new beast of sensory awe on a level beyond storyline. And there's just something about Harold's voice that's really mesmerizing - indescribable, save for A Poem. It's so soft and slight - like the balm of summer's breeze across my face."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fine one!","review":"A great movie!I watched it this morning on showtime and am so happy I did!I knew nothing of this movie except that Mary from the wonderful THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY considered it one of the finest love stories of our time.I agree with Mary!Love,not neccessarily romance,is the word here.Great songs by the great Cat Stevens adds to this quirky,warm hearted tale.It's also fun to see what life looked like in 1971.I was just 5 then.Brilliant flck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too old for ,me","review":"same old story- liked the first one better (actors)I really dont think I orderd this- got two of the other one"},{"rating":"2","title":"I seen it in theaters more then 20 times.","review":"While living in San Francisco there were theaters that Showed this movie once a month and always drew a full theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must see","review":"i thought this movie had its funny moments but i did catch myself with a tear rolling down my cheek. this movie teaches you to love life and try to be free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Comedy at its best...","review":"This bizarre film is actually quite funny. I was first introduced to this film in 1984 and still watch it from time to time. Without giving anything away, Harold drives his rich family crazy with a number of hysterical suicide attempts - only to miraculously appear seconds later as though nothing happened.Although not a mainstream comedy, this movie is tremendously funny and is a \\"must have\\" for your home collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE EVER!!!","review":"I HAVE BEEN IN LOVE WITH THIS MOVIE SINCE I FIRST SAW IT. IT HAS EVERYTHING YOU COULD WANT IN A MOVIE."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant Must-See Film!","review":"I also agree that this film is one of the best life-affirming films ever made. What I love about it, having seen it several dozen times since it was released, is how powerful some of its most brilliant moments are. One of my most favorite (and haunting) is the quick glimpse we get of the numerical markings on Maude's arm as she sits with Harold. No further explanation is needed into why Maude celebrates life that way she does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky little film","review":"This came highly recommended by a friend. I can't believe I had never seen it because I've been a movie buff for 40 years. This is quite enjoyable...definitely quirky. Ruth Gordon is remarkable. The soundtrack by Cat Stevens is great too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Humor","review":"I first saw this at the theatre and during the opening scene, the audience got very quiet. I, on the other hand, was making a fool of myself laughing out loud. The irony of the mother scolding harold was perfect. The audience soon followed with a few polite titters, followed by good natured chuckles but it was way out there for those who hadn't seen it coming. This was during the hippies, it was an anti-war film, an anti-establishment film and an anti-parental discipline film, all of which appealed to the generation. Other movies such as The Graduate and MASH had the same fan base. Fortunately it has aged well and although tame compared to movies that came later, still maintains it's own style & form. I think it made the top 100 movies ever made list, quite high, around 14 or so. Bud Cort (Harold) continued to act and was at Groucho Marxs' bedside when that comedic legend died."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my faves!","review":"Very eccentric and strange. I love this movie. Ruth Gordon is at her best in this movie. I love Bud Cort also. They did a wonderful job, and I watch this a few times a year for the comedy and Cat Steven's music. Ruth was such a great actress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why hasn't anyone seen this movie?","review":"One of the questions I always wind up asking people that I like, as I get to know them, is \\"Have you ever seen Harold and Maude?\\" The answer is almost always that they have not seen it, though they may have heard about it, but they're just not sure. How could such a great movie escape the radars or so many bright and inquisitive people? I don't know the answer to this. Maybe you do. All I know is that whenever someone tells me that they haven't seen it, I drag them home and put in this DVD. I've introduced a lot of people to this movie, and they all say they love it. So if you haven't seen it, watch it, and if you have seen it, make everyone you know watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great skin comfort","review":"I have been using this product for years.

I bought this book precisely because all my textbook use the old mu synthesis toolbox and I wanted a book to complement the Robust Control Toolbox demos in the mathworks website.

You'll get a lot more out of them than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please!!!","review":"Are we to believe this poor victim was forced out of law enforcement because he was always right and the department or system was out to get him at every turn? I guess the Grand Jury, the Judge and the trial Jury were also out to get him. When, by his own admission he couldn't follow the judges' instructions.

Nights of Cabiria is the first film I've seen from this brilliant Italien director. Cabiria is such an enduring character that will always be remembered for her innocence, spunk, and most importantly, her defiant spirit after going through so much humiliation by scumbags who took advantage of her golden heart. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO EVERYONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plan 2 hrs to watch it,3 hrs to talk about it,4ever to rembr","review":"Prepare to run the gamut of emotion. The imagery and symbolism surrounding Cabiria are broad strokes of genius. Felinni sets you up masterfully for this intense climax--which might just rival the intensity of a climax with Carmen Electra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Striking","review":"At times, both funny, uplifting, and devastating. An evenly paced movie that slowly drags you into this lady's life and the recurring letdowns she suffers. Her inner charm and response to these events feed you with energy and yet, at the end, you are devastated. The restoration by Criterion is beyond belief. Check out the DVD extras for comparisons. I can't stop thinking about this lady and what must drive her."},{"rating":"2","title":"delightful, charming, funny, entertaining","review":"I just love this film! One of the funniest scenes I remember seeing in a movie in a long time is near the beginning when some guys find her on a beach, don't know if she is alive, and while trying to resuscitate her, hold her upside down. They sure didn't know CPR in those days! She is successfully resusciated and quickly lets those guys know their place as she looks for both of her shoes and the guys look on in wonder and confusion. Throughout the film, the performance by Giulietta Masina is remarkable. She is incredibly expressive but somehow pulls everything together with a masterful subtlety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, beautiful, unforgettable","review":"This is my #1 favorite movie by Fellini, or anyone!You will watch it and be strengthened by it.

Once again you can see Giulietta Masina\`s great performance.Charming, cute, funny and she expreses the everyday life feelings so well.I won\`t talk about the movie\`s story so I let you to your surprise and believe me you WON\`T be dissapointed.Ready to cry *AND* laugh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Telling Lies About Hitler","review":"This is an interesting and very useful book for those interested in the David Irving Trial in 2000. Evans, an eminent historian gives a blow by blow account of the libel case brought before the British High Court by David Irving against Deborah Lipstadt and Penguin Publishers. However, it is also very interesting as Evans then draw conclusion and raises many questions about the nature of objective history and issues about the credibility of historians.If you have an interest in any of these areas this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clouded by hatred of Irving","review":"Professor Evans's broadside against David Irving just will not fly. Not that Irving is completely right on each and every point he has made over the years. But Evans is not really a historian to match Irving's indefatigable researching and presentation skills. He commits numerous errors, makes statements that were long ago discarded by more modern historians of the Holocaust. Yes, Irving lost his (in)famous--and perhaps unwise---defamation suit against Deborah Lipstadt; but the verdict was a Pyrrhic victory of sorts. True, Irving's books soon \\"disappeared\\" from various libraries and bookstores, but his essential worth as a historian of the World War II period remains significant, even if it is not acknowledged as frequently as before \\"the trial.\\" Like Sir John Keegan and Professor Gordon Craig, if you are going to study that period seriously, you MUST study Irving. Not so Evan...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received it","review":"Did not get it and asked for refund.

I didn't get a since of making good music from the 5 heartbeats, .... The cursing out of fellow heartbeats in a public setting also very unprofessional, and classless. The other glaring problem was I believe their 1972 concert (completely unhistorically correct, someone didn't do their homework) done with drum machine synthesizer music, not real instruments with real musicians, as was the custom of that period, and not the [inexpensive] cookie cutter synthesized, drum machine music we've learned to tolerate since about the mid 80's. I give the 5 heartbeats 2 thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Acting","review":"Robert Townsend cannot act. I repeat, this man CANNOT ACT!!
