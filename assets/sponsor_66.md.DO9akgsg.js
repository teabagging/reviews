As far as I know, China is not know either for products that are not mass produced or artisan glass blowing. The edges of the starfish's legs are rough, as if they were pulled from a mold and not finished off properly. Finally, the detail and design on the starfish I received is very plain compared to the picture on Amazon. There are no little embellishments or stripes - there's just a shapeless blue blob of glass in the center of the starfish. I'm afraid I'll be returning this piece.

To be fair, most of these exotic features, which used to crash everyone's browser can now be made to work--if you are a professional web designer.

It started off with the claim that the reader will not only read faster, but that reading comprehension will increase. The only real speed reading excercises are for viewing (not reading, as the book says) large chunks of text quickly. But it ends there. There are no tips about comprehending material while viewing it quickly. There are tips for memory retention and classic conditiong for relaxation (both of which you can find in an Intro to Psych class), as well as smart ways of how to read texts (look at charts, topic sentences, etc...), but nothing about understanding the chunks of text we are \\"viewing\\" quickly. I admit that after doing these dizzying excercises, my regular reading for comprehension increased in speed a little bit.

The other pieces were frosting on the cake, however, as this CD has one very enjoyable piece after the other. There are no slow, onerous, lumbering movements on any of the pieces. All are played with a brightness and verve by both the oboe soloist and the orchestra. These are the types of classical pieces that have you humming the tunes afterward. I can't emphasize enough how enjoyable these selections are. And the amazing skills of the oboe soloist are close to unbelievable. These must be some of the hardest pieces in the repertoire, yet he punches out the notes with the greatest clarity.

I have done all I can do to try to make sure seal is tight and done correctly. These may work well for puffy/light things like blankets and pillows but I have not found them to be much help with clothes. They really don't save 75% of space and I find half of the ones I have bought to lose their seal on a consistent basis. The large ziploc bags can do just as good of job protecting your items. Also, things do not vacuum down perfectly like the picture on the box. You have to put just a few items in and make sure they are stacked perfectly to achieve this. You get nothing like the picture if you fill bag to the capacity line before vacuuming. You also get a lumpy, not very stackable final result."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for a move or long-term storage","review":"I was very skeptical of this seemingly \\"made for tv\\" product, but I have to say..its exceeded my expectations.

I rated them a \\"2\\" because with the first use, they work great. After that, though, it's a crap shoot if it'll work again. They seem to be too rigid in that when the vacuum seal is used, the bag compresses and sometimes can create folds that break open rendering the seal useless for multiple uses. I do use the bags again to store items, but can't vacuum seal and compress, so they're basically expensive plastic bags. If you only need them for 1 season or just one long-term use, then buy them, but don't expect them to keep working after the bag is reinflated. Some do work a second time, but I've never had a bag do three rounds of duty. I've bought the multi-pack and the cubes, and both have had the same issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap product. Falls apart after a couple of uses. Zip seal is very weak.","review":"We have had these space bags for a year.

Well the oh-so-easy zip machanism is totally useless, it does little to create the air-tight seam youre promised, if fact I spent about an hour anguishing over getting my airtight seam - even without items in the bag. Defeated I gave it back to the store.Recently I bought the bags again, thinking they may have fixed the problem and gave them another try.

Then I bought a second set with the same problem (bags reinflate and tear very easily). the worse is that space bag does not stand behind its product. it will cost me more than the product is worth to send it back, just to have them replace (no refund). Please don't buy these space bags."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great space saver!!","review":"I love these bags. I live in NYC where the space is limited. I used it to store all my winter clothes and it worked perfectly! The best is that I can hide the bags under the bed and still have closet space available.

Upon opening the shipping container I noticed that one of the bags came with a rip in it. I loaded up all of the other bags with the aforementioned items and less than two weeks later the bags are nearly the size of the original items. In short, the bags leak air slowly and are only good for keeping dust off your items. Don't purchase these bags if you want the items to truly compress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Create your own Space Bags!","review":"If these bags don't hold air, as advertised, then do as I do and create your own. I use extra heavy garbage bags and suck out the air with my vacumn cleaner. Twist and tie the end with a tight string or rope. The problem I have is that if I don't get the tie really tight the air SLOWLY leaks out. I had considered buying Space Bags because I thought they would NOT leak. However, it sounds as though some of these bags leak faster than my own garbage bags. In that case, I will just keep using my own method."},{"rating":"1","title":"Space Bags","review":"I really needed these bags to work because I have a small house with little storage space. I was so excited when I got these and I used a large bag for a comforter that my husband refuses to give up.At first, after I carefully folded and placed the conforter in the bag, sealed the bag and vacuumed the air out, we were amazed at how compact the comforter became! I read the reviews and noticed only a handful of positive reviewers that stated that the negative reviewers had not used the bags properly and I thought they were right because I had used mine properly and it worked!Well, as soon as I picked the bag off of the ground, carefully, the seal was undone and the bag was full of air.Excellent concept, but these bags do not work; at least they did not for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy merchandise","review":"My wife and I bought 2 sets. Only two of the bags kept the vacuum seal. The rest either leaked, or worse yet, split apart. These cheap things split under the zip lock seal, despite having a reasonable amount of clothing inside. Good idea, but terrible quality. Plastic is so cheap, it makes me wonder why they didn't bother to make the things a little thicker. I hope a word to the wise is sufficient in this case. I'd hate to see anyone else waste money on this product without being warned off."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS product that really WORKS!","review":"I absolutely adore Space Bags in any size they are manufactured in. They can be used to shrink-down or protect so many different items in your house, protecting them from dust, dirt, dampness, etc. -- not to mentiion getting lots of stuff out of your way when you're not using it.I've managed clutter control by storing extra pillows, blankets, winter robes, sweaters, down jackets and afghans out of the way until I need them. When I take them out, they are as fresh as when I put them away. I also used it to keep the dust off of my collection of skeins of yarn.I couldn't be more satisfied with Space Bags. However, it is important that you do not confuse the original product with all the knock-offs that you can find in \\"Family Dollar\\" type stores.

It cost $15, and came within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping (which is basically standard shipping).It really works. Came with a variety - an extra large, large, and medium. There's a ziplock kind of seal at the top, and there's a hole in the middle of the bag that you use a vacuum hose to suck all the air out of, which deflats the bag. Works great, I guess. After all the air has been sucked out, the bag and clothes looks all shriveled up. The top of the bag, where the ziplock type seal is does rip easily though. That has happened to one of them, but the other two has held up just fine though."},{"rating":"1","title":"a plastic bag and that's it-","review":"I bought them to store blankets in the closet and every month requires re-vacumning the air.

DONT waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"I am making an international move, so space saving is a high priority. These bags helped me out a lot! I was able to pack 2 large pillows, 1 comforter, 2 sheet sets, and 6 sweaters in an 18 gallon rubbermaid container! Without the space saver bags, only the pillows fit in the container.Downsides:1) They don't lay flat, so be prepared for that.2) The bags were a little smaller than I thought they would be. 2 pillows fit into the XL bag, 1 twin size comforter barely fit into the L bag, and the 6 sweaters barely fit into the M bag.Overall, Im happy with the job they did, but I will be purchasing more due to the small size of the bags.

Guhrke writes an excellent romance that is about a relationship that grows into love. There is no outside threats or murders, the heroine is a strong, confident women who may not be the most beautiful but does not need a man to make her happy. WHen she hears Anthony comment on how she is nothing to him instead of scheming of ways to get him to love her, she simply decides to move on with her life. What a concept!! The story that follows is about two adults who fall in love with each other, him unexpectedly and against his planning and she with real man, and not the one in her imagination.A great read, I highly recommend it for anyone wanting an intelligent regency read.I hig"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Romance","review":"Daphe is a 24 year old woman who had spent her life working with her archeologist father.

The Roles should be reversed. The two personalities just don't work and the wording is simiular to Jane Austins Pride and Prejudice. Sorry the whole concept of this book didn't work.

The next, \\"Karma Shadub,\\" at 21:01 the second longest piece on the disc, is like a meditation chant and may prove to be a deal-breaker for some listeners. \\"Tropus,\\" a piece for choir and string trio, rights the ship a bit and the \\"Alleluia\\" for string trio is quite nice. The disc concludes with \\"O Ignis,\\" a 27:43 setting a hymn by Hildegard of Bingen. This soulful piece is again for choir and string trio and brings the disc to a calm, almost noble, close.The disc will definitely mean more for listeners who know Medieval music, but as a purely contemporary work, it's a nice \\"time out\\" piece.

One thing worth noting outside the technical references of this book are the discussions about project management skills and being able to facilitate the numerous teams required to make the migration to AD happen.

However, this is not really a traditional Newtonian -- it has a glass lens mounted internally within the focusing tube that apparently compensates for the shortened tube length. So the laser collimator didn't work with it and only led the collimation to be worse, not better. Now I have a hopelessly uncollimated telescope with a dim and distorted image. I can't recommend this and suggest getting the only slightly higher priced Meade that has the full-length Newtonian tube."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"Disappointed!

You can really feel the tension between the time of Bach, of the transcription, and nowadays; especially in the Brahms.There is really something special in her way of producing sound.I also found the baroque violin rendition of the original Bach brilliant.

Now I'm thinking ahead to winter. Pockets and Ribs, I think, will be my next project. My knitting mentor tells me I'm ready to tackle just about anything, but I like simple, classic styles.

If your looking for simple shapes and easy patterns this is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little misleading -- but good","review":"I have not yet begun to knit the sweaters from the book but this is a very nice collection of do-able projects. The box actually has cards inside, each with a picture and knitting instructions of one sweater. The sweaters are beautiful. There are 20 sweaters to knit. My problem with the box is that, while the box is a little less than an inch thick, the box is only 1/2 filled with sweater instructions and the other half full of a cardboard filler. However, it does say on the outside that there are 20 patterns -- so I guess it does not matter.The sweaters are for the most part traditional, nothing weird. All are women's sweaters.

Also, all the patterns are sort of quick-knit, beginnerish sorts of things, which don't present any challenges and won't look particularly nice when they are done.

But specifically the problem with these bowls are 1) mine were already starting to rust in spots on the inside upon shipment from Amazon 2) there was damage to the top rim which looks like it originated from the factory 3) the plastic lids were terrible smelling, terrible fit and very thin and floppy. There is also only 1 hook in on the side of the bowls.I had purchased this to replace a set of similar size bowls from Ikea that were plastic and only 2.99; well these were not an upgrade by any means.

I liked the author's hard-hitting style, but by the end this book winds up being predictable and generic, like a typical 1950s Hollywood crime movie. The too quickly and neatly-wrapped-up happy ending is definitely not in keeping with what I expect from noir and really put me off; plus, the improbable (some might say, ridiculous) mystery behind the femme fatale and murder victim is so badly and blatantly given away by the mid-point that it failed to register any impact at all with me by the time it was finally clinched in the climax... That is, other than to groan, say \\"D'OH!\\" and smack my forehead, Homer Simpson style.

Most irritating is the fact that many of the functions that the program ought to perform are not available on the basic version; you have to buy the upgrade to get them. As a result, much of the payroll information is \\"hidden\\" once it enters the program; the buttons for accessing it are mentioned in the \\"help\\" windows, but don't exist on the basic version.

Once you've read a few books about gamblers and gambling addiction, you'll realize that this story is the network TV version of what it's really like (if you want the cable version, check out \\"Stung: the incredible obsession of Brian Molony\\"). The author's intent is good I suppose, but characters' dialog is absurd, contrived and filled with unrealistic bravado. Clearly, the author is no gambling addict -- not a bad thing! Though the addictive symtoms and behavior illustrated throughout the novel are conceptually accurate, they're depicted with a simplicity that renders their phenominal effect almost trivial.

I also never cared about the characters.

At first we were excited to find it, because we liked the Wizard of Oz. For starters, let's talk about the characters. Dorothy is younger in this movie, which is confusing. However, she is the only cute thing about the movie. The hen, pumpkin, robot, and the moose are like pre-school characters, which would be fine for a kid's movie,but once you meet the wheelers and the princess, you would think the movie had been transformed into a horror flick. For example, Dorothy enters a room with women's heads (only their heads) stuck into glass cabinets, and they all begin screaming. Then a beheaded woman begins to chase Dorothy, and that is quite enough for us. This movie is nothing like the Wizard of Oz.

Frank Baum's \\"Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" is a classic that shouldn't be messed with, I prefer \\"Return to Oz\\" because of its more faithful approach to Baum's work. Plus, it's much darker and more intense (the Wheelers will certainly scare the little ones), and Dorothy is indeed played by a young girl, and not a 17-year old Judy Garland (I mean no offense; she was a talented actress indeed, but Fairuza Balk is more believeable here). The special effects are spectacular, and Princess Mombi and her many heads are visually stunning.So be careful, this will not be as sweet and innocent as \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and the kids will probably be frightened by the many dark elements in the film (such as Dorothy's electro-shock therapy and the Tin Man's frozen posture).A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Return to Oz","review":"This was one of my childhood movies that I loved to watch again and again.....

Dorothy escapes from a mental hospital and ends up back in OZ which is in disarray. Dorothy needs to save OZ from the evil witch/queen that has several different identities (heads...LOL).

This underappreciated film couldn't win for losing when it was released: had it tried to follow the path taken by the inimitable 1939 classic, it would have rightly been judged redundant and inferior; yet it caught flak and brickbats because it dared to go its own way.

This is a classic good vs. evil story and the details (such as the \\"deadly desert\\" that turns any living thing into sand immediately) are less sugar coated than the musical production of the first book. By the way, this is not at all a musical but just as spellbinding.

This movie had some wonderful ideas, but none of them come across as serious fun, only hokey jokes. Trying to get past the fact that this is a sequel to one of the best movies of all time is hard enough, but watching all of our favortie characters from the original jump around playfully like muppets is completly ludicrous. But I must give credit where credit is due: the movie is very similar to the way L Frank Baum described it in the OZ books, and if you DON'T compare it to the Wizard of Oz, it does work on a few levels, only moderately. If you strip this movie of it's name and give it another, it might work for it's time. But come on people, this is Oz, and this is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful","review":"So many reviewers have written how this sequel is closer to the spirit of the Oz books than the original movie. I vehemently disagree. Baum's Oz sequels are fun, simple, whimsical, and often silly. Does Dorothy smile even once in \\"Return\\"? I think one forced smile at the end.F. Balk is very good as Dorothy otherwise (considering that she had to fill in for Judy Garland's legendary performance). But this is a compeletely joyless movie.It is beyond my comprehension that it took 45 years to make a sequel, and this is what they came up with. Atrocious. MGM's \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" is near perfect, and this movie nears a complete disaster.In Fact, the only thing that is worthy of the land of Oz in entertainment form since \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" is the new Broadway musical \\"Wicked.\\" Finally something that makes Oz sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Getting!","review":"I enjoyed this movie.

Such is Return to Oz which finds a happy, realistic, medium between the 1939 film and L. Frank Baum's books. The grenadine has been sucked out, but remnants of the 1939 film still remain (such as the RUBY slippers). What we find could be another socio-commentary film - the aftermath of growing up and child-hood dreams (or the reality of child-hood dreams revisted - that not everything is as it seemed). Fairuza Balk is beautiful and real in her creation of Dorothy - the score is haunting and has some of the same orchestral beauty of Arthur Freed's 1939 score. Some issues in this movie are not for kid's who grow up on Gumby and Barney - but if you wanna jolt your kid into reality at an early age - this flick is for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something to Remember!","review":"I remember watching Return to Oz for the first time.. I was mm say 5 maybe 6. I loved it from the start, and here I am almost 18 and trying to remember every detail of the movie. We used to watch it in Kindergarden whenever we had a spare moment on those cold friday afternoons. I would say this is the perfect gift for any generation! Trust me, if they didn't see it in 1985.. show it to them now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"kids movies are the pits these days...","review":"This movie was one of the first i ever saw that really opened my eyes right off the bat and it never stopped. I guess i led a sheltered life, never being allowed to watch \\"scary\\" things, and i guess my parents figured a sequel to wizard of oz would be good for us, but it scared the dickens out of me, but in a really good way. The electro shock, the storm, the wheelers, the headless witch, and the incredibly imaginative, lunch pail trees, the waddling tock, the green room, this is a gem of a movie. seeing this movie will re awaken your childhood imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"Received first copy....had glitches!

Younger kids were sitting there with freaked out looks on there faces. I was thinking why are we still watching this \\"Disney\\" movie. Waste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Got here on time... I just didn't know it...","review":"So I can't fault the business for not getting my hands on the product when I was supposed to. It was in my mailbox, but i thought it would be coming to my door as deliveries often do when you're in an apartment with a small mailbox. Anyways, Enjoyed the movie, lots of childhood fun to be had."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best OZ movie to date!!!!","review":"I love this movie. It is more in the spirit of L.Frank Baums books and sticks to the book so closley. The characters such as the Scarecrow, Tin Man, the Lion, Tik Tok, Jack, and Gump look more like they should from the covers of the original books(not people in make-up and colorful clothes). If you are thinking of getting this and have silly ideas of it being like the classic musical DON'T! It's much different, but in my mind better. Tik Tok is my favorite character and he looks and sounds so cool. Hope this helps anyone interested in this movie. Being from Kansas i should know right? -LOL"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic movie","review":"Awesome movie. Product was shipped quick and came in excellent condition. Very happy. thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Return To Oz","review":"This movie was a childhood favorite of my kids and a movie that was not in our collection. Although it plays out differently then the original Wizard of OZ it is a wonderful movie. I love Tic Toc and how he saves Dorothy from the Wheelers. Dorothy saves the day once again and all is well. Hope all you Wizard of OZ fans give it a try Return to Oz is fun for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"What, no Munchkins?","review":"Dorothy travels back to Oz, only to find it taken over by the Knome king. The cast is wonderful, but the story line is the real spledor here. It's not a sequal to the original, but rather an entirely new film that does the books proper justice. The bet scene by far is Princess Momby playing the Piccalo thing in the beautiful palace, before returning the head. It's just to classic! Please watch this movie, it's delightfully chilling and not too difficult to understand. Every detail is justified. Everything in Oz is some sort of subset of Dorethy's experience, but includes thed twist of the original, wondering whether Dorothy is dreaming, or if the reality of Oz is in actually a real place. It's just amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet memories.","review":"This movie is very special to me. I remember watching this movie as a child and my grandfather making me a bowl of ramen soup with rice. I know, that has NOTHING to do with the movie.This is one of those movies that you just grow up with. Wizard of Oz was a favorite but Return to Oz was even more of a favorite. The story is just so much more fun!The mental hospital escape, the rocks with faces, the lunch pail tree's, Tick Tock, Jack, even the wheelers were fun (well now that I'm an adult they are. As a kid they scared the crap out of me)! I loved the parts about Ozma and I wish I knew more about her. Of course back when I first saw this movie, I wasnt aware that Oz were books! I always tried to put together the pieces of Wizard of Oz and Return to Oz and wondered where did Ozma come from!Even as an adult, I enjoy watching this movie. Its sweet in that family type of way and its just fun to watch all the trouble and people Dorothy run in to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd, odd, great","review":"This is a serious twist on the Wizard of Oz. Different people, different setting and just different. This one is a little darker and spookier, with some campy moments and a young Faruzia Balk(Nacy from The Craft). If you are expecting it to be a sequel to the original, this will disappoint you, but if you are looking for something funny, 'scary' different and a little odd, this is the movie. There's a chicken, a moose of sorts, a witch with many heads, and tin man and the coolest rollerblading I've seen for that time. I loved it as a kid and watching again, I still love it, odd as it is. It's useless to compare the acting or 'realism' since it's an older movie, but it's still great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and Brilliant","review":"This film is billed as a childrens fantasy film. The fantasy part of it is true, but the real fact of the matter is that this is not for children. This film is much darker than its song and dance original. This film is not much of a sequel either. This film takes place in an Oz that is foreign to those that grew up with the Wizard of Oz. The sets are dark and dirty, all of the characters that we once knew have been turned to stone. It is now up to Dorothy to turn everything in Oz back to normal. This is a film that is sure to scare most children that think it will be as fun and cheery as the original. For the rest of us it is a great ride into the dark. The plot keeps the film going into different, new directions into the heart of this Oz that is over run by the darkness. Truly original and truly entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid sequel to a classic","review":"It is always difficult to make a sequel to a classic film, especially if you do so a decade or more later. This becomes next to impossible if it is a film that is based on a novel or series of novels. Most people know of the original Wizard of Oz film, but most are unaware that it is all based on a series of books. This film is a solid effort to keep to the books, while also paying homage to the original film. This is one of the first films Disney did in the live action area, and it is a solid effort. Fairuza Balk is well casted as Dorothy, and the work by Lucas and Henson in the film is top notch. This is a great film to have, be it for your kids or for your personal collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"scared me crazy","review":"I first saw this movie when I was about six years old. I couldn't sleep, and my mom hid the tape so I wouldn't be freaked out again. I found it when I was fourteen and watched it, and I thought it was an odd movie but I loved it. It was great and I watched it over and over again. Untill one day I turned it on and my brother had taped over it with some other stupid movie. So needless to say I bought the dvd. I highly recommend doing the same thing. Whether or not your evil brother taped over your original copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This movie came on time was easy to order and my kid luvs it!

So much that as an adult i've been trying to find it for years on dvd. Instead I found a digital version which is even better! To those of you who think that this movie is scary you have to remember the people who grew up with it are generally the same people who grew up with even more gruesome shows like Ahh! Real Monsters and Ren and Stimpy. Overall a wonderful buy and I'm very happy to finally have a copy of The Return to Oz."},{"rating":"1","title":"will not play in US","review":"Unfortunately, I purchased this video twice from amazon. The first time i got it, I purchased it from a company out of the UK,, it would not play in my DVD player, or my new Mac laptop. It only cost me a few bucks, so i thought i would chalk it up to being my mistake and not bother with a refund. I really wanted to see this old movie, so I went on again and bought it from Minneapolis. But it still won��t play! I think it should have stated in the DVD description that it is not in the correct format for US use. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reurn to OZ","review":"Not really for Kids. Don't know what Disney was thinking making this. Too scary for children.Condition of DV was NEW."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Heartbreaking, Beautiful, and Terrifying Trip to Oz","review":"This has got to be the most heartbreakingly delicate film I've ever seen, thanks largely to Fairuza Balk's tender performance and Walter Murch's surreal, careful direction. Murch seems to have put a painstaking amount of detail into this - the film is bursting at the seams with psychological hints and allusions that reveal themselves more and more upon repeat viewings. Beautiful, moving, quite frightening at times, and ultimately unforgettable. Forget the moderately enjoyable Wizard - Return is the real masterpiece of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter's favorite OZ movie!","review":"My daughter loves this movie as it more closely follows the book.

No, no, NO...And even with all that, I think I illogically got miffed the most that the princess got the Ruby slippers, which I feel rightfully belong to Dorothy.The ONLY cool thing was the wicked queen who could change heads to change moods, but her mionions on the skates were just stupid.

The remarkable thing about his post reform operas is the role played by the orchestra. Instead of being backround to the singers the orchestra becomes another voice. Listen to the big bravura duet finale to the first act. It becomes almost a trio with the orchestra becoming a third voice. The outragous, bombastic & altogether wonderful second act finale is one of the greatest in all of opera, not least because of the wonderful part played by the orchestra. I beleive that this new, expanded role for the orchestra that Pacini developed had a profound effect on both Verdi & Wagner. This, and the other post reform Pacini operas are wrongfully neglected masterpieces.

I assumed that the tape would be done by an actual Australian; but how wrong I was! I started listening to it, and I've heard enough aussie's speak, to begin to wonder if the tape's speaker was really Australian. I soon found out however, when the speaker smoothly changed to his normal voice; east coast american! That was enough for me to start laughing insanely and finally to toss the tape into a pile of other cassette rejects, including my personal favorite; How to Speak with a Southern Accent by Zehni lai Quien!!

The Eagle Creek ones also have some texture in the plastic which seems to hold the items in place better when you're rolling it so you get a flatter package. With these, items tend to slide down as you roll, so you end up with a lumpy wedge.

No problems so far with moderate handling, but I wouldn't recommend getting rough with it. All it takes is a pin hole leak to render it useless.Air is vacuumed out easily just by firmly pushing on it. Like the other reviews, I have found slowly sitting on it to be a better method than rolling the air out. The included Sure Zip lock helps to seal the bag easily, but it can be detached and get lost so take good care of it! There's only one seal but I would have preferred two for redundancy.My biggest gripe is it's lack of vertical height. Though the dimensions are just nice, you can't really fit a lot into each bag before the seams look practically bursting.

That method usually works for me, but not this time.The quarters continually jammed in the exit slot which required the machine to be turned off and completely emptied. When you power off the unit, any coins still in the sleeves are no longer considered as dispensed. That means the machine treats the coin sleeves as empty. It will keep dropping that coin until it has dispensed the amount needed to fill an empty coin sleeve. If you do not empty the partial sleeves it will keep dropping change like a slot machine.It also kept dropping pennies into the nickel sleeve. After emptying each nickel roll, I found at least two pennies in each. It over filled the pennies.As with anything mechanical, I expected an occasional jam. However, this was constant. Plus, the need to check each roll after it was filled doubled the work. I do not recommend this unit at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Less than 1 years old and it is useless.

They make better CG movies for video games these days. I would've rather seen it as a puppet show. Honest. Another thing that I really hated was the voice acting. It was too goofy for a story this creepy. And while it did have some creepy visuals (I'm talking loosly here) and a creepy story, the music doesn't fit. Period. Usually I'm very forgiving, but this was one of the few movies I actually dozed off as I watched. Don't make my same mistake. DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE.

It is more like reference book rather than a sit down read book. The print and layout of the book made for an even more boring book.I would recommend this book for secondary education teacher as a reference book and college students.

Of course, the film is based on Dicken's famous novel, although the story is condensed. Freddie Bartholomew stars as the title character, a young boy eventually orphaned who meets a host of characters as he grows up alone. Although Bartholomew was actually one of the better child actors in film history, he never captures this character and his performance sometimes seems forced and ineffective. However, he is surrounded by an incredible group of actors playing memorable supporting characters. Basil Rathbone, W.C. Fields, Edna May Oliver, and Roland Young are all excellent in roles that only Dickens could have written. They make the movie. The film features the usual MGM production values and is well worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all time classic \\"David Copperfield\\"","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. YOu've got WC Fields as Micawber, Basil Rathbone as Mr. Murdstone, Edna Mae Oliver as Aunt Betsey, and Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Peggotty.I think Edna Mae Oliver is the best Aunt Betsey I've seen. She really gives Murdstone an earful, and doesn't put up with any nonsense.This film holds up very well for something from the mid '30s. The costumes are very authentic, just what Dickens would have wanted, I feel. It's a very good film adaptation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hollywood's best-ever Dickens!","review":"George Cukor and a classic cast bring Dickens brilliantly to life. Freddie Bartholemew is excellent as the boy David, W.C. Fields does a magnificent turn as Mr Micawber, Basil Rathbone is a brooding Murdstone, and the stand-out for this reviewer: Edna May Oliver as Aunt Betsy Trotwood. The pivotal scene where she confronts Mr Murdstone over his mistreatment of David is among the best five minutes of film ever recorded. The only slight weak link is Frank Lawton as the adult David, who is a little insipid; but the film, like the book is most compelling when recording David's eventful childhood. There must be an honourable mention for Roland Young as a suitably odious Uriah Heep!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Charles Dickens would turn over in his grave","review":"The \\"classic\\" 1935 version with W.C.

When the 3rd one failed I tired of the personal relationship I was forming with the UPS man so being a handy sort I found the problem to be a thermal fuse that was over-heating. I replaced this part and things were fine until the spindle that drives the auger wore out. I've replaced this and that but I have finally grown weary of fixing this junk appliance.

Voluptuous with a sexy voice etc... but so much of a deal was made about \\"how could he be with her\\" that it was distracting. I LOVE the idea of a heroine who is not model thin, but both Layla and Ethan seemed to have trouble with it for a while. I really liked how they had other things in their lives, interesting jobs, sailing, biking...they were interesting characters. But dump the friend Bill! What a jerk. I'd like to see more books with larger woman as heroines. This is a nice start, but I'd like to see their size be an issue to address not an overwhelming obstacle....then again I'd like to see that in real life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"I loved this book!

This movie has great cinematography, but the real-life experience is what is the big draw. Some hard-nosed environmentalists, not to be confused with true environmentalists, may be offended by this movie (because they blame all \\"ills\\" on mankind). However, the look-and-see attitude of the plot is great and really is calming for our warp-speed attitudes of modern-day life. That is not to say it is slow and plodding, by any means. The twists and turns keep your interest and give you a love for nature and our world far better than the Walden books by Thoreau or other \\"classics\\". This is a must-see for mature and maturing people of high school age or older (younger people may well enjoy it, but may miss the \\"message\\"). Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrol Ballard is a genius...","review":"when it comes to stories of man and nature, and this is probably the best example.

I am a seventh grade science teacher and I rent this video and show it to my students every year.

And the kids all remember the film years later (especially the mouse eating part)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Most Underrated Movies of All Time","review":"Where was the Academy when this film was released?? Never Cry Wolf, from it's breathtaking cinematography through it's haunting musical score, is one of the all-time classic films about the juxtaposition between modern civilization and the natural world. Visually, it's the only film I've ever seen that feels like IMAX even if you're watching it on a \\"19 color TV. Charles Martin Smith, Brian Dennehy, Samson Jorah and the Ittimangnaqs(both of them!)act without \\"Acting\\", and the message of this film is vitally important, without trying to be \\"Important\\".

Well, okay, it's screaming in a quiet, dignified way..."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:A dull film whose conservationalist message is often eschewed in favor of long stretches of Charles Martin Smith alone in the wilderness, Never Cry Wolf has bad narration, poor characters, long stretches of tedium and a jumbled moral: stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop Crying Wolf","review":"Its too bad the movie is based upon too many outright lies and twistings of the truth, as is the rest of Farley Mowats work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting vulgar & pointless","review":"I've only seen this movie once, and that was too many times.

I'm a Wolf fan myself as well as a fan of both stars in this so found DVD very satisfying. Will be watching this film many many times in the years to come.

Covering a period from 1982-85, \\"The Pink Opaque\\" is a decent collection that captures the dark atmospherics and etheral touches of the Cocteau Twins, mostly distinguished by the lovely (if inchoherent) warblings of its lead singer Elizabeth Fraser. The remix of \\"Wax and Wane\\" is more aggressive in tone and eliminates the drum machine that surfaces on the original. \\"Hitherto\\" moves along with gloomy guitars and crisp drums, while \\"Aikea Guinea\\" stands out with Fraser in good vocal form. While I'd normally suggest that the casual listener grab their individual LPs, \\"The Pink Opaque\\" is a worthy consideration for Cocteau completists."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Late Poetry of Meng Chiao","review":"I bought this book on the rcommendation that it is a good sample of translated Meng Chiao poems to use as a guide, because I translateJade Culture of China, and Chinese poetry that relates to the Jade Culture.

There is also tales of the future. I found myself wanting to dream more vividly and hold on to the vapor of memory before the vale of forgetfulness fell over my mind as I awoke each day.Carol quotes well-known persons to relate her tale and anchor her concepts. The dreaming butterfly and girl are still floating in my mind now.If you believe in the metaphysical aspects of life, you will want to read this novel.

It furthermore is somewhat critical on the conclusions that are drawn in this field, and the limitations that exist. Also it discusses possibilities that suspects are not found in the database of fingerprints whereas the fingerprints are actually in it.We see that more discussion on the use of fingerprints as evidence is available on the Internet, in literature and in court. It is always good to remain critical and in this way the book helps in the discussion. In my opinion more scientific research is needed in this field, which can help to have a good overview of limitations and acceptable use. The large finger print databases that exist certainly help to do more research"},{"rating":"1","title":"Look further","review":"Judge Pollak vacated and superseded the January 2002 opinion cited by another reviewer.

It look like the copy protection is only good on newer computers/software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It. It doesn't Play.","review":"Don't buy this item. It has some weird copy protection stuff on it that prevents if from being played on your PC or Mp3, which is really the only way I listen to music, making this CD completely useless for most people. It is now a coaster.

Thanks for not telling me ahead of time so I could have avoided making the purchase.Now I have a colorful coaster which cost me $14.:-( Big thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luxurious sand paper?","review":"These sheets are not worth the price. They feel like the rough cloth you would find in a jiu-jitsu gi. There is a reason that these sheets were reduced in price so much, and that is because they are not luxurious sheets. I highly recommend that you purchase some different sheets instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real quality","review":"I am so pleased with these sheets. Prior to this purchase, the most thread count I had in my sheets was 600. These 1000-thread-count sheets are much more luxurious.In addition to the thread-count quality, these sheets fit my bed better, are wider and deeper than my other sheets. They cover my thick mattress with sheet to spare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheets piled up","review":"The sheets were gorgeous when I received them. Nice and thick, oversized. Now after washing them twice they are piling up. Very aggravating. 80.00 is a decent price for these sheets but I have paid 60.00 and not had them pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Quality, Excellent Price","review":"I was weary purchasing these because of the $4O price. We recently upgraded to a king size bed and I couldn't find a set of sheets in any store for less than $70. My husband sent me a link to these and I ordered. We LOVE them. Very smooth and soft and they wash up beautifully. I am going to order another set just to have extra pillow cases. $40 is cheaper than most stores charge for just a set of king pillowcases!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These are awesome!","review":"I love these sheets! The sheen is nice, the feel is super soft and they are just glorious to sleep on. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sheets for the price!","review":"These are nice and thick and feel like they'll last forever! They do get softer after washing them too. For the price for 1000 thread count these are worth it! There are other sheets for way less thread count that are a lot more expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"sheets","review":"the sheets are soft, but they come out of the dryer quite wrinkled, and the blue color dye is not holding. It has faded from face cream touching the pillow case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor product","review":"Thought this sounded too good to be true and it is. Bottom fitted Queen fits under mattress but not over top of mattress. Top sheet is much too short. To say we are disappointed is an understatement. We've used the sheets so we won't send them back but this product is made in China and should remain there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have gotten 5 except...","review":"The flat sheet is a little short for my tastes. I am picky about tucking my sheets in a particular way and these sheets would need to be ~6 inches longer to be completely perfect. Otherwise they are among the best sheets I have ever owned. They are very thick which would lead me to believe they will last a long long time. They are also very smooth once washed. I would really recommend these to anyone looking for sheets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Sheets","review":"I have had my sheets for a month now and I love them!They are so soft and nice the best sheets Ive ever had! I wish I had orderd two sets! Good quality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All great but they wont stay on my bed","review":"These sheets were a great deal and were a welcome replacement for one of the sets of sheets I use. The 1000 thread count got me interested and are what sold the product to me. These sheets are soft! The Sateen in the sheets is a minor problem. The sheets start slipping off the bed after a night or two of sleeping under them. So I end up stripping and re-making the bed about 3 times a week. Other than that, these sheets are very satisfactory and were well worth the $40 I paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sheet set - soft and smooth","review":"My wife and I love this sheet set! They are very soft and have a silky like feel to them. The sheets have kept us very warm so far this winter - I'm interested to see how they will hold up over the summer. For the 40 bucks we paid for them these sheets are much better than the much more expensive sheet sets we have bought which are only half the thread-count."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable thick sheets!","review":"I was excited to try out 1000 thread count sheets for around $50. The sheets are very comfortable (kind of buttery) and are quite thick, meaning they warm up fairly fast and keep you warm all night! It's great in the winter - we'll see how they work out during summer months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very True, Shrinking is horrible problem","review":"I purchased these wonderful sheets, only to have them after the second washing not fit on our mattress. Yes, they are wonderfully soft and lovely to sleep on, but we can only use them on a regular size mattress."},{"rating":"1","title":"1000 Thread Count Sheet Set","review":"Beautiful color - lilac. Top sheet is very small. It will barely tuck into the bottom of the mattress and is also short on the sides. Pillow cases are also rather small for king size. Other sheet sets I have bought with high thread count have been softer. This set was rather stiff even after several washings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice sheets","review":"Great product for an amazing price. Theses sheets are very nice, soft and look great."},{"rating":"1","title":"sheet set","review":"The sheet sets were nice, however it states it will fit a mattress us to 17 or 18\\" deep, which was wonderful as we just purchased a 16\\" thick, and it didn't fit! The return was easy and prompt credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Rough & Significant Shrinkage","review":"The sheets appeared to be of good quality, thick fabric, but they were too rough. Even after several washings they felt more like canvas than sheets. They also shrank significantly even though I followed the directions to use cold water, low heat and remove promptly once dry. I couldn't fit them on my bed anymore, they weren't long enough. The flat sheet wasn't long enough to start with so after they shrank it was even worse (although this is fixable by sewing on a panel of fabric so they can be tucked into the bottom).The seller was very prompt about replying to my message and issued a full refund including initial shipping (not return shipping though) even though the sheets had been washed. I left the seller 5 star feedback for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"heritage king sheet set","review":"These sheets fit fine out of the package but when you wash and dry them they shrink too much and I had to return them. These aren't a good buy. Sorry guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but not great","review":"We just got our sheets tonight, washed them in cold water and put them on the bed... Problem though is that they are a little small. They don't fit the bed correctly and we've got a standard matress. SO even though the sheets feel soft and all I'm sure we'll spend each morning putting the sheets over the matress because they \\"popped off\\" again... Not something I would buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Elastic","review":"Very nice fabric...weak elastic. One corner of elastic broke the first time we put the sheets on the mattress :("},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful sheets at the beginning, but....they lost color, and they shrank!","review":"No I don't think it's the problem with my washer and dryer, they are new units. Now only with great difficulty can I put them on my queen bed. and they claim they have deep pockets! I do believe it is a quality problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"sheet set","review":"the sheets are super soft, which i love. however, there is fading along some of the fold lines. i suspect these were on display in a store and faded in the sunlight. thought about returning them, but wasn't worth the hassle given the price i paid. the faded area is covered by the comforter anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great out of package, but changes when washed/dried","review":"Great deal for 1000 ct sheets ($39.99), so I bought... very silky outside of the package, although the color was faded to pink in the corners, as if it had sat out in the sun too long. I got a small refund back for that as I liked the feel of them.Anyway, after 2 washes, I can see the smooth sateen sheen starting to wash away (guess the fact that the sheen was on one side of the sheets was a clue), and they've shrunken considerably despite only drying on warm setting. They are thick, and were cheap, but don't hold up like luxury sheets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"There is no way these sheets are a 1000 thread count. They are cheap and not worth the money. All in all they will last though and I dont imagine the stitching coming out or anything like that but it is just not what was described."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"I bought these sheets on sale for $39.99. First of all these sheets were extremely soft and comfortable. When I first put them on my bed they were a little too big. However, when I washed them (following the manuf. instructions), the sheets shrank so much, I could not even stretch the fitted sheet, no matter how hard I pulled and tugged, to fit my mattress. I am not sure if I just received a defective set of sheets, or if this is a common occrurence."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY PILE!!!!","review":"I was so happy when I received this sheet set. It looks beautiful (that's the reason why I am still giving 1 star). But after a couple of nights of use the fitted sheet became ruff. THEY PILE!!!! If you are looking for comfort - as anybody who buys a 1000TC sheet set is - don't bather with these. Spend your hard earned money someplace else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sheets for short period of time...","review":"These sheets were the softest sheets I've ever slept in... until after a few washings the fitted sheet became pilled. I'd prefer a regular sheet to these now. I don't recommend buying them unless you only need them for a month or two... and that would be odd."},{"rating":"1","title":"1000-Thread Canvas","review":"These sheets are terribly heavy and surprisingly rough, even after washing. I couldn't believe it, thinking they would far surpass the softness and plushness of my 600-thread sateen sheets, but was I wrong. They're even worse than the $25 \\"cheapy\\" sheets I bought at Target. I was shocked my washer and dryer didn't quit on me when I washed them -- that's how heavy they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"sheet set","review":"Value for expenditure. Good quality, washes well, sleeps good, arrived on time and in good condition. Only wish that it had been American made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Royal Heritage Home 1000-Thread Count 100% Cotton Sateen, Queen Sheet Set, Lilac","review":"Rough and thick, even after many washings and use. Not happy at all. My 300 ct. is still hands down (though a different brand). Will not buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Don't know the technical jargon, but I know by the feel and performance that these are great sheets. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"better as a tablecloth","review":"If, unlike me, you're into thick heavy sheets that could double as a tablecloth or a mainsail, these these sheets are for you. These sheets are a bargain, if you think value is primarly determined by the price per pound. I have much more comfortable 600TC sheets, with better hand, texture, sheen and color fastness than these. Although I haven't put these under the microscope, I suspect what they're made of is multi-ply (i.e. twisted) thread, which tends to over-state the actual threadcount for softness compared to a sheets where each thread consists of a single ply. If these sheets were any worse, I would have returned them, but they rate a grudging OK at the price...but buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite Amazon purchases...","review":"These sheets are absolutely the best I've ever had. Some might say that you can \\"swim\\" in these sheets they are so soft and comfortable. They also fit well with my S&F; pillow top mattress unlike other sets I have purchased.Hopefully as the other reviews suggest, they will become better over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the sheets I ordered, difficult to return","review":"Instead of the Royal Heritage 1000 tc I ordered, I received... on the label, the word \\"Royal\\" was crossed out, and the color ordered, \\"stone\\" was crossed out and replaced with \\"beige\\". There was no communication from the seller before I received the sheets. There was no receipt or return label included. I called the number on the return address, and found that there was no way to leave a message. He did return my call, however, and after calls and emails, he agreed to credit my account after I had sent the sheets back. I requested and received a return label. it took a long time, and was eventually resolved.It would have been more successful for the seller if he could have told me he didn't have what I ordered, rather than substituting a lower quality product for the price of the sheets ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I should have been tipped off by the low price...","review":"but I was hoping that I had truly found a bargain when I purchased a set of Royal Heritage 1000TC sheets in lilac. When I first opened the package I was pleased. The lilac color is lovely and the sheets seemed well-made; however, after only a handful of washes, I experienced the same problems as several other reviewers - shrinkage and piling. The sheets barely fit on my 18\\" mattress anymore and are so scratchy and uncomfortable that they have taken up permanent residence at the back of the linen closet. Spend your hard-earned money elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nice feel...for short time","review":"Great sheets ... until you laundry them for couple of times (by following instructions!)- the fabric develops tangles and flocks like a cheap cotton.

All of the tracks are strong in their own right, with Facts of Life being the flagship. It was so tragic at the time that in the label's view Billy was yesterday's news and this brilliant work was buried thusly. His Piper offerings are also must-dos for serious fans. This is perhaps the best, and sadly a precurser of what could have been, to a very gifted artist that many of us are the better for having had his music as part of the fabric of our lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billys...","review":"worst album.

It doesn't have PvP and the monsters don't drop pretty armor and swords for you to play with. Dragons are going to be very difficult to level up to the point where they can even fly. It is a game where griefers, macros, kill stealing, ninja looters are not welcome and they won't even enjoy this type of game. Horizons is a game where if we don't work together then the undead can and will take over our cities.In Horizons things are not handed to you on a silver shield.

An online game CAN NOT BE PERFECT AT RELEASE.

ARGH! I've been playing for 2 weeks now, and there is downtime aplenty, bugs, no maps, and item disappearance galore. They even have an item replacement policy on the homepage it happens so much. I am so completely disgusted with this game. Star Wars Galaxies had problems, but there was something to *DO*. There are ACRES of non-content, and server lag will have your characters and MOBS rubber-banding all over.. And I have a fast cable modem. Further, when trying to engage MOBs, you have to chase the thing for 15 feet before you finally attack, usually in the middle of a camp.

GIMME MY MONEY BACK!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Major Features","review":"This game has possibly ruined the entire MMORPG genre for me. I personally didn't have any problems with the launch as some seem to have had - my problem is with the game itself. There simply is less innovation in this game than the first generation MMORPGs. If you plan to play an adventure school then get ready for kill monster X for experience (there are no item drops - only crafting resources), level up, and then move on to killing monster Y ad infinitum. If you plan on playing a crafter, just substitute create item in place of kill monster. Nothing fun about this game at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game but don't buy used!","review":"While still working out some gltiches, the overall experiance is great with a fabulous user-based commerce and a lot of fun in the adventuring areas as well.The glitches are not all worked out but one would assume subsequent released would fix this.A note: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME USED. The Cd-Keys and accounts are NOT transferrable and establishing your own account will not be possible with Artifact Entertainment if the game has already been registered. Artifact will NOT transfer the code or account. I've already had to purchase a second copy of the game after a used version was untransferrable.

It also has a great cinematic battle system, a multiple layer character engine with millions of customization options, a cool living vs. the undead story it's even being designed for cell phone support!

The graphics were pleasing, there was plenty of content, and a great community feeling. While the xp grind was there (get used to killing wolves...lots of wolves) it was masked by quests, community, and a good crafting set up. On top of that was the slightly unusual role play for dragon toons, who aged and developed over time until they gained the power of flight."},{"rating":"1","title":"game with potential but vastly unfinished","review":"After playing this game for 6+months I cant recommend it to anyone. The graphics are nice for a little bit but have issues with ATI cards, sounds is average and the gameplay while promising is missing a terrible amount of content. The weekly events are now monthly and uninspired, very few monsters and a lot on incomplete classes/features with no ETA on introduction.The company has downsized due to financial issues and thus bug fixes and feature introduction that was tauted as in game on release are still not in with no time frame.The economy is player based totally, but is out of whack, where crafters prefer to sell to npc's than players and being an adventurer serves the only purpose to fork money over to the crafters for items you cannot get anyway/anywhere else.So much is broken in there currently it's not funny. Even dragons the major selling point are far from completed."},{"rating":"1","title":"very confusing and complicated account creation","review":"After you shell out a couple of dozen bucks on CD, you need to pay additional dozen bucks a month to keep online account. Horizons account creation is absolutely the worst I have ever experienced (and I played quite a few games online).It requires patches that themselves require administrator privileges.

I was intending to write a very detailed, scathing review...but I find I no longer have the energy or desire to devote my attention to it.I'm fairly certain no one is considering this game unless theyre already familliar with MMORPG's, so let me be as brief as possible:Dont even bother with this game! It was released months too soon. It's buggy and laggy beyond belief. It's underdeveloped and woefully short of content. It's poorly balanced with few worthwhile playable classes. It loads from a slow-moving website (load times can take 5-10 minutes depending upon your system and connection). And lastly, aside from playable dragons (which arent all that great), it offers nothing new to the genre.Play Dark Age of Camelot, Play EQ, or wait for World of Warcraft or EQ2. This game deserves a quiet, merciful death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for experienced MMORPG'ers","review":"It's about 2 weeks before release and the current beta version is horribly buggy. Framerates (on my high end computer) are pathetic (averaging about 15 - occasionally dipping below 5fps). Gameplay is, to be generous, very boring and very tedious. Graphics are good, but not great. Character development is shallow, all characters are basically the same. One bright spot is crafting - which is somewhat deep - but mindnumbingly boring.I'd wait a couple months before I bought this dog. Maybe after an update or two it will be worth buying.This would be a good beginner ORPG for a young teen or someone who has never experienced MMORPG's before. Experienced gamers should avoid Horizons."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is a must have","review":"Am beta testing this game and it simply rocks.It has better graphics than EQ, SWG, EQ2.It has more advanced tradeskills than EQ, SWG, EQ2.It is both solo casual gamer friendly as well as having group and community goals and challenges.If you don't like PVP and griefers, this game is for you since there is none.So much to do, so many things to own including houses and property and the ability to build towns.Don't miss out on playing this game from first day of launch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what kind of drugs these positive reviewers are on","review":"But this game is far from ready for release.

That's the most idiotic thing ever and the very first time that I saw a free downloadable trial of a game that made you put in your credit card. They probably make you put it in so they won't tell you when your seven day trial is over but instead, charge you after it's over without notice.

This game has NO original concepts, you can fight boring computer monsters only, and there are no dungeons only the same boring landscape everywhere, hell your character can't even swim! Combat is so simplistic you can get up and go get a snack and it has no effect on the outcome, your auto-attack is just as good as any other power.

Since the price point is $225, this leaves $50 per movie. I don't know if it is just the inadequate product description (as others have pointed out), and I am somehow missing the value here, but this product seems like a huge waste of money to me.

The stories told by some very notable names are all to often filled with fabrication aimed at building up their street legend or neighborhood.

Big Jimel weaves a tale which is so transparently false that it left me wondering if the man was suffering from signs of dementia. In retrospect I suspect it is merely an advanced case of meglomania.The remainder of the book brings little to the table in terms of substance and meaningful anserws to the problems facing the mutltitude of young men engaged in senseless acts of violence against their own.

This book was nothing more than a shameless plug for the Nation of Islam and provided virtually no insight in the area of gang history.

Costello being irritatingly self-indulgent, creating yet another collaboritive album that sounds labored and is truly tiresome to listen to. I guess you can't blame an artist for wanting to continuously stretch his boundaries, but at this point I suspect Elvis is quite incapable of creating a solid, tuneful album with intersting wordplay on par with even Blood and Chocolate, let alone This Year's Model or Imperial Bedroom. Anyone who is sick of Elvis the lounge singer, should check out Graham Parker's recent albums. There's a man who still knows how to record great, gutsy music.

She doesn't remember that she was once the most lethal assassin for the United States government. But Pentecost, a terrorist leader, remembers her well and he's sending his people after her. Samantha has to quickly remember her lethal assignation skills to bat off the intruders that come for her. One exciting scene that I liked was when her and her partner had to jump from a two story building to get away from a grenade. It was about to explode a few feet away from them. They were heading right for a frozen lake. On the way down they had to whip out their guns and shoot the ice so they'd be able to break through. This broke their fall so they wouldn't break their lags after hitting the ice. This is a FANTASTIC book! I couldn't put it down. It has non-stop action all the way to the end.

Still, even after such an arduous work, you end up not being 100% sure that what you have learnt is correct. Wiley should long ago have retired this edition from circulation and then market a new, thoroughly corrected one.

I was a little disappointed in the quality of the plastic- I was hoping the plastic would be a little thicker, and less brittle-feeling. The carrying-case is nice, but I realized a net-like bag would be better, so all the sand can shake off and the toys can dry out. I can imagine the plastic bag will get full of sand and dirty water after the first use. So, I'll probably find a different bag to carry them in.

It strikes a wrong note, as if there was a World War I style trench battle in the middle of a book about Vietnam era jungle warfare. I hope we don't see any more \\"accurate\\" portrayals of the 40k universe in Abnett's wonderful books.Still, that is a very small part of an otherwise excellent read.

I think she overacted in the beginning with the teenage girl coquettishness - \\"Oh Mama, think of it!

The artwork that is interspersed throughout the psalms is also very moving and meditative. Each psalm begins with a summary of the psalm that is helpful for prayer and meditation. The psalms are arragned for communal recitation, but they are also beautiful when prayed privately. From the forward and afterword, it seems that this particular version of the psalter is \\"experimental\\" with regard to ease-of-use for community prayer, and the authors encourage feedback about such use to help in a possible future \\"revision.\\" If someone finds the psalms to be meaningful, heart-felt prayer, this psalter will only make them more so!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"BEGINNING bass?

And \\"Never Enough\\" is another of those Jesus Jones songs that sounds like it should've been written long ago, seamless songcraft and rowdy attitude mixed in with the band's above-par lyrics to form a great college-rock track.Doubt was uniformly the stronger album; Liquidizer remains worthy of exploration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now, Nothing But A Curio","review":"This album sounded like a monster when it came out, raw, angry and unique.

Sadly, in retrospect the disc sounds cluttered, muddy and tepid. It's hard now to imagine tracks like \`Move Mountains' and \`Never Enough' causing a stir, but some albums just don't stand the test of time. Liquidizor is just such an album, if you want to here the band at it's best, try Doubt, which is more mainstream but has stood up better.

When you lesson to \\"Make It last Forever\\", slip on a nice pair of headphone, lie back, get comfortable and just take it all in. You won't be disappointed.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic Mr. Keith","review":"Very romantic and awesome CD, one of his best. Great party music.

Like I Want Her. Like Merry Go Round. And Twisted. Buy it, you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Keith Sweat fans","review":"This album is a must-have for Keith Sweat fans! Unless you've bought his other albums when they were originally released, there's no reason to buy any of his other albums if you have this one. Just about all of his popular tracks are on this album, aside from a few of his obscure hits. \\"Make It Last Forever\\" is a favorite for anyone that enjoys slow jams from the old school days, and \\"I Want Her\\" should bring back memories of the late '80's high school dances. This album also has \\"A Right And A Wrong Way\\" and \\"How Deep Is Your Love\\", which were a couple of his really popular slow jams. No Keith Sweat fan should be without this one in his/her collection, and the album contains enough tracks to keep the CD going for more than just a short drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for late 70's/early 80's Sixers Fans","review":"I loved this book growing up.

Beasley has a talent on the sax that is near un-matched. He has a smooth, strong, and disciplined voice that rivals that of James Osborne, but is capable of Luther/Teddy riffs and touch.I must say that I've seen Walter Beasley live, and the album pales in comparison. That is in no way a denigration of the album, but a wild and vivid endorsement of catching a live show if you can. If you are not fortunate enough to have that option, and if you like spirited, adventurous, and sometimes a touch 'sappy' jazz/blues, get this album, play it early and often, and then buy more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dealing with webtwo","review":"I think Walter Beasley is wonderful... but when I ordered this CD, I was sent a tape cassette, who has tape cassette's.. When I contacted K.Beasley I was told this was a final sale.She wasn't a Wal Mart Store..I live in NY, work and manage a restaurant, and our main goal, is to make the customer or guest happy.. I returned the tape to Fla. and again was told by K. Beasley no refund, my credit card company fully refunded my money.. so I don't know how good or bad the cd was ... But I will never buy anything from a 3rd party again , on Amazon...and I really didn't even know it was from a 3r party until I placed the order.. Amazon was not much help at all..

After last year's fabulous 'Belly Of The Beast'(directed by Ching Siu Tung), I figured there was no way I could be disappointed. I was wrong. Lord Steven is just looking sick in this movie. He's bloated and his hair is extra nappy. The action is pretty weak and the script pathetic. But the worst part is that at least fifty percent of Lord Steven's dialogue has been dubbed over by someone(I'm pretty sure its the main bad guy in the film)else's voice, who sounds nothing like Seagal. Its pathetic. The entire film is pure doo doo. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"the \\"Worst\\" Steven Seagle film I've ever commented","review":"What happened to Seagle?

Why slander a country?Seagle should not have taken place in such a meaningless product like this. There should be some other ways of arising problem of child abuse.

He originally got Frederick for his birthday from a friend of ours which he immediately fell in love with. He asked me to get him more of the frederick books. I looked up Leo Leonni and found out that he had several other books that won the caldecott medal/honor. Since it was more economical and easier to maintain to get 4 stories in 1 book, I bought this book. The weird thing is that my son wants me to read the 3 stories that won the caldecott honor/medal (he loves swimmy, frederick & alexander and the wound up mouse) but he doesn't care much for fish is fish. I guess the caldecott panel really know their stuff!? I got teary reading Alexander and the wound up mouse.

There are no pictures. There is little information what the rules look like, what they're made of, and when they were made. I recently picked up 30 rules from various manufacturers and many of them were not listed in the book. The book only provides date ranges rules were made, no specifics on determining the exact age. For a particular manufacturer, like Sun Hemmi, the book does NOT provide the simple method of determining rules made from 1950 on (the 2 letter code)."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long list of makers, too short slide rule descriptions","review":"The book is a long list of slide rule makers and models, from 1600 to today.There are short descriptions on slide rule technology at the begining of each section, but I expected a more detailed introduction and a shorter models and makers list."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this tool, especially at this price!","review":"Within two weeks of it's arrival, this little tool has become a serious fave for me, whether it's for levelling or marking. I'll never drop a chalkline again! It's ease of use and adaptability are even making me less reluctant to hang wall paper again.Perhaps you can find a brighter laser, or more functionality but you'll pay a lot more for the privilege. Yes, I've seen some of the similar products on the market. The Craftsman level looks nice, but to be honest, I've had quality complaints with Craftsman tools for some time and I'm not anxious to revisit that line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Pictures our straight and hung faster","review":"This little item works really well I bought it for my husband since we recently bought a new house he has a lot of hanging to do. He no longer needs the huge level, tape measure and pencil he just has to push this into the wall nail and its done. The laser is really strong so be careful around people, you don't want to make them blind because you are waving it around without the shield covering the laser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but needs to be more accurate","review":"I could think of a thousand uses for this until I discovered that the horizontal level wasn't accurate. I was attempting to align two pictures and found that when the horizontal level bubble showed the unit to be level, it was actually off by about 1 inch every 6 feet.I've contacted the manufacturer and received a reply that the issue was forwarded to the product manager. So far no response from the product manager.So like the title reads, great idea but isn't useful it it's not accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not measure up","review":"I can?t say that it measures up. The Strait-Line may be okay for hanging a picture or putting up curtains but it is not ready to replace the chalk-string yet. Sometimes it is okay. Other times it skips a lot and, in certain light conditions, it is very hard to see. It is handy as a quick check (Used for quick checks, I would give it four stars.) but I was unable to use for doing actual work, like putting up a tile ceiling on furring strips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I bought this thing from a local home improvement store thinking it would be handy to use for hanging items on the wall and providing layout lines for flooring, etc. Wrong! The retractable pins that are supposed to hold it to a wall or ceiling or whatever, retract continuously and it won't stay in place. The laser line is practically invisible so it was of no use even if I had a project where I could just set it on the floor. It does seem to be fairly impact resistant proven by the number of times the pins retracted and it fell off the wall plus throwing it across the room out of frustration didn't seem to hurt it. However, it was a piece of junk before I threw it and it's still a piece of junk. I don't even know where it is anymore and I don't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much money -- get a pencil and ruler instead","review":"I thought this would be a nifty quick high tech solution to hanging pictures, marking for shelves, etc.Unfortunately the product is flawed for several reasonsa) the laser is cheap and does not draw a straight beam of light for more than 6ft.b) tool has no easy way to attach to the wall except by making two holes with sharp punch pins (get out the spackle!)c) trying to use this tool causes grief and possible need of counseling...In summary, using small pencil marks with an old-fashioned tape rule is still superior and I am sure that most pros agree that this is an overpriced, overhyped, piece of junk. Compare to the price of pencil and you'll be even more disgusted. I only wish I could get my refund and more to cover the cost my frustation with unlevel results."},{"rating":"1","title":"LASER LEVEL","review":"Bought this for a gift to my husband. He hasn't used it a lot, turns out to be a little more of a problem to use than not using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for working in the dark","review":"As other reviews have noted, my experience of this tool was that the light in the room had to be very, very low to see the laser line at all. Many times, I had to turn the lights off just to see the line. Also, keeping the thing on the wall with the pins was a joke. My attitude went from frustration to amazement as it fell off the wall again, and again, and again. Finally, you cannot accurately level the laser with the bubble levels on the tool, as the bubbles are too small to line up between the lines with ANY accuracy. This tool is being returned today and I am going to check out other products. I wish I had listened to others and not purchased it in the first place. Final result: a \\"tool\\" that has little use beyound amusing pets and maybe setting it on the floor to lay tile in the dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laser Intensity","review":"The laser is not powerful enough,and the line washes out in the daylight. You have to work in the dark to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to be objectional","review":"Got mine as a gift. I'm a carpenter by trade. I've used lasers since they came out. You had to literally bolt them to the wall. Now they are small enough to fit in you hand. The one I have is out 3/4\\" in 8 feet plumb, and twice that in level. Jet line with a line level is more accurate. A plumb bob takes a little while, but is more accurate also. So is a level with a straight edge. The beam is straight and does seem to go over small obstacles in uneven walls or floors. For what it can and can't do it still needs to go down in price. It is only good as straight line. I hardly ever use the one I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I am still wating to see a straight line I can follow. The line will hit a perpendicular surface but not show up on the surface I am working on. I will be returning this item. Furthermore the 2 pins to hold it to surfaces are puny and they either do not penetrate or the unit falls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just the Facts!","review":"If you're like me you look at the reviews before buying. I was very excited when I saw this product. For me it meant no more lugging my big rotary laser. Well he's the deal. The Strait-Line 64001 Laser Level is a great idea, but it lacks greatly. The laser is just to dim to see. You can hardly see the line on a white wall. The laser's power is just not enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes 3 weeks to ship!","review":"I just ordered this item and I was told that the delivery estimate is 2 - 3 weeks by UPS! You may want to reconsider this if you want it as a Christmas present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Well,right away upon practicing I found out as with many other reviews the level vials were not accurate.I used the push-pins[about 3/8\\" long] in drywall and after a few screws secured into the drywall the level came down and cracked the laser lens cover which is the switch for the laser line.I would say however for the brief time it was used the laser beat a chalk line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money like I did","review":"This tool is not very useful; I feel that I largely wasted my money. You have to manually level the tool (using a tiny bubble level) every time you want a level line, which means it is no more helpful than a traditional 48 inch framing level made of aluminum. But doesn't the laser at least work over longer distances? Not in practice, because you also need to manually hold it up on the wall while you use it (unless you want to pin it in place, leaving holes), so the line is only good as far as you can reach with your other hand. Real self-leveling, tripod-mounted laser levels are great, but this is not that tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product, lousy customer service","review":"This thing is nothing but a laser line projector. The vial bubble doesn't reach the limit marks. How in the world would you be able to get a level with that? Use a little pin to held this thing on the wall? And to correct their bad design, they want you to buy those 3M Commander stickers. Yeah right! Don't bother sending them feedback on these errors, oh excuse me, features.

The B-Square bolt stop cover plate is literally twice as thick as my existing bolt stop cover plates on all my mini-14's. I looked at it very closely under high magnification. This means the bolt stop cover will NOT fit on any of the four mini-14's we tried it on. Contrary, we tried two other brands of this exact same type of scope mount, and they both fit immediately.

I will call customer service tomorrow but for now they are gonna make me have to grind it down. I dont like this.I finally grinded it down with a dremel tool and got it to fit. Another problem is that the hex screw for tightening it down and leveling it to the stock, strip out very easily.

I looked on you tube and found a video with instructions on threading a circular machine. You just need to follow that and this machine will work. My daughter completed a fuzzy purple scarf with the yarn in the box and loved it! She did drop a couple stitches right at the end of the project ( her fault not the machine, she stopped halfway in a row) easy fix, you can't tell I had to stitch it up with this fun fur yarn.She wants to make more things, for the 20 bucks I spent it works to what I expected, just don't expect to be able to make complicated items.

The quality of construction seems good and it is easy to adjust length quickly. It easily handles my Canon Rebel XSI even with a 70-200 f/2.8 lens which is quite heavy. I have not tried more expensive monopods and this one seems adequate for my needs. I plan to use it during school functions with the kids and for extra stability for non-IS lenses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon Monopod 100","review":"The canon monopod does exactly what I need it to do and was reasonably priced. I reviewed several others and was going to purchase a different one that was twice the price of this monopod but decided against it. This monopod is lightweight and I like that so when I have a camera, heavy lens and flash attatched to it - it's not too heavy to carry around. When I say lightweight I don't mean cheap. That's what I was afraid of when I read some reviews but it is constructed very well and simple to use. The other monopod that I had would only let me shoot horizontal shots or I had to turn the whole monopod in order to shoot vertical. This one has a swivel head and it's very easy to operate. Very satisfied that I chose the Canon Monopod 100. GREAT PRODUCT and YES I would recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good purchase","review":"I have been looking for a tripod but chanced upon this monopod which was totally new to me. I didn't know something like this existed. I brought it with me to Hawaii (march 2009). I had fun using it. It was very handy in taking pictures of myself. Rather than disturb other people to take a picture of me, I just put my Canon Sx10IS on it (tilt the lcd view finder of my camera and put it on a 10 second timer) extend the monopod and I get beautiful shots without having the camera too close to my face. It also provided good support when I need to use the zoom option of the camera which minimizes the shaking. I really love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clip broke right away - now useless!","review":"I liked this monopod at first, but the bottom clip broke the second time I used it.

It is compact and light enough to pack for traveling. The quick-release locks on the leg allow for easy extension and retraction. The pan head is an added convenience some other low-end pods do not have. I will be using it with my 12X zoom with 1.5X tele-converter for added stability. Although I have not yet taken the trip for which I purchased it, I expect it to serve me well when the time arrives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughts on the Cannon monopod.","review":"The Cannon Monopod is an inexpensive, convenient way to steady the larger, heavier cameras.

I use it with a heavy 400mm lens and it holds up nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This monopod looked well designed -- comfortable grip, light weight, extra length, easy-to-use swivel head, very compact. Unfortunately, after just 3 uses, the bottom lever just snapped off with hardly any pressure. The plastic is too brittle to support the pressure of holding the leg in place. Other users have noted this defect as well. I can't see any way to repair this. Adorama's return policy requires you to return defective products within 14 days, with complete packaging intact. I really wish this monopod had been made of more quality materials for the levers -- it really was perfect in every other way. Now it's unusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the Price","review":"This is a great monopod for the price. It is lightweight and well built. The only downside is the ball head isn't really made to handle the heavy weight combinations of camera and lens (such as the EF 100-400L IS on a 20D). It will work fine while shooting with heavy lenses, but you'll need to carry your rig by the camera/lens while transporting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canon Monopod 100","review":"Appeared to be a rather sturdy monopod but after about 3 weeks of shooting various sporting events, on section of the retractable leg is sticking quite badly now. I'd say spend the extra money for a better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, light, sturdy and fast","review":"This is a great, light weight mono-pod. The camera (E-510) mounts to it quickly and the head holds it tight. The ball on the head stays put even with a larger zoom lens on it and the leg sections are easy to extend. They also stay in place once the levers are locked down.All in all this is exactly what I was expecting and it fits my needs perfectly.So why only 4 stars and not 5? I would have liked a built in clip that would make it easy to attach to my camera bag; I had to make one of those myself.Other than that - a great item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable tool for Macro work!...","review":"In the beginning, I was toting around a tripod for shooting flowers in Macro mode, but soon became annoyed with all those \\"legs\\" around me when shooting. So, I decided to invest in a Canon Monopod 100 where all I had to do was just raise or lower the one leg which I found was so much better than using a tripod.I'm not knocking tripods, because I do use a tripod for other photo shoots, and I'd surely be lost without one.But, in my case, shooting flowers, I simply found that a monopod worked wonders. And, when i first used the monopod, I was afraid that my shots would come out \\"blurry\\", but quite the opposite, no blur at all, so thats when I was sold on using a monopod."},{"rating":"2","title":"One happy photographer!","review":"Canon Monopod 100 for SLR Cameras & LensesWith this high quality monopod, you'll have the comfort and good results you are looking for.

I'm 6' tall, and it extends a bit past my eye level, and is easy to adjust. It's very lightI wondered about it's strength, but it surprised me... it's much sturdier than the typical low-budget tripod leg, with no apparent \\"wobble\\" at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great product at a great price!!!","review":"I've been an avid photographer -- professionally and as an amateur -- for 55 years.

Die, Vecna, Die! is an epic adventure that falls just a bit short due to the fact it seems a bit too pre-programmed, leading the adventurers by the nose at times. It does bring the story arc for Vecna closer to a conclusion, but relies too heavily on plot contrivances that negate some of what has come before in the other Vecna adventures, such as the revelation that the Sword of Kas that we've seen in Vecna Lives! is a replica, not the original, or that, oh, by the way, there IS a way for the Sword to defeat Vecna. This module also suffers in comparison to Vecna Lives!, which managed to evoke a truly terrifying atmosphere. However, this is a fine adventure well worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow","review":"I bought this JUST for the 5/64 bit, and it has already stripped.

However, I have not yet taken the PCAT so I still have to see how well it prepared me for it. The only beef I have with this edition is that it does not contain info on the changes in the test. They refer you to a website to cover the new material. Also the book contains info that isn't on the test anymore. I think they should have redone the book and included the new material and got rid of the old."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is for the old pcat version!","review":"I just recently took my pcats on Nov 20th and I cannot tell you how disappointed I was with this book. After reading the reviews for this book I thought that this was the PERFECT book for me. When I took the Pcats, however, this book only contained about 1/3 of the information that I needed to know about Chem and Bio. I studied this book night and day, and I knew this book from front to back. Also, organic chemistry was a third of the Chem section, and Kaplan did not cover all the info that was needed to do well on that section. Surprisingly, biology was a lot harder than Chemistry, while the verbal section was easy.(mainly because Kaplan failed to include the essentials for the test)This book might have been great for the Pcats before they made changes to it, but to me this book was absolutely useless in preparing me for my Pcats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great preparatory tool","review":"I know this isn't the newest version of the book, but when I bought this book, it prepared me very well for the PCAT. To give you an idea of its completeness, I scored in the 90th percentile without having taken any college biology courses outside of a general biology course."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Help","review":"This Kaplan book is the most in depth coverage of the material in the PCAT that I found. It has very thorough review sections and covers probably much more than you will really need to know. If you can review with this book and at least survive the questions they ask in the practice tests, then you will do fine on the PCAT. Note: Do not freak out when answering the practice questions, the questions in this book are harder than the ones on the PCAT.Some comments that should be mentioned with this book: This book does not cover calculus, so be sure to review it also. Don't worry so much about chemistry calculations; try to get down the general concepts. Do not expect to learn everything you need from this book, there is too much info in it...instead focus on your weak points and strengthen them. Relax and follow some of the test taking tips given in the book...they really do help.In case you care, my composite score was 99th percentile. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Exact Copy of DAT","review":"This book is a word by word copy of DAT.

I consider Under the Western Freeway one of the best albums that I own because its just great music. Grandaddy experiments with different sounds and styles, but they play their music with emotion, great intensity in some songs and a sweet sadness in others. I can see how this experimental nature may turn some listeners off from their music, but I think it's great that the band just plays what it wants to. Nowadays it seems some bands and singers seek to use music to create an image so it's refreshing to hear a group that displays sincerity and passion for their music.Some songs I like on the albumAM180 - Great song, catchy tuneNonphenomenal Lineage - I love the guitar in thisEverything beautiful Is Far Away"},{"rating":"2","title":"summer here hids","review":"Under the Western Freeway has Grandaddy's best song, summer here kids. this song is good enought in its self. oh ya and the rest of em arnt bad either."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unknown classic","review":"I heard of an album called 'The Soptwhare Slump' by a band named 'Grandaddy', i really wanted to hear it so i decided to take a trip to my local record store to check if they had it.

EC never was much of a singer, but here he's way out of his depth -- off-key whitebread bombast is not what this kind of music calls for.

It's not too heavy on character development, but just enough to keep the characters interesting without an Oprah-esque heaviness. It's got a couple of different mysteries running at one time, but the writer handles that with ease. There was one section (a chase through Europe) that was a bit long, but other than that, this is a very good, very quick read. It's similar in style and tone to Patricia Cornwell's early work.

The symptom is a message saying that the Inbox table of contents is corrupt, and offering to rebuild. If you say YES you will probably loose all your email permanently! The correct answer is to say no, exit Eudora, then use File Find to locate inbox.toc and delete this file, which will delete the table of contents but not the email. Then Eudora can recover.Another suggestion that has improved the reliability for me is to have an automatic filter that copies all messages from Inbox into Inboxsafe, which might be slightly less vulnerable to corruption. The last suggestion is to make sure the boxes don't get very full. Don't take vacations :(Regarding spamguard, there is no spamguard built in to Eudora.

For that reason, I'm giving this unit two stars.APC UPS's, which I normally use, all have replaceable batteries, which is a big money saver when they wear out after a few years.

Highspots are the demented sax ensembles and solos, Kaiser's dead-on wah-and-graunch guitar stylings, and Smith's eerie grasp of what Miles was trying to do, but sometimes undershot. From the get-go, it doesn't sound like an imitation, but more of a tribute. Minor quibbles: Kaiser should have tossed the cheesy guitar-rack sitar effects and used a real sitar. And Smith plays just a bit too clean. But anyone who loved Miles will flip over this CD. And those who didn't, or were too young to get it: Hold on to your hats.

The main problem was the paper cover containing the ream was torn very badly and wasn't even protecting the paper. There were pieces of tape on tears in the paper cover, which held up, so it seems the ream had been damaged but was sold as new. I reported the problem and asked for a $5 partial refund.

Rod Taylor brings his typical light touch and charm to his role as the hero, leaving young Dennis Cole to do a lot of the action, that is climbing onto the moving train. Great cast with John McIntyre as the railroad owner and Micheal Ansara as the jailed brother of Lamas. The other hero of the show is the car...a 1914 Stutz Bearcat.

I cannot understand the success that Enrique could achieve. Musically, nothing new, untouched with rock history and with current modern trends in music (the effort to rap in one of the tracks is just worth a smile). Commercial bubble gum music for female teens, only pretending emotion while being emotionless. Enrique's vocal is ordinaire, somewhat worn down and weepy.

No over-the-top midwives or larger-than-life heroes here: the tale is populated by a bunch of ordinary people trying to do the right thing as best they can. Even the magic is low-key. Thus, the story isn't really just about the conflict between environment/development -- it's an extended character study of a man who has to make decisions that can't please everyone.

It's essential to the plot that we believe in the conversion of the main character from \\"cynical lawyer\\" to environmentalist. This conversion is not believeable.

The author broke the cardinal rule of \\"don't tell, show\\". Again and again instead of showing us the story, the author told us the story. Another issue was that there seemed to be three, possibly four stories, within this book with only a minimal connection to each other. The second half of the book had little connection to most things that had happened in the first half of the book. The change brought upon the central character seems unsupported in that we didn't fully understand why he was the way he was before or after the change. The central character seems to be nearly devoid of emotions throughout the entire book so it is hard to care what happens to him. Buried somewhere in here is possibly a good tale.

I find this disc one of those that arrests your attention, not by the virtuosity of single tracks, but rather by the solid coherence of the whole. Since most of the melodies are unfamiliar (\\"Lazybird,\\" \\"Blues for Poland,\\" \\"America Drinks and Goes Home\\"), that quality is nailed by the band itself. The one exception--the stand-out track--is \\"Corazon,\\" in a brilliant, unforgettable arrangement and a dead-on performance that is paradoxically tight and loose, from ppp to fff.

Loads of fun for under $10!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"My 8 y.o. son had begged me for this toy for months. Finally we bought him one and it is a huge disappointment. I don't know how it received a Parent's Choice Gold Award. What makes the ball go flat is a suction cup inside the ball. When we flatten the ball out, the suction cup doesn't keep it flat long enough to throw it. Without the suction cup working, it's just a ball."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"This toy is not worth the money. Buy a frisbee and a ball instead. The commerical shows how it magically turns into a ball when its in the air. The box states that this will happen only at random times and the more you play with it, the better it will work. It turns into a ball when it hits the ground usually and our kids lost interest very quickly.

This 14 cut session became an instant Xmas classic, now 52 years old! The Gleason orchestra backed by the Keith Textor Singers, created this no vocals, strong melody/lush arrangements effort that made it the hit is has become. I believe the original Capitol Records pressing rights are with the current Razor & Tie label. The original Capitol Xmas mailbox cover photo was also changed.

Prof Suttles succeeds in his stated objective of providing a reference grammar accessible to interested non-linguists (like me). He steers clear (for example) of the more question-begging sort of presentation of Salishan languages which denies the verb/noun distinction, but provides all the relevant information bearing on the point; the grammar is accessible but in no sense linguistically naive. Prof Suttles' anthropological background is evident in the quite copious and interesting appendices too.The index is a bit patchy.

Still, \\"Mirage\\" is powerful and riveting on its own terms, bitterly reflecting the realities of life for thousands in a war-torn, impoverished place, as the films of Rossellini and De Sica did half a century ago. Kovacevic's transformation from a sullen, helpless, sensitive boy into a veritable one-teen island of rage and reprisal is terrifying and authentic.

Ms. Wolper writes some great one-liners for Elizabeth, but she also proves that even smart talking characters can be shallow and ultimately uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cigarette Girl","review":"I must totally agree with ohmargi in her review of this book. I found myself unable to put this book down, but wondered where it was going. It was quite entertaining to live vicariously through Elizabeth and her girlfriends, but what happened to them in the end was too abrupt. I found the characters lives too choppy, unfinished and I wondered why Elizabeth subjected herself to some of the treatments she received. I was very disappointed with the ending (balloon analogy is quite accurate) and had the feeling I was strung along for nothing. I would pass this book onto my friends, but would not \\"highly\\" recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like pulling Teeth!","review":"I am surprised that this book got any good reviews. I thought Bridgid Jones was so much better! I could not even finish this book. The author was so in love with the main character (and this was a barely disguised autobiography, I am sure) that it made me want to barf. She constantly built up how funny a line was going to be prior to delivery, and the line would fall dead in the water. Maybe I missed something, but I don't know what all the hype was about. I am not a prude by any means, but her over-use of the f--- word (about 5 times per page) got very old, very quickly. Don't bother with this book! No wonder this woman was stuck in THE ZONE! She will probably be stuck there forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex in the city without self-esteem or hope","review":"There are two ways to read the book. One that because the lead doesn't get married, that she is *liberated*, broken out of the husband-baby-suburb mode unconcious ruling our late twenties mentalities. Elizabeth, the lead, is, after all, on shelf at 28. Along the way, there are lots of snide comments about how feminists don't get laid and purchases of many great shoes. I kept waiting during all the cynical witticisms and descriptions of how predatory other women, for the author to make a point, bring some plot points back. When she does, I feel cheated, the main character is cheated, every woman in the book is cheated. Maybe LA really is no place to be a girl.Stick to sex in the city, it's smarter, funnier, and has a heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's a Bimbo and Won't Admit It.","review":"The \\"Heroine\\" in this book is as much of a bimbo as any of the bleached, silicon spinners in LA. Constantly on the make for sex, she gets irritated at men who won' sleep with her (hello insecurity, constantly needs a man's attention) She uses her \\"brains\\" to create trite come-ons for the old director who is a poor and over glorified representation of the Late, Great (hooker-hiring) Don Simpson. Carol Wolper's proximity to the \\"Hollywood\\" lifestyle (she's pals with Gina Gershon, whoo!) is just about all she has to go on. I'd take a whining Bridget Jones over this loser of a book any day.If you've spent anytime in college and can carry on a semblance of intelligent conversation with a man, pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I only got this from the library","review":"I only read half of this book simply because I couldn't get into it. I don't get it. The only thing I remember is the main character was sleeping with a directer or producer type guy while his young girlfriend is in New York and some fancy friends I can't relate. I guess it's an okay book to read if you like that kind of thing. I didn't read the entire book to know how it ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this book published?","review":"The Cigarette Girl is a sub par book chock full of banal subject matter and pedestrian writing. You don't care about the characters. You've seen this world of shallow movie biz people before. The book is not funny, moving or even slightly insightful. I was left wondering who the author knew in order to get this empty tale published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"One of the genre about single career women looking for Mr. Right. Helen Fielding and Jane Green did it lots better. The writing is witty but the characters are shallow. There is no clue about what the title means. The main character, a Hollywood screenwriter, compromises herself too much at the end. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"and will you respect yourself in the morning?","review":"Even though Elizabeth says half-way through the book that she will never settle for less than what she wants, i.e., true love (and from the beginning you know she loves her mentor, Jake), ultimately she settles more than anyone. I know the author intended this to be a hip, \\"honest\\" portrayal of the now woman, and probably believes that Elizabeth isn't settling at all, but what does Elizabeth have at the end? A sometimes affair with a man who seems to sleep with whoever wherever he wants, who is having a child and living with someone else, and who basically is unwilling to acknowledge that Elizabeth means much of anything to him. Boy, sounds great! Without meaning to, the author has just presented me with the best reason of all not to have an affair--it's sleazy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why did i buy this book?","review":"Definitely a why-did-i-buy-this (okay, i know, i thought it would be fun), or how-did-this-get-published category book.

A shallow sex-crazed airhead and her life and loves in L.A. Her main criteria for a man seems to be one who will sleep with her (and that euphemism is *never* used, it's always the \\"f\\" word). Men who already have girlfriends are an even bigger draw for this woman, who doesn't care if they leave their girlfriends, just as long as she gets some action on a regular basis. Brand names matter very much to her. Her sense of humor will give you some chuckles, but is not the laugh riot the reviews imply it is. Wolper adequately describes her characters, but unfortunately you quickly come to the conclusion that these are people that you want to avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindblowingly BAD","review":"This book was presented as something akin to Bridget Jones, well it is a book, I suppose, that is where the similarity ends. There was no warmth in the character no humour in the plot, it was predictable, lacking in any sort of witt, warm or humanity. It is a book about a shallow Bimbo, in a shallow world surrounded by characters who are even worse and more dislikeable then her, I defy anyone to care what happens to our hero or the idiots she spends her time with. The writing is poor, the storyline reminicent of the worst of 90290. It's is pure LA, in the worst sence of the word, shallow, meaningless, unoriginal and boring!

Like many RPGs, the final battle wasn't the hardest I encountered, but the overall game was good, and none of the puzzles were incredibly hard to overcome.A definite keeper, with considerable replay value, as you try out other classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neverwinter Nights Hordes of the Underdark","review":"Hordes of the Underdark is an adventerous game containing various new classes, feats and levels!

That, of course, is no problem for me because it is nothing for me to see the problem and fix it. I must say, for the average gamer it might be tough to fix.

Their sacrifice was not in vain. They did overall do a good job.There have been additions that are kind of neat (ie \\"flying\\"). You can hit upto level 40 now. The storyline is better than SOU and it won't put you to sleep like SOU.However the game is not without its flaws. The game is inconsitent with the origional NWN (ie same characters have different races, religions compared to the origional). Bioware did a bad job with the origional henchmen.

The sound quality of the ATRAC3 is excellent!However, the main gripe I have seems to be the same as everyone elses. The copy protection scheme is annoying.I do a lot of \\"original\\" recording via the analog input on my sports model. It would be nice if I could copy that to my hard disk ( any OS, since I use several, mostly NOT Windows ) and be able to make my edits and also to back up my audio on cheap data CD's for archival purposes. This seems possible, the software just doesn't allow it. Also, I run MacOSX 10.1.4 and BeOS 5.03 ( I know, a dead OS, but it works! )Still, a good product.

The problem is Sony decided to make getting songs really difficult with their software OpenMG. The program is barely functional on my brand new pc. To make thigs even worse the program has anti-piracy parts in it. Who actually buys a MD player to transfer songs they bought? Anyways if you have any problems with the software don't depend on any support since OpenMG website is closed. OpenMG is the only software you can use to transfer songs. I think you can use realplayer to transfer the songs now too but you can only put mp3s on it. Because of Sony guarding its ATRAC technology so closely they have taken away their user's rights to pick which program they would like to use. Unless you want to spend an hour changing the songs I suggest you don't but this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for voice","review":"I use the MZ N707 on the job, recording meetings, speeches, etc. This is a great tool, vastly superior to any tape recorder. The sound quality, using Sony mic ms907, is just amazing. It's relatively easy to quickly move through a recording for key points and to transcribe notes. The only real con, and it's a minor one, are the control buttons. They aren't as responsive as I would like. The remote is cheap, and somewhat disappointing considering the quality of the product, but functional. If I could upgrade the remote, I would. One change Sony could make: please include the means to attach a carrying strap to unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably real nice - if you're OK with copy barriers","review":"In a bit of a hurry, I purchased one of these primarily to record digital audio on location using the mic input. The package states support for .wav, and so I expected to be able to copy to my PC and export to .wav or something usable elsewhere. I learned the hard way that it can't be done, or at least they work hard to prevent it.

Very easy to use under red light and it even displays the Greek Alphabet letters associated with each star (ex. Beta Orionis). Even if you have no observing equipment yet, this will help you learn the sky better than any of those huge books.

I purchased the Oster Expressbake machine and it was a horrible mistake. The machine doesn't mix the dough well, pieces of unmixed dough clings to the crust, the consistency of the bread is mealy and the crust is extremely tough. I am in the process of trying to return the machine. As for my old machine, alas it got so busy mixing dough that it took a dive off the counter top and had to be put to rest.

More than worth the price.If you like this - try the Icewind Dale games (you can get the entire set of 3 games in a Boxed set for less than $20 - maybe even ten)I was hooked because - yes, when I was 16 I played the DnD version - which was one hundred times more scary - and about ten times more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"so much unmet potential","review":"You know that saying \\"the whole is greater than the some of its parts\\"? Well, I feel the oposite is true with this game. It certainly looks very good. It has a very good turn-based fighting system that is easy to use. Stat building and leveling up is handled well. The problem is that these individual elements do not add up to an enjoyable game. It feels rather empty, and due to many bugs (several of which crash the game), I found myself eager to \\"get it over with\\" so I could play something else.It lacks any meaningful plot and is basically a series of somewhat redundant battles.

It executes the 3.5 rules nicely, and watching them in visual action provided me with a new respect for the ruleset.

I imagine that it helps if you have a powerful computer system, but from what I've read, it doesn't help much.If you can pick this game up on the cheap, say $10-12, go for it, as long as you can also download the official and unofficial patches.

There were several times that I entered a home in the village and was unable to start a conversation until I moved the entire party around; possible due to movement being blocked.The combat system takes forever to finish, although I did like the area of effect being shown before casting spells.I found the game to be many of the Dungeons and Dragons rules without the imagination or great storylines that were the hallmarks of my D&D experience. After being given the initial \\"wow\\" of graphics and the original Temple of Elemental Evil as a backdrop I would have expected much more than this product delivered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting game...if it would work","review":"The game is pretty interesting. I'm not a pen and paper D&D player, so I can't comment on that aspect of the game. But as an avid video gamer, I liked what little of the game I have been able to play. Unfortunately, even with two patches for this game, it still is riddled with bugs and other complications that make the game frustrating and not very fun. I was sorry to have spent the money on it that I did. I could have laid down the same money, or perhaps even less, for a better game that was actually fun to play. The technical difficulties destroyed any chance that this game would be enjoyable. If you're a glutton for technological punishment, buy the game. Otherwise, find something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T!","review":"my god, why did I ever installed it? wait a few months and buy it after the first 10 patches comes out, becouse you know what? it doesn't work without it, I'm using PENT4 1G with 512MB mem win XP, sound O.K?, well it's slugish and crash all the time... just wait..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexcusable","review":"The BG games, IWD games, and NWN games were all wonderful near flawless D&D games. I enjoyed each one tremendously but they were all made by the same company.Then came Pool of Radiance, a D&D game by Ubi Soft, and it was a bug filled unplayable pos.And latest is Temple of Evil by Troika and Atari... buggy and almost unplayable like PoR.Didnt they learn anything?This games price has already dropped 1/3 and its very new. It will be a bargain binner like PoR in the near future.If you want a wonderful D&D experience then buy the Baldurs Gate, Icewind, or Neverwinter Nights series. STAY AWAY from Pools of Radiance and Temple of Evil. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the Patch","review":"This game is unplayable in it's current form...it might be good once they get it out of beta (maybe alpha) testing, but I'm sorry I spent any money on it before it was ready. In the future I intend to stay away from all Atari Products"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Crashes... No gameplay either!!","review":"I have to agree with the previous review. After the Balder's Gate series (1+2+Throne of Bhaal) and the IceWind Dale set, this game is a disappointment. I have not experienced any crashes on Windows ME, but the bugs are just too frustrating. The scrolling of the screen is too slow. The comments made by the previous reviewer are spot on with regards to graphics, combat and character generation. I only gave 2 stars because the bugs prevent me from seeing more of the game. Anybody reading this should hold out for the patch first. The crashes must be due to Windows XP(extra problems!), but the bugs are very unprofessional for a first release. Come on guys, you cannot even complete first level quests due to bugs... how much beta testing does it take to discover that? Shame on you Atari. I remember TOE from D&D all those years ago, hence the interest. What a shame. Tis a few steps backwards from BG1+2, IWD1+2 and NWN."},{"rating":"2","title":"ADDICTING FUN, BUT GRAPHICS LEAVE SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED","review":"Honestly, at first I was upset. When you plug it in and start playing you realize right away this game has the graphics of a NES, but when you are using a gun it's so much more fun than a gamepad. Makes the experience. Overall the game was fun but not really a value since a NES with a gun and a hunting game would give you overall the same results. One advantage is that it is plug n' play and can go anywhere. I got it for my dad and he loves it and can figure everything out so it's a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a Hunter's family","review":"My family loves this game. My husband, my 8 year old daughter and my 3 year old son love it. It's great because my son is even able to use it and shoot the deer. Every kid that has came over and played it, loved it. It's great b/c it has target practice and different level hunts so it's even fun for my husband and his friends. I have had it for 2 years now and have had no problems. Great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"I bought this toy for my fiancee because he likes to hunt and thought it would be fun to play.

He wanted another one so I called the number on the insert that came with the game, it was made by Mattel. The lady was real nice that I talked to, she said this Play TV Huntin'3 game has been discontinued because it drains batteries, 4 batteries don't last but for about 3 weeks. You would go broke buying batteries! The game itself was only $18.00. She said this is why the toy has been discontinued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radica Huntin' 3","review":"My son was given the Radica Huntin' 3 game for Christmas. The game was fun for the first day and then on the second day it started to malfunction. The computer inside the gun slowly started not working, by the end of the second day he couldn't hunt at all. We returned the gun to Amazon.com where it was purchased. We then bought the same game from Walmart. We brought it home today and it didn't work right out of the box. The gun won't calibrate so it is impossible to hit anything. Since both of these guns were defective and they came from different states I am guessing it is a bad design. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PlayTV Huntin' 3","review":"The gun is a good size. It takes a little while to get the aiming down, but it's a lot of fun when you do. Not realistic hunting, but that's not what I was looking for, a 7-year old was the recipient. He loves it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PlayTV Huntin' 3","review":"This game pretty much blows for younger kids because it is impossible to aim. It is too difficult for them to manipulate the scope on target. The graphics are marginally better than the first generation of Pong.

Sus interpretaciones sencillas, en especial La Bikina son fabulosas. El maestro Ruben Fuentes debe sentirse muy orgulloso por la interpretacion de Luis Miguel de esta su bella composicion. Los medleys de los boleros son fabulosos y luego los toques nuevos en sus viejas interpretaciones. Bueno, no podemos pedir mas. Luis Miguel, te luciste de nuevo!

My problems with the stereo:It felt and looked and operated as though it were shoddily built. The wires when plugged in had to be jiggled often so that the circuits could be closed. The CD player was noisy as the disc spun; it sounded like a window fan blowing. The lights were too bright at the low setting, and the way in which they changed color was annoying. The sound quality was none too good. Setting the alarm was tedious. There was no sleep button. And worst of all, the thing stopped working completely three days ago, which was roughly two weeks after the 90-day warranty expired.

The cd covers various styles of this musical tradition ranging from Rhumba to the male initiation anthem Abakua. This collection by Grupo Afro-Cuba is excellent for students of music, collectors of African derived music or people who just enjoy good music. The varied tracks in this collection invoke feelings of joy, pride and dancefloor fun.

I put a smallish 40 w bulb in to reduce the weight in the head of the lamp, but invariably it folds at the center and base hinge, leaving the bulb only 16 inches or so above the desk -- not effective for lighting a large area. The hinges are just too weak to support the weight of the dome AND a light bulb. I am already looking for another lamp that will stay in the position that I set it. Price and appearance, 4 stars; functionality, 1 star. Overall, two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This lamp is a piece of junk","review":"The lamp will not stay upright no matter how tight you make the screws.

Sure, you can press and hold a button to keep it at a particular color but when you turn the stereo off it loses the setting and cycles through the colors again the next time you turn it on. Maybe you could deal with the bright lights if the sound was good. Once again, don't but this one! Even if you can get past the very thin, metallic sound the hiss of the CD player at low volumes is unacceptable. Once again, Sharper Image's quality disappoints me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome game, good guide!","review":"First, I would like to say that Shadow Man is one of the best video games I have ever played. It has a higher maturity level, beautiful hi-res graphics, and tons of levels and objectives. I would definitely buy this game if I were you. As for the guide, it is very helpful. This is not the kind of guide that tells you exactly what to do every second, but rather a guide that will help you if you're lost, and give you a general direction if you don't know what to do next (you have to find many items on your own)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone documenting this turkey gets an 'A' for effort...","review":"The only thing more tedious than playing this infuriatingly redundant game must be describing how to circumnavigate the maddeningly homogenous and sprawling levels...Seriously this game makes tooth extraction look like an attractive alternative. It's reminiscent of MacDonald's Kurdy; an eternity spent breaking granite with straw. In fairness to the programmers', Shadow Man is absolutely beautiful, the interface is simple and relatively clean. The immensity of the environment makes the game incredibly boring: Lara is more graceful and athletic. Gordon is much faster, and not as prone to endless meandering in go no where levels...

My major problem with the novel is the rather bland characterization. In particular, I found the lead character, Professor Wim Vermeer, to be a remarkably colorless individual. I also found the plot somewhat slow-moving, with very little suspense until the last 50 or so pages.Also, I would not buy this novel if you're interested in the Harvard Business School and its inner workings. This book actually has very little to do with the school or business in general. It is instead a straighforward whodunit that happens to take place at Harvard. Most of the action in this novel takes place off-campus.In the end, I can't recommend this book because I think there are far superior mysteries out there. In particular, I recommend the work of William Kent Krueger, Jacqueline Winspear, and Michael Connelly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Face-paced debut","review":"Jeffrey Cruikshank's Murder at the B-School is an enjoyable and well paced debut set in the financial and academic worlds.When a wealthy student at Harvard Business School dies under mysterious circumstances, Prof. Wim Vermeer is asked to represent the college and act as liaison with the young man's family.The powerful MacInnes clan, predictably, shuts Vermeer out. But he soon teams up with a captain on the Boston police force to jointly pursue their investigation. The professor's involvement, along with the detective's willingness to accept his participation, are just two holes in the plotFortunately, Cruikshank's characters are interesting, and his descriptions of the internecine battles of academia are well-done.

He hits all the hot spots, including Afghanistan, Colombia, Iraq, etc. in his survey. He's done lots of traveling, no doubt, but his writing comes off as macho bragging (of the \\"I fought off three guys armed with only chopsticks!\\" nature) and his advice on staying safe is pretty common sense (Really? We shouldn't flash large gobs of cash in crowds? Thanks, Pelton!).Pelton himself was captured by armed rebels last year in Panama's Darien Gap and had to be rescued. If he's so savvy about the world's most dangerous places, why did he get himself in that position?

It appears that the author added a string of half-truths to another of hearsay and mixed it with own experiences, drawing a phantasmagoric scenery, impressing on people totally unacquainted with the subject matter.

How does he manage to review two chapters in DP4? A book that hasn't even been written or published yet? He hasn't even read DP3 or he would know that RYP is not a journalist and probably one of the more levelheaded people around.

Most of the info was rehashed from the previous editions, and I'm not going to shell out twenty bucks to read the same thing twice. It seems that as the editions keep going, it's getting lamer in both visuals and text, as if the publishers made the author tone down (\\"dumb down\\" is a more appropriate phrase) the material to make it more mass-marketable. Not to mention that DP5 is designed more poorly than the previous editions, making it a little more difficult to distinguish the sub-chapters of each country. I think I'll borrow a copy of DP5 out of the library and photocopy the new countries and stories and add it to my well-worn edition of DP4.Yes, there are some new countries and some new stories, but overall, \\"the shoes ain't worth the shine...,\\" as the old saying goes. Severely disappointed, RYP, severely disappointed. It's as if all the new found fame has gone to his head and not into the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENTERTAINING AND STRIKING","review":"I have consulted this book many times over the last few years, both as entertainment and as a reference to what is going on in a particular part of the world. It makes for a very entertaining read, as the author not only describes the socio-political situation of the country, he also tells a story of his own experiences in the particular places.When I started reading about his experiences, I often thought them exaggerated. However, given Robert Pelton's recent abduction in the Panama Colombia border by paramilitary groups, I start to believe more and more that he actually did live through such experiences. The book is a good eye-opener to everyone who thinks we are living in a modern civilized society. If you are doubtful, read about sub-saharan Africa or Central Asia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ingenious","review":"This is the first book I have been inspired to review.Pelton gives ingenious real travel advice that I have not before found in another guidebook. It's not a traditional guidebook, rather, but an introduction to the world's sketchy places and an appeal to get out there and do things outside your comfort zone. Start living!Outside of catologuing certain places, DP offers specific advice and travel tips for traveling anywhere, really. Also lots of links to other sources.Its a great reference book, highly entertaining, and even inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"The World's Most Dangerous Places (5th Edition) by Robert Young Pelton","review":"I bought this book as a gift for a friend who owns an older copy, a copy printed before 09-11-2001.

The laid back writing style and the in-depth details keep a reader occupied for days. However the timeliness of the information, much like the places he writes about, are perishable given the high-instability of many overseas countires these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather have poison ivy than watch this movie","review":"I was forced to sit through this movie; yes Alyssa is attractive and it's allright to see her half naked but being that she is one step down from a porn star - everyone has already seen that, so yes I was expecting her to be her normal trampy self again but you would think the movie would do something else to keep an audience interested.Instead you go scene to scene waiting for her to undress or if you're like me waiting to see the credits roll as the plot is girl comes to town; has sex with the first guy she meets, reads some old diary notes, then decides to become a homewrecker, then finds her morals, married guy who thought he was going to get some gets pi$$ed and tries to kill her.This movie was just downright awful and I still have nightmares from viewing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alyssa is Alyssa!","review":"I have seen this movie 4 times and still loved it the last time around.

A rather sappy love story is the center of the movie and there's very little suspense. The only reedeming feature is Alyssa Milano's performance as Lily. She's really good and I must admit her nude scenes are also very sexy.The DVD contains no extras. It would have been interesting to have included interviews and behind the scenes.All in all, a movie for Alyssa Milano fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"this was a great movie for direct to video. it had more sexuality then the first and more drama. it was so much more tangable then the original. the first one had offscreen sex, which just didnt work becuase of what Drew was trying to do, but with the onsreen sex in this one, showed a loss of innocence. but the thrid one just sucked!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poison Ivy II: Lily","review":"I liked this movie.

Lily (the Milano character) is no teen murderess, nor is she a premeditated homewrecker. The story is sexy, but not gratuitously so. Both Alyssa Milano and several others turn in competent performances. Cheryl Ladd was particularly notable in her role as the invalid wife. Milano, of course, is stunning. She's sexy enough, thank you -- but mostly she's just oh-wow, girl-next-door pretty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrated \\"No Nudity\\"","review":"The movie was a good thriller, if you are looking for Nudity, the Unrated version could easily have passed for PG.

It only has just like 5 minutes of very mild action, total."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyable in a strangely melencholy sort of way","review":"I guess different people have different expectations of a movie labeled an \\"erotic thriller\\". Many people probably watch this movie for the breast shots of Milano, and they won't be disappointed. However, this movie has far more depth than just a showcase for the VERY talented actress and her fine body, it actually has a rather well done plot and a cast of excellent actors as well ! Each character seems to have been perfectly cast for their perspective role, and the story is unpredictable and rather unusual for an erotic thriller. Don't expect the usual tired seductress/broken hearted seductee sleep-a-thon here, this movie actually has plot twists and an interesting story line. I would say that this is the best movie of the 3 movie \\"Poison Ivy\\" series, and enthusiastically give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwhelming","review":"All right, I've tried to get into this one about as much as a fan of the Forgotten Realms can, but, I just don't like it. Here's why: the game is overwhelmingly cluttered with... stuff! Normally, I'd never knock that in such a title. Morrowind, Warcraft, and some other older turned based titles had as much, if not more \\"stuff\\" to contend with while playing. Yet, Neverwinter lacks something in its delivery. There were too many times where I got disoriented by some column or building crossing between my character and my eyes that resulted in some minor attack catching me entirely off guard. The ability to modify/personalize your character and his equipment is too limited. Interactions between you and NPCs are frequently tedious and unrewarding. And for those who claim that the expansion packs or tool sets make-up for these frustrations; please note that I didn't give the game 1-star. Oh yeah, the music wasn't that bad either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fans of BGII may be dissapointed.","review":"As a huge fan of Baldur's Gate II, I was expecting a lot more from this game. The party system is not at all like BGII. There are no romances or banter to be found, unless you engage in the online play. That, in and of itself, was the most dissapointing aspect of this game. The rest of the game was ok. The graphics are pretty nice, a little cumbersome at times. The plot is fairly interesting, perhaps a bit too easy for some. The game also offers a starting level to help train the new player on the various controls and console. Overall though, it just got really boring without the ingame banter/romances/mods that BGII had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blaaah","review":"It's not the follow-on to BG2 that I expected.

Having just one character under full control, and a second barely under control, isn't as much fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neverwinter Nights Gold","review":"Enter a world of magic and adventure in Neverwinter Nights Gold Edition. This pack includes both the original Neverwinter Nights and the Shadows of Unrentide Expansion. This game is a RPG with both single and multiplayer modes. It is my opinion that this exciting game is well worth your money and time.The storyline of this game is well-developed and the characters fill their roles well. The campaign also includes many sidequests so you can take a break from the main story. Much freedom is given to how you create your character and how you go along with the storyline. Also, your inventory is easy to use and you are easily able to access anything you carry.This is a fun and versatile game that is definitely worth playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it but...","review":"great game from back in the day but I could not get it to work on windows 7 64bit. maybe I havent spent enough time with it but Ive tried installing it twice and no luck. will update if I can get it to work"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neverwinter Nights Gold","review":"When my start up disk became compromised, I purchased this product so I could continue playing my game.

Don't get me wrong, I'm probably the biggest Howard Hewett fan on the planet, but I just can't stand any fake action and thinking of the talent of Howard, he shouldn't have done that to his fans.

This has also been the experience of two friends of mine, who (unlike myself) are HUGE fans of O'Brien's previous apocalyptic novels, and who have absolutely devoured his other works. This, however, they couldn't even bring themselves to finish... \\"No, really,\\" they tell me, \\"his OTHER books are great.\\" I'm sorry, but there are too many authentically and consistently good authors in the world for me to waste any more time on this one.

The graphics were decent, and cool at times. It takes a while to get used to it, and even then you might move your character in the wrong direction. Magic is a complicated game, and it was hell for the programmers who originally made the AI that plays.The spells 'come to life' to give it more action, and less strategy, and make it less complicated. Seriously, you (the wizard) can block or deal one damage. If I was playing MTG (the card game) and I got attacked by a 1/1 I can't say, I smacked it dead.

You immediadetly know there's something wrong with a game, when it's graphics are worse than those of the original Nintendo. Torneko is a boring and tedious dungeon crawler, with randomly generated enemies, items, and weapons. This is a huge problem since sometimes i had gone with only several enemies and all items that i needed, other times i had armies of enemies and very little items, in which i had no chance of winning from the begining. To win you don't need skill, just luck. The story is too simple and the main character is a fat middle aged guy. There are many beutiful RPGs with engrossing gameplay and graphics, on the market. You don't need this game for whatever reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eew! Random trash","review":"The randomness of the dungeons makes sure that all of them are poorly \\"designed\\". There is absolutely no progress or purpose in playing because after each dungeon you go back to level 1. The same randomness makes your success in the game completely dependent on luck, not what you do. You may find yourself stuck in some place where you can't progress because luck has given you an impossible set of enemies. And you wants to be a fat middle-aged man? This uses some of the enemy monsters from the famous Dragon Quest series. That is the only reason anyone would buy it: if they're a big fan of Dragon Quest.

It's meant to fly very very slow and it does, can maintain lift at 6 mph or less with a slight wind. It's very light, about 10 ounces, so can only fly on calm days unless you're an expert at flying a light plane in the wind. I used a small straw and placed them where the wire landing gear meets the mount to prevent the wire from cutting into the foam on rough landings. best to fly this model indoors if you have access to a gym (great for teaching science classes!) but I fly outdoors right after dawn and also at about 6 pm when the wind dies down.

A Russian who made most of his career in France, he sang Des Grieux in the first recording of \\"Manon\\" and was especially admired as a Massenet singer, as the thrilling excerpts from \\"Werther\\" on this disc demonstrate. He has the rare ability to instill a sense of poetry and character with just a few subtle touches--a treasurable singer.

I physically felt his hand and received a healing. Working daily with the healing techniques in this book gave me the extra training and focus I needed to set up my professional Reiki Practice.

I always used the hole on the bottom to push a battery out with my finger--so it must be poor quality plasic--or not enough plastic on these inner tabs. The four on the outside appear to be a bit thicker. I suspect an injection mold issue and Canon should correct this. On the other hand, once inserted in the case, I have no problems.

This is probably not her best but I happened to keep it for the erotic sex scenes. She usually promises at least a good one towards the end of the book and this book has 2. What about storyline?

The feeder works as advertised with no issues at all and the only concern for me is that when I arrived home the feeder was completely empty. So unless my cat ate more than usual due to the stress of me being away or another animal was getting in the yard and feeding as well, the feeder may be too small for one cat for one week.

Now, it's hard to find and extremely costly, but at least you get a lot of it when you do buy a box of it. This starter is teeny tiny and makes one batch, more than doubling the cost of the yogurt.

I found a nice alternative in Dannon Oikos Greek Yogurt - plain. It's 1 dollar at our local walmart (cheaper if you have a coupon) and works just as well.

It's very cheaply made and I would not recommend it for anyone who wants to learn by following along with the DVD. You have to watch each section individually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very funny!","review":"I am a great fan of Victor Borge, and this collection is superb!...even had a couple of things I had not seen before.

This is not mentioned on the packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Genius at work, tape could be better","review":"Victor Borge's work is incredible, and this tape is a compilation of some of his finest bits (See end of this review for a list). Unfortunately, unlike the tapes you rent at the video store, this tape is in the grainy EP mode, so Borge is not presented as well as one might have wished. The materialrates a 5, but the EP speed rates this tape a 2. If the nonstandard EP speed had been listed so that the buyer could choose their own personal price/quality trade-off, then that would have given it a 3 or 4.Introducing Mozart............

Good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad VHS burned to DVD","review":"Wow - I was shocked at the poor quality of this DVD. Be warned - this is the poorest quality DVD I have ever purchased from Amazon. It appears that someone had an old VHS tape of a PBS Fundathon [which is about the only time PBS plays decent stuff like this] and transferred it to DVD. The only reason it gets 1 star is for the content - the presentation is so bad it almost completely ruins the show. It's like watching TV off an antenna when the weather was bad. Come to think of it.....And they did a lousy job of it.The content is [mostly] all there, though there seems to be a couple of bits missing - probably poor editing when this lousy excuse was transferred from whatever medium it was on originally.You have been warned - avoid this particular version of the Maestro's work. Pay a couple extra dollars for a different version. And shame on whomever did this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Victor Borge is great - this DVD isn't","review":"This DVD is very inadequate in showing the amount of humor Victor Borge is known for.

WHich, by the way, is awesome. If you have ever read your horoscope, or the birthday analysis book, or for that matter have had your Myers-Briggs personality type analyzed, you will LOVE this book. I find this to be better than any personality inventory, much more accurate and actually takes into account the very, very complex nature of our personalities as human beings. It is spiritual and helped to change my life, actually. This particular book takes a light-hearted yet educational approach to the 9 types outlined in the Enneagram. Fun to read, actually humorous at times. I have to say that everyone I have showed this to is amazed at the accuracy. A good intro to the Enneagram."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helping to Understand Why.","review":"I had previous knowledge of the Enneagram but needed a deeper understanding of its ramifications for me. The format of this book illustrates succinctly the different facets of personality. The cartoon illustrations bring the traits of ones personality type to life without diminishing the importance of the written text. They show clearly the strengths and weaknesses enabling one to use strengths to advantage and, at the same time, curb weaknesses. This encourages more harmonious relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Into to The Enneagram","review":"If Enneagrams are new to you, and they were to me, this is a fun, simple introduction.After reading this I bought a RISO/HUDSON volume including an Enneagram Test (RHEA Test, from memory).

The zipper is crummy and the side pocket zipper pull broke off when I went to zip one of them open. The feel of the jacket is also CHEAP and the removable faux fur hood embellishment looks like rat fur and it also looks like it is coming off the huge hood. It could be cute if the hood had a better design and the fur was nicer, fix those zippers and get some nicer feeling fabric and it could be a winner! Close but no cigar...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth Sounds of Nat Cole on SACD","review":"The best that these tracks have ever sounded - mastered by the master Steve Hoffman - direct from the original mastertapes. Smooth hi-fidelity for these 50 year-old plus tracks, presented better than they were recorded by Capitol. And in three track stereo = Left - Center - Right with the orchestrations in the side channels and Nat Cole basically in the center.My main gripe would be that the two discs could have been 'filled-out' more - Each disc only runs just over fifty minutes for the 38 tracks... A touch miserly IMHO for this (very) premium price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn typing quick!!!","review":"Learn typing quick and easy is a great typing tutor!

The book is full of errors!There are blatant mistakes and distortions on virtually every page! E.G.Page 15: Filignano is in the Molise region not Abruzzi. Page 37: The RCA contract was signed in February 1945 not October 1944. Page 47: The apartment was not rent free. Lanza paid $75 per month for it.Page 219: Lanza and Di Stefano never met. I know Di Stefano. They only spoke twice on the telephone.Need I go on? I have spent a lifetime researching the life and career of Lanza (the last 20 years working on a biography.)I cannot believe that Amadeus actually published this almost completely inaccurate book. As for Mr. Bessette, I don't know his motives for attempting this futile exercise, but the mere fact that he relied on Al Teitelbaum as his main source of information says it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appears he used information from other books!","review":"I have read every book out on Lanza. This book, although has different pictures in it, nonetheless is a carbon copy of all the others, with nothing new added, except some alleged isolated, unprovable stories. I suppose one could ask how and from whom after 40 years since Mario died, did he get this 'new' information, when other authors who were very close to Mario and would have had this information, never knew about it. My opinion is that this book has absolutely nothing new added to it. My concern is only that this book defames not only Mario Lanza, but his family as well, which is not appreciated by Mario's following and should be questioned in any interviews that he may have. After all, he never knew any of the family nor did he ever meet mario Lanza."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Negativity!","review":"Mario Lanza was one of the greatest tenors of all time. I was only 7 when he died, but I remember listening to my sister's records of him, especially \\"The Student Prince\\", which I still have, along with some of his CD's and all his movies. This book seems to desicrate his memory--and all the happiness his wonderful voice brought to everyone. I enjoyed the pictures, but did not care for the tone of the book, which seemed unnecessarily negative. I agree with you, Damon! Your Dad was wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing list of Lanza's failings.","review":"This is a depressing list of Lanza's failings, passing as a biography. It's everything negative about Lanza that you didn't want to know.If you've seen Lanza in his movies, you won't find that Lanza here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A load of rubbish","review":"I don't know why time was wasted in printing this book, the content is nothing that has not been addressed before and most of it is not what fans or those interested in this great mans artistry want to read about, instead of printing unsubstantiated innuendo I would rather read about his talent, this is nothing short of a slur on a great man. This book was touted to be the definitive biography of Mario Lanza, instead it turns out to be nothing but el cheapo magazine stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another compilation of trash and half-truths!","review":"Instead of a new slant on the life and work of Mario Lanza, we have been served another sleezy, trashy compilation of all previous Lanza myths. Quite a shame, as a truthful biography which would focus more on the mans music than the third generation gossip which keeps turning up seems to have been another missed opportunity traded in for the usual trash which has been printed about Lanza since his untimely death 40 years ago!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope the author never gets an interview","review":"This author and his book leaves a lot to be desired. Although he writes well, he misses the mark with his feeble attempt to undermine Mario. Never have met any of the family, he professes to know too much and depends on others and their wanting to be included in his book, in which they give him any information that he wants to hear. He has not done his homework well and no matter what others may say, he is no expert on Mario. He never knew Mario or his family. This is a cheap shot for him to make money on. His next cheap shot is on Lucy Ball, which will be a bigger mistake. He already started on her..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage - Lanza deserves better treatment. Pure tabloid.","review":"This book makes supermarket tabloids look like great literature. It centers on, and magnifies every negative aspect of Lanza's life, and does little to give description to one of the greatest tenor voices of the century. Even when his voice is given praise, it is usually tinged with negative commentary. Much is drawn from previous biographies (Callinicos, Bernard, Robinson) which makes this a rather lazy effort that brings little else of a factual matter to light. The only redeeming quality of this work is the inclusion of rare photos which Lanza fans will enjoy. You can forget the rest as worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ripping good read.","review":"Authorative, well-written and nicely packaged, it is a book for Lanza and non-Lanza fans to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Even Bother To Waste Your Money!","review":"This book is a distortion of half truth.

This is a DVD series the way they all should be. Not only do you get some first rate television in nearly pristine transfers, but you get all the extras you could ever want. The normally serious Rod Serling goofing lines, bumper spots for Chesterfield cigarettes, CBS ads for other TV shows of the day, ad infinitum.

The quality of the shows more than stands up to the test of time and the dvd quality is amazing. Really well done job! I get a kick out of the endorsements at the end of each shows for other shows of the time; Andy Griffith show, Make room for Daddy, all the Westerns that were so popular then. Really brings home how ahead of it's time Twilight Zone was when compared to the shows airing at the same time. The acting from so may well known actors was top rate.

Having every episode in one convenient collection was one of the best gifts I could have given her. All the episodes are beautifully remastered and stay true to their roots. Not to mention the fact that it includes two episodes no longer aired on TV even today. It also includes a lot of little extras such as interviews with Rod Serling, and commercials that were aired with the original airing of the show.

Every year I always catch and episode or two that I've never seen before, and catch a few I know by heart, enjoying every second of it.So during the winter months this year I decided to splurge and buy the entire series box set, every episode in original air date order. This is the Ultimate Twilight Zone package for any fan. Plus bonuses too many to list, complete with a booklet which gives a quick synopsis of every episode. Simply put, you can't do better than this. All struck from the original camera negative and magnetic soundtrack it says right here on the box, and it definitely looks that way on my TV screen.So do yourself a favor, if you're an old fan or new, grab this set and beat those cold winter night blues, you will love it!T"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great buy!!!","review":"After reading the various reviews from fellow co-buyers, I decided to add this set to my collection. I'm so glad that I did. The quality of the transfers to DVD is the best I've ever seen, & the shelf space this set takes up for a 28 disc set is very small. It contains tons of extras & the price breaks down to a little more than a $1.00 per episode. It was delivered in 3 days & I'm super pleased with everything--price, quality, delivery.

I love the original Twilight Zone and each disc plays great. I really like the menu set-up (the main menu has a link to each episode on the disc and you can select that episode and select which scene you would like). One thing I would change, is how it is packaged. Each DVD case has each season in it, which contains 5-6 DVDs, they can be hard to push the button down to remove the disc and they catch on one another it feels like you might break the disc in half, but oh well now. Maybe 4 discs per case would have been better? put 2 discs on one side then another 2 on the other side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not perfect","review":"This is obviously a great collection with all of the extras, but I have two issues with the set.

Overall great, but get it right next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite classic.","review":"This is quite a classic tv series in my opinion, very well done, and definitely enjoyable.

This is definitely a classic set."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Twilight Zone","review":"The is the first Twilight Zone which aired from 1959 to 1964 including 138 episodes.

The blu-ray picture on my big screen HD tv is awesome, like watching a short movie. The extras, while not all new, are still interesting and informative. For all you real TZ junkies, I can also highly recommend a book called The Twilight Zone Companion.

It's great to hear the actors speak about working with Serling as well as the their nostalgic reminisences of \\"working\\" during the late 50's.My favorite parts of this set though, are the college lectures by Serling that give a glimpse of his genius as a writer and the challenges he faced working in the tv medium.In my opinion these lectures also show the side of Serling as a \\"regular guy\\".Overall this is probably the best \\"set\\" I've ever viewed.

Even after all of these decades have gone by, it's a classic show--most episodes are well written and thought provoking and even the episodes that are a little weaker are still interesting to watch.My only annoyance is that it doesn't give the viewer and option to play all episodes on the dvd.

That's fine if you're going to hand pick an episode, but it's a little annoying if you just want to have the disc running in the background while doing other things."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Twilight Zone","review":"A great box set, just what I expected.Shipment was fast and everything was intact.

I got a great deal on it and 28 DVDs are well worth the price for this. A long-time fan of the TV marathons, there are several episodes that I have never seen! There is only 1 complaint I have about this set in that there is no feature of \\"play all\\" on each disc. Therefore, I have to manually go back to the main menu and go to the next episode and start. Additionally, there is no way to \\"repeat all\\" either. Sometimes I would just like to put on a disc and let it play! There is also no option for subtitles. Otherwise, this is a nicely put-together set and essential for any true fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really terrific, except....","review":"While admittedly, I have not yet viewed all six seasons in this format, I discovered a quality control problem in season two. Whoops! The last disc just falls out, of course shiny side down, because the box was not constructed properly. So, before you cut the cellophane, grab a couple extra boxes, in case your set was cheaply produced anyway. But, on the plus side, the discs I have viewed are all excellent for clarity and content. What a great series. (I have not viewed the disc that hit the floor yet, however.) A must buy classic television purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight Zone DVD Complete set","review":"This was purchsed as a gift and was very well received. The DVDs are being enjoyed by all generations of the family, ie those of us who remember the weekly episodes during the 50s and 60s, the young adults who have seen the rerun episodes on TV, and the young children (10-14 year olds) for whom the stories are not overly frightening. The listings make it easy to find a particular episode. It was a great gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Cool, Totally Twilight","review":"I have only watched a few of the numerous episodes here, but they bring me back to my childhood days as I'd watch, somewhat chilled, the Twilight Zone on TV from time to time. Not as scary as it used to be, but even better now that I can understand it all. The collection is complete and classic. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best view of the best !!!","review":"Pristine video, enriched special features,and menus.This set has all the features of the Definitive Collection and more.Only one documentary is missing about the pilot movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not \\"completely digitally\\" restored...","review":"Everything was great about this box set except that starting in season 2 many episodes are not digitally remastered like the packaging claims. Some of them are like watching old worn out video tapes. They should all be restored with the technology of today. I was disappointed since this is a complete box set and it's an all time classic from the atomic era. Also it is expensive so I assumed it would all be restored and cleaned up so beware. Nobody else has mentioned this in their reviews so maybe I got a bootleg or a bad version. Who knows but I was disappointed. It doesn't have subtitles so that was a surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the best","review":"Well worth the discounted price. I saved over $80.00 by NOT buying at the big box store..... Every episoide from the 60's plus a interesting DVD about Rod Sterling."},{"rating":"2","title":"KEEP THIS IN MIND!!!","review":"Great set, great series...you already know all that. KEEP IN MIND PLEASE: Discs in sets like this have a habit of coming off of the \\"jewel\\" (i.e., the peg part that holds the DVD in the case). You should know this for shipping AND for storage reasons, especially as due to the large number of discs in the set, the manufacturers had to resort to some attenuated packaging and from my experience the discs have a habit of falling off and can get SCRATCHED UP (which you don't want). Think about this when it comes to shipping (although there might not be much you can do about this) and storage, as even in the safety of your own quiet home, the discs could be working their way free due to gravity and other factors and trying to rub their delicate undersides against all sorts of harsh edges inside the DVD cases. My recommendation: Get this set (you must), but then buy a bunch of cheap thin DVD cases (you will need 28) and repackage them so that your preciouses will be safe and sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great product and seller from Amazon.","review":"This set is the best. Picture is great and the extra bonus features are great as well. You will not go wrong with this product and the picture is great also. I have not had any problems as others have claimed in their review. They may need to buy a new DVD player. I have used on my laptop and PS3 with not one problem. The only thing I do not like is that you can not select to play all the shows at once. You have to watch one then select to watch the next. Not a problem just me. lolWorth every cent and cannot beat the price. I received super fast the seller was great and gave all the information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight Zone = A must buy","review":"Yes we all know the TZ blu-rays are finally coming out and I'm sure eventually there will be a massive blu box set that will trump this dvd set. However that is years away. If you go the route of buying the individual seasons that will cost you a fortune either way. For me the best option was this set. It really is amazingly thorough and full of special features and docs. I highly recommend it for any and all TZ fans. This is a very solid and respectable set - especially for the price. The amount of material you get with this purchase is well worth it. I have no complaints. The packaging is solid and the transfers are great. Also, you no longer have to wait around for sci-fi channel to give a marathon or be awake at 2am to catch episodes. Now you can view them whenever you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Apex of American Television?","review":"I bought this because I had vague recollections of having seen this television show a few times in my youth. But I did not see many and was not mature enough to understand the plots or the purpose of the show in general. I have found the writing and acting outstanding for its time (late 1950s/early 1960s). Each show remarkably stands on its own. This program may have been the apex of drama and mystery in the history of American television. I very much enjoy its perspective of ... \\"what if this could happen?\\" I highly recommend these videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to collection","review":"I got this as a present for my dad - he was thrilled!!!

You never again have to say 'I haven't seen that episode in years, I'd love to see it again'. They're all there, just waiting to be watched.

These episodes weren't meant to be seen with such clarity, as now you can spot the seam in the background cylcorama at 18:21 in \\"The Grave\\", or the fact that in \\"Eye of the Beholder\\" the nurse walking into the room at the very beginning is not wearing any 'ugly' makeup, among many other \\"flaws\\" which were not noticeable before the advent of remasters or Hi Res screens... AND we're still expected to pay such a high price for the Blu-Ray version, where they are more evident."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show is amazing, the set is overpriced","review":"If you buy the individual seasons that amazon sells together it's 233, if you buy this set it's 333.

Just to let everyone know :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic math anyone","review":"I started to buy this complete set, then I saw each individual season was $50. 5 x $50 = $250.... So, why would I pay $350 for the bundle, shouldn't I save money with a bundle? I'll be buying these all individually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Submitted for your approval...","review":"This collection is amazing! The casual Twilight Zone fan will appreciate that the full five seasons are here, giving them plenty of episodes to choose from. The true lover of the Twilight Zone will be equally or more impressed with the impressive amount of extras included in the collection. I bought this collection as a gift for myself, and it is the best gift I've ever given to me! I could watch these episodes over and over again, and the bonus features, including a short biography of Rod Serling, offer a brief case in human studies. Through the episodes and the bonus features, we get a glimpse of what the world, its hopes, anxieties, dreams, wishes, fears...were, and a challenge to look at what we've become. How many of the episodes eventually proved to be a foreshadowing of the future? Interesting stuff. Definitely a must have for a Twilight Zone fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection","review":"Looking back at some of these classic episodes definitely brough back some memories.

There is no CLOSED CAPTIONING."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magical place...","review":"I have loved TZ as long as I can remember and deeply enjoy getting lost in this magical place. I believe Rod Serling is simply brilliant and brave for presenting such bold subject matter during that time period. A series that has such depth of thought was rare then and especially would be today. The TZ collection is a creative masterpiece! I highly recommend this set as I waited a long time to buy it and discovered it is worth every penny. As others have noted, the only downfall is that there is not a \\"play all\\" option on each disc. You have to manually set up each episode. A small annoyance compared to the commercial free viewing. I also enjoy Rod's promos for the next episode. Superior DVD set and high quality!

This is a terrible product all the way around. Terrible to manage, operate, and to keep data.Every power glitch (yes have ups) causes RAID failures and drive problems (will not boot) The unit alos locks up which the only way to start again is to cycle power and that is essentially a power glitch corrupting the disks.There is a horrible tftp and flash re-writing procedure to get going (restructure array) and the last time it quit working all together.The unit has a very long response time on the web interface.

Somehow when you use it as a RAID 5, it is only 1.36TB. You would think it would be 1.6 if you lose one drive as a hot spare. I am not an expert in RAIDs, but you can't find information anywhere about size.Second, my unit failed very soon after I got it also. I had the same experience with tech support telling me I might not get my data back. What use is a RAID if they have so little confidence in it? I could have purchased a large hard drive, but I wanted redundancy.Third, it is so SLOW that I can't use it. It is slow to start, slow to restart, slow to access data.I would never purchase anything made by Buffalo ever again. For the money that I spent, I could have easily purchased a small PC and used it as a server, for not much more I could put a RAID in the server or purchase a backup drive. This product was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I bought a $750 paper weight.

At this point in time, the tech said there was nothing else he could do and that I had a big paper weight. That was it. Oh he did mention that I could restore my data by sending it to a data recovery firm. I have purchased many computer related products over the last 15 years and have worked with many more -- I work in the industry -- but I have never been so dissatisfied with a product as I have with this unit.

The tower of tires is unstable (4 subsets of tires stack on each other) and they need to create a notch for them so as not to fall over so easily. Son really not interested in them. The roof opens up revealing a lift for a car which raises up and allows the car to drive down a very steep ramp.The only things that light up are the words \\"casa della tires\\" above the garage door.

I am a retired, overweight male in the 230 pound range so getting on a ladder is not usually something I even think about, but I found myself going up and down this device without any hesitation or fear of falling.

Because of it's aluminum looking body I assumed that it would be lighter than it actually is. While I can carry this ladder around by myself (the 22 foot model), it's definitely heavy and if judging it by appearance, I would say to view this more as a steel object in terms of weight than aluminum.

Not having much of an idea about what I wanted exactly, I decided to consult with my fellow netizens and find the most highly rated ladder on Amazon. Of course, I was led to the Werner MT series. What a pleasant discovery!Absolutely pleased with the design (which I learnt is a direct knock-off of the Little Giant and much, much more affordable). I gave up on the notion of owning a multifunction ladder after finding out that they are now banned in New Zealand due to safety reasons. This step / extension alternative is actually much more innovative in my opinion. It's simple to work out (I highly recommend checking out the Little Giant demonstration videos) and the construction is quite sturdy. The latter gives it the slightly heavier weight that a few other reviewers have pointed out. A great purchase for those like me who are clueless about ladders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the ladder, but","review":"1. No reasonably priced platform for paint can.2.

The locks are very hard and get jammed making it difficult to fold it.It is very solid and sturdy and could be very useful for outdoor use and for construction workers.

The 26ft is a tall and heavy ladder which is difficult to maneuver for me and I am pretty strong. The worst part is that is came to me damaged but I did not unwrap it for a few months, missing the return window. It looks like the carrier dragged it on the side and bent the spring loaded bars that lock the extension in place. It is solid metal but they are pretty bent and I worry about them breaking which would be bad if someone were standing on the ladder. I still use it without the extension but I paid big money for a heavy ladder that is not really that long. I am extremely disappointed in that, especially since I spend quite a bit of money with Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"toolman","review":"Ladder is very easy to use.

It is probably okay for a homeowner, but not for somebody who uses it alot for work as I do, an insurance adjuster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disillusioned","review":"I purchased a 22ft ladder to use in painting a 25ft high ceiling.The ladder actually measures 20ft when fully extended.

The fold out feature is really nice and makes the ladder long enough but still easy to store in my garage.

I am extremely pleased with this ladder as well as the fast delivery time from Amazon. The product arrived in pristine condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful ladder","review":"Have had this ladder for 2 days so far and I am very impressed with it. I have been able to use the standard height and also use the extended height to reach very high places in my home. I felt safe stepping on the high steps. This ladder is very sturdy and heavy duty. Only con would probably be that it is heavy; my wife may not be able to use it as freely as I do. But like I said it is heavy duty and not a problem for me at all. Only gave this four stars because I have not yet straightened it out to get on my roof. Will update later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ladder","review":"Price was great.

I own probably 7 more Werner ladders and was expecting as least that the ladder be safe and sturdy. My main problem is when you separate it and use it as bases fora scaffold board. One side is okay, the other that has no hinges is clearly unstable/unsafe. I called Werner 3 times about this, and was surprised when they seem unconcerned. Finally the last person I spoke to agreedthere may be issues with that side when used in that manner. Then, I was told I could make it sturdy by\\"purchasing\\" 2 \\"dynamic hinges\\" from them at a cost of almost what I paid for the ladder. Isn't that interesting? I guess when only when people are injured, will they take this problem seriously. So the \\"multipurpose\\" ladder really isn't very multipurpose. If you use this ladder in this manner,BE CAREFUL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stable & Versatile Ladder, Minor Gripes","review":"Ladder was what I anticipated since I had checked out the various options at my local home center. Easy set up and comfortably stable to work on. My only gripes are that the stampings for the center hinge still had major burrs. If you get this ladder, get out some emery cloth and de-burr the edges of the part. Also this one was missing a rivet that holds the spring loaded center hinge lock pin together so that the pin and the spring came apart. I fixed it with a machine screw and a lock nut.If you get one of these, inspect it carefully before you use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Werner MT-22 Type 1A 300 Pound Duty Rating Telescoping MultiLadder","review":"Great ladder.

Works great as a simple ladder, plus you can use it as two separate sawhorses, or extend it to climb on the roof of your house (like me!). Extremely sturdy and feels really strong!

I am a contractor that uses this thing on a daily basis. It handles everything perfectly for the height that it allows you to reach. If needed, like doing sheetrock work, painting, etc. it becomes a scaffold. You want one ladder, buy it. You won't be let down. But, understand, 300lb. of sturdy support that you can walk up either side, does weigh a few pounds. But, closed it can be carried through any hall, up in the attic, wherever it needs to go. Great ladder. I also, have an MT-22 for bigger jobs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really 13 feet","review":"The product description is not very clear. I needed a ladder that was 8 feet tall when it is double sided. The product description never says exactly what it is. The 13 feet is when it is single sided and fully extended. But, when folded and double sided, it is not even 6 feet. Now I have to return it and start all over. Plus, it is very heavy and hard to carry around. The first thing the manufacturer has to do is list measurements in all positions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"This ladder is suppose to be the last ladder you buy...A Frame Ladder:Works well as an A frame ladder. It's sturdier than one sided A frame ladder and you have the option of extending the ladder.Extension Ladder:You can't extend the ladder while leaning against a building like a typical extension ladder. You must lay it out on your lawn and then lift it up. This is a close to impossible if your by your self. Rather cumbersome.Scaffold:I wouldn't trust these joints. These joints just slide in and are not secured.After buying this ladder, I bought an real extension ladder. To make a scaffold, I use this ladder and another A frame ladder. I would consider this 3 in 1 ladder a 1.5 ladder. It an extendable A frame ladder at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack of all Master of one","review":"However clever this ladder is, it is not. For example as an extension ladder it performs poorly. It's major flaw is you can not raise it like an extension ladder. There is no rope to pull it up, so you have to lay it down and extend it then raise it back up. By the way, 50 pounds is not much when compacted, but at 17 feet it weighs much more. The best use of this ladder is for replacing the lamp in the stairwell. As a step ladder it works, but the steps are only 2 inches deep as compared to a regular step ladder where the steps are 3 inches deep. This is much easier on your feet. The bottom line is: Buy this ladder if you need to replace lamps in stairwells or you have small storage, it does store quite small.BTW: I am selling my ladder for cheep at the local garage sale ;-)Tim"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Heavy!","review":"I am surprised that this ladder has such good reviews. It is a very stable ladder that makes you feel safe when you climb it, but the weight of the ladder makes it difficult to maneuver. I think it would be extremely difficult for most elderly or women to use this ladder. I can barely stand to carry it myself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Value Purchase","review":"I have two Werner ladders and was not disappointed in this purchase. Werner is not proud of \\"Made in China\\" as they are in \\"Made in the USA\\" on the other ladders. The problem I am seeing with Made in China is that it is usually very good quality, as is this ladder, and at a price (Amazon's), an occasional use user such as I, cannot ignore. Although I have also found that the portability was a positive for a recent project at our childrens home. I also note that it is heavy but expected it to be for the height and weight capacity. I bought two platforms that fit this ladder and very pleased that I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly built ladder - and cheaper at Home Depot","review":"This was bought through Amazon as gift for me. It arrived as expected and in \\"perfect\\" condition. Unfortunately, the very first day I used it on a roofing project, one of the rivets that connects one of the stabilizing cross-arms snapped off for no reason. I stopped using it immediately and went back to my old extension ladder. I will return it for a replacement and see if the second one is of better quality/craftsmanship. (BTW... you can buy this at Home Depot for $159.00, but you will have to pay the tax and transport the ladder back home - it's REALLY heavy.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Air Conditioning Saleman's Dream Ladder","review":"I too purchased this ladder at Costco for just under $100. I am in commercial air conditioning sales that requires a ladder from time to time to get on to roofs (extension ladder) as well as into ceilings (step ladder). One small problem with having conventional ladders; I drive a '99 Buick LaSabre. This ladder is perfect! It just fits across my back seat and provides me with the versatility of having all of these easily adjustable ladders in one conveniant package. In fact today I used it in both the 7 foot step ladder as well as the fully extension mode at the same site. It is very well made and easy to adjust. This ladder is perfect me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super ladder but HEAVY","review":"This ladder is really fantastic with all of the different positions you can adjust the ladder to. There are latches that allow you to adjust the length of each side of the ladder independently. These latches work smoothly and are set up to allow you to release one side and automatically latch at the next stop. This system makes the cumbersome weight of the ladder more manageable. The ladder also comes with a set of hinges that can be used with the extensions to create a second step ladder or, with the use of a board to span between them, a scaffold. One point I should make is that the advertised length includes the reaching distance of an average person standing on the highest recommended step. If you really need a ladder that is 26 feet long then this ladder will be too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal","review":"This ladder is an upgrade from a 13 foot.

The great part is that is collapses and takes up very little room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ladder","review":"What an incredible Deal of the day!Ladder works great. Remember this is a 22 foot extension ladder so it is fairly heavy. It is intuitive and easy to operate, however because it is fairly large and heavy it took a little thinking of how to open/close, and extend/retract; that is to say where to stand and how to hold the ladder to make it quick and easy to operate it.The only thing that seemed a little odd is how you connect the two removable extension pieces to make the second small ladder/scaffold. These two extension pieces are hooked together with the extension locks. This works just fine, I guess I was just expecting something more complicated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with this ladder!","review":"I bought this Werner 22' telescoping ladder on a Lightning Deal recently. I was a bit afraid of its weight -- other people had commented that it's just too heavy to move around. However, I'm a 57-year-old couch potato woman, and I had no problem schlepping this ladder around. Set-up is a breeze. I did take a couple of minutes to see how to extend the ladder parts and lock them safely - that was 120 seconds well spent. I feel very stable and secure when I'm on the ladder. I plan on ditching my others and just keeping this one around. It also takes up very little space in the garage.

It is so versatile, and the construction is very durable. It's easy to use, extend, and very stable. It is so stable it can be folded together (with no leg spacing) and can stand up on a flat surface without tipping over.One word of caution is that when you extend it to it's longest height as a \\"lean-to\\" ladder, it is difficult to manage given it's height and weight. May require a second person to help carry it, if you're not strong enough.I would definitely buy this ladder again."},{"rating":"2","title":"durable, versatile, but heavy and a little tricky to manipulate","review":"First, let me say I do love the ladder. There are so many variations and accessories, the possibilities are seemingly endless. However, my wife has a hard time manipulating it or even moving it.

It takes the place of several ladders and fits in the back of my truck. It is great on hills or stairs because you can have the sides two different lengths. Also it is longer than a 24 FT esxtension ladder when fully extended. When it is fully extended, you need two people, or the way I do it is lay it on the ground, put one side against the bottom of the house and then start walking it up. When you get it up, you can then move it around to where you need. It is heavy, but not as heavy as a 24 FT fiberglass ladder. I have used this by myself and have had no difficulty moving it around. It feels very sturdy no matter what position I have it in. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Werner MT-22 Type 1A","review":"I saw the Little Giant TV ad and was impressed except for the price. When Amazon put the Werner MT-22 on sale, I ordered it immediately. The multi functions do keep you from having to buy several different ladders.

I would give it 5 stars if it weren't a copy of something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"No work platform?","review":"From all the reviews I have read here this ladder looks like the one for me. One thing I have not seen in the reviews is the work platform that comes with the Werner MT17 offered from Q.V.C. for $172.68 + $23.72 S&H.; I would think a work platform would cost about $40.00 if purchased as an accessory which Amazon does not offer. And the reviews form the people purchasing this ladder from Costco did not mention anything about a work platforn included. So this ladder from Amazon is not a great buy if you have to lay out extra money for a work platform, which I need. Totals > From Q.V.C. with work platform > $172.68 + $23.72s&h; + N.Y. tax= $214.64. From Amazon > without work platform $173.35 + $25.00s&h; + $0 tax= $198.35 -$25.00 Cash back until 9/30/06 = $173.35 + $40.00 work platform =$213.35.Less than one dollar difference!

I do suggest getting theWerner AC19-2 Extension Ladder Coversto protect your walls.As other reviewers have mentioned, this ladder is heavy. It is 300-pound rated and uses a heavy-grade aluminum. One man can carry it, but you're not going to sling it over your shoulder like a 6' consumer grade model. I'm a short-to-average guy, medium-build and I can handle it just fine. The weight is most noticeable as an extension ladder, as you have 25 pounds or so above center. Fully extended, this ladder could get away from you if you're not prepared. If you're planning to use it as a full-extension, work in a clear area, set the extension while on the ground and then raise. If needed, have a helper around.Great ladder. Would absolutely buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really neat ladder","review":"Had a friend with one come over to show me how to operate the ladder.

Have only had one opportunity to use this ladder so far, but it works well. One limitation, it would be nice to have one additional lock-point to use the step-ladder configuration in tighter spaces. It only locks when opening out the legs to about a 5' spread which requires significant floor space. On the positive side, it's about 47 lbs which is managable.

I can adjust it without help and was confident up high in the stair well.It can be taken apart and used as props for scaffolding or as two step ladders.

At 26' with strong gusting winds I felt secure on the ladder.The only drawback is that it is very heavy, and unlike a normal extension ladder it is very difficult to futher extended the ladder in the upright position. Two people work best when you need to fully extended it. Otherwise you will have to lay the ladder on the ground fully extended, then lift the ladder to the house.All in all a great buy.

It is a sturdily constructed ladder and one feel safe using it. Not bad looking either. Werner deserves 5 stars for the price and quality combination. The other nat'l brand costs twice as much. The only negative about it is when it is fully extended as a straight ladder in the upright position it becomes quite awkward to maneuver by one person, and could be dangerous. That is because the center of gravity is so high and it is not a light weight ladder.

I didn't pay enough attention to the weight and the problems involved with extending it. There has been one task for which I was glad I bought it: installing a new light fixture over the stairs and painting the walls on those stairs. It's positionable and very sturdy and stable. I spent a week or so up on the ladder and it wasn't going to budge. As a stepladder, I don't need it; I have one. As an everyday extension ladder, I find it extremely difficult to use. The problem is extending it. It's very heavy, top-heavy when extended, and almost impossible for me to manage. (I'm 5'4\\" and 120 lbs., for reference.)

It's all done very badly and with no action or suspense whatsoever. The script is stretched tight to make a full movie out of a twenty minute plot. The Mole People is not a well made movie, but can be fun to watch nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun for the whole family","review":"If you are a leave it to beaver fan, its is amazing seeing hugh beaumont in another role and you keep waiting for him to call wally or the beaver and it just doesnt happen. In one of the beaver episodes ward cleaver talks about the old sci fi horror films being good fun a direct plug for his movie which is kind of cool to see the movie. aside from beaver fans, you normal sci fi fans will love this well plotted out adventure and journey below the earth. This is much better then the stupid garbage put out by hollywood today and you can sit and enjoy it with your whole family and it actually has a couple scary moments when you ignore the silly rubber glove and masks wore by the mole people. this is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and boring - some sad inconsistencies in plot.","review":"Its a standard scifi storyline of a lost civilisation being stumbled on by our heroes. A very long and tedious introduction by a uni professor expounds theories of underground dwelling. In fact the whole movie is padded with many long episodes of no intrinsic value. Plenty of ridiculous scientific explanations by John Agar. The 150 ruling beings couldn't possibly survive in their environment. And the Mole people seem to be completely subservient but probably outnumber their rulers. Of course there is a love interest with beautiful maidens.

Filled with ryhming sentences, the text seems to roll of off your tongue. Young children will enjoy hearing about the noise and ruckus the farm animals create when they realize they have not been fed. This misfortune creates the mood for The Grumpy Morning. After travelling through the farm with each animal, the author takes you into the farmers bedroom, who seems to have slept through her morning ritual of feeding her animals. As she is awoke by the noise of the grumpy animals, she emerges with a smile on her face and proceeds to feed and love her animals.The story is told from the point of view of a barn owl, who cannot go to sleep because of all of the noise that morning. The final page of the book shows the owl in his nestm finally ready to go to sleep, now that his friends are fed, happy, and most importantly quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Games I Have Ever Seen","review":"I bought the first Nicktoons Racing game in December last year. I figured that this one would be the same style, just with different characters. Only when I started the game, I found out I was very wrong. The music sounded very cheap, the graphics were also horrible, and the game is living proof that the budget was very small. There are only four places you can go to: Bikini Bottom, Retroville, Amity Park, and Dimmsdale. There are only eight characters, too, and until you win in a world with the character from there, there are four people you can race with. I only had to \\"play\\" the game for five minutes to decide if it was a piece of junk. I now regret ever thinking about getting this game in the first place.

Over three years, the chef's knife has gotten noticeably less sharp (My mother-in-law does not have a knife sharpener/honing bar), but is still quite functional. The knife is pretty well balanced and comfortable.And, that's good, because while you get this because it's interesting and funny, for the money you spend, you'd want it to be useful for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous & Funky","review":"I've been wanting this set for a long time, but turned off by the high price elsewhere.

I've been using them regularly for a couple months now, and the edges have held. Not bad for $70.But that's not why you should buy this product. There's something deeply satisfying about stabbing a miniature man in the face with a paring knife.

And some content from interior pages.However, Taschen has badly cropped most of the cover images. Many of the images have ~30% of the image area missing. It's been cut off!.

Some of the names of the magazines were memorable - Eyeful, Beauty Parade, Whisper, Wink and my favorite one Titter.

I understand that there's a lot of nostalgy involved and I can understand that people who lived in those times (50's and 60's) may find something pleasant on it, probably more for the atmosphere the book can evoke in their memories than for the quality of its contents. But if you're looking for good paintings and good motives for your own paintings as it was my case, forget it. At least it wasn't expensive; and surprisingly, the Elvgren's book I mentioned before costs exactly the same at Amazon, for real good american pin up ART, instead of bad taste.1000 Pin-Up Girls (25th Anniversary Special Edtn)1000 Pin-Up Girls (25th Anniversary Special Edtn) [Paperback]"},{"rating":"2","title":"1000 pinups","review":"I recently ordered this pinup book and was pretty happy when it came in.

It teaches them to divide a bigger task into smaller ones. Third, the carrying case is fun and each like carry it around.The pieces are large the cardboard is thick. Some pieces are damaged but that is because it is used so much, almost everyday for the past few months.There are other puzzles by the same folks.

It was way too much information to take in during a single sitting. I will be watching it many more times. Lefty gives out the wisdom that he has gathered over many many years of fishing. It reminds me of talking with my grandfather about fishing. In my experience, most fly fishers make the sport much much more complicated and expensive than necessary. Lefty makes everything simple and is very specific about what works and what doesn't. He even has a section on flies for various kinds of fishing (trout, bass, salt water, bonefish). This section gives roughly 5 flies to use for each kind of fish. In the long run, I'm sure that this section alone will save me money and help me catch more fish. The only thing I was disappointed about was that pike and muskie were not covered in the fly selection section (especially since there is a nice big pike on the video's cover)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent final album by the group!","review":"I liked Gladys Knight and the Pips' very last album as a group.

Strong songs like Love Overboard, the dramatic title song, Say What You Mean, You, Lovin on Next To Nothin, and others. While this won't match their Midnight Train to Georgia era of hits from the'70s, this was a fabulous swan song for the group.

My So-Called Life also portrayed how difficult it is for parents let go of their child so that they can make their own choices, however misguided they may seem. Now at 32, I can still watch the school rouge, Jordan Catalano, and feel that rush of inappropriate, inexplicable, high school crush-love for the wrong boy and it is so addictivly delicious.

I watched this series back in 1995 when I aired on MTV, and this DVD set is a keeper I will share with my kids when they reach their teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty decent show with just a bit of annoyance","review":"This was a pretty good show about the emotional conflicts experienced by a group of teenagers and their family members in the 1990s. The cast is great at conveying the confusion and angst of high schoolers, their parents' consternation, and the younger sister's forebearance.Two quibbles: it is very irritating to hear the word \\"like\\" used in almost every sentence; nobody could have worn that much ugly plaid clothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"bringin back memories","review":"I got this for my fiance and she loved it....she remembered it from back in the day and wanted to watch the whole series...it is a great deal and is well worth it for yourself and younger generations to be turned on too..."},{"rating":"2","title":"everyone's so called life","review":"This shortlived series is as relevent today as it was 15 years ago. I have been watching it with my 15 year old daughter and it is amazing how much she can relate to the characters. I, too, at age 48 can totally relate to the issues of High School, who to be friends with, how to be who you are and who you want to be, parents, kids, spouse, life...I loved this series when it first came out - and still love it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Related to my era - growing up in '60s","review":"Very emotional for me. Great! I had a love in the '60s who wasn't very available -- I could definitely relate. Forty plus years later I still dream about him and it's still very emotional to see him at reunions. We just had our 40th reunion. I still cry after seeing him. Re: My So Called Life: I love the whole story line; it takes me back some yet I now realize that it's still the same in many ways for many young people. I really feel for young people today for I think life is really rough for a lot of you. Please love and respect yourselves and others. Let's all be on the same team. It's so difficult for 2 people to get along sometimes no wonder there's war. I pray for this to change. God Bless."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing show that will live on...","review":"I've just recently watched this series, my mother has talked about how much she loves it and when I saw it on DVD, I decided to try it out. And Wow! My So-Called Life is an amazing show! A show that will everyone will enjoy and one I'll be happy to let my daughters watch when they're older. It's a real look at the life of being a teenager and reminded me so much of myself at that age, as I'm sure it will remind everyone else who watches it of themselves at that age and what it's like to be a teenager trying to fit in in high school. I recommend this show to everyone! It's definitely a must-see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My \\"so-called\\" Review","review":"Great show, great actors, great writers, great issues.This show was cancelled after one season (Why?!) It was not another Saved by the Bell, or Beverly Hills 90210. It had REAL people with REAL issues. It contained teenage and adult problems, humor, and triumphs. It was the first look at REAL life, with no apologies. I think it was too much for people at the time. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this again. The extra features were informative, funny and worth the time I spent watching them.I recommend this to any who caught an episode years ago and enjoyed it and to any who want a new perspective on family and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time, losers.","review":"I love this show. It's far from perfect, but it hits many of the notes with such resonance -- it's a diamond in the rough. I'll compare it with 'Once and Again' by saying that it's in many ways a dress rehearsal for the later series. 'MSCL', though, has a certain rawness that I find both endearing and entirely unique among television dramas. The Claire Danes performance was truly lightning in a bottle, and the parents were the perfect blend of best intentions and utter cluelessness. I found myself toggling constantly between nodding sympathy and wanting to slap them silly; it's extremely difficult to strike that balance in writing and acting a character.So it's here; it's great. Why? Maybe \\"they\\" saw units from the original printing selling online for $300 and realized they could make money on it. If corporate greed can get me what I want, maybe I can look the other way once in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of it's Kind","review":"This is one of those rare genius', smart TV Shows out there. I just recently discovered 'My So-Called Life' last year while flicking through cable and saw A.J Langer as Rayanne, who is one of my all time favourite actors. I then saw Clare Danes come onto the screen (who I'v always liked), and then I saw Jared Leto, while the time I was thinking ''What is this show'', I couldn't help but notice and be impressed by the humour of it and the true honesty of it. Watching Clare Danes as Angela Chase and her questioning of things and the humour of Rayanne, I really felt that I had stumbled onto something special and unique. Now I'm really femiliar with the show and a definite fan, I have yet to buy this on DVD but I can't wait to be the proud owner of this fine, witty, wonderful show."},{"rating":"1","title":"my so called life complete serier","review":"Not happy dont ever buy dvd's out of the country.i dont know about you but i have never heard of not being able to play the dvd's unless you have a dvd player with region 2. i didnt even know what that ment."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I can't describe how amazing this series is! I remember watching it non stop in middle schcool! But now I get to really appreciate it even more, because this show was WAY ahead of it's time and it dealt with many real issues that teens go through.... then, now, and in the future! It's so cleverly done! I HATE the fact that it never came back for a second season, but in a way it's good because it never went downhill like The OC. I say and PLEA that this series continues as a book series! Winnie Holzman PLEASE WRITE IT!!!! I beg of you, because... you see Tino knows this guy who knows this guy that can totally help publish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series. Too bad they cancelled it.","review":"It's a shame great, relatable, quality series like Freaks and Geeks or My So-Called Life have to be cut short. These are real people in the real world with problems we all face while young, unlike shows like Gossip Girl or the likes. Don't get me wrong, I like those shows, but they can never actually impact a persons life, for those character are pretty much unreal.My So-Called life is a personal favorite, and I recommend it to everyone. Despite being almost a decade since its cancellation, it's still current and relevant. Shows you the things we have to deal with in high school, without pushing agendas or trying to sugar-coat them in any way.Definitely one of the best teen dramas ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good series but questionable picture quality","review":"I used to love MSCL so I am glad to have it on DVD, however the picture quality is on the grainy side and it does not look very good on my 42 inch HDTV."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOTLEG!!

Unless you taped the episodes when they aired originally, this is likely the only way to see the show. And it is certainly a show worth watching. At 18, I was too young to see the show the first time around, but I have loved watching it now.The 19 episodes of the show were all new to me. Yet even years later, I can relate to the characters of the show. The show is admittedly a teenage drama, yet it is entertaining and at times thought provoking. The stories are interesting and amusing, I highly recommend people check it out. To this end, this set is a better idea for purchase than the previously released My So-Called Life DVD that contained solely the first three episodes because the show is too good to stop at just three episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"read this!","review":"i was an avid fan of this show from the moment it came out on tv. I was so sad whenever my mother informed me that it would be taken off the air... i was about 13 when i began watching the show and my mother always watched it with me. we both enjoyed it very much. although i was not in high school at the time, i did identify with a lot of the things that the characters went through, especially Angela, because she was really shy and had a hard time speaking up sometimes. i am so glad that this show is going to be released onto dvd.1 i just cant wait ..this is so exciting!

When it arrived I was displeased to realize that this is more of a booklet than a book. True it is full of activity ideas, but half of them require you to go out and buy something (A CD, a puppet, a book). The pages are thick and glossy with full color reproduction of 'entertaining' drawings. This means the creators of the book paid a lot to produce it and pass the price tag off to teachers and schools. The final blow was that the book contained only activities, no theory at all. There were no explainations of WHY a particular activity was worthwhile or WHAT it aimed to teach.

Like one of the other reviewers said, Vicente Fernandez can be compared to Frank Sinatra in both his mastery and popularity in his chosen form of music. But even Frank did'nt have pipes like these! \\"El Rey\\" is in a class of his own.Some of the best tunes here include the beautiful \\"Lastima Que Seas Ajena\\" and the powerfully mournful \\"Que De Raro Tiene\\". Still, the tops on this CD and one of his best ever is the heart-wrenching \\"Mi Viejo\\". It would take a rather heartless soul to not be moved by this song. It's that good.As good as this collection is, I give it four stars only because overall, I like the song selection on \\"Historia, Vol. 2\\" a little better. This is, however, just my personal taste and most Chente fans will be very happy with either one of these discs. In fact, these two CD's would give a new Chente fan an excellent introduction to his music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used item...","review":"I think the price was high considering this item was a used item.

It's not that it is not well made, it is not that it lacks production values or some appealing performances, but the story is so bleak and the ending so awful that it just left me feeling really disappointed. Every stereotype of the ephemerality of gay relationships is on display here and as such it seems to represent a step back to when the appearance of positive gay relationships in movies was a rarity. I'm not suggesting that there is something wrong in representing the negative side of some gay relationships, but potential buyers and reviewers should be aware that this is not only not a positive view of gay love but an essentially jaundiced and negative one.

But the script is atrocious and the characters get more annoying and ridiculous with every passing minute once the hating starts. I'm sure the transexual brother/sister is everyone's pick for the most controversial character. Personally, I hated he/she and thought his/her blatant relationship sabotage was too over the top.

I never liked the C64 and made fun of my friends who had one for the long loading times :) While not being a C64 fan, I am a big fan of the entire retro scene from the 1980s and this book really hit the spot for me - so much so that I could barely put it down.The entire sordid history of Commodore is covered here with no punches pulled. There's tons and tons of great material, written in a highly-entertaining format.My only complaints would be: perhaps giving a little too much credit to Commodore and too little to Apple but that's probably to be expected and perhaps not even incorrect; the other complaint would be a severe lack of photographs. This book cries out for a big section of color photos somewhere of all the key people and all the computers. Alas, all we get are poor black & white photos at the start of each chapter. BOOO.Bottom Line: A must-read for any Commodore or retro computer fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"After a slow start, this book becomes a must read and hard to put down.This book makes a fantastic case study in running a business, and I do not mean in a positive way -- I am sorry that it does not include an index for future reference. The stories of developing the VIC-20, Commondore 64 and 128, and the Amiga are fun to read. The author also presents great portraits of the key engineers and executives involved. The author also writes a history of the home computer that is NOT the classic Apple-cult example. He makes many references that are less than complimentary of Apple and Woz in particular. This book is a great counter-balance to the revisionist history put to the public by Apple's PR machine. The story of Commodore is the story of how one company got lucky, capitalized on it and then lost its way. Fascinating dynamics."},{"rating":"2","title":"38911 Bytes free","review":"A must read for any Commodore fan or anyone that wants to learn more about the early days of personal computing. If you think Apple or IBM invented the PC, you need to read this book.As a C-64 and C-128 owner 'back in the day', I was looking forward to this title. There is precious little information in print about the internals of Commodore and the real story behind the company. I was not disappointed. Bagnall's book is clearly well researched, and manages to present some of the difficult situations and conflicts without overly taking sides. There is plenty of trivia about the machines themselves and the chips inside, but the real story here is the people that designed them. My only real criticism is that the book is a bit dry in sections - it's primarily a history and could have benefited from some more narrative. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow - what a trip down memory lane!!!","review":"I got my start in the Personal Computer industry back when the Commodore VIC-20 was new and I had two of them.

Now if only there was another one like it covering Radio Shack, all would be well! It's truly stunning the way the paths of Amiga, Apple, Atari, Commodore, IBM, Digital Research, Microsoft, MOS Technology, Motorola and yes, Radio Shack, intertwined in this rich stew of opportunism, arrogance, incompetence and employee stealing. Go ahead, read this one along with Andy Hertzfeld's \\"Revolution in The Valley\\" and reflect for a moment on the amount of revisionist mythmaking machinery that has grown up around the House that Cringely Built. Unlike many other books, Bagnall doesn't skimp on the technical details here either - the story of MOS Technology and the 6502 is almost deserving of its own book!-Dallas Hodgson, Deluxe Paint (AGA series) co-developer"},{"rating":"1","title":"The gospel according to ada","review":"I am trying to do some quick refresher reading on ada for a job interview and this book has been sitting around unread since i went on an ada course 5 or so years ago.

Its riddled with profound opinions on the philosophy behind the language and i skipped the first 4 chapters as irrelevant rubbish but still have the rest padded out excessively with this stuff instead of getting down to the actual language.

Every day I drove the car, I had to add fluid because the fluid in the power steering reservoir had dropped below the minimum level. There was no leaks where the hoses connected to the pump. There was no leaks on the power steering rack. I found fluid on the bottom of the pump. After I cleaned the fluid off the bottom of the pump and drove the car again, there was fresh fluid on the bottom of the pump. After I removed the pump to return it to the supplier, I noticed one of the bolts was never installed on the pump because there was paint in the bolt hole. I have requested a replacement.

Duncan Browne's stunningly gorgeous debut album is a perfect case in point. A reminder of a time when naive idealism & an almost pre-Raphaelite devotion to beauty was in vogue, this is one of most quietly stunning & moving albums I've ever heard ... only 35 years late! Previous reviewers will give you all the details you need to know. I can only agree with them & offer yet one more enthusiastic recommendation. These are songs of unashamed melancholy, longing, regret, desire, and transcendence, sung without a trace of irony or distance. Did people ever really feel this openly vulnerable? They did & still do, even if it's more frowned upon today. Do yourself a favor & immerse your soul in the dreamlike, haunting world of this album. You'll return again & again!

This their debut sparked the friction which gave birth to 'This Is The World'. However this album has gems that I would put up against any other pop band ever (No Doubt, What's Wrong With Dreaming & Home and Dry). Later versions of this album came packaged with a cover of Califonia Dreamin', an attempt by the record company to promote the band to a wider audience. They needn't have bothered; Siobaghn Mahers' silky vocals layered magically over Tim Speeds' fantastic arpeggios creates a lush pop heaven.If you like this then buy This Is The World and one of the singles from Say Something Good, When I was Young; it has the best B-side ever recorded in History. If you like pop, PROPER POP, not some child star dancing around but pure souls who can sing and write then BUY THIS ALBUM.

She hooked me on tea, English style, with these wonderful crystals. The flavor is just slighly different because of the process - it's not exactly natural sugar and it's not exactly brown sugar. They don't dissolve immediately - so you have a slightly sweet flavor at the top and it gets progressively sweeter as you drink down. You can stir and stir and get it dissolved, too but I prefer the other method. More recently I began drinking it with peppermint herbal tea because the PG Tips was keeping me awake at night and it's just as delicious in that tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"great humor from another time","review":"These selections take me back to Saturdays after the cartoons were over when I was a kid in the late 70's and early 80's.

You don't need this DVD to do that sort of activity - just hold your baby and move side by side with the music.

I looked forward to reading it each night, and found it very interesting as well as relaxing. I enjoyed learning things about thoroughbred horse racing, and the people who put their hearts and souls into training the horses. I also liked the characters who were developed by the author - they all seemed genuine, yet flawed (as all us human beings are!)The storyline flowed along nicely, and was able to hold my interest page after page. Overall, this novel was a very pleasant and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"It is not often that I don't finish a novel but I couldn't finish this one. It is very long and boring. The happenings at the racetrack are interesting but quite one dimensional. There are subplots thrown in willy nilly, such as the drug overdose of a jockey. The romance is very shallow and almost abusive. I assume there is some kind of background intrigue happening about the main characters family but sadly the book did not hold my interest enough to care what that intrigue entails. Too bad. I hoped to enjoy another author who writes fiction about racetrack life after devouring Bev Pettersens books. Seems I better keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favoried To Win","review":"I was very anxious to read FAVORED TO WIN after meeting MaryAnn Myers at a book signing in Parkersburg, WV. Not being familiar with horses, I might have been reluctant to purchase the book had I not met Ms. Myers. She is as personable as the characters she creates in this book. Not only did I learn about horses and what goes on behind the scenes, but the book was about believable characters with very exciting, interesting storylines. If you are a horse lover or just love a \\"great read\\", you'll love this book! Am adding MaryAnn Myers to my list of favorite authors. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favored to please everyone","review":"Bravo! Another book that you just can't put down. Situations that will make you laugh, touching moments that bring a tear to your eye and an education on the behind the scenes of thoroughbred horse racing tossed in. An intriguing tale of a young woman that finds a new way in life quite different than that of her upbringing or mysterious past. The cast of characters leading you through the world of racing are all quite believable. In fact, I began to imagine what actors would play what roles if this was a movie - I think Wilford Brimley would make a great \\"Ben\\" - the gentle trainer and guiding mentor throughout the story.

The moves were a little hard to follow at first, I had to do the wourkout 2-3 times before getting it down. It's worth it. The routine is a lot of fun.I disagree with another reviewer that said that Keli does not cue well. I think she does a great job. Watch her hands. She will hold one up, to the side... when she wants you to lead with that foot. You won't hear her say right foot or left, which is great because when you work out at home, you are a mirror image of what's on the screen. Your right is their left. In the advanced portion she says \\"back foot\\" and \\"front foot\\" which works out well because the step is perpendicular to the t.v.The abs routine that is in this video is amazing. You can not get an better ab workout in this amount of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"great basic step workout--hard to find any like this","review":"In recent years, I've noticed that step video producers have tried to figure out the most impossible routines for steppers.

I wish more videos were still designed in this way today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You're kidding, right?","review":"She doesn't do the same movement twice! I didn't get a chance to get a decent workout because I couldn't figure out which direction she was going next -- her instruction on her steps was non existent. It will work well under a table leg to help balance an uneven table and that is about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"I consider myself to be a fairly advanced step aerobic fan and bought this tape b/c of the other reviewers' positive comments. I was dissapointed.I found Ms. Roberts cueing to be fairly inept and she uses her own idiosyncratic naming of fairly common step sequences which add to the difficulty of following along. In addition, it seemed the choreography to be repetitious and dull.However, you will get a good workout aerobically and I thought the stomach routine to be one of the best, with good instruction in proper technique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"She uses a lot of upper body along with low impact stepping for a great total body workout. The moves take a little getting used to, but they aren't boring, even after repeated use. The abdominals are also very good, followed by a relaxing close. The best all-around step woekout I've seen on tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout for all levels.","review":"This tape is guaranteed to get your heart rate up. I started feeling weak kneed, but I'm in great shape now and still enjoy working out with it. You gradually increase the intensity with three levels, a cool down and then an ab segment. Keli is easy to follow and the workout leaves you feeling like it was time well spent! I'm ready to try her circuit training next. Does anyone know if she has one on kick-boxing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pay No Attention to Bad Reviews - This Workout is Incredible","review":"Ok, so if you do this workout so often that your body gets used to it and it doesn't challenge you anymore, fine. That will happen to all great workouts. But, this workout is fantastic and geared to Intermediate steppers and maybe Advanced steppers too, if your platform is on high. It is interesting and the choreography is great and she DOES give good instruction. If she doesn't say LEFT or RIGHT foot (Like one reviewer said), then it's not the end of the world because you just mirror everything they do. It gets you huffing and puffing and suddenly when you're done, you can pat yourself on the back for getting through a great workout and doing good work. The other aspect of the tape I loved was that her co-exercisers, don't yell out and ruin it all. They keep quiet and smile and seem to enjoy it as much as I know you will. Stick to it for minimum of three times a week and about five to six times a week and the WEIGHT WILL MELT OFF YOU!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating Video","review":"I have been involved with step aerobics for many years both in live classes and using videos. This particular video was the most frustrating video I have ever tried to step through. I even put this tape away and then brought it out later to give it another try. It was a waste of my time. She doesn't cue very well and she is hard to understand. By the time you think you might be getting it, she changes the move without cueing first. If you want a good video, use Kathy Smith's step aerobics. All of her step videos are great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout- a little confusing leg moves","review":"Great workout with interesting moves. Keli Robert's six packs inspire you and she's an energetic woman, which pumps you up.There is one section of the video which requires you to move the opposite leg than in the video in order to do it properly and it may be confusing for beginners/ 2 left-foots. I was surprised that Keli Roberts wouldn't point that out in the video.Ab section is a killer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this tape!!!","review":"This is one of the best step tapes I own. It is a great workout and really gets your heart pumping. Combo's are easy to follow. She goes through about 10 different combo's so it never gets boring! I do step aerobics in my house 5-6 nights a week and this is deninately one of the best out there! I highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best for a beginner - Transitions are rough","review":"While the workout helps you break a sweat, you have to overcome some challenges with the instructor. The transitions are not smooth and as a seasoned stepper, I would have expected a higher caliber lead. As someone else mentioned, Kelli refers to some of the moves using non-standard terms. While different terms are acceptable, the instructions and demonstrations were a bit challenging to grasp simultaneously. I had to stop the workout several times to grasp the movement and count. At this point, I've got the routine down and I like the progressive intensity. I would not recommend this tape to a beginner. I recommend the Reebock Step Workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"SANFRANSICKO","review":"Rarely has a movie about a serial killer been so dull and lifeless, and so horribly written and acted. SANFRANPSYCHO showcases the absurd murders of a religious fanatic who is killing people to cleanse them.

Joe Estevez continues to demonstrate he didn't get any acting lessons from brother Martin Sheen---he is awful as the police detective assigned to the crime.

Honestly, I had heard these things break off and so was extremely careful in loading and unloading the batteries. But after maybe six battery change overs, I now have 3 broken tabs.CANON FOLKS!!!

The only time I missed shots because the flash didn't go off was when I didn't have the CPE3 plugged in. One 6 magainze pack lasted me all day for well over 500 flash shots. I bought an extra magazine with rechargable batters simply because I don't like to stress over things like not having enough juice.1 less star because the CPE3 and extra magazine are overpriced.

None of the four I ordered retracted consistently, or at all, even from the get go. Reviews I read before purchasing were mixed, with good outweighing bad, so I took one person's advice and ordered two--you can always find a use for a second lock! When the two arrived, one didn't work, so it went back for an exchange. Ditto the exchange. Ditto the exchange. One of the two originals worked twice, and then it too, seized on retraction. I will now pay twice the price and hope a different brand works better. I think the design is flawed: The cable is too thick for the retracting mechanism. I'd hoped the company's usually good products would come through, but not this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor construction","review":"The lock arrived with a piece rattling inside that looked to be broken off the locking mechanism. The receiving insert would not accept the end of the cable and hold it. However, even if the lock had worked, it would be too easy to break. The case is just plastic. If you need security, this lock doesn't provide it. If you just need to deter little fingers, a baby lock is a cheaper and more effective solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for cycling day trips","review":"Great lock for bike club rides. It weighs less than my cell phone. Any tool in the hardware store will disable it; it will stop thieves that only have their hands to work with.

A great concept, but the implementation is very poor. Avoid this lock."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AND WHY","review":"At the advice of the NY times review I purchased two of these locks. One didn't work, so I returned it, and got another that didn't work, and for exactly the same reason: the PROBLEM is that the \\"release\\" button -- the larger button on the right hand side of the image -- is a tiny, fragile plastic lever arm that holds the retraction spool in place with a hook measuring at most 3 mm. On one of the two locks, it arrived already broken, and on the second, snapped immediately. The result is that the cable does not retract, just flops around. You have to hand-thread it back in, with the spool wheel jamming on the broken fragments from the lever arm which are bouncing around inside the lock. This is an example of extremely poor design, with the key moving element, the one subject to the most stress and use, made of cheap, flimsy material. Master products are usually excellent, but this is a deeply disappointing bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This","review":"This lock never worked right out of the package and I returned it. The part in the body of the lock could not engage the end of the cable due to faulty assembly. It also feels pretty cheap and fragile, like you could smash it to break it, and the cable is thin and could easily be cut.

Needless to say, recovery was impossible because Norton only starts up in OS 9 from the CD, and will not install the product in OS 10.2 unless it is going to the primary drive. So I installed it anyway, knowing my files were gone if I did, and must say that even Disk Doctor is a complete waste as it takes 8 hours to scan my hard drive, then tells me I have a bad disk sector- the only way I can fix it of course is to start up by CD (which is only OS 9), and run Disk Doctor again.

The music overpowers his awesome voice at times. At the concert in Cleveland, when he spoke between songs, the audience had to be quiet to hear what he was saying and that was still a challenge. With a voice like Engelbert's even at his age, he can still sing a beautiful song and doesn't need it hidden behind massive drums or arrangements.

It was rated only about 3 stars, but it had some decent acting and a little 'twist' to keep it interesting. Somewhere in the intro there was a note that it was based on a true story.. not sure if that's true, but it was a good watch, nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Funny,Touching Novel","review":"Having seen both the movie and reading the book. I have to say,once again the book is the winner. It dosen't have that silly \\"kidnapping\\" of Sidda by the other Ya-Ya's and is so full of detail that you can feel the 98% humidity and taste the Cajun food so mouth-wateringly depicted in the story. Most of all,it nice to read about a group of friends who geniuniely care for each-other and don't go around back-stabbing or cheating with the other's husband,etc. It'll make you wish had ones as loyal and appreciate the ones that are. It gets a bit slow in spots,but overall a very charming book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply divine, dahling.","review":"\\"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood: A Novel\\" is about three words: Life, Love, and Family. Although it took me a while to read this book, I enjoyed every minute I spent on it. It drags at points, but then it'll pick right up in pace and you won't be able to put it down. This book shows you how important your friends are, how to forgive your family, and how to understand people. I hope the movie is just as good. I recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divine Story","review":"Loved this book, great story about lifelong friendships between women and how these friendships can sometimes be the most powerful things in their lives....the book transcends cultural and geographic borders, relevant worldwide....I highly recommend this to other women....definitely a Girl's book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I disliked this book very much","review":"I considered stopping about half way through but kept going and I should have gone with my original inclination. Too many details - too many characters - too many weird french expressions - too much of a time span covered - it made no sense that some time periods were covered in excruciating details and then decades were skipped. This was a truly awful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"lighthearted but poignant","review":"Everything about this book is beautiful and full of life. You will fall in love with the lovable, if sometimes loony, characters and you will envy the bonds they share. The language is delicious...your senses will be astounded as you are brought into the hot and spicy Louisiana bayou. As a northern girl, I hardly thought I would understand that easygoing southern philosophy, but on the contrary! Ms. Wells's beautiful creation is fun for all, and it will undoubtedly have you alternating between hysterical laughter and sentimental Kleenex moments. This novel is a memorable one that will touch your life, most definitely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divine Secrets is simply divine!","review":"What a great book! I am a young reader, and reading is not one of my hobbies. A friend bought and highly recommended this book and I thought I'd give it a try. Wow! I couldn't put it down. Wells' ability to give the characters life and thought and emotion astounded me. I actually found myself laughing out loud, literately. I also felt like crying at certain points- something I don't do often. I highly recommend this book, it's guaranteed to be one you won't forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divinely Splendid","review":"I loved this book so much and recommended it to everyone I could possibly tell. In fact, Divine Secrets was so touching that I now am an avid reader looking for another book that will provide me with such a rich and enjoyable reading experience. The Ya-Yas are a great team of friends who brought me back to warm memories of my own childhood and the good times spent with friends. Vivi Walker's character is an amazing inspiration of a woman, even though she does have her short-comings. Rebecca Wells has a unique story-telling talent and her writing is clear and heart-felt. Divine Secrets is one of my favorite books, but I do not recommend reading \\"Little Altars Everywhere.\\" Though the other book has the same characters, it is lacking the zest and enthusiasm that Divine Secrets has. Also, I would stick to reading the book and ignoring the movie as it does not do Wells' writing justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book comes to life!","review":"I enjoyed this book so much! very single part of it jumped out at me. Rebecca Wells makes the story really come to life, so you feel like your there with Vivi or Sidda. The movie did not do justice to this wonderful book, though a good movie within itself, emotional parts were left out. So if your in the mood for a book that'll take you away from everyday life, I recommened this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I can see how some people would find this a good book. Unfortunately, I have not been lucky enough to find any solid frienships similar to the ones told about in this book. It almost made me depressed to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny & Sad & Wacky","review":"It was hard to begin this book but once I got into it I couldn't put it down! I loved the writing style - the descriptions really helped things come alive. The women are a tad on the unbelievable side but then again I'm from the northeast. Just fun, wacky, and very touching."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Divine\\" Certainly Does Describe It","review":"After reading this book, I wished for friends like the Ya-Ya's but then realized that it is probably much easier for me to read about their lives than actually have to experience them. I enjoyed the way Rebecca Wells gave a direct flow leading to a conclusion while still taking memorable detours that enhanced the characters. Vivi and Sidalee Walker were so in tune with one another, it was unfortunate that neither of them realized it, but then again, that is what kept the book juicy. Upon finishing the novel, I sent it overnight mail to my best friend in Virginia - unfortunatley, she sent it back, having already read it. I'm always the last to read great books. Divine Secrets comes highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"mindless drek. an embarrassment to intelligent readers.","review":"This was a complete waste of paper. I absolutely hated this book & am shocked that it was even published. What's more alarming is that it's a bestseller. I agree that most of the women I know who love this book are superficial & as annoying as the \\"people\\" in this inane book. Too many cliches & the silliest, stupidest dialogue I've ever read. Popular fiction at its worst!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is supposed to be good?","review":"I was so disappointed by this book. I kept hearing great things about it, but I couldn't even finish it. I got about 2/3 of the way through it and I couldn't take the torture anymore. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy, contrived drivel!","review":"I, too, was conned into reading this by well-meaning friends who declared it to be wonderful and funny. I won't be taking their literary advice again! I don't often despise books, but this one is horrible. It's sappy and contrived, and far too poorly written to qualify as a guilty pleasure. The characters are one dimensional and unoriginal, the flashbacks are tedious and heavy-handed, yet still fare better than the awkward attempt at a framing story in the relationship between Sidda and her sickening, plastic-molded boyfriend. I don't want to spoil the girl power/woman love thing surrounding this book, but I don't understand what the fuss is about. Try \\"Who Will Run the Frog Hospital\\" by Lorrie Moore, or \\"Sarah Phillips\\" by Andrea Lee, or ANYTHING - just leave this one alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost the best","review":"This would have been the best book I have read, ever, if the corny sub-plot about Sidda and Connor had been eliminated. I could hardly endure the writing in those parts. HOWEVER, the rest of the book was just GENIUS. I am a southern, Catholic, screwed up daughter of women who grew up just like Vivi, Necie, Caro and Teensy. This book would have saved me thousands in therapy if it had just been brought to my attention sooner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an awesome book.","review":"The story line is funny, outrageous and captivating. The story will let you find hope in the most desperate relationships! Have fun, its a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too shallow","review":"I enjoyed this book, and found myself caught up in the idea of the story, but I found the characters were too contrived and shallow. I couldn't really believe all the things that came out of their mouths. And to me, Sidda seemed like a 25 year old, not a woman approaching 40, immature."},{"rating":"2","title":"We all have a little Ya Ya in us","review":"After reading \\"Little Altars Everywhere\\" and having mixed feelings about Vivi I was a bit leary of venturing into \\"Divine Secrets.\\" My apprehensions were for naught because \\"Divine Secrets\\" creates an enchanting Vivi who can nearly be forgiven for her sins as a mother. All the favorites from \\"Little Altars\\" appear again in this novel plus some new favorites. Teensy, Caro, Necie & Vivi (the names should be enough to make you want to read this book!) draw the reader in and they are as enchanting as adults as they are as little girls and teenagers. Ms. Wells has a command of the language which paints pictures of what needs to be seen and forces the reader to feel what needs to be felt. The girls' desire to see Miss Tallulah Bankhead as Scarlett O'Hara was so palpable I was forced to read her biography. I can't wait for Wells' next! Does Sidda ever have her own Petites Ya Ya's padding behind?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A hilarious, heartbreaking gumbo of generations","review":"Rebecca Wells has captured perfectly what it has been like to grow up the feminist daughter of Southern belles who were feminists without knowing it. This novel made me laugh out loud in several places--and weep genuine tears in others. I not only saw myself in these women, but I saw my mother, my aunts and several other dear friends who grew up in the South, with its corsetlike strictures on what constituted a \\"lady,\\". Two generations of women finally had the gumption to be who they are come hell or high water. Wells' book helped me to understand my mother and myself, and to long for my own \\"Ya-Ya Sisterhood.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE! Why does everyone like this book?","review":"Well, if you loved the movie \\"Steel Magnolias,\\" you'll probably like this book. Personally I thought the book was maudlin, silly, poorly- written crap. (I listened to the audio version-- did not read the actual book.) The nauseatingly cutesy names of the women put me off right from the start: Vivi, Teensy, Neecy, and Caro??? The only parts I found marginally interesting were the painful parts of Vivi's life (the convent, the drug problem, etc.). I especially hated the stupid secret ceremonies out in the woods and the long, sappy passages about the \\"wonder and beauty and glory of the fabulous ya-yas.\\" Gag!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book couldn't keep me interested.","review":"Please!

I don't know what all the fuss is about the Ya-Yas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't live up to the hype","review":"I was skeptical when this book was chosen by my book club for its latest selection, and I tried to be fair and objective as I began reading. I have to say, though, that my initial hunch was correct. I thought it was a tremendous disappointment. The characters, including all four Ya-Yas were very superficial...I didn't find myself invested in them at all. Characters, scenes and dialogue did not ring true...they were all very labored and clicheed (here's an original character: a gay, witty costume designer), and rendered in pedestrian prose. And am I the only reader who found Teensy's morsels (or, rather morceaux) of French dialogue akin to fingernails on a blackboard? There was no emotional payoff for me, either; Sidda's reconciliation with her mother being triggered by memories of an elephant ride just didn't work, in my mind. The seeds of a good storyteller are there somewhee, I think, but in this work, Ms. Wells couldn't pull it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was so-o-o-o- disappointed.","review":"I bought the book because it was highly recommended to me by people whose judgment I trust. I was so-o-o-o- disappointed I read halfway and decided to quit because it was simply boring. Filled with trite cliches, shallow characters, and not particularly funny situations I labored with this book until I decided to just not finish it. Of course I also thought the Horse Whisperer and Bridges of Madison County were trite and contrived also. But I love Barbara Kingsolver and Kaye Gibbons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too cute, too contrived","review":"I couldn't even finish it.

It's a stretch but perhaps this was done on purpose so the reader could put themselves in her shoes??I can identify with wanting to know your mother's story --what was she like, what did she enjoy, what kind of things happened to her when she was young, how much like her am I...? I've always wanted to know these things about my own mother --too bad she didn't keep a scrapbook for me to explore and doesn't have friends like the Ya Ya's to help fill in the blanks!

Get a grip girls...read 'The Second Sex' by Simone de Beauvoir if you want to see how real women develop and support each other.

This story is so predictable, so cliche, so contrived...it basically cloakes itself in tiresome, ultra-hammy \\"I am Woman, hear me Roar\\" self-importance. I especially could not stomach Sidda's \\"insecurities\\" about whether or not to marry her hunky dream man - because would she really be able to love? And does she even know what Love is? Gag... Vivi, the leader of the Ya-Yas and Sidda's mother, is supposed to be some overly complex Woman with both allure, sensitivity, and disgusting habits and behavior, yet she is just a carricature that never seems real.

I thought they were very honest, warm, funny and quirky.Some parts tended to drag a little but the story kept drawing me back in with it's unique style of writing and twists.It was a fascinating account of a mother's relationship with her daughter, proving the impact a mother can make on a child with the world she creates around that child, and how she uses it to show love . Very unique.

I have shared this book with many of my women friends and all reactions were the same - fabulous. This book reminded me of my best friend and myself and some of our adventures of raising four children each as single moms. I feel sorry for people who can't empathize with Vivi. Life is real - not storybook. Vivi had her problems but made life fun. I recommend this book for all who have best friends they grew up with and remain friends with.

Little Alters was a page-turner for me, but I had to drag myself through the first half of Ya-Ya Sisterhood before finally just giving up and putting it down. Maybe it gets really good in the last half, I don't know. I just got tired of the main character wallowing in unnecessary self-pity and neuroses over her 'traumatic' childhood. Blah blah. I put it down and started reading Wicked - the Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, and was MUCH happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've GOT to be kidding...","review":"I realize that this book has gotten some rave reviews, but for the life of me I cannot see the point. Here we have a bunch of spoiled, rich, white dixie (ditsie) debs (and one rather unlikeable offspring) eating and DRINKING their way through this story. I did enjoy the descriptive prose regarding the \\"sisters\\" as young girls, but beyond that, I found the characters one dimensional, totally self-absorbed, and nobody I would want to know. Perennial alcholics do not, in my humble opinion, make the most appealing sorts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't very pleased...","review":"I was really not impressed by this book. After reading both of them I think Little Altars Everywhere was MUCH better. Ya-Ya dragged on, and was sorta boring. There were some good parts though, like all the flashbacks of Vivi in her younger days, but Sidda just annoyed me in this book.Everything that is wrong in her life is instantly blamed on her mother. She may not of had the best childhood...but it wasn't awful, and Vivi is surley NOT the root of all her problems. It just gets old afetr a couple hundred pages of her whining and self-doubt. I definiatly recommend Little Alters, and if you want to know why Vivi is the way she is, then Ya-Ya as well, but it takes a lot to get there."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Oprahfied Gone with the Magnolias","review":"This book didn't completely stink, but I swear I just wanted to kick that Sidda. She's such a lump of whiney misery. And what, does she have a reverse Oedipal complex? My opinion: She's just an excuse for the author to write in flashbacks. Just for the record, I'm not a Southerner and I didn't like Steel Magnolias. So if you did, take my word with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"This book was not the worst thing I ever read, but just not very engaging. It's like tabloid TV only it doesn't end after 30 minutes. It's not particularly insightful and in the end, you just don't care about the characters and what happens to them. At the same time I was reading this, I was reading the Heart is a Lonely Hunter (Carson McCullers) who wrote that book when she was in her early 20s. It's a thousand times more interesting and insightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck. I liked the movie, the book is SHALLOW.","review":"First of all, don't read this book if you expect it to be \\"clean.\\" It's not the worst out there, but it managed to shock me a couple times. Second, even if you can tolerate that, these are SHALLOW people. I got about half way through the book. I'm sure \\"dramatic\\" and \\"inspiring\\" things happen later, but so far...ick. Its full of over the top STEREOTYPED characters. Not only that, but the characters all think they are deep and wonderful people. I've never read a book where I felt author was judgmental about what made an interesting person. I probably enjoyed the movie so much because they cut all the garbage out and it had a great cast. I can't believe people liked these characters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I bought this for 10 cents at a flea market","review":"I'm only on page 83 and I'm about to ditch the book.It's not engaging. I can't relate to the characters. Their \\"adventures\\" are trite. The way they relate to each other is not realistic. If the main character, Sidda, was as badly abused as she implies, there is no reason for her to idolize her mother the way she does. The plot is disjointed, jumping from Sidda's narration to the mother's memories, without any kind of clear transition.Furthermore, the French is just AWFUL. You'd think the author would check with a French speaker before she commits such errors as \\"Comprendez-vous\\" or \\"les petites pauvres\\" (when she means poor little ones, not little poor people) to print. Or at least the EDITOR should have checked!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggh! What a mess...","review":"A friend from a book club suggested I read this one. Often, we love the same authors (Anita Shreve, Amy Tan, Kaye Gibbons, etc.) but every time I picked this one up it just didn't click for me. Well, I finally sat down to read it and I was so disappointed! I think this is one of the many recent books that have been \\"hyped-up\\" more than it deserves. It's a somewhat funny, mildly entertaining tale of several lazy, shallow, vain southern women and their daughters. The story primarily focuses on one of the daughters who is desperately lost and trying to find her way as an adult. I adore books about southern women (see Kaye Gibbons - wonderful writer!) and family, but I found this to be one-dimensional and extremely predictable. If you must read it, go to the library - don't bother to buy. And, plan to read it while on vacation or better yet, while drinking heavily! Maybe if I had been drunk, I would have liked it too..."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, bad book","review":"I found this book boring, very badly written, full of annoying characters and ridden with cliches.

So contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Word of mouth on this book was so strong that I had to pick it up. Having grown up and lived in the South my whole life, I was ready for a really good read. Boy, was I disappointed. The book seems more like disjointed short stories featuring the same characters than anything else. The plot lines veer toward melodrama and stereotype and I found myself reading with growing impatience and annoyance. Bottom line: I do not recommend this book to any of my friends. If you want really good writing about the women of the South, read Ellen Gilchrist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw away characters in a throw away book","review":"Clearly written in the hopes that Hollywood would pick this up.

First of all I think it's way too long. There are too many passages when I sit there \\"okey okey move on\\" and get bored. The story could be interesting, a difficult mother and a daughter relationship, but after we get that, it takes forever for something new to happen. Do we really have to know of every single party the YaYa girls go to? Second, it's always boring when you realise that the good people will always be good (and the good people in this book, they certainly are oh-so-good) and the bad people will be bad. No development whatsoever, and therefore no excitement. So, even though I value longlasting friendship and all of that, this book did not make me want to join the YaYa-clubs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really don't know what to make of this book","review":"I read this book and it had no effect on me what-so-ever. I expected much more depth from Wells' characters. Because it is told as a series of flashbacks, the reader is only given thin facades of each character. None of Wells' characters seemed to possess a soul. I think Wells' intended message was that even though Siddalee endured so much abuse as a child, she realized that her mother loved her, and did her very best. A message often hard-learned, but after reading 356 pages, I expected much more depth, breadth, and a greater understanding for my own life experience and journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely appalling","review":"Cannot see why this book is so popular. Poorly written, dialogue unreal, characters not fleshed out, the ya yas completely unappealing and not like anyone you would want to know, let alone be like. But then, \\"Bridges of Madison County\\" and \\"Horse Whisperers\\" were popular, too. It is amazing to me when there are so many good writers out there--Smiley, Kingsolver, Gibbons, Russo--how anyone can struggle through such drivel. I tried for l67 pages and then I was getting so depressed I had to give up. Back to Welty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential not realized","review":"I was fascinated by the psychological promise in the beginning of the book. I thought we were going to see how and why Vivi changed from the girl with so much inner spark and promise to the empty soul she became. What we got was a litany of harsh outer circumstances that could destroy some, but not others. I wanted to know why they destroyed Vivi. Or did they? The sappy and totally unbelievable ending seemed to say \\"nevermind.\\" An unsatisfying book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banal, trite, self-indulgent, liberal feminist nonsense.","review":"I finished this book because it was the only one I brought on the plane and the film was \\"Lost in Space\\".I have never read such a cliched, predictable and tedious book. I thought the writing was sophomoric and dull. It read like the author had written the story and then picked up a thesaurus and started changing words at random to make the piece read \\"more intelligently\\". What I wouldn't give for a book where people walked across a floor instead of \\"padded\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"overwrought and wrong","review":"I wanted to see what all of the fuss was about, so I bought and read both this and LITTLE ALTARS EVERYWHERE. Ugh. Aside frome the fact that the details are often WRONG (\\"crayfish\\"? OYSTER muffulettas?), it's overwrought, overheated, the framing story is moronic.... How can you caonize a mother who is an alcoholic child-beating sexual abuser? Why would you want friends like the equally alcoholic and shallow Ya-Yas? As a friend of mine said, \\"All of the women who love this book are people I cannot stand.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd cross the street to avoid a ya-ya.","review":"Evidently there are two kinds of people who read this book: wanna-be ya-yas and people like me, whose skin crawls at belonging to the same gender. There isn't one woman in this book who I relate to, would want to, would want to be related to, or would want my daughters to wanna be. Stereotypes with no saving graces, bad dialogue, pathetically neurotic... the writing is cliched, sappy... the only men developed are either unbelievable, inhumanly sensitive saints or idiots. I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"What ever happened to good literary editors?","review":"This book made me want to throw it across the room. The Ya-ya's are a tiresome bunch but not as tiresome as the narrator. Her non-story was the least interesting part of the book. One expected some sort of dramatic resolution. I thought the characters were not well developed and hard tocare about. Having grown up in the South, I guess I expected more. A Eudora Welty she's not! What little humor there was (from these supposedly fascinating women) was of the \\"you hadda be there\\" variety. I think if there were decent editors we would have fewer books like this. How many times do we have to heat that Sidda and her lover were naked?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a unique voice that pulls you in","review":"This book is so rich and unique. It tracks complex female bonds and the way they stretch and contract and bend, but never ultimately break. Rebecca Wells' narrative voice is half the pleasure of the book. Her descriptions of the South bring it completely alive -- you can taste the bourbon, feel the sticky heat, and smell the river."},{"rating":"1","title":"wildly overrated and a disappointing read","review":"This book was absolutely raved about (as you can see from the amazon reader reviews), but utterly failed to charm me. The writing style was too flowery, too obviously trying evoke.As for the content, I find it impossible to believe that a woman (Vivi) with THAT close of friendships could be THAT screwed up and unable to pass even a facsimile of that love to her own children. The trials and heartbreak she suffered as an adolescent seemed no worse those of most people. (I could be confusing this book with that horrible, horrid, awful prequel \\"Little Alters.\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for all Females","review":"You laugh and cry over what happens to these best friends. I have some great freinds, but none this close. I wonder if it is even possible in this moble age?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Epitomizes Life as a Woman","review":"Anyone who wants an inside view on what its like to be a woman should read this book. It touches on every subject; from friends, to mothers, to families, to men...you get it all. I have never before laughed out loud while reading a book and I never cried so much either. It gave me new insight into relationships and provided comic relief during some pretty intense subject matters. All in all, a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reinforced my pride in being a woman!","review":"I fell in love with the well defined characters and immediately identified with the lovely tragic heroine. Thought provoking and incredibly well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GA-GA OVER YA-YA","review":"Large portions of this book were either unbelievable, trite, or downright annoying. For examples, leaf through the book for any mention of the dog, Hueylene. All of the \\"dog\\" passages reminded me of the stuff I used to put in term papers so that I could meet the minimum length requirement.There were some cute little stories stashed here and there, but all in all, I'd have to say that this is the most overrated book I've read since Memoirs of A Geisha."},{"rating":"1","title":"So awful I can't begin to tell ya, dahlin","review":"Please do yourself a favor and don't waste your time--this novel is trite, ridiculous trash that barely qualifies as a banal \\"beach read.\\" For the reviewer who felt the book deserved the Pulitzer...thank God you don't get to vote."},{"rating":"1","title":"one word: contrived","review":"I'm not quite done with this book yet, but I felt like writing a review anyway. I like the flashbacks with the stories about the Ya-Yas' childhood and Sidda's childhood, but this whole scrapbook thing has got to be the most contrived way to get to these flashbacks that I could ever imagine. I find myself skimming over the parts in the present, with Sidda at the cabin, because they just seem like filler the author put in to get us from one flashback to the next. I thought I would race through this book, but instead I'm crawling through it, because each time I get to a \\"Sidda\\" part, I just get fed up with her silliness and bored with her thoughts. I haven't given up on \\"Divine Secrets\\" yet, but it's certainly slow going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ya-ya, yadda yadda yadda","review":"What a crashing bore. Rule no. 1 in fiction: make your reader care about your characters. Who cares about a bunch of self-absorbed Southern alcoholic pampered useless women like these, who think they are just the cutest little things! Skinny-dipping, disrupting the school play - using the word \\"poot\\" - oh my, aren't they just so adorably naughty! Please. I've seen soap operas with more easily identifiable characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book- it was wonderful","review":"I think that women everywhere should read this book. It is the heart wrenching book about families, and mother- daughter relationships in particular. Not only did I laugh, I cried! I can't wait to read Little Altars Everywhere. I can only pray that it will be as interesting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT IMPRESSED","review":"After about a month, I finally managed to finish this book. If you want to read about a bunch of selfish, alcoholic nudist, then this is the book for you. If you want to read something worth reading, try Michael Lee West."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I'm thankful for all the readers who expressed a similar opinion, because I was the lone one who despised this book at my book club! I am glad I am not the only one who finds the characters trite, selfish and uninteresting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stories But Lacks OrganizationSLC","review":"I enjoyed the stories in this book but they seemed thrown together. Half are told in third person and the other half in first person. I liked the flashbacks but it alternated to frequently. Other than that - a great book! I laughed out loud during the Shirley Temple scene...I will never forget Pooty Pootwell! And Vivi's experience at St. Augustine's just about broke my heart. If you enjoyed this book you would love Beach Music by Pat Conroy (one of my all time favorites)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some interesting characters lost in an implausible framework","review":"While the relationships of the first generation of Ya-Yas made for some good reading, the framing story of the oldest daughter of the most outrageous Ya-Ya was trite, boring, and, as a result, a little intrusive. Wells was a little lazy in her characterizations (for all their brass and sass, the Ya-Yas do not have distinctive voices), and she completely failed to engage me in the story of the adult daughter. The \\"Gone With the Wind\\" episode was memorable, as were a handful of others, but the overall effect was severely handicapped by Wells's sloppiness as a writer. These poor women never seemed real to me, and, in the end, the point of the story (the daughter's redemption) looked a little too self-serving for comfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderfully entertaining, so realistically written","review":"I couldn't put this book down. It kept me engrossed from departure to arrival on a long international flight. Sleep deprivation didn't matter. I was totally involved in this hilarious and wonderfully realistic interpretation of female friendship. It made me think about just how special these friendships indeed are.I insist that my mother reads it. Next are my girlfriends."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was sad to leave the world of the Ya-Ya's.....","review":"One of the greatest bonuses in reading fiction for me is the opportunity to join another's world, even if for a short while. I found Devine Secrets to be a heartwarming trip into the ties that bound the four characters. When I turned the last page, my heart sunk because I felt they were taking their friendship elsewhere. Vivi's character is refreshingly colorful (unlike Sidda's...I skimmed through her angst!)The book takes you to the depths of friendship we all long for. Highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lively portrait of friendship","review":"The characters in the book are brought to life in a very compassionate manner -- we love them despite (or maybe because of) their flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Barely worth the time to read. I skimmed. The frame of the story is weak and clearly constructed just for the sake of stringing together anecdotes about some lively women--I was bored by it pretty much from the get-go. The dialogue is stereotypical--the author tries too hard to make the characters say funny Southern things. While the idea of such a nurturing sisterhood is great, this book doesn't really dramatize a story about real people--it ascribes to an ideal and tells the reader about it. The jumping around between narrators is not controlled (nor explained nor justified) and therefore is distracting--you never know where the story is coming from. This might have been great stuff for a collection of essays, but not a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm glad I'm not alone in my assessment of this disappointingly mediocre novel. While the author has her moments, I reached the conclusion that she just isn't that great a writer. She certainly lacks something in the character-development department.I'll give it this much, though, the book held my interest. There's always something intriguing about stories that gives clues in the present to what occurred in the past. But the characters just didn't hold up. The Ya-Ya's behavior, especially as children and teenagers, was too unrealistic. Well-raised Catholic southern girls of their era didn't raise hell in public, or bath naked together as teenagers.And the character of Sidda was too exasperating for words. She couldn't marry the man of her dreams because she \\"didn't know what love is\\". Give me a break!! And if I read one more sentence about these woman boozing it up...It's a promising story that could have been much better in other hands. The best thing about it is it's wonderful title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to stop reading it","review":"After hearing so many strong recommendations for this book from my friends, I coudln't wait to read it. Once I began reading it, I couldn't wait to get to the good parts. Alas, I was disappointed throughout. So much so that I just couldn't go on reading it anymore. I found the relationship between these women a little all-too-perfect and hence not very believable. It was a bit too sappy for my taste. Bear in mind, however, that I am a non-fiction fanatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling","review":"If the characters in this book typify the American south, I'm moving to the Yukon. But I know that can't be right! Surely not all southern mamas are self-absorbed, bipolar dipsomaniacs. And surely we shouldn't have to read about the few that are and - worse yet - be expected to glorify them. I'm a huge fan of black humor, but child abuse written about in this way gives me chills. I'm with the writer/reviewer who was moved to throw the book across the room at one point. Wells had a good thing going with the prequel, Little Altars Everywhere. She should have left it at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book just dragged on.....","review":"i forced myself to finish this book, with lack of anything else to read currently. i just kept thinking 'who cares! '.... the characters are completely unbelievable, completely boring; and the plot goes nowhere very slowly. honestly, did people really enjoy reading this! don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for","review":"I didn't hate it, but I certainly didn't love it either. I picked this book up on recommendations from a wide variety of people, but I was quite disappointed with it. Personally I found the characters just too colourful to be real. And as a mother myself I had a hard time identifying with a character that is a selfish immature poor excuse for a mother. There is just no excuse for abuse - even if you are a Ya-Ya."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would...","review":"I WOULD GIVE THIS A ZERO BUT THEY WON'T LET ME. AND I DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO READ THE BOOK TO KNOW IT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Left a Nasty Taste In My Mouth","review":"Far as I can tell this book is about a bunch of shrill, overly dramatic, self pitying alcoholics. This made for a weak book. I hated Sidda, she was irritating in her every word and action. And the mother was overdone and seemed less real for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capital O for Overrated","review":"This book is not badly written. It simply has no plot and I can easily place it in my top ten Most Boring Books list. Perhaps I am a bit biased since everyone I knew raved about this book and it was strongly recommended to me by several people. I was bound to be disappointed I suppose and hence should not blame a fairly good writer. I know that others will vehemently disagree with me but I have to ask.....what is the big deal about this book? Why, when there are so many other interesting novels out there, would you pick up this bland concoction. Sure, the mother-daughter conflict makes for interesting fiction otherwise it would not be done so often in literature. If you want to read real mother-daughter drama, read White Oleander. I don't understand what is so compelling about this group of four women who grow old together. It really reminded me of Steel Magnolias which does nothing for its credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I can't understand the affection for this book. It is not badly written but it is about nothing but bad behavior and weak women. We need to teach our daughters and friends that women are capable of wonderful things, not self-indulgent, childish behavior. The characters are unbelievable and the plot stultifyingly slow. Do southern women want to be thought of like this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny","review":"I bought the book because I love Southern Women Writers, but this does not hold a candle to Kaye Gibbons or Eudora Welty. This is cornball stuff to me, but everyone else likes it so I may not be the one to go by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ya-Ya's? More like YADA-YADA-YADA!!!","review":"What a major disappointment. I wanted to like this book. I yearned to like this book. I tried, and tried, and tried to like this book. However, the author never convinced me that I should care about this group of cliqueish, priveleged, self-important friends. Too forced, too trite, and too cute, the story limps along, wilting under the hot Louisiana sun. The one time that the plot began to show some intensity, some passion, Vivi is too easily rescued from the evil religious school. Poor thing, she just never fit in. The promise of a personl conflict leading to character development was never realized. The whole sequence left me empty. The author lost my attention and commitment at that point, never to regain it. The Ya-Ya's aren't devine, just disfunctional. YADA-YADA-YADA, there's a whole lot of nothing going on with this book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally enjoyable!","review":"I think you have to be from the South to truly enjoy this book. It is not my own story but I couldn't help but laugh at the familiarity of Southern ways. It is truly southern. I could not help but fall in love with the Ya-Ya's at their best and worst. I saw in them a little of all the women in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"phoney-baloney sisterhood","review":"Rebecca Wells: I demand you give me back the three days it took to get through this mush. Why, why, why, are we supposed to like characters who think it charming to swim in folks' drinking water? Why does \\"southern charm\\" often equate with \\"annoying as all get-out\\"? This novel was worse than bad. Bad, I can forgive; manipulative, cloying, greeting-card sentiment I find abhorrent. I could just see the author, big-buck$ movie in mind, churning out her self-indulgent, Zelda Fitzgerald-wannabe, stereotyped characters and thinking \\"ok, this is very Shirley McLaine, and...I wonder if Olympia Dukakis can do southern...?\\". And the thought that Bette Midler--the QUEEN of overacting--might be involved with the movie--oh, IIIIKKK. Suffice it to say that from now on I consider my reading life a ya-ya free zone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tribute to southern sisters","review":"If you are a southern woman, or know one, you'll enjoy this book. The characters and situations seemed so real to me that I wondered if it was based on reality--if the author had actually found the \\"Divine Secrets\\" scrapbook assembled by the ya-ya's, and researched it's beginnings. I loved the way their story was slowly revealed, developing characters who were very real, with histories that forged the choices they made. This is a very entertaining book....you'll laugh...you'll cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Story!","review":"I thought this book was incredibly well written, with a lot of truth in it as well. It's a great book about mother/daughter relationships, as well as friend relationships. Although the 'drinking' aspect of the book didn't apeal to me, it added a sort of funny, and laughable part to the book. I also saw the movie, and it was just as well done as the story was. I loved this book, and think that all women, and girls should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the Ya-Ya Sisterhood!","review":"I read this book thinking that it would be a trashy book fix that I would read and never think about again, but I was wrong. I read this book and it immediately became my bible, guiding me through everything from the proper conduct of a lady while her parents backs are turned to how to act when you've just been sent to the county jail with three of your best friends. I never thought that I would love this book so much, but it has become one of my classic summer reads. If you have never read The Divine Secrets, you must, or you'll be missing out on one of the best experiences of your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm having book letdown after this one","review":"After the third time reading this book, I have had the worst trouble finding anything that even comes near to the profound joy this book gave me. It made me call my best friend and tell her how much I love her and how I would give anything for those days long gone where we just hung out together. Thank you Rebecca for an exceptional read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Ever","review":"I originally bought this book because I just wanted something different, did I ever get that! I'm hooked now. This is by far my all time favorite book. Hard to put down and I'm ready to read it over and over, something I've never done. My mother is reading it now and just overwhelmed by the emotions of the book. I'm buying it for all my girlfriends for their birthdays! This is a must read for every woman!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read? Ya-Ya!","review":"This book is just a good read, plain and simple! A fair warning to anyone who picks up this book: it'll make you miss your girlfriends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divine","review":"A book that will make you laugh and cry at the same time. A great read and Wells captures so truly the mother-daughter relationship as well as the relationship between life friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"I WANT TO BE A YA-YA SISTER!","review":"I read The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood about six months ago and I still think about Rebecca Wells' characters. I had my closest friends and mother read it, and we still laugh about certain parts. Vivi is one of the strongest characters I've met. I loved her, hated her, laughed with her and cried with her. I was extremely sad when the book came to an end. GET IT. READ IT. LOVE IT. AND PASS IT ALONG!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a story of women friendships and mother/daughter relationshi","review":"I have read divine secrets 3 times already and each time I discover something new. This is a good story of women's friendships, their sorrows and tribulations. It is also a story of that wierd and special relationship that exists between mother and daughter and how we never really are able to know the woman behind the mother. Siddalee is given that chance when she receives her mother's secret scrapbook detailing her life and friendships with the Ys-Yas. She becomes privey to that special relationship that exists between women that no man is allowed to penetrate: the sorrows, the joys, the ups the downs that are part of a woman's life. This book is wonderful - a must read for all women of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A teenager's point of view","review":"This book was amazing. It dealt with the real issues of life: kids, husbands, alcohol, depression, and the most trying of all- family. While I am only 18 and I have no kids or a husband, it really put a lot in perspective for me. And I really admired the relationships these women had with each other. It made me rethink the way I treat my mother. Every teenage girl should read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was surprised by this book","review":"Instead of loving the Ya-Yas, I was surprised by how much I disliked this book. Wells can get specific vignettes just right: a small-town contest that falls into disarray, or girls out on the sleeping-porch on a hot summer night, are wonderfully drawn.The framework for these vignettes is a problem, though: how can a person's, Vivi's, memories be invoked in her daughter when that daughter simply holds a memento from Vivi's scrapbook? Some divine or magical agency? ESP? Who knows? A loving group of women who help their friend's daughter understand her mother better by *telling* her stories would be more mundane, but also more credible and involving.That may be a problem that only I have with the book, but why spend leisure time on a character who is as completely toxic as Vivi? I recommend it if it rains on your vacation and it's the only book you've got."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK","review":"Unfortunately this book came highly recommended to me by a girlfriend who I will no longer trust when she says she likes what I'm wearing. This book is a downer. I felt like I was watching someone's therapy session third party. I could have done without all of the profanity coming out of this grandmotherly woman, and I could have skipped the vivid descriptions of how she beat her children with a belt buckle until they bled. I couldn't even finish this book, how depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like having to read a novel version of the sitcom \\"Alice\\"","review":"I haven't read the other 300 reviews in here, but I found this book very hard to get through. Wells wants her adult Sidda to be screwed up, but she can't seem to escape the romance novel convention that says heroines have to be glamorously screwed-up, i.e. confused despite fabulous careers and dark, handsome, beautifully one-dimensional boyfriends. I was quickly bored with Sidda's problems.I hate Southern novels that are infused with a yee haw sensibility that feels close to Petticoat Junction than Faulkner, and this book is rife with moments of teeth-clenching cutsie-pie.Not my cup of molasses."},{"rating":"1","title":"The NY Times Book Review was right not to feature Ya Yas","review":"Since the book was given to me as a gift, I can only be grateful I didn't put out my hard earned money for a copy. To compare the characters in this novel with the characters in Margaret Mitchell's \\"Gone With the Wind\\" - or any of Flannery O'Connors short stories - would be ludicrous. The Ya Yas were characters who never changed and they all were interchangeable. This novel has been compared to \\"The Bridges of Madison County.\\" While I think it is a valid comparison, \\"Bridges\\" was intended by the author to be a \\"spoof\\" although, ironically, it was not received that way. Evidently \\"literary\\" history repeats itself. Worst of all, this book is boring. I am only half through it, but I keep it on my bedside table at night and after a page or two, I am sound asleep. At this rate, I should finish it by the millenium."},{"rating":"1","title":"*SNORE* another overweight housewife book *SNORE*","review":"This is just exactly the type of novels that make other American writers blush in shame, shaking heads, and hiding behind sheets. A total embarressment to intellectual beings of life. If you are a woman, with overly sensative emotions, you MIGHT want to try this. Another uninvigorating housewife/teenage girls novel, an embarressing book to be seen with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing divine. Yawn-yawn.","review":"This book is a verbose, homoerotic, waste of time. And the great conflict between mother and daughter was just plain unbelievable; there was no pay-off after all that slugging through. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book I Read This Year","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book. What a disappointment! I had to force myself to finish. Aside from the \\"whine\\" factor going through the roof, the sugar coating was just too much. \\"Fluffy pink and blue thoughts.\\" The ridiculous 84,000 blessings. I defy you to turn to any random page and NOT come up with something gooey and cliched. This is the stuff of seriously bad Young Adult books. Ms. Wells might be a lucky writer, but she certainly isn't a gifted one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Stupid Book!","review":"I can't believe I paid money for this book. The characters had no depth to them at all. For the most part, they were stereotypes. This is a feeble attempt at a \\"feminist\\" book. As a woman, I am insulted by this book and the supposed \\"sisterhood\\" it portrays."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ya-Ya Secrets reveald","review":"I really loved this book.I saw the movie about 2 weeks before I bought the book. The book was alot better than the movie, but I'm glad I saw the movie because now I can picture the whole setting in my head. This was one of those books that you just couldn't put down. It was so realistic that it's sort of sad to think it was all made up. To who ever reads this review you should really read this book, you'll cry and you'll laugh.I would especialy recomend this book to anyone thatis from or has been to Louisiana and I would say the age group is probably 14 and up. HI Miss Taylor !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Started out Slow but grew on me...a great read!","review":"The hype about the upcoming movie made me want to read this book, along with its intriguing title. But I almost gave up on reading the book. It started out slowly, and took a while for the pacing to pick up. I felt disinterested.Stick with it as there are warm moments along with heart chilling experiences. What Vivi experienced when she was \\"sent away\\", Vivi's mother, Vivi's memories of being a young mother...these are all gold. And I cheered for the guardian angels who helped Vivi along the way, the ya-ya's.I didn't like Vivi in the beginning but by book's end, her strength and pride shone through. Her bumpy rapport with Sidda made sense. Sidda's story and struggles are shared with us, but I identified more with Vivi's story of courage. Vivi's pain--the bad things in her past-- Sidda had no clue about. She wasn't able to read between the lines, know all the secrets left untold in the scrapbook. It was fitting--like real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heal your Spirit","review":"This is an excellent book! One of the best I have ever read.

I picked it up again at the library a couple weeks ago to re-read and loved it almost even more than the first time!

The story was a good idea, but lacked depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"here's a grip - get it","review":"My sister sent me this book, saying it was un-put downable. Fine. I read it - and have wondered why I did so. Shallow, predictable characters, who have no, repeat NO toehold in real life. I rather think that we are supposed to identify with either Siddalee or Vivi, or view one of them as our sister/mother. Hmmph. I can identify well with women who have never had to work outside the home, who have no money worries, and were sent to film premieres; I know several women who can leave their high-end jobs in the theatre to go to an island and think about their lives. Drivel - possibly well-intentioned, possibly cathartic to Wells, but drivel nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic portrayal of sisterhood...","review":"I work at a small gift shop with an entirely female staff--we passed this book around between us like candy!

We're going to cook up some spicy Gumbo Ya Ya, play cards and delve into Vivi and Sidda's past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, boring, mean","review":"I did not enjoy this book. It was a slow boring read. Vivi is a mean selfish woman as is her daughter. I was really looking forward to reading this book. It was recommended by so many of my friends.

It never got better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, cliched, trite, disturbing.","review":"I found this to be an obnoxious, poorly written book. Wells draws on every cliche possible. The characters are so false that I couldn't believe that other readers actually identify with them.

Why is this character idolized by the members of Ya Ya societies everywhere?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A revelation about my mother's life","review":"I resisted reading \\"Divine Secrets\\" for several months even though it was recommended by a friend whose opinion I respect. I thought the title was silly (still do) and I didn't like the cover (still don't). But -- the book itself really grew on me and the most important thing about it was that it made me re-examine how I thought about my own mother, who, by the way, is nothing like any of the Ya-Yas. It is so hard to access someone else's experiences and memories; the book helped me to understand some things about my own mother just because she grew up in the same era as the Ya Yas, and for that I am thankful. It also made me wonder--why do we so often seem to have unresolved conflicts with our parents?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me long for my childhood and my adulthood at once.","review":"What a wonderful book. I wish that I could have sat down in a room and read this book with all my best girlfriends around me. I feel fortunate to have the same friends now, as an adult, that I had as a child. The Ya Ya's warmed my heart and made me smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow characters and an alcoholic storyline.","review":"I recently read an article reviewing \\"A Monk Swimming\\", which praised the happily drunk main character and his antics, but warned that people who had alcoholics in their circle of family or friends would not find this story amusing. \\"Ya-yas\\" is another such book. It is painful to see Vivi and her ya-ya friends soaking up hard liquor as the children play and swim around them, or pack a cooler of Bloody Marys while they hop in the car and get drunk on the road. Anyone who knows the tragedy alcoholics face in their daily life will not find this glorification of such activities very charming at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The title is catchy, but the book is woefully disappointing. Contrary to the reviews on the cover, it really was not particularly funny. It read more like a motion picture script than a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A novel \\"lite\\"?","review":"I'll admit to being entertained at some of the young YaYas' exploits, and occasionally touched at the devotion that they had for each other. However, the characters (particularly the men), plot, and dialogue were contrived and stilted. I won't bother to read Little Altars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A maudlin, overwritten tribute to white southern womanhood.","review":"I picked up this novel because stories about mothers who lose it after the fourth or fifth child generally interest me, but I couldn't stomach the dose of sentimental drivel about the true (and therefore typically southern) friendship exemplified by that bunch of spoiled, rich, white belles. At least those passages are better written than the framing story about the protagonist putting off her marriage and planning to directing \\"The Women.\\" Those sections are completely overwritten and even more nauseating, with their Harlequin Romance-like references to \\"his strong arms,\\" etc. Why didn't Wells's editor at least tell her to cut that part?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this book inane.","review":"I normally like southern women writers, but this left me cold. I found this book contrived, silly and a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERATED!","review":"With all the 'glowing' reviews this book received I couldn't wait to pick it up (the cover itself is reason enough to buy this book!) and read it. Talk about a disappointment! I could not get into Wells' style of writing and lack of character development. I found myself having no sense of feeling for the main characters and had to force myself to read this book - finally quit after 224 pages. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Altars","review":"If you stand back and check the scenes, one by one, they were preposterous. Except readers want to believe and therefore \\"work with\\" the author and forget the details that make it so unrealistic. I think the people who like this book must have coming of age issues in their forties that most people took care of in their twenties. The characters in the first book were much more developed. Wells's first book illuminated the consequences of the period's politics on a family in specifically too. It was funnier and sadder and darker and even more psychological."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and boring.","review":"Terrible read. Three-quarters of the way through the book I was still waiting to find a single character that I cared about. By the end, I wished I hadn't wasted my time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel free to throw this one away","review":"What a boring read, I couldn't even finsh this one. The writing was selfserving, sappy, and unbelievably cliche. What a bunch of fluff. I couldn't relate to any of these characters, especially the pathetic narrator. I can't believe Tom Robbins(he is one of my favorite authors)recommended this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"And what is the big deal with yaya?","review":"How does skinny dipping cause such a stir? A completely unbelievable family relationship, poor monolouge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readable, but just barely.","review":"Parts of this story are entertaining, but the last five chapters are pure sentimental drivel, as are passages throughout the book. The 4 yayas are exactly the type of girls/women I've always detested--they think they're something special, when what they really are is obnoxous and thoroughly self-absorbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remarkably disappointing","review":"I read and enjoyed Little Altars Everywhere and was looking forward to reading Divine Secrets. I haven't been as disappointed by a novel in quite a while. The characters in Little Altars are articulate, smart, funny, painfully honest and--most important--speak for themselves. The switch from first person to a third person narrator robs Divine Secrets of much of the vitality of the first book, substituting a lame \\"romantic\\" plot for the slowly revealed mysteries and horrors of a remarkably dysfunctional southern family. The romance is contrived, and the writing is banal. Comparisons to The Bridges of Madison County are all too accurate. Sadly, the characters in Divine Secrets are quite weak : annoyingly narcisistic women and an unrealistic, stereotyped cast of supporting players. What happened to the engaging people in Little Altars? They are unrecognizable here. I hope Ms. Wells finds original characters with their own voices again in her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I thought It Would be cut out to Be","review":"I just got to get this out of my system: This Book Sucked! I absolutely hated the way it was written, bouncing around, back and forth, not at all connecting with what the story was meant to be. Another thing: the characters were unbelieveablely grossly American. Your typical immigrant from the early 1700s. Housewives with rats for kids may enjoy this book, but as for me, the single female, did not find this novel humerous or interesting at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rah! Rah! for the Ya-Ya's--Vital Women of the South","review":"The Ya Ya Sisterhood is every woman's dream relationship with her fellow woman. The other as support and strength and vitality. How the men pale in comparison as lost loves or simply husbands. It's one woman's search for her mother as a person. The search for the feminine and balancing the ying and yang. How can she be an accomplished person when she doesn't know if her mother approves of her? How can she commit to the all-too-perfect love of her life if her mother doesn't love her? Reconstructing her mother's past and her relationship with the Ya Ya's helps her identify and solve her dilemna. A wonderfully thoughtful, yet joyful journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring....","review":"I know so many people loved this book but I simply could not get into it. I was forcing myself to read it. I was waiting for the story to start after the first few chapters, but it never did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous read","review":"Read the Ya Ya's. Also read Little Altars. I, as well as all of my friends loved the books. Funny, sentimental, touching, beautifully descriptive, insightful. I am not from the south, but could relate to the women's close friendship and the descriptions of the summer air. I read novels of all type, fiction, non-fiction, classics, Shakespeare and Stephen King. Divine Secrets as are all books, is unique unto itself and those who try to fit it into a mold and compare it to other novels of similar type do it a great disservice. I think all those who negatively picked it apart need to lighten up! Find a sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiddle-dee-dee! I love this book!","review":"Divine Secrets is one of the best books I have read in a long time.I was totally enthralled and could not put it down.It was laugh out loud funny.As a self-proclaimed Southern belle, I can tell everyone out there that those ya-ya girls are the real thing.Friendships like theirs do really exist here in the South.You MUST read this book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Southern, but not Siddalee","review":"Want to read a truly fabulous book about disfunctional, Catholic families from Louisianna? Want a really hysterically funny read rich with N'awlins patois, a boozy mother, and a character whose life is made up of a bunch of wild and crazy adventures? Let me recommend \\"A Confederacy Of Dunces\\". This, however, is a waste of paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it!","review":"I'll have to admit that if I had read Divine Secrets with a critical eye I would not have enjoyed it as much as I did. I guess Ms. Well's novel spoke to me because I'm also going through mother/daughter problems and major life changes, too. I thought Vivi's character was the most developed and the most realistic. Sidda Lee seemed a little too insecure and wimpy for a typical 40 year old woman. I'm from the South so many of Vivi's quirks and characteristics seemed realistic to me. Ms. Well's style of blantantly pointing things out (like riding Lawanda the elephant means life is scary so hold on and enjoy the ride) irritated me but didn't keep me from enjoying the book. It's not classic literature, but it's enjoyable if you can identify with the South, southern women, female friendships, and the energy-charged mother/daughter relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful story - a must read for every woman.","review":"The Ya-Ya's brought back memories and made me laugh and cry...sometimes at the same time. The characters in this book got me on their side instantly and I felt that I knew them and if I came across one of them along the street I would recognize them. Have told so many people about this book and hope they take me up on my recommendation. A wonderful find...plus Little Altars Everywhere. Can't wait for her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"Together with the \\"sister\\" book, Little Altars Everywhere, this is an absorbing and enlightening story. Intertwined with the laughter is the pain and tears many of us remember from growing up. If you read this book you NEED to read Little Altars to get the full effect - probably should be sold together."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okay . . .","review":"I listened to the audio of this novel. The author did a good job of reading -- bringing the different characters to life. I didn't love this book, however, because it was too full of cliches -- the over-the-top Southern mother, the oppressive Catholic Church, etc. -- that it just didn't ring true. The plot was so predictable that I was bored most of the time. Obviously many others who read this book got more out of it than me, but I think I'll pass on anything else by Ms. Wells."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! Finally a book that explores the depth of women's souls","review":"I put off reading the Ya-Ya sisterhood for a very long time, I didn't believe that any book could really grasp the unique closeness of female friendships. In retrospect, I should have read it the first day I saw it. This book really hits home! I saw my mother, my grandmother, myself, my friends, like we had been pressed inbetween the sheets. Ms.Wells weaves her story in a comfortable southern drawl that nearly belies the raw emotion of her work. She's a first rate story teller, and she hits the nail on the head with this one! 84,000 kudos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Southern cutie-fied formula","review":"Shame on you, 'becca. I hail from the very area you write of. I never heard anyone speak such French phrases! If they were Cajun, some may count. But rarely does a mid-to-upper class clique-like gal-group speak so; they'd deny their Cajun heritage in a heartbeat. I wanted to love this book, but couldn't. I wanted to like Vivi, in her lush-like splendor, but she came up so Hollywood, so thin, she disappeared after I put the book down. Wish Miss Wells hadn't welshed with such superficial and formulaic-contrived characters. Loved the cover of the book, though..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous book about mothers,daughters and sister/friends","review":"I LOVE this book about the relationship between a southern mother and daughter,and the mother and her lifelong friends,the YaYas. You will laugh,cry and be astonished at the depth of characters in this book. You will probably learn a little about yourself and your own mother as well. A must read for every women, and lots of men too! A book I will return to again and again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Southern-flavored VooDoo Yuk-Yuk","review":"This book lives DOWN to its goofy baby-ca-ca title. So many times I had to back up as I read, because I swore the book contradicted itself over and over again. I hate to agree with one of the characters in the book, but I think Buggy had it right when she said that Vivi and her friends were spoiled, self-centered and childish. I complained out loud so much as I read this book that my husband repeatly asked why I was wasting my time reading it. I finished it just so I would have the right to critique it. The book is supposed to be about relationships between mothers and daughters. On this level I found that the book was exceedingly shallow. Just because you light a candle and invoke some goddesses's name, does not mean you have spirituality or depth of relationship. What a waste!!! As a woman, I am insulted. If I were a Southerner, I would be horrified, if a Catholic, mortified at the portrayals, which may be viewed as the \\"norm\\" for that part of the population."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give this 0 stars","review":"I, too, read this for my book group and I have to say it's one of the worst books I've ever read. It's contrived and unbelievable. I found all of the Ya-Ya's annoying in their belief in their own cuteness and outrageousness. I've never heard of people spending so much time cultivating their own mythology. And why exactly are they so special? Because they went skinny-dipping? It's like a bunch of women who all thought they were Zelda Fitzgerald but were really just mid-sized fish in a very small pond.I found Sidda unbelievable too, and even the other members of my Book Group (most of whom at least liked this book) all found her boyfriend just too perfect to be real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"My mom liked this book & recommended it to me. I couldn't stand it. It was just too, too....oh, I don't know.... self-congratulatory, unbelievable, or something. \\"Look at what a cute little book I wrote about a bunch of women with cute little Ya-Ya names\\". Maybe because I'm not from the South but it seemed like the author was trying way too hard to be oh-so-clever. Didn't work for me - made me cringe. But as you can see other people liked it. Or maybe that means it was a good book because it DID invoke feelings in me (even though they were hateful feelings). No criticism of the author as a writer - I just didn't like the characters & story - a matter of preference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I had heard so many glowing reviews about this book that I was earnestly looking forward to a good read. I was very disappointed. I had to force myself to finish reading it.There was nothing remotely appealing about any of the characters. Three of the so called \\"ya-ya's\\" are so thinly defined that it was hard to imagine what drew the group together in the first place. The author spends far too much time describing how they were always in a bed, bath, or hammock together. She should have devoted that time to helping us understand them better. The main \\"ya-ya\\" is a poster child for dysfunction.This book reads like a long-winded justification of alcoholism, drug, and child-abuse. There is nothing divine in that."},{"rating":"1","title":"what an awful novel","review":"I can't believe this was a bestseller. The writing was on the level of a junior high school creative writing assignment. The characters were completely unbelievable and the \\"plot\\" was just plain stupid. Save your brain cells and don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite trash attempting to pass as literature","review":"This novel left me absolutely cold. I doubt I have ever felt such significant disgust or hatred of any novel as I do about this one. After all of the fanfare I decided to pick this novel up and give it a try - against my better judgment. Anyone who considers this literature has obviously had little exposure to true authors of merit. The most disturbing aspect of this book is its ability to maintain its place on the bestseller's list and in the hearts of many devoted fans. Am I missing something?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I can't believe how many people liked this book. It read like a made-for-TV movie. The dialogue was completely unbelievable (people just don't talk like that!), the plot contrived. It's too bad, because the premise of the book - a damaged family relationship and the exploration of female friendships - had a lot of potential, but fell totally flat. It was almost frustrating that it was so poorly done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the date of issue saves this trash","review":"To term this work dreadful may still be too complimentary. Here we have a work that tries to be Tennessee Williams and ends up with the depth of Green Acres (though, sadly, without its humour.) Scanning the reviews on this board, however, made me realise how it is selling so well - mental illness (real or counterfeit), exploring the \\"dysfunctional familes\\" and \\"chidlhood memories\\" and trite psychobabble are so popular that their adherents would give anything of the genre the status of Macbeth. Those reviewers who became defensive or accused those with contrary views of being \\"in denial\\" and the like had me laughing aloud - the book, which deals not with the trendy but with the truly sick, was far too tragic to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploits People","review":"This book was a sappy, cheesy story which does not deserve any credit. It is similar to his other books, like \\"I know this much is true.\\" The only reason anyone gives it any respect is because it was on Oprah's Book Club and people are too afraid to say anything bad about it because they think people will make fun of them or something. The content really was not that great, and I feel it is time someone spoke up and denied Oprah her instant bestseller powers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh yes.","review":"If you read only one book in the bathtub with a martini this year, make it this one. I was mortified to see it end. I wanted to turn back time, but of course all attempts to do this failed...I will just have to wait another year or two and read it again - by then it will all seem new. Ms. Wells is a true original. Rejoice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Petty, Poorly written, and Boring!!","review":"I have never hated reading a book as much as THIS book. It was given to me by a friend who absolutely couldn't say enough GREAT things about it. I have read 2/3rds of this book and wasted way too much of my life on it. Tonight this book will join the logs in the fireplace. I can't believe women can be this petty."},{"rating":"1","title":"it deserves less than one star, but that wasn't an option.","review":"This ranks as one of the worst books I have ever picked up. The writing was so poor, so uninspired, so trite and full of cheap stereotypes, I can not for the life of me understand what all the hub bub is about. The story line of Sidda was poorly written and silly and the story line of the ya yas unbelievable. I read this for my book group, but could not bring myself to waste my time to finish it. I sat in a group of six women who loved it and felt like I had landed on some strange planet. I just wanted to scream \\"this writing is garbage!\\" \\"this is not good literature, it will not stand the test of time!\\". But alas, I was alone. After reading this drivel, I want to run and pick up a Jane Austen novel or Thomas Hardy to remind myself what truly wonderful writing is."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Chore","review":"Someone gave it to me to read! It took months to get through this tripe. Lots of tedious details. Book about close female southern friends, problematic mother/daughter relationship... nothing rang particlarly true. Forgetable writing style and story. Sorry I picked it up, actually, because my own mother was passing away the entire time it took to read this book. I sat in the hospital with this terribly boring story, determined to finish it. This family paled in comparison to my own family dynamic (the mother even paling by comparison) which made this boring book seem doubly trite for me at this time. Oy, so happy it's behind me."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's made a mint with this one. Too bad!","review":"Insipid characters, contrived plot, shallow writing: food for the masses. I wouldn't have a problem with this book if it weren't for the fact that it's being passed off as literature. In fact, I expect that Oprah will soon enough adopt it as a must-read. It ought to be shelved next to Danielle Steele- categorically that would be more appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"Silly book about an aging yuppie and her relationship with alcoholic mother and mother's relationship with alcoholic \\"sisters\\". Oh yuck. I was simply unmoved by the angst of these priviledged, white, Dixie debs. The characters were flat and predictable. The grossly overdone references to food, booze and flowers were, I suppose, meant to be sensual. It left me retching. There was precious little here to be of any real interest or value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depth?","review":"Entertaining at times, easy read, but I am not recommending it unless I can get rid of my copy of the book. I sure would like to think Southern women have more depth. The ones I know do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down with Ya-Ya","review":"It's no wonder this book was created: what a copy of the humerous Bridget Jone's Diary. This book was tedious and dull, the cover art was a bit nasty to look at also. The day to day writings of this was a bore to read, okay...day 1: do dishes. Day 2: go get groceries, chatted. Etc.etc this book just didn't stop. Why would we want to know her choices of vegetables? Huh, the author was trying to hard to be funny. Worst of all, I had the hardest time remembering this title and the authors name, all I could remember was divine and ya-yas. Briget Jone's Diary is still my beloved humorous fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly overrated!!","review":"The Ya Yas are a bunch of selfish, useless, inconsiderate, alcoholic women. I found absolutely nothing redeeming about their adolescent behavor. I forced myself to read this trite to the bitter end to see what all the raves were about, but I am still puzzled. I didn't find the book particularly amusing. Of course, I didn't like the Bridges of Madison County either, maybe I just have good taste!!! By the way I am a successful adult woman with many women friends who loves a good laugh and a good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tugs at the Heartstrings and Tickles the Funny Bone","review":"Rebecca Wells has written herself a masterpiece in \\"The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood\\", which through the lives of Vivi Walker and her daughter Sidda, addresses the complicated relationships shared by many a mother and daughter. From page one she had me hooked with her on-the-money descriptions of every emotion felt at one time or another by a woman, myself included. I honestly don't see how she could ever top this novel--it was THAT good. My suggestion? Make yourself some hot tea, curl up on the couch and get lost in Wells' Louisianna. I guarantee you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is the WORST book that I have ever read! In fact, I didn't finish it. What a waste of money.

HOW PRETENTIOUS CAN YOU GET?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious!","review":"I just finished this book, and I have to say, it is one of the very best. Wells has opened up my own desire to delve into creative writing, a genius. The story of the Ya-Yas is so tastefully done, one cannot help but wish that one was indeed a Ya-Ya. Vivi is certainly one of the most colorful characters I have ever had the pleasure to smell, taste, feel and experience. All submodalities are brought to life in this book, as if you are in Louisiana on a country road, cruising in a convertible, drinking a flask of bourbon with the wind in your hair and the smell of summer all around you. Marvelous read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood","review":"This is a great book with lots of action and suspense. I do believe though that it is about the most dysfuctional family in the history of books! I can't believe all the things that happen to the children growing up under their mother's protection! You must read it to believe it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this was such a great read...","review":"I'll admit that this isn't an absolutely perfect tour de force that will make a huge imprint in the literary community, but this book made a huge imprint on me. I'm not Southern at all, so I'm not attached to this book out of nostalgia. However, it did make me think of the spirit and magic of childhood. It made me remember why I love who I love, and why I will remember some moments of my life forever. This may be a chick book (it made me cry), but I don't care. If you are interested in a book that weaves in and out of past and present and different POV's, a book that makes you want to relive your childhood for a bit, then this is definitely for you. It's not all happiness and fun throughout the book, but in the end, you will have that warm feeling of reading the last sentence of a book, while thinking of how much you related to the characters in this wonderful book by Rebecca Wells."},{"rating":"1","title":"A better movie!!!","review":"I didn't wait for the library's copies to be returned and I wish I did.Siddalee Walker is one of the least sympathetic characters I've ever read. Though they are spoiled and self-centered, the Ya Ya Sisterhood saves this book.Here's an interesting fact: most of what happens in the movie does not happen in the book, and the movie makes tons more sense. Normally I am a purist when it comes to movies made from books, but I much prefered the movie version.Most of the dialogue in the book didn't make it into the movie, which is good because Wells is too concerned with making things sound beautiful and poetic, so much that the dialogue is barely believable. ...And not everyone speaks French, thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Southern Tale","review":"This book was about many things but what I ended up thinking about is how everyone experiences different lives and how we all get to the same place. We all ask ourselves the same questions \\"Who are we and what our experiences have made us\\". Everyone's experiences are different and there is no \\"NORMAL\\", just different. Very insightful. It wasn't about the characters being good or bad persons, it was about living our lives the best we know how. With what we know and what we have to work with. I really enjoyed this book and recommend it to my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ya-Ya? No, No!","review":"Oh, please. If I didn't know better, I'd have thought a man wrote this book. It just didn't ring true. The writing itself is not particularly good, and the story seemed rather pointless. I just didn't buy the whole Ya-Ya sisterhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and weird","review":"I loved Little Altars Everywhere and looked forward to Divine Secrets, but found Ya-Ya's disappointing and annoying. The characters, which were quite funny and touching in Little Altars, were suddenly boring, especially Siddalee. The flashbacks about Vivi as a child were good, but what happened to the fact that she had molested her children in Little Altars? What happened to Siddalee's brothers and their not-so-endearing relationship with their predatory mother?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughing and Crying at the same time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"WOW!!!!!!!!! What a book. It has parts that leave you rolling on the floor laughing, and other parts that leave you with tears streaming down your face. Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood is a truely remarkable book, with witty dialogue, and a wonderful plot and strange and interesting charicters. It doesn't take much to get into this book, with funny scenes that make you think about how wonderful life realy is. Then there are scenes which are so profound and sad. But there is the right ammount of both to leave you at the end with a content feeling, because it wraps up perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divine Ya Ya Sisterhood","review":"My review: Slow starting (first 50 pages) the author picks up from there and finally captured my attention. When she did I was at times enchanted by the 'real life' honesty that flows throughout the book. Weak in spots, the first series of letters was sometimes boring but mostly weak surrounding the character of Sidda and the very brief encounters with Sidda's fiance seemed amateur. What enthralled me to finish the book however, is the authors magic pen of description that she finally got around to displaying. I started out trudging through the first half and by the time I was finished I loved this story. It is refreshingly honest and the author circles the dynamics inside of situations with home spun grit; much flavor and consistent real life soul to the end. (Sidda's character needing more foundation and structure though)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Put me to sleep!","review":"I have to agree with the reviewer Shannu, this book was highly recommended to me but in my opinion completely boring. I felt like I was back in college and had been assigned a text to read instead of reading for pleasure. It was torture and put me to sleep each time I picked it up. I actually enjoyed the author's writing style and will read another of her novels but I just couldn't keep interested in the story line. After reading many reviews of this novel I can see that 95% of the reviewers would disagree with my opinion so it would probably be safe for someone reading my review to pick up the book and read it themselves. Hopefully, you won't expect much and then be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"so so chic","review":"Do you remember the Nancy Drew novels? Nancy was always hopping into her sporty roadster in her smart suit.This book is full of that breathless girly detail. Why do we need to know that Sidda ate brie and ground wheat crackers? What's wrong with crackers and cheese? What's the point of all the socio-cultural window dressing?There is a glimmer of real emotion in here but not worth the read! Reminded me of the \\"trash novels\\" of my girlhood.This book was recommended by a friend so I gave it a try- but there's just too little time in life for stuff like this. If you read the good books first, or at least the intelligent trashy entertainment, you'll never get through this book. Of course the author has had some kind of real emotional experience, but her attempt at revealing it is an insult to every abused child of a raging alcoholic. Dig deeper and drop the bestseller nonsense.I know- it's all been said in many reviews, and better. I gotta go read now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ya-Ya? No, No!","review":"\\"You MUST read this book!\\" I was told time and time again, usually with a scrap of paper and the title scribbled on it. \\"Even though you're a guy - read it! You'll love it!\\". So finally I got it...and read it...and didn't particularly love it. I liked it - somewhat. Yet, with all the hype surrounding it (from SO many people), I wanted to love it. Why didn't I love it? Because the characters were no more than caricatures, the plot was plodding, the humor forced, and the ending could be seen by Helen Keller. Wells had her eye on the \\"Oprah Book Club\\" logo when writing this book, but (surprise!) the book isn't depressing enough to warrant Oprah's stamp of approval. Which is why I liked it - somewhat. Lately, people have been telling me \\"You MUST see this new movie! You'll love it!\\" with a title scribbled on a piece of paper. Guess what the title is?"},{"rating":"1","title":"let's not worship weakness","review":"Coming from a family of stong women, I am ashamed to have read this book. Its glorification of female weakness is deplorable. Even worse, so many women seem to admire these characters that hate their children, get drunk, and have no meaningful relationships with their husbands. Here's hoping my generation will turn this trend around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow women play-acting at life","review":"I really wanted to like this book. All my friends loved it and I was told I'd laugh and cry through the whole thing. I never laughed and only wanted to cry over the time I wasted on it. The characters lack depth and are content to remain shadows of real women. The minority of reviewers who disliked this book echo my sentiments exactly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written, Entertaining, Incredible Novel!","review":"This novel is an easy read. The incredible lives of these four friends will enthral you. You'll want to send a copy to every girlfriend. A MUST READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was transported","review":"Rebecca should be proud of this long list of commentary on this book with an average of 4 stars. Based on their comments, the negative reviewers may want to ask themselves a few probing questions. I wonder how many of those who felt the characters were self-centered were volunteers, mothers, believers in a higher power etc. The characters in this book were real people with guess what flaws, among them, too much alcohol and nervous disorders. And guess what again, their faith and friendship continued to get them through life. (I loved the from the heart and soul prayers to the Holy Mother of God) Maybe a good lesson in here for all of us?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ya-ya gag-a-rama","review":"This was without a doubt the most horrible pile of rubbish I've had stuffed under my nose in ages. I'm truly aghast that this has been so popular, even without the benefit of one of Oprah's plugs. Then, for research, I went to her website and read her bulletin board, and it all made sense to me. You'll never find a lowlier bunch of toothless, fake-drawling buffoons than her fans. It's true folks, the end of the world is at hand.Check out Gumbo Ya-Ya for the ultimate proof."},{"rating":"2","title":"If they'd let me give it more than 5 stars, I would!!","review":"This book, I believe, touches women in that space where you are always trying to live with and figure out your Mother. Wells does a great job in telling both Vivi's and Sidda's stories -- I'd often get absorbed in YaYa-ness that I'd forget about Sidda. It's been far too LONG since a book engrossed me this much.I've also enjoyed reactions as I walked around carrying the book. Total strangers have stopped me to say, \\"Isn't that book wonderful?\\"I agree with another person who recommends Amy Tan's books which also explore the mother--daughter thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I WANT TO BE A YA-YA!","review":"Divine Secrets is one of the best books I have read in a very long time. The ideas this book shares about the mother/daughter relationship will ring true to many women, whether mother, daughter, grandmother, or friend. The power of the woman-to-woman relationship is explored and discussed beautifully throughout the entire novel. This book made me want to be a Ya-Ya, move to Louisiana, and most of all, call my mom."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"this book was some of the most heavy handed, trite garbage I have ever read. I love coming of age books, books about friendship, about interesting and wonderous cultures. This book sadly lacked the depth and originality and thoughtfulness that I hoped for. To this reader, it had all the makings of network, not even cable, made for TV movie of the week or sitcom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild, frustrating, wonderful daughter/mother relationshipip.","review":"From page one the reader is caught up in the estranged relationship of Vivi and her daughter. We learn of the incredible 50 year relationships of 4 women in the Ya-Ya Sisterhood in Louisiana, who would stop at nothing to protect one another from anyone or anything. Beautifully written - one of those books where you stop reading so that you never have to face the last page. One hopes that these women's lives and adventures would go on forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, mothers and daughters should read this one ...","review":"I read Little Altars Everywhere first, and couldn't wait to get my hands on Ya Ya's. God...I grew up in New Orleans, but had plenty of family in CenLa. Not only did it evoke the feeling of 'home'...but the differences in the relationships between mothers and daughters vs. seeing the mothers as women with a tight circle of friends....should be a must read for mothers and daughters. I know I passed them on to my mama and am anxiously awaiting her opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book about relationships. Mother/daughter. Friendship","review":"Excelent. One of the best books I have read in a long time. Could not put it down. I loved the friendship that these women shared. A must read for all women."},{"rating":"1","title":"I looked for joy, I found obnoxious self-indulgence.","review":"I read the entire book. I hated it. I kept expecting some explanation of the behaviour of the characters, and all I got were anecdotes. The last chapter was completely anticlimactic. I didn't like the daughter and couldn't have cared less if she got married to the stud or not. And the mother -- was the point just to prove that boozy old ladies were young once, too?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A heavy drama and a light comedy all in one","review":"This book made me laugh hysterically and sob at the same time. It was a real delight! I recommend it to anyone who knows of the mysteries of the mother/daughter relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skating on the success of \\"Little Altars\\"","review":"\\"Little Altars Everywhere\\" was quite touching, the author clearly gifted (at times even Faulkner-esque). So I was floored at how poorly written and flat-out boooooring \\"Ya-Ya Sisterhood\\" is. I couldn't get past the fourth chapter. There's no trace of the talented writer from the previous novel, nor any glimpse of the lovable protagonist who, in this novel, is all but unrecognizable. It leaves one with the feeling that the author was under contract pressure and sat a monkey in front of her keyboard to fulfill it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood is a warm, thoughtful, tale of the mother-daughter relationship. When I first picked up the book I found Rebecca Wells' prose somewhat gushy. I soon discovered that Wells' style was simply lush and languid, with a tone I haven't read before. As the story progressed with memories and flashbacks I became absorbed in the Ya-Ya world. Truly an original work with humurous, real, characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to be a Ya Ya...dysfunctions and all!","review":"I have read many books. I've never cried while reading any of them...or laughed so easily. I thank Rebecca Wells for her spirit and ability to so gently yet powerfully tell this story. I think most daughters can relate to this and I think most of us wished we had the Ya Ya's to help us understand our mothers.I have a sister Vivan and she is now affectionately call \\"Vivi Dahlin\\". It's not such a stretch. She is as complicated as the real Vivi, but then again, aren't we all?All family relationships require passports to travel through. I am so glad I got a chance to hear the accents and smell the spices cooking through Vivi's shrimp etoufee.Forever a fan of the Ya Ya's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A TOTAL BORE!","review":"I finished the book and I can't understand what all the excitement is about! A friend highly recommended the book to me. I won't take her advice again about a book. If a zero star was available, that would be my rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT I DON'T FINISH A BOOK","review":"This book was ridiculous, confusing and totally boring. I tried and tried to get into it, but I just couldn't. I would not recommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent piece","review":"This book was quite successful, being filled with great humor, and yet still remaining sensitive. It has an outstanding way of showing both types of bonds between women - mother and daughter bonds and the friendship bond. Wells was rather clever in her way of showing how the two types of bonds can intertwine. Without a doubt, a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divine","review":"A wonderful novel - filled with the seemingling-real ghosts of the south. Ya ya will not win a Nobel Prize but it is a terrific escape into the lives of strong women. I enjoyed the humorous entries about motherhood and overcoming hardships. For entertainment and laughter, real this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I'm going to be honest, I don't read many books. I don't have time and I usually get bored after the first page. That being said, I was glued to this book. My goal was to read the book before I saw the movie and I am glad I did. The plot of the book is much richer than the movie. There are more twists and turns. My reccomendation is to read this book whether or not you have seen or plan to see the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"TAKE IT FROM THIS N'AWLINS NATIVE BELLE!","review":"By far, one of the best books I have evah read! Don't you listen to any of the nay-sayers about this book! It is simply wondaful dawlin'! I am bawn and raised in N'Awlins, LA. So, you can trust my instincts on this book written about a family of women in the heart of my beloved Louisiana. Every one of my friends and I simply adored this book! It will make you laugh out loud and make your little ole heart sing! I am reading it a second time, that's how good it is! You won't be sorry you picked this one up. This book is a sure treatment to prevent wrinkles from frowning too much b/c you will smile the whole way thru!... You won't be sorry sweeties!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"makes you realise the true value of friendship..","review":"This book was truly the best one i've ever read before in my life.. believe me, i've read TONS! It'll make you laugh, and cry.. and wish you were part of the ya-ya rabilia.. a must read.. and the movie's coming out too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern Charmer....","review":"What a great mother-daughter book. I read this book a couple years ago and passed it along to my mother, who loved it. This book is charming, funny, touching, sad and forgiving. It's about the bond of lifetime friends, relationships between siblings and last, but not least, that special mother/daughter relationship. I found myself laughing out loud at times, and near the end, shedding a tear. I can't wait to see what the movie will be like! Mom's and kid's...go out and read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rebecca Wells' novel is an instant classic!","review":"Divine Secrets was a powerful book about the complexities between a mother and daughter. I loved this book. It was complex, insightful, funny, and poignant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing passionate characters, except the lead","review":"The Ya Yas are the bestest of best friends. Everything about their lives is exponential, from the love to their tragedies. Its this passion for living that makes them so fascinating. The only disappointment is the lead character, the very boring daughter of Ya Ya Vivi, Siddalee Walker. Oh well, you'll get past her like I did and revel in all the glories of the Ya Yas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I picked up this book because of all the hype about the movie and now I fail to see what all the hype is about. I found the story very disjointed with too many undeveloped characters including Siddalee. Hope the movie was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pul-eeeze!","review":"Contrived. If you're the type of person who buys into every little glee and cliques of so-called womanhood, you'd like this book. (The movie was even harder to sit through.) If you have any discriminating taste at all, you'll be bored. If still courious, get it from your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"If you want to read a good book set in the south read Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. If you want to read a good \\"Women's\\" book read The Bridget Jones Diary. Under no circumstances would I ever recommend this southern fried fluff. It is cheesy fiction in the disguise of literature. I am so shocked to see Ya-Ya frequently named as one of the best books of the year!The characters and story are so predictable I could hardly stand it. Plus it is extremely boring! I guess I should have seen the red flags flying when I heard they were making Divine Secrets into a movie with Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn. This book was a tremendous disappointment. Too bad Amazon doesn't offer a \\"zero star\\" option."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dumbest book I almost finished","review":"This so called work made me embarrassed to be a woman and by the number of 5 star reviews I feel the world may come to an end. If you have any taste in literature and feel deep in your soul that you are a \\"grown up\\" I would recommend not wasting your precious life on earth reading this jibberish. There are no redeeming qualities to be found. Reading this was like chinese water torture, or screeching nails on a blackboard. I wouldn't trust any woman who thinks this type of literature is \\"wonderful?\\" because she is not a woman, she is stuck at age 7."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, with incredibly annoying characters","review":"I know I'm in the minority, but I hated this book. The writing is terrible, the characters completely unrealistic and extremely annoying. (And don't get me wrong--I'm a woman who highly values female friendship as well as humor writing.) I literally threw the book across the room at one point. A real waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikeable Characters, Overdramatic Story","review":"I quit halfway through when I realized: I didn't like or identify with any of the characters, started skimming, and thought the whole story was completely overly dramatic and self indulgent and just didn't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exhausting","review":"I didn't realize this book was a sequel. I just read it on its own without any familiarity from prior reading.It feels like the \\"strong Southern women with lots of secrets that are gradually revealed\\" plot has been done enough already. I got exhausted by these characters and the word \\"ya ya\\" was pounded into my skull like a spike.If you are into these kinds of plots, you'll love it. If watching \\"Steel Magnolias\\" was all you needed to satisfy any craving for \\"strong Southern women\\" stories, don't bother. (I suspect that few men will enjoy this book. That could be part of my problem with it.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Divine Book","review":"This book will have you laughing and crying as you follow the relationships of Sidda & her mother and the Ya-Ya's. It serves as a reminder that true friends are always there - through the ups and downs of life - and that true friendships cannot be defeated."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just really didn't like it","review":"I just couldn't make a connection with this book. While I liked Vivi and the other Ya-Yas, I really did not like Siddalee at all. She just seemed so whiney and annoying to me. I didn't really care what happened to her, and I thought her boyfriend would be better off without her and her stupid little problems.The really sad thing is that I automatically don't want to read a book when a reviewer compares it to this book. I'm probably missing out on some good reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book","review":"Overwrought writing fraught with brand names and trite metaphors the author wanted to fit in so just squeezed in where possible. Terrible, cliche, and it's disappointing so many readers fell for it. Poorly developed characters and no discernible or respectable storyline. Sorry to be so harsh, but the book was highly recommended and then turned out to be a BIG let-down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Similarities between \\"Ya-ya\\" and \\"Crossing to Safety\\"","review":"In one season, our book club read \\"Divine Secrets of the Ya-ya Sisterhood\\", and \\"Crossing to Safety\\", by Walter Stegman, and we found many similarities between the two stories, and some of their characters. It seemed to us that Rebecca Wells might have been influenced by having read \\"Crossing to Safety.\\" Made them both more interesting to draw the similarities out of each."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular Study AND Story","review":"If you really want to know about the complicated, but rewarding, nature of women, read this and believe every word. The Ya-Yas and their petites (children) are honest and fascinating. These women made me grateful for my mother, grateful for the girlfriends I am blessed with, and gave me a longing to be more connected to even more women in my life. Our husbands might not get it, but we will."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that can't be put down !","review":"This book was very moving, it was an emotional novel, one that stirs the emotion of a daughter- and has relevance to all mothers and daughters. I found the story to be engrossing. Very Faulkner-esque. A great talent out of the south, I hope Rebecca Wells writes more great novels like this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Glorification of Alcoholism","review":"This book is a hymn to alcoholism. It is awash in liquor. It seems as if the characters accompany every significant speech, action, and confrontation with a drink. Characters are drunk all the time, and a significant number of problems arise because of various people's drinking. Husbands and wives get drunk individually but don't talk, one character's marriage is considered good because her husband happily brings her drinks,a women leaves her family to go to a hotel and drink, the main character drinks brandy while ruminating on the effects of her mother's drinking. Hello? Didn't anyone else notice this? This is not divine, it is desperate. Because of that I found this book silly and 2-dimensional."},{"rating":"2","title":"A poignant discovery story.","review":"I loved this book simply because it dealt with Southern women, their lives and relationships. The fact that it was set in Louisiana furthered my enjoyment because I lived there for some time. However, more than this, I loved this book because it poignantly illustrates how we look to our families for so much perfection and are always let down when we don't find it. That relations are not about finding answers necessarily, but about learning to love and accept imperfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely great, witty and wicked.","review":"One of the best! It was a little confusing at first but hang with it. All of a sudden it was fantastic!. The story line was SO ORIGINAL. At times it made you so want to be a YA-YA and other times you were SO GRATEFUL you were not a YA-YA. Viva la Vivi!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too self-important","review":"it's all been done before - supposedly rule-breaking and wild but lovable women. they are certainly wild but hardly lovable. it is difficult to love a book with a heroine as hard to like as Vivi. even Sidda's dilemma has been done to death. and the way it was written seems to be cocky in a way, like it is expected of you to just simply love the book and characters. boring and unoriginal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring---Read Something Else","review":"I agree with Nicole Bonnell, who is halfway through the book and can't take it anymore. I'm in the same situation. A good book holds the reader's attention quickly; there should be some kind of narrative hook that draws you in. I have no idea what that hook is in this book. The flashback scenes to Vivi's childhood are incredibly boring. I read voraciously, and based on everyone's praise of this novel, was sure this book would make my top ten list of books I love. I can't believe it's actually on my very short list of books I despise. My suggestion is to save your money; don't buy the book, as I did. Borrow it from the library to see whether you like it first. If you are a discerning reader, you will notice the humor is not funny, and the characters are one-dimensional and unintriguing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing in form and substance.","review":"Contrived and shallow, with not one experience, emotion or pang left to the reader's imagination and intuition. I was simply bored by the tale of the Ya-Yas, and in particular by their totally unsurprising effect on the Siddalee character/caricature. I felt as though I'd read every vignette before, and probably told much better, elsewhere. Wells left no emotion unturned and un-flayed, and that actually made it an extremely tedious read for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous heartwrenching and thought provoking","review":"Our book club read this selection last month and the concensus was FABULOUS. Just about any person who had good buddies growing up will find similarities between themselves and at least one of the characters in this book. It is something just about anyone can relate to and Ms. Wells writes with a forthright style and imagination. This was a FUN book. Can't wait to read another of her books. Ta, Ta, all you Ya Ya's out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 'chick' book","review":"I loved the Yayas. Even though I grew up in neighboring Texas, I could hear and smell my childhood in the narrative. The book will not go down in history as a classic nor will it be taught in schools for years to come but you will want to by a copy for your best girlfriend. Like many of us, Siddalee learns to appreciate her mother as she matures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and trashy read","review":"Bluntly, I didn't like the author's style. To much prose and letters, not enough of the details that make a book a great book that stands out in a way to be called a good book. Oh well, maybe I just didn't like the character's looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and unbelievable","review":"Caveat: Everyone in my book club liked this book except me. I just didn't buy the characters at all. I got so annoyed I put it down half-way through. Contrived, sloppy, and the characters were pretty unappealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"perpectives from a daughter of an alcoholic","review":"This book nailed me. I stuck with it because a beloved friend told me it was wonderful. I realize, however, that I loved it for different reasons than she did. The portrayal of the emotional scars of growing up in a family with mental illness was very accurate.For any one with a history of alcoholism in their family: This book can be tough, it can trigger some unattractive memories, but it also can help you start down the path of forgiveness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope the movie was better than the book","review":"I heard all this hype about this book and was not impressed at all...I had a hard time picking it up to read it...I thought...It must be me! Or it's going to get better, BUT it didn't. I was hoping for a lot more than the book had to offer..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wells Captures the Essence of Southern Sisterhood","review":"So well does Ms. Wells understand the bonds formed in Southern childhood and the unique way that women have of creating family through rituals of blood and water. The first chapter reads as though it were a distant memory out of one's own past - full of hot lazy summers, girlish laughter, and tall pitchers of iced tea drunk on screened porches. At times bordering on the melodramatic, Divine Secrets is still entertaining, tear-jerking storytelling at its best-- something too many authors have forgotten. The most remarkable feat of this books is the ability of Ms. Wells to shift from Vivi's to Sidda's voice with a smooth as silk transition. Regardless of whether your mother is your best friend or someone you don't recognize on the street, you will recognize yourself and her in Divine Secrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the book -- can't wait for the movie!","review":"Enjoyable, funny, yet thought-provoking, \\"Divine Secrets...\\" was a welcome sequel to \\"Little Altars Everywhere\\". Everyone has known folks like these inhabitants of Garnet Parish, Louisiana -- the Ya-Ya's, their husbands, the Petites Ya-Ya's -- people with problems and frailities, but also with love, loyalty, and joie de vivre. Not only did I feel as if I knew them all intimately, I found myself wishing I had grown up in the South on a bayou! I was sorry to say good bye to Siddalee and the rest of them when the book was over, and I eagerly await future novels by Ms. Wells."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book hits home with every relationship a woman can have","review":"Rebecca Wells captures both the rapture and heartbreak that a woman can experience with her relationships between a mother and daughter, as well as a woman and her friends. The entire time I read the book, I yearned to join the Ya-Ya group for their next adventure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"After hearing (and reading) all the hoopla about this novel, I was very excited to finally get to read it. It started a bit slow for me and I really couldn't understand Sidda's problem and reasoning for \\"going away for a little while.\\" The high points were definitely all about the Ya-Ya antics, and I feel guilty that I couldn't appreciate the message about mothers and daughters until the last few chapters. However, I did enjoy this novel and I was kept interested until the very end. But I liked LITTLE ALTARS EVERYWHERE tons better. It's a lot darker and more sad, but it touched me deeper than DIVINE SECRETS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took me back to my childhood!","review":"Although I'm from the Northwest and only lived in the South for several years as an adult, I identified with this book. My mother and her friends had much the same lifestyles as the Ya-Yas, and we must have been quite the Petite Ya-Yas without ever knowing it! My office mates and other friends are passing this book around at a speedy rate, and although it's not everybody's favorite, it is near the top of the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful, yet confusing","review":"i loved almost every aspect of this book, and, being a twelve year old daughter, felt some of the tension between the mother and daughter. but what i cannot understand is why this is such an acclaimed mother-daughter novel. my mother opened to the second page which is (i believe) stuffed with curses and other language, and (it doesn't really bother her) asked me the question i'm asking. i don't need an answer, but i want to be a writer, and this is definitely an experience seeing a different writer write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty weak novel","review":"I was disappointed by this book. I'd just read \\"The Triumph and the Glory\\", which I thought I wouldn't like all that much because it was set during the Second World War and is supposed to be s guy book, but IT WAS SUPERB, it was just beautiful there at the end. I expected that I would like Ya Ya Sisterhood but it left me cold. Go figure . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply moving emotional thriller","review":"I have read many books, rarely does a story make me laugh and cry. As a woman I found the unique nature of the ya-ya's to be very intriging. I feel they learned how to survive tough times through love and compation for each other. This book also makes it very clear that we are all imperfect but still have the need to love and to be loved! Survival is a challenge for all of us. It's very refreshing to have a story that illustrates a womans special ability to nurture those whos lives are lucky enough to be touched by her heart. Thank you, Rosie O'Donnell for introducing Rebecca Wells and her 2 outstanding books on your show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complexity of family relationships","review":"This book portrays highly complex relationships between family and friends. There is a lot of humor, which breaks up the heaviness. However, it is a very serious book. Wells writes colofully, captures accents, and eccentric personalities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly captures Southern lifestyle!","review":"Growing up in Louisiana makes you appreciate this book, but I have given it to many out-of-town friends and they love it. It captures the true friendships that are born, nurtured and cherished for a lifetime by the women of the South!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype!","review":"Considering the amount of reverential press and copycat clubs this book inspired, I was less than impressed. The heroine was pretentious and unsympathetic and the Ya-Ya's were, to put it bluntly, annoying. I do not recommend this book unless you're someone who still swoons over or is somebody still in thrall of your high school's cheerleading squad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic, absolutely pathetic","review":"I read this book for my book club and I can honestly say it was one of the worst books I have ever read. I could not get past the poor writing enough to lose myself in the story. Did anyone edit this book? The writer should be happy that I do not work in publishing because I would have thrown the manuscript away. Well, to each her own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent writing-unrealistic storyReb","review":"Rebecca Wells is an excellent writer. I found the story very unrealistic. I had a lot of difficulty finding any sympathy for the ya-yas . They appeared immature and selfish throughout and try as I might I could not finish this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a women's classic!!!","review":"This is a classic women's novel, filled with heart, tragedy and friendship! The story examines not only how women can empower other women but also how we can take our parents for granted by seeing them merely in their role as parents and not as people with their own lives to live. A true joy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"a total lack of subtlety","review":"I loved the cover of The Divine Secrets of the Ya-ya Sisterhood. The text of the novel, however, was insulting to one's intelligence. Wells consistently feels a need to explain her character's witticisms and code words thus giving potentially humorous conversations all the levi of having a joke explained (e.g. we could have all figured out that \\"the Betty\\" is the yaya term fo the Betty Ford Center). Furthermore, the author often uses brand names of attire to develop hercharacters--please, portray your fictional creations with more finesse! Having just read Robert Penn Warren's All the Kings Men, I am sorry to see such a marked decline in the genre of southern fiction. Carson McCullers, William Faulkner, Tennessee Williams and the other greatsouthern writers would be appalled, I think, by this novel which is devoid of the evocative and subtle prose which made their work so timeless and so stirring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"The book was highly recommended by two people whose \\"book opinions\\" I respect. Enjoyed the read. Really felt the \\"sisterhood\\". Brought back memories of my younger years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not hard to put down","review":"I read the Ya Ya sisterhood for a book club. while I finished it and even found some of it entertaining, it was the the type of book that I just could'nt put down. I read before bed, and I had no trouble putting it down to go to sleep. The best part of reading this book, was when I was finished and found out how the others in my book club felt about it. Some were absoulutly enthralled by it while others found that it hit to close to home and stopped reading midway. I enjoyed some of it, but I would not recommend it to my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliched writing with cliched characters","review":"I spent $14 on this book because all my co-workers said it was the best book ever. WHAT??? I read half of it and couldn't go on. The characters, for one, are NOT even REMOTELY believable, and they are not even original streotypes. All this goddess stuff - PLEASE! And the language! \\"[His wife] was like a foreign country that he needed a passport to visit.\\" GAG! If the characters in the book think in language like this, it doesn't mean that the author has to write the whole book that way. DON'T FALL FOR THIS BOOK!

Even though I found there to be much sadness there was also much joy. For those who disliked the book, I can only guess that it might be to close to home for them or that they have never experienced any of the tragedies, failures or deep friendship these women shared and could not relate. I was moved by the way the authour wrote about ViVi's mental illness. Having read Wally Lamb's depressing \\"She's Come Undone\\", just prior to the Divine Secrets... it was a pleasure to ride the wonderful roller coaster of emotion to be found here in \\"The Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood\\". A must for every woman who is a daughter or has one!

How it ever got published in the first place I will never know."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blissful read","review":"I just picked this book up yesterday, and I read until two in the morning because I was so caught up in the story of Sidda and her mother and the ya-yas.This book focuses mainly on friendship and love, things that are essential to every human being. Reading this book makes me want a group of girlfriends just as tight and close as the ya-yas. Yet at the same time, this book makes me happy because no matter what happens to any character, everythings pulls out right and blissful.I love this book, and I definitely recommend it to anyone. Although it may seem light and airy at first, there's a core that this book centers around, which makes the overall feeling fulfilling. I know that sounds strange, but it's the only way I can describe it. Anyway, read this book, you'll love it. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very contrived and convoluted.","review":"A book supposedly showing the strength and tenacity of Southern women. Hard to relate to characters who were psychotic, self-absorbed, indulgent alcoholics who beat their children.

This book was not written to be \\"deep.\\" It was written to just skim the surface of these women's lives, and for the reader to come up with their own interpretations. I found this novel to be one of the best books I have ever read, and am recommending it to all my friends. A \\"Southern JOY LUCK CLUB!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Ya Ya","review":"This is one of those books that makes me long to return to my Southern roots.

Do yourself a favor and read the book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a Heartwarming Book","review":"This is a heartwarming book as it describes the differences between a mother and daughter. Daughter leaves home and mother pretends that she doesn't want much to do with her anymore. The book is quite funny, but sad at the same time. It's definitely a \\"chick book\\". I received it as a gift from my sister. I probably wouldn't have read it otherwise. I thought the story was good, the southern charm wonderful, and Sidda's fiance is a dream. A major difference is how this book is presented. The scrapbook of the Ya-Ya's is the common thread thoughout, and it is quite effective as a plot welder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divine Secrets of Th Ya Ya Sisterhood","review":"This is a wonderful book!

Oh what a diffence an outline makes! When Ms. Wells wrote this book, she no doubt had a clear outline of what she wanted to DO with it, what she wanted it to do, unlike when she wrote the mixed up, hot and cold, scatterbrained Little Altars Everywhere.These characters come to life, into your life and change you for the better. We all do the best we can in this life and hope for the best! Take part in the life of Sidda, Teensy, Caro, Necie, and Vivi dahlin. Forgive and comfort Vivi along with Sidda, love Sidda along with Vivi, tell Sidda to \\"marry him\\" along with everyone!I hope that Rebecca Wells will continue to mature as an author and organize her thoughts well when she writes, as she did when she wrote this very enjoyable book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please ! This is not the south !","review":"I half way enjoyed this book. I picked it up from the new book shelf in my library just after it hit the bookstores. And just as I thought, many, many readers believe it to be a portrayal of southern women. I have NEVER met anyone like these characters. And I don't think I live a sheltered life. In addition, I read about \\"Ya, Ya friendship groups\\" popping up all over the country. Many of these people were \\"discovering\\" friendships with women for the first time in their lives. How Sad ! To think this book about drunks, smoking fiends, and (as seen in Little Altars)child abusers, directed women to cherish the other women in their lives; and how bizarre to need a ritualistic club to do it in. Personally, I would rather have experienced more about Sidda's relationship with her boyfriend. He seemed really wonderful ! Who WAS that guy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A well woven Southern story","review":"This is a tale of womens relationships, daughters and mothers, sisters, girlfriends, and in the background, the men that weave their way in and out of the lives of these women. It is tragic and funny, aggravating and thoughtful. It deals with love and hate, acceptance and betrayal, and I really enjoyed it. Life in the South was so well woven, you can experience the heat, humidity, and the very fabric of the Ya-yas lives. This was definitely a 4 star read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Riveting Read","review":"Colourful characters who are easily able to be identified with, no matter where one is in the world.

When I was about half way through the book, I wondered why people thought it was so good. Sure, there are some great little stories about the women who call themselves the Ya-Yas, but I found most of them to be quite unbelievable. In addition, most of these stories seem to have no real connection, except that they were all experiences the Ya Yas had. I was not able to finish this books because I felt like I was running in circles... the book was going nowhere fast. I spoke to the librarian at the school where I teach, and she felt the exact same way. My advice? Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest piece of dreck I've ever read","review":"NO STARS!!! Someone owes ME a star for reading this book. Who is responsible for publishing this? The nicest thing I can say about it is that I found no spelling errors. The only explanation I can come up with to explain the popularity of \\"Ya-Ya\\" is that readers are blissfully oblivious to how much of their own emotion they are projecting onto (or into?) this microscopically thin story. I wish I could sue someone to get the time back I wasted reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yucko-Yucho","review":"I found this book and its characters annoying.

The book was so self-serving about boring, self-indulgent, contrived characters...especially the boyfriend...yeah right, he was a cardboard cut-out..and the scenes of Lake Quinalt...please..it was so unreal. I really skipped many pages out of boredom...and that I really didn't care about these women at all! This whole book was like a comic strip with no depth.

Just because this book has a catchy cover and title doesn't mean it's worth reading. The writing is truly awful, with just a hint of what could have been thrown in. Maybe the first page was well written, but that must have been the one the author spent the most time on. And the ending! How long does it take an author to wrap things up? In Wells' case, far too long. Perhaps a better editor would have helped. For fine southern fiction, I suggest Flannery O'Connor, for starters. There are good books out there (book clubs, are you listening?) but this isn't one of them. When I was done I kicked myself for the few days I couldn't get back...

I wanted to be a Ya Ya and wished I had a group of friends as connected as the Ya Yas. It's true they aren't perfect and they have issues but so do most people. I have been searching for a book that would entertain me as much as this one has but I am consistently disappointed.

I really enjoyed this story, but did feel that Sidda's part of it was a little shallow. I recommended this book to my mom, and aunts and grandmother and they really enjoyed it and took to it. However, after I read Little Altars, I warned them not to read Little Altars, they would've been too disappointed. So much was left out of the second book i.e. the molesting, etc. It was very disappointing to discover that it wasn't what I thought it was at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for me to poop on","review":"This book was really awful.

Don't waste your time on such tomfoolary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN.....zzzzzz","review":"I was so bored with this book that I read only half of it. This would be a good book for relatives of the author, but as an outsider, I just ended up not caring about her mother's scrapbook, or any of the characters. I think I felt this was because it seemed TOO personal a read and I didn't feel a part of it in anyway, therefore, not caring about the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run away","review":"This is one of the few books that I haven't finished. I couldn't go beyond page 90 because I found it extremely dull and annoying by the superficiality of the lives of the characters. The insipid characters weren't making me care about them or the story line. Or wait, there wasn't a plot up to where I left it. Just remembering the past full of too ideal childhood memories of the ya-yas and the daughter Sidda sugar coating the neglect of the ya-yas towards the petit ya-yas. Perhaps I just couldn't get into the lives of women who just seem bent on having fun and doing absolutely nothing worthwhile with their lives. I wish I didn't sound so harsh but I have to vent when I pick up a book expecting it to be good and couldn't even finish it. I don't like leaving books unread. I have given it one more star than I wanted to because it could have gotten better if I had given it more of a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divine!","review":"I loved this book and the pre-quel, Little Altars.

It literally shoots off the track at a very high speed. Could really hurt someone. Finally got it to go around without flying off. And then, after 15 or so mins, nothing. Just stopped working. My dad is an electrician, so he tried fixing it, but no luck. It's absolute garbage!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the race track","review":"This is a great toy!!!

My 5 year old is a huge Cars fan and received this for Christmas. After minimal set up he was off and running and then came to a screaching halt. It worked for exactly 3 laps around the track and then stopped working. The booster made an odd noise and no longer launced cars. My husband took it apart and then it worked for another 2-3 laps. Just long enough to figure out the flexible poorly constructed track can not support the force of the cars without the connections coming apart.

I bought this for my grandson for Christmas. He was thrilled with the toy. We put new batteries in it, the thing ran for maybe 15 minutes and has never worked since. We put new batteries in twice and still nothing. Also, its a racing set and yet you would not be able to have a \\"race\\" since only one car is included in the set. I'm disappointed Disney would put their name on something so worthless. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely meets expectations","review":"Our 3-year-old son is enjoying his track set. I can understand why it is recommended for 5 years and older. It has an element where you have to push a lever to change tracks when a crash car comes out. You can turn this function off though and it is just as fun. It was very simple to put together. It' just REALLY big so it's hard to find a place for it other than the living room floor. Overall, it definitely satisfied expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"We bought this for our son for Christmas and it too, stopped working after about an hour of play.

What a piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enormous disappointment","review":"Nothing new to add except that our track crapped out after 5 minutes, too. It was 5 minutes of fun, though. I am crossing my fingers that Mattel might release a 'fix' of some kind for the motor.

It's set up right next to the now extinct Cars track.Make this right, Mattel and Disney Pixar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pixar track","review":"We got this race track for my son for Christmas. He was so excited. We set it up and I could tell right away that is was not durable. The track ran for about 20 minutes before the engine blew out.

Definatly not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!","review":"My son's got this race track for Christmas - it was the only thing they asked for. I am so dissapointed with this item. First of all, the track is very cheaply made. It seems to fall apart if you just walk by it. We have not had the problem of it not working, like others, but it is so LOUD that they hardly want to use it. It seems like only one car can use it at a time or they start running into each other.I really expected more out of this race track for the price. I was very disappointed in all of the cars items we purchased this year. It just doesn't seem to be very entertaining to my kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booster quit","review":"I also purchased this track for my daughter for Christmas.

The installation of the program is the only thing that has not given me problems. Though the program has many excellant features, getting them to work properly has been an exercise in patience. Even after getting the upgrades to V7.3 the program still constantly crashes or changes the spacing/formatting of the document I am working on. Text is dropped out of description cards with out me knowing it, spaces and/or lines are inserted at the end of description cards for no reason, and I could go on. This software has the potential to be a great program, but in my opinion it is not quite ready for prime time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than nothing but not by much.","review":"The program does not allow you to easily reuse previously entered data.

So you must enter your employment history over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than nothing but not by much.","review":"The program asks for the same information over and over. Each time you change the resume format it ask for you employment history and education. This information is usually the same. The program should give you the option of reuse of previously entered information. Other users also mentioned a version 7.3. Yet when I called customer support and asked where to get the upgrade they either had no idea or said the program would automatically update during registration. Well the program does not self upgrade and the current 7.0 version has problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't use the resume's you create!","review":"The video and instruction is good, but you cannot print any ofthe resume's you create.

I'm wanting to do Waldorf-style wet-on-wet watercolor with my daughter. I think I either needed to buy a kit from a Waldorf source such as Oak Meadow (which would have been about a third cheaper, because it wouldn't have included things I didn't need, such as the easel and most of the tubes of color), or else I just needed to go to the local craft store and buy a pad of watercolor paper, a couple of 3/4\\" brushes, and the $1 kit that has 5 tiny tubes of color, just to get started (which would have been about two-thirds cheaper than this kit).Oh well, live and learn, and I do think this is a good set for a serious beginner, though one with a carrying case would probably be a bit better still."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbalanced attack","review":"I have never been more disappointed in a book (other than made up tabloid bios).

This book gave me a feeling of hope, love and laughter, and definitely a different approach to being romantic. This slim book packs more detailed ideas for romance than a lot of books with far more pages, and reads like a romanctic adventure in some parts. There are also portions where the author's personal references are funny and sweet, often giving the book a feel of a mini bio.

I am a sophomore psychology major, and this book is absolutely awesome. It's preparing me ahead of time for what I need to know for getting into graduate school in the future. What I liked best about the book is 1) the APA is sensitive to issues of special groups of students, such as students with disabilities, ethnic and racial minorities, and women. Since I happen to be both of the latter, I found this information grealy appreciated and helpful. 2) the APA doesn't assume that all readers are going into doctoral programs and includes advice for students going into master's programs, highlighting both the positives and negatives of going to both kinds of programs. It also provides a detailed timeline for applying to both kinds of prgrams. Awesome book; I'd recommend it to any psychology student (or one in a related field) interested in going into graduate school in any field of psychology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to use for a guide","review":"This book has helped me immensely with my search for a grad school.

I found this book to be useful in defining my personal goals, identifying my own strengths and skill sets, and creating a carefully thought-out template for my applications to Clinical Psychology PhD programs. As a \\"non-traditional student\\" with a master's degree in psychology already under my belt, I was surprised by just how much I needed to read this book before preparing my applications.

It is near impossible to launch the cars, and when it finally does launch, it can't even make it half way around the track. The pterdactyl is a wind up toy that lasts maybe 15 seconds, but you can send it flying by pushing a button. And it flys right into the launching mechanism, not into the other cars. I expected a better quality product from Hot Wheels for that kind of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard to Launch for 5 year old","review":"Putting the toy together was fine. The appearance of the toy is exciting. Playing with the toy is a disappointment!My 5 year old wants to watch the cars go around instead of concentrating on his timing with the launch mechanism. And, he'd like to see the car go round more than 3 - 6 times before it goes flying off the track, launching the \\"terrordactyl.\\" Plus, there's no way to set the toy for such continuous play.We have several matchbox car toys and love them (partiularly Ice Mountain); this is our first Hot Wheels set. Perhaps he'd like it if he were older or only had the expectation of being a spectator watching adults play with the toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad, bad, bad mattel","review":"I agree with the other reviewer. This is a product that the staff at Mattel should be embarrased of. The launching system is a disaster, my guess is that they tried to reuse it from another failed product.

It broke the first day. It's going back. Kids really don't like getting presents that they get to play with for one day.The website is no help.

He always knew there was something wrong with sacrificing and suffering so much in order to put the Revolution first. He realized that without putting one's family first, nothing is worthwhile. This true story is a perfect example of how love wins over darkness. It really was Lorenzo's love for his family that helped him to do the daring and dangerous things he did. I think I learned more about Cuba and its people than I ever did in any history class and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the island that seems to mystify the average US citizen (or, at least, me)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introductory guide","review":"This is a good guide for anyone who is interested in how the Roman army functioned and how it changed over time.

You don't even need to be a Ridge Racer Type 4 fan to love the music. An interesting refreshing mix of Japanese house, acid jazz, dance, techno, and a touch of lounge beats make a tasty smoothy. Every track is made for a specific reason, with loud, fast paced, hectic funkified beats, and cool, calm, yet invigorating tracks for certain parts of the game. Everything has a feel to it, and the music never seems awkward or out of place. The music will motivate you to drive REALLY fast any day. Don't listen to the music if you're planning to drive to the store sometime soon! Namco is known for composing high energy tracks, especially for their Ridge Racer series (where the music REALLY started getting better after Rage Racer).

I believe that the first game that really raised the bar and made Ridge Racer music worth owning is this CD right here, the soundtrack for Ridge Racer Type 4. R4 is probably the most popular soundtrack of the whole Ridge Racer series... And for good reason. R4 makes great use of drum n bass and jazz influences in the songs. This makes a very relaxing yet charged listening experience. The synths and styles used are very nostalgic to gaming in the 90s. If you're in the USA, then this soundtrack fetches an arm and a leg... But collectors and hardcore fans will want to put this album towards the top of their list for Namco soundtracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, quick and easy way to hang large pictures or framed posters","review":"If you have a large picture/poster frame to hang, use no other system.

The stop for the stopper in a thin piece of plastic. When I contacted the company they said it is not a warranty issue because it is usually due to over tightening. Well I tightened it the same every time, it just seems the plastic stop gets brittle with age and then breaks AND falls into the bottle of wine. They want $18 per for repair of each stopper and return shipment, which is not bad, but if it happens again and again?

At first I found the movie disturbing (and my wife almost had me turn it off), but about a third into it the tone and pace changed, and it turned out to be one of the most heartwarming films I have seen in ages. I still hear that little song dance in my head, simple and infective. A great film that I still think about from time to time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"How this movie has the high average rating it has makes absolutely no sense. It looks so promising in the trailer, but what a let down. Sloooooow, poorly written, stiffly acted, and not a whiff of wit to it. Just awful. Takeshi Kitano has a cult following among fans of Japanese gangster films, and I can picture him in that role. But a previous comedian? That's harder to swallow. After watching this mish mash, I understand why he left comedy. Considering how much of the film focuses solely on Kikujiro (Kitano) and the young boy, one would expect to feel a sense of affection between them by the film's end. One would be wrong. Rather, the two characters remain flat, and the dragging hours involve weirdly violent incidents, awkward attempts at comedy, and shameless, fruitless attempts at pulling the viewer's heartstrings. A disappointment all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Work","review":"I have seen Brother, which included Takeshi Kitano, and I loved him in that film. But after renting this movie from Blockbuster, I will definitely buy it to have as part of my Japanese movie collection.Takeshi (Kikujiro) played a brilliant role as a man of all sorts of emotions and actions which made me feel bad for him at times, and for others in different moments. The connection between him and the little boy (Masao) was very real and touching. The plot, though at times a little slow, was still cute and sentimental. The music, the acting, the story, the whole package was amazing when I decided to see it for the first and third time. I suggest this film to any person who enjoys a nice story without minding the subtitles. My little brother who hates subtitles also fell in love with the film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yakusa undone","review":"Those of you who are used to Takeshi Kitano movies may be in for a surprise with this one. The first time I watched this movie I was engulfed in a waterfall of emotions from falling off my couch comedy to eye watering sadness. This movie gives the audience a diffrent look at Japans infamous Yakusa. We can come to understand the circumstance that may lead a child to grow up and become a member of the Yakusa. With out giving away the movie I ask you all to pay careful attention to the similarities between the two main characters in this movie as this may clue you in to the deeper meaning of this movie. A must see...absolutely wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Kitano's usual, but it's worth it.","review":"This is not what most Takeshi Kitano fans expect from him.

Hard to believe that such a film was made by director known in the states for more \\"hard-hitting\\" action films.

Not everyone's cup of tea but they should at least take a sip!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nothing but heart","review":"this has got 2 be 1 of kitanos most funniest films. it mixes dark comedy to light hearted scenes that would make anyone smile. not to mention kitano had me laughing the whole way through. be advised though, theres a scene where an old man tries 2 take advantage of the little boy by trying to take off his underwear, but kitano saves the day just in time. other then that, very very enjoyable close to masterpiece film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Franco fans will love this.","review":"Typical Fanco film - castles, chained women, mad doctors, ghosts, lots of atmospheric photography.

The show's production (lighting and smoke) were not modified to suit filming, resulting in a difficult-to-watch picture. They also had excessive bass for the first half of the disc - a near-consistent very low tone permeated the hour of the disc I could tolerate. I like bassy recordings, but this just made my ears hurt. Knowing what I know now, I'd not have purchased this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's only a commercial for the show","review":"I love the Cirque du Soleil - I enjoy their Allegria DVD, and especially the Varekai DVD. The cinematography was superb - the acts are all shown.Corteo was a new one - came to Chicago but I couldn't go, so I bought the DVD.DISAPPOINTING!It was a commecial for Corteo, not a video of the Cirque's performances in Corteo. Almost 1/2 the disc consisted of 'audience reaction' - not a single Cirque act was shown.If I buy any more, they will be year 2003 or before"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was hugely disappointed with this. I saw Corteo early on, and I thought it was amazing. I was really excited to see it again on DVD, but right when it started something felt wrong. When I had seen it live, it created a very touching and beautiful mood with the performances, music, and costumes. Now, everything was being awkwardly narrated. The concept of the show was just bluntly explained right at the beginning. It made me cringe a little. The music had all been changed. Where before it felt like you were inside of this mans melancholic dream, it now felt wacky and silly. When, \\"these kids are jumping on their parents bed\\" was narrated, followed by a relentless slide whistle, I just couldn't take it too seriously anymore.It feels like it was seriously dumbed down for a wider audience. Makes me very sad. Two stars because the performances themselves are of course still amazing. It's just the show as a whole that's been ruined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good show, bad video","review":"I had the opportunity to see Corteo on tour, and enjoyed it immensely. The latter cannot be said for the DVD of the production. Apaprently the camera crew was unable to deal with the \\"two-faced\\" stage of Corteo - about one third of the time, the performers are facing AWAY from the camera, and you, the viewer, will be looking at the backs of the performers far more often than you would have if you were just sitting in the chapiteau.The bonus features are worth a look, so perhaps renting this DVD rather than buying it is the preferable option.

And it benefits from the excellent Sprint 1xRTT data network.But the i600 suffers from the restrictions brought about by using the operating system that is built into it (Windows Mobile Smartphone). The user interface is horrible and requires way too many key presses to do anything. The i600 doesn't support T9 predictive text, there isn't a built-in camera, no Bluetooth and no WiFi.

The kids love to hear the stories and have told me that it makes \\"Father's readings more interesting!\\" The activities are very relevant and complement the readings very well.The only problem I've had, is that a couple of the readings were too condensed and left out some key details. Therefore, it took a little more effort and time to explain them, and they left the kids a bit confused. But, with careful research and comparison from the readings at Mass, I've been able to clarify any uncertainty.I highly recommend this book to catechists working at the elementary levels!

He tells it likes he sees it and I appreciate that in a writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and Erudite","review":"I was happy to find McCall's latest book, having thoroughly enjoyed--and learned a lot from--Makes Me Wanna Holler. It's evident from his writing that he has thought long and hard about these issues.On a few occasions, I disagreed with his analysis. For example, the woman on the elevator could just as easily have been apprehensive because he was an unknown man, rather than specifically an unknown black man. Gender can be just as powerful an issue as race in today's society. Or perhaps he was simply projecting his own impression on to her, and she wasn't concerned at all.Still, McCall brings important issues to light, and his combination of experience and research brings powerful support to many of his arguments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!!!!!!!","review":"First, I'd like to say that I don't have alot of time to read many books but this was one book I couldn't put down. The main character was really someone who I could relate with. The way this book reads it could've been someone I know. I enjoyed it.(Essence magazine Booklist)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth could not have been told better","review":"In this book, Nathan McCall does not hesitate to tell the truth, which is something that many of today's writers fail to do. Considering that McCall is speaking from personal experiences, it makes the points raised in the book much more valid. For those that have been asleep or even those that have not, this book is a definite wake up call. To understand the current situation that blacks are in, one has to start with the foundation and get a clear analysis of the good and bad, which is something that McCall helps the reader do in this book. Not only is the author bringing forth points that we already know are true, he is linking them with commonplace experiences which makes his observations even more effective. The only qualm that I have about this book is the length. I got so caught up in reading it that I had finished before I realized it. Don't wait, read this one as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"C- From a white guy","review":"McCall has a lot of perspective on racial issues. So much perspective, in fact that he understands how both whites AND blacks view each other. Whites think blacks are stupid, whites don't want to live around blacks (integration is just a pretense for giving blacks the boot)You'll get the basic idea after a couple chapters. There's no need to think for yourself when you've got someone as brilliant as McCall telling you how you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Essence One","review":"I found this product gave me the same benefits in a 1 per day as what I was getting w/a previous product that required 3 per day.

It is a slow story at the beginning and then comes up to speed about halfway through the book. Near the end is when I really got hooked on to the book and it started to get me thinking about what I had read. The reason that I enjoyed this book is simple, it let me find out what had happened in the prvious books. This is the first book of the series that I had read and it was easy to find out what had happened in the previous books. It gave information on what the past had been like for the characters and how different their worlds had been while growing up.

I am not sure if this was part of the fiction but I was delighted to read that Halide dumped the Mathematician loser who was making plans to take on a second wife and married Mr.Adivar quickly after.

All of the characters and settings required for a great story are here, but the narritive left me wanting more.

This book fails as a drama because I didn't care aboout any of the characters as they held no special interest for me because they were so one-dimentional and Halide never realizes her \\"gift\\".

I have ordered them. Of all those books, this one was the least helpful. It does list a whole lot of things to do \\"now that you're 50.\\" But there's nothing innovative or inspiring that you can't think of, yourself. It lists things anyone can do at any age. Many of those things involve having lots of money to invest. The title should read, \\"Things To Do Now that You're a Millionaire.\\" The pages are thick and glossy. Maybe to catch your drool, if you are drooling at 50. There is one, maybe two, suggestions per page. I guess I was looking for something with a little more humor. For such an unimaginative book, it takes itself way too seriously. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Silly Book","review":"This is a fluffy silly book. It reads like Sex in The City with Vampires. Yes it also resembles the unwed series by Mary Janice Davidson. I love this kind of story so that does not bother me. It is a great read while I wait for the next MJD unwed book.This book is easy to read. I cleared through 200 pages in one day. Very unlike me. It keeps my attention. The mother is actually my favorite character. She reminds me of my own mom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"I found this story so-so. The characters and plot were bland.

Give me a story with likeable characters that are interesting ~ not so one-dimensional. Definitely not reading the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries to hard to be Davidson","review":"An inferior rip off of Mary Janice Davidson's Wed books.

I was looking for a change but saw this book and thought...OK...one more. Now, I'm on the 3rd and almost through and ready to go on to the next one. I'm not a big fan of books that take paragraphs to describe a building or scenery and was rewarded with none of that in this book. Yes, there's descriptions but not lengthy ones that make you nod off. I enjoyed the premise of the book (a vampire dating service) as well as the writer's sense of humor. The main character, Lil, is a fashion diva worthy of Sex and the City (she even transforms into a pink bat). She's likeable and funny. I would recommend this series highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"What can I say?\\"","review":"The title for this review is my primary reason for hating this novel. It's only the dread of reading those four words yet again that has stopped me from going back through the book and counting the extraordinary number of times this phrase was used. It's not witty catch phrase, nor is it quirky, it's just very lazy writing. Ditto the unnecessary descriptions of garments with 'aspirational' labels - product placement in movies is one thing, but this was just boring to read, and smelled suspiciously of author hoping to cash in. The majority of characters were thinly devised and one dimensional. But the worst part of this book is that there are flashes of really good work, but it seems the rush to push out product (no doubt to top up the handbag fund) resulted in a poorly finished job.MJD's Undead series is light, funny froth. This isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing \\"Betsy\\" Knock-Off","review":"Raye writes like she's trying to sound like MJ Davidson's main character Betsy Taylor (Undead and Unwed, et al.). I found this a very weak story with not-terribly-interesting characters. It's Sex and the City with vamps, and both Candace Bushnell and MaryJanice Davidson produced better writing and characters than Kimberly Raye has with this book.However, I have not given up, and will cautiously read Raye's next installment in this series. I hope that she will grow into herself and her characters, and not try to be someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't Recommend It","review":"I just finished this book and in comparison to the other vamp, demon, magical romance books that I have recently read by (Kenner, Hallaway, and Swenson) this book pales in comparison.

ECM has gotten pretty complacent these days and this album has its' share of mellow moments, but, all in all it is some wonderful composing and playing!!!Lovano and Scofield both sound fantastic. The SOUND of Sco's guitar is awesome. Johnson and Elias work great together. Joey Baron's drumming is also very tasteful. I love the Bass Desires albums from years ago and have been wanting Marc Johnson to put out another solo effort on ECM. I have no complaints!!!

For this reivew, I want to give you a poetic expression of the atmosphere and temperment of this music:A cool September night in lower New Hampshire,The forrest is clear and quietLeaves are chattering about the day;The nightbird nestles in the tree singing his songThe water provides a soft pace for the sing-a-long;The moonlight masks itself across the vast scape...of the calm and uncovered night.A door is open in the distance,The wood and the wind sing a song so soft and gay;.......twinged with Shades of Jade.In short, great music to reflect on. In the Miles Davis tradition, there are no liner notes. Everything that needs to be understood is in the music.

I found that the connection and data rate are solid and reliable even over longer, noisier links operating at reduced speeds.For example, I can get steady 80Mb/s rates from my router room to my family room but have never seen better than about 20Mb/sec from router room to kitchen. I bought two of these adapters and enjoyed so much improvement over WiFi-G that I bought two more to link to the other household sites needing Internet access. The primary advantage is reliable linkage; my Wifi could link up OK but it tended to drop connections and reconect every few minutes (when the microwave fires up, etc), creating headaches for anything more demanding than simple web browsing (like file transfers, etc). \\"Reliable\\" and \\"stable\\" wins out over \\"fast,\\" in my view.Highly recommended for noisy homes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great with TiVo","review":"I've had three of these for about two years now.

Wireless does not make it more than a room away in my rebar-filled 1950's-era home, and it would have cost me (conservative estimate) ten times as much to have electricians wire my whole home.

And it is. For some people, it will work very very well. For others (like me), it won't work at all.The reason is that the two adaptors need to be on the same circuit, else you will see very poor (or zero) performance. This piece of critical information is conveniently omitted in NetGear's product description.In many houses, the chances of two rooms at opposite ends of the house being on the same circuit are pretty slim. This was how it was in my case - I had a specific need: to connect a PC in my living room to my router in the study at the far end of the house. Wall outlets on different circuits, therefore no joy.Like I said, this product might work extremely well for you - I know people who have these adaptors and love them - but be aware that it's just as likely it won't work at all.Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivers as promised","review":"Product works as promised.

It had good features such as ability to create a secure and unsecure partition.But all its features are useless when the design of the product is flawed. As noted by others, the metal casing connects to a plastic (right around the USB connection). That can break no matter how careful you are. When you pull the drive out of a USB port, you are applying pressure to this plastic part and it's guaranteed to break at some point unless you're 100% careful all the time.

Music with disortion.b. video: like a VHS copy. Faces are often difficult to recognize; some drop-outs too.c. less important: scene selection: 8; no subtitles, no extra's.It's not a restored and/or a remastered film; in my opinion the manufacturer copied a VHS tape.A pal bought this DVD also, the same results, and he is disappointed too.

She must leave Fredrick March and seemingly go back broken hearted because of her feelings for him. Nothing could stop this sad ending. However when the moment comes that she is to return to the tree, she is able to stay and she said the words that have been with me since I was seven years old, \\"There is no power stronger than Love\\", Her acting ability and her humorus character were excellent.

When you get bored of romancing around the house and building your skills, you can take time out from your life to run a business.A word about CC: I download A LOT of custom content from modthesims2 and other common places. This EP seems to work with all of my stuff and doesn't blow up my game.

It is so nice to be able to leave for work and actually see what your Sim is doing with their days. I have yet to experience any of the bugs that have been talked about here, but the one thing I found that I do not like is that, like in the other expansion packs, when you come back from downtown, it is the same time as when you left. So, if you go to your business at 9 a.m. and stay downtown working until 9 p.m., you are obviously exhausted, hungry, smelly......but when you get back home, it is still only 9 a.m. and your day is shot to hell.

Other than that, this game has no other bugs that I have run into (so far.) I'm so glad I bought this part of sims 2! This is a great game and a must buy for experienced sims players.

For example, wife stays home and husband goes off to work at his business at 7am. Husband works all day and comes home - and it's still 7am!

You can sell things, make things, give makeovers, or just provide any environment that is so nice that people want to stay there (gym, lounge, what have you).

I hate leaveing at 9 in the morning for your store and then coming home at 6 and its 9 still at home. I hope the patch come soon cuz these bugs suck. I am very upset that there are not hardly any new items. For the price of the game we should have gotten alot more. It is also very hard to run a business. It is a ok game but needed more work done on it. It realy is not much it is not realy worth that much money. I know I may of not of bought it if I knew there was just this in new stuff.

Good luck and have fun if you do buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible!","review":"This is such a let down! It's nearly impossible to play. For one thing, you can accidently ruin the lives of other Sims by hiring them to work for you. How do teenagers go to work and to school? How do adults keep their 'real' jobs? They don't, and the adults show up as unemployed if they're staff and don't get paychecks or get called to work when you play their lot. Also, if you have this game without other expansions, it overrides the basic Sims2 wants for your sims, and you end up with business-focused sims (from child to adult, and regardless of their aspiration)which is really annoying. All the expansions have this annoying tendancy though, so if you have them all it balances out.

Overall a waste of money. If you can figure it out, you can have businesses downtown, but you would need a good computer just to load it every day that you go to work. Honestly its like have a job, except you have to so much work, that you forget to let your sims live, and you lose a ton of money.

I highly recommend this product for serious minded movie lovers and videofiles.The Realta Reon VX-50 HQV Processing does a great job of maximizing the potential of standard dvds in both picture and sound quality. My favorite feature about this unit is that once it is calibrated to my desired taste and liking, it seems to bring out the best of all the movies no matter how poorly the film to video transfer was made.

I bought the authorized one first & it was all broken, video scrambled & cassette jumbled, tried to return for a better one, none available.

And for those whose primary concern is her looks, there is next to no footage of her above the age of 11. The makers of this video seem to have been only interested in getting something--anything--they could put Britney's name on. So we get interviews with people who knew her growning up. Take a look at the picture on the cover. That's the closest this comes to any representation on Britney and it's the best you'll see on this DVD, by far. So just photocopy the cover if you must."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S NOT OFFICIAL!","review":"This isn't very good! FIrst off, it's not even official!

Instead of doing that all the people in her small town talked about how they used to have doll parties, and how she threw her retainer in her teacher's hand! It basically didn't say anyhting about her now~a~days it only talked about her when she was younger. I know that i wanted to know what shes doing next and if she has a new album comming out, instead i sat there and listen to her old hair dresser say \\"oh i used to cut her hair!\\" So i do not reccamnd anyone to buy this it is a waist of $$$$MONEY$$$$$$$$$$$$."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO not waste your money on the DVD, if any buy the VHS","review":"Don't waste your money on the DVD. Heck, even the VHS unless you really want to see this. There is no Britney, just little parts they show her on a stage but it is faded and no sound. The whole video is the video people interviewing people from Britney's home town Kentwood, LA. Very boring! Although it is nice to hear what they have to say, but its not worth it - especially since Britney is not in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music !!!","review":"This is an excellent album from start to finish featuring 2 great saxaphone players Branford Marsalis and Michael Brecker. Highly Recommend!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"This movie is a fantastic look into what manipulation terosists groups put on their people to brain wash them to kill. In this movie the Tamil Tiger,, regime, put their women to the test and recruit them to kill an Indian political member, by blowing herself up.The main character in the story comes across many people on her journey which change her views towards other people and starts to love others and herself like she never once knew.All of which most of these people die.Its a fantastic movie i wish everyone could watch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Malli's final decision not worth all that navel gazing","review":"The film is sure darn nice to look at but it couldn't prevent all the introspection from grating on me after awhile. The film also lacks any hint of subtlety as the plot steamrolls through one complication after another, all designed to give Malli even more to mull over. Perhaps I'm being too harsh. Maybe the film would resonate with me more if I had a brother who had been the victim of a political assasination. But I don't. Or maybe if I could imagine just one benefit of martyrdom. But I can't. About the only thing I did notice, and this was very early on, was that the payoff for all this agonizing introspection will clearly come at the end of the film when we witness Malli's final decision. Although I genuinely wanted to know Malli's ultimate choice, I felt I was forced to wait too long and sit through too much melodrama for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"DESTROY OR CREATE=TO BE OR NOT TO BE","review":"The major attraction of this film for THE MAN WITH THE KINOAPPARAT is the sound design. Any serious sound guys out there, you need to read this book as a text book.The person who picked this particular film up for distribution in the US is an amazingly familiar name to those serious film these people; John Malkovich!Well, I did not expect you to know this but it is the truth! At the initial screening at NUART theatre, the tie and suit guys fled so fast that one could easily gage the ultimate uniqueness of the film just by looking at the speed of these guys!It is a fascinating journey into the shady area where ethics and higher ideals clash/where animal nature and intellect clash, depends on the way you would like to phrase it!Filmmaking, artistry and authenticity at its best! I watched it breathless knowing that it would not get a national theatrical release. It was that good. Don't hesitate, go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another romp through Willa's world","review":"If only this review can stay attached to the book it's intended for. I've written others that were placed under the wrong title, requested a change and did not receive it. Alas. Hidden Agenda is very similar to the other Willa Jannsen books, and if you enjoyed the first two, you will like this one as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning and bittersweet.","review":"Above all, besides being incredibly beautiful eye-candy, \\"Casshern\\" is a deeply spiritual film. It is a meditation on human nature, innocence, war and the origins of evil. It cuts right to the heart of what really matters in life and what truly lies in the deepest soul of each person. I was enthralled for most of the film, disgusted at some of it, and in tears during the final scenes. The contrast between the remembered happiness of simpler times and the twisted anger and hatred evinced throughout the rest of the movie was striking and heart-wrenching, especially in the implication that it is that simple love and joy that truly lasts in eternity, rendering the endless war and greed and cruelty on earth ultimately meaningless. I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casshern - The film you've been missing.","review":"An Epic Masterpiece. Full of comic-book color and wonderfully vivid fight scenes. This movie screams originality and even has the feel of Final Fanstasy seven. The only thing that may slow your feelings down is the fact that this movie is rather long. But, at the end, it's really worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"It's boring and preachy. There is one great action scene, but the (very) few others are so poorly cut it is difficult to tell what is even going on. There are some little treats for people who appreciate Japanese animation, but even then it is hard to tell if they meant homage or just cliche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Casshern - An Odd Film In All Respects","review":"I don't know if you can really understand this type of movie unless you are Japanese. I usually love foreign flicks and I didn't mind the fact that this film was in subtitles. However, it was just odd. The fight scenes were cheap and had little depth. Some of the imagery was OK but so much of it as computer-generated that it looked cheap. It even ventured into the horror genre a bit with pools of body parts soaked in red fluid and some \\"undead\\" types.Overall, I am having a hard time believe I paid to see this movie. It was a one of those movies where you are thinking - OK, its about to get good and then the moment never comes. Don't waste your money here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously...the trailer was better than the film.","review":"Ok. There are a few things I learned from buying and watching this movie. One, don't ever buy a movie simply based on the trailer. Two, Japanese people are apparently bad at acting, writing, and computer graphics. Three, this movie is at the very bottom of the list and I'm trying really hard to find a reason why it's not worst than Van Helsing or Cat Woman(Making it the all-time worst movie ever made)."},{"rating":"2","title":"CASSHERN","review":"I GIVE THIS DVD A 4 OUT OF 5 STARS, 5 BEING BEST.SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE GREAT, GOOD STORY LINE WISHED IT WAS DUBBED IN ENGLISH WOULD HAVE MADE IT BETTER FOR VIEWING.YOU MISS TO MUCH OF THE MOVIE WHEN YOU HAVE TO READ SUBTTLES."},{"rating":"1","title":"SIGH","review":"I watched (Casshan:Robot Hunter) as a little kid when it came on the scifi channel and it was an awesome anime but this live action movie named Casshern just stinks because it's nothing like the anime.There is very little action and the story is a mess..."},{"rating":"1","title":"US version is edited severely","review":"Visually amazing but this version is severely truncated. 80 minutes? Just unacceptable for something like this.Seek out the Asian versions for the full experience -- I'm sure there is a cheap Hong Kong version of the DVD out there as well as the various higher priced Japanese DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"I purchased this version hoping to see some of the special features with English subs. I have not yet watched the dvd, but I was pretty unhappy when I found that the movie was just 117 minutes long, when the original was 141 minutes long. I don't see how they can take a pretty much perfect movie and mutilate it like that. Don't waste your money on this, find the original version and just live without the special features."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun, but Deep, Film","review":"I was one of the people who saw the action-riddled trailer and expected this to be fighting up the bum, but I was pleasantly mistaken. From the very beginning this film gripped me with its emotional scene design and story, up until the point where I genuinely felt compassion for all those involved. Sure, the special effects were corny, but I knew that going into the film and it didn't take away any of the excitement this movie has in store. If you like superheroes, dystopian storylines, and don't mind B-movie effects, give it a watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are so much better Japanese movies...","review":"Like so many films today, this is one whose premise is much better than the actual film. The trailer shows you all you really need to see. Yes, it is impressive to see a bunch of random body parts suddenly coming together to form Frankenstein-like (although seamlessly put together) mutants and it is nice seeing the title character kick the crap out of a bunch of robots but the painfully slow pace of meaningless plot between these great scenes are punishing. It could do with a round of editing, reducing the length of each scene which might turn it into something worth sitting through. As for the mix of animation and live-action, it just doesn't work. It looks like when Mary Poppins and all jumped into the sea and danced with the animated fish. Save for the mutants, the acting isn't as bad as most current Japanese SF flicks but that is a mixed blessing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool","review":"I dig this movie. It's hard to follow and seems a little shallow in plot, but the style is awesome, and the soundtrack is a hit. If you like fast paced action movies that you could think about, but don't have to to enjoy this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"loved the 1973 &1994 cartoons, hated this","review":"I watched with the Japanese audio and subtitles. This movie started out well enough, but quickly stopped being entertaining. A friend who was not familiar with the source material watched it with me and really couldn't follow what was going on. I don't think the film was well written, it's very convoluted. Also, something about the CG and colors used in the movie made my eyes hurt a little. Overall, a huge disappointment.Most of the acting was good, the music was about a 50/50 split for me. The robot designs were also pretty neat, many of them followed the originals pretty closely. I wish they had been featured more prominently.Minor SPOILER ALERT!The BK androids are zombies in this movie. Yeah. But they do command robot armies, so that's... almost OK? Add in a mechanical stone lighting bolt that never gets explained and other subplots completely unrelated to the 1973 original and you've got a disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just missed","review":"Waited a long time to see this movie and I fell asleep. It's not that bad, just started to go all over the place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I had high hopes for this movie. I thought that if i was patient while watching it, that the action would get better. Well sorta. When the main character gets his powers the fight scenes lasted only a few short, bad edited minutes. It has so much potential because it is has nice visuals and plot build up. But it never pans out. Rent don't buy. You'll be pissed if u do buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"Bad inconsistant ill concieved messy story line. Cheesie cartoon effects. Cornball acting. Forced darked brooding feel. I don't know if having watched the original cartoon would of helped, or produced contempt of a remake. I usually have a taste for chessie scifi, this one sort of falls flat on its face. One reviewer mentioned this movie a prime canidate for MST3K, wholefully agree. I did notice alot of lot of reviewers went nuts over this movie; glad someone enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!","review":"Despite what the distributor's say, don't be fooled.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"if you throw enough mud against a wall something sticks, but what?","review":"This movie borrows so many styles of so many famous directors, I completely lost track. The only thing thatheld my attention was that I never had a clue which part of the kitchen sink I was going to get next. As a wholeit is interesting, but even the great CG effects sometimes left me asking why? Sometimes they're thrown inwith no connection to the \\"story\\" and I think I am being generous saying that. There isn't a plot that makessense let alone one you might remember 24 hours later. The only reason I don't feel ripped off is that I gotthe dvd cheap! Okay movie to watch if you're on LSD maybe. If you watch movies or anime sober, pass thisone up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnotic Casshern","review":"Strange, imaginative, and mesmerizing, Casshern is like nothing else on film. Science fiction? fantasy? this futuristic film grabs you with its imagery, color, stylized action, and catapaults you to another world in its depiction of good and evil, science vs humanism, and the ultimate redemptive climax will leave you breathless. Powerful, hypnotic, engrossing, Casshern is one to add to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"$3.99?","review":"I watched this movie to the end because I was bored and because I paid for it, but $3.99 is way too much for watching this movie.$0.50 would be okay only if you are really bored.You can assume I didn't like it and don't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A China Painting","review":"The willow pattern china commonly know as BLUE WILLOW takes form in this excellent romance by Deborah Smith.

There's a lot more places you can stick this thing other than the provided pole (how about the fridge door and desk lamps). The magnets are strong enough so it only needs one hand on a magnetic surface to stick to. Tons of poses are achievable because other than (1) non-articulating fingers and (2) thighs that do not rotate about a typical sitting position (spidey fans know the pose), it is extremely articulate and you can get it to mimic many comic-style poses. I gave it five stars despite the non-articulating fingers and thigh because of this.Btw, if you want spidey to hang in the middle of the pole and not have that piece slide down, just wrap some of that tie wrap (that the toy comes in) below the \\"spinner\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh... huh?","review":"Weird story.

This is a fun movie with some truly creepy moments. I won't spoil anything here, but lets just say the footprints were eerie.I'm a big fan of high-budget, CGI horror and sci-fi movies.

Google 'Canon BG-E2 service problem'.I shot about two thousand photos on a cold Thanksgiving morning with a monopod attached to a Canon 70-200mm f2.8 L lens. The performance of the battery grip was solid. Never had a problem. Now the battery has become a permanent fixture on my 30D.I gave it 4 stars because at $150, it's overpriced. I wish there was a aftermarket battery grip like the Opteka for the Rebel. I see that Jenis makes one but couldn't seem to figure out how to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design","review":"I've just switched to a 30D from an EOS 5 and 50e. This grip is terribly designed for anyone with medium or small hands- it's a simply a huge, uncontoured rectangular box.A vertical grip should make holding the camera easier, not harder. The grips for the 5 and 50e were great in this respect. The BG-E2 makes the camera a cumbersome slab. Canon took no account of user ergomomics in the design of this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what the 20D needs for big lenses","review":"Although people had problems with the first generation of this grip, I've been completely satisfied with mine. Recently, I've been shooting with a 300 2.8L, and it would be much more difficult without the extra length the grip ads to the body. Similarly, the second set of buttons for vertical shooting makes a big difference, too. (One note: when shooting vertical, it is hard to actuate the thumb wheel and impossible to use the joy stick--which I do frequently to change focus points--without moving my right hand.) By holding two batteries, the grip also keeps me from worrying about running out of juice during high volume shooting sessions.The grip still has a little flex in it, but I've never had any of the power problems that I've read about here and elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"CANON BGE2 BATTERY GRIP","review":"BEST accessory I purchased to go with my Canon 30D. I have taken over 2000 pictures without charging batteries using this grip.

I've had very few of the issue many are complaining about. I'm not sure if it is a matter of 'luck' (which is very bad on Canon's part) or I'm not as demanding, or picky, or what.Overall it does what I need it to do, it holds two batteries and also has portrait orientation buttons as that is how I like to shoot most of my photographs. Works as well as my previous generation (Canon D60 and grip) did for me prior to purchasing this one. I've shot about 1500 or so photos since I got the grip and have no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did I wait!?!?!","review":"I have been debating getting the battery grip for my 30D for awhile now. There have been lots of mixed reviews on the product so I held off until last week. I wish I had bought it 8 months ago when I bought my 30D! The camera feels so much more stable and easy to hold. I admit that I do have big hands, so it may not be well suited for everyone. It is big! Hopefully down the road I'll have a 1D series, but at least for now I know what one feels like. I agree with some of the reviews that Canon should have made the material to match the 30D, but I dont think it takes away too much from the whole package. It mounts securely to the camera. It gives you extra battery life. The vertical shutter button is great. It takes a little getting used to, but much more comfortable than the old fashioned way. Overall it was a great buy and a great product. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"baterry grip for Canon 30d","review":"I bought this baterry grip in Sep. 07.It's really worth every penny.Extend the shooting time (all day).Shooting in vertical mode.Highly recommend for all Canon 20d,30d and 40d .Thumbs up"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly disappointing accessory","review":"This has to be one of the worst EOS accessories Canon has ever put out; hopefully they will revise its design soon. The grip does not rest flush with the bottom of the EOS 20D regardless of how much you torque the nut. The small amount of play is annoying, but there is a much more serious problem in the form of intermittent power interruptions. A medium-heavy lens (e.g. 70-200mm 2.8) and a flash cause enough flex in the BG-E2 when you hold the camera by the grip that the electrical pins on the grip lose conact with the terminals in the 20D body. Quite unacceptable for anyone who needs a reliable camera for active work. There are work arounds in the form of shimming the grip, but Canon should have done a better job, especially considering how wonderful a camera the 20D is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"I upgraded to the Canon 20D from the Canon 300D with a BGE1 battery grip. The BGE1 fit and operated perfectly on the 300D. So, I was very leary about ordering the BGE2 for my 20D when I read the previous reviews on this product. But this is a necessary accessory for me and I finally buckled and purchased one. I can only surmise that Canon has corrected whatever deficiencies there may have been because my BGE2 fits and operates perfectly on my 20D. It is extremely snug with no gaps or looseness and none of the problems experienced by previous reviewers. I wouldn't be without this. Maybe Canon is listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill W","review":"I just received the Canon BGE2 Battery Grip yesterday and already have it attached to my EOS 30D (nice).The unit fits very well and is very secure. I had no trouble aligning and tightening the Grip to the Camera Body.I also found the additional shutter release very handy. In addition, the shape of the unit allows a solid \\"grip\\" in the Vertical orientation as well.I too already had an extra battery pack, as TWO Batteries are required. Please note that the unit COMES WITH the Canon BGM-E2 Battery Holder, which allows you to use AA batteries. There is NO NEED to buy this as an accessory (unless you want a second AA battery magazine).One accessory that compliments the Battery Grip very well is the Canon Hand Strap E1. This Strap is designed to work with the neck strap yet provides added security and control with the Battery Grip (and well worth the $25-$30)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never get a BGE2 battery grip Canon said \\"We fix it\\" its a lie","review":"Until now I was a proud owner of a Canon EOS 20D, well not any more!!

This is a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Don't expect this collection of short stories to be anywhere as good as the author's first work Thirst.

I didn't like how the author attempted to \\"school\\" us on urban slang and dialogue. I also didn't like the way that the book flowed. At times subjects were jumpy and rather than flowing into a collaborative story where all the characters paths crossed, I felt dizzy trying to keep up witht he changing characters. Overall...the book it pretty good.

Many Christians think the Holy Spirit only distributed gifts during the early days of the church. In To Whom Much is Given, the author provides the readers with a glimpse of how spiritual gifts can be used in a contemporary setting.Gray uniquely creates characters that are very familiar in personality. Readers can immediately connect with the tight friendship between Donna and Yolanda and the silly male antics of Max and Fred. From the moment that Max and Donna have their chance meeting in the grocery store, it is non-stop action. These two fall into one adventure after the other---adventures that uncover profound discoveries about each other.Readers will become intrigued with a fifth character in this novel, a disturbingly bitter woman who seems bent on destruction. Her thirst for destruction and the growing relationship between Max and Donna add up to one suspenseful and thought provoking read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Christian read with non stop action","review":"The characters of Donna and Max are very familiar in personality.

I commend him for weaving his faith into this engaging story.My favorite aspect of the book was the portrayal of a black male who is celebrate as a result of his faith and biblical obedience. He was a beautiful character to follow.As creative feedback, the writing style really needed help. There was just WAY TOO MUCH going on in this story and much of it (including the characters) so unbelievable. The slang use was awkward and there were several grammatical errors. I read this book because my 20-year \\"little sister\\" told me it was \\"one of the best books she had ever read.\\" I only finished it because I wanted to be able to discuss it with her. I have to admit, it was a really choppy read for me.Maurice, my advice to you is to KEEP WRITING (and get a good editor!) The more you write, the better your writing will become.

Ours arrived with the top busted off and the box taped back together by the shipping company. I assume this happened because the box was being handled individually and tossed from station to station by the shipping personnel and equipment. 26lbs of paper has a lot of momentum and that is a pretty thin cardboard box. So the top split open and spilled the contents. That box was meant to be shipped on a pallet not individually. The top 10-15% of paper was all dishuffled and wrinkled. We kept the box as I didn't want to hassle with returning it but I think I'll go back to picking up a case at the local Office[Depot/Max].The cost is about the same and I will get the paper intact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon should be ashamed!!","review":"I've ordered hundreds of items from Amazon over the years and have come to depend on their packaging to protect my items -- I've been very satisfied until I ordered this HP Office paper Quickpack.

Personally I submitted a packaging review along with photos -- I hope that others will do the same.I do not know how they decide on type of packaging, but I think that unless a box is clearly a shipping box - which this one clearly is not designed to be, it should be protected inside a proper shipping box.

Well, the problem with a lot of old blues recordings is their thin and often rudimentary instrumentation that adds little to the emotion of the vocals - by placing them in a more complex and much richer framework, Lomax adds to their power rather than abusing it. Clever and, with only a few exceptions, highly effective.

He presents his concerns by setting forth the facts in a logical and systematic fashion that stays on point. Although I do not find everything in his books compelling, it certainly gives one pause in accepting the 9/11 commission report as factually and accurately depicting the events of that horrific day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"Tarpley answers who and how, not so much by naming names, which is often (though not always) impossible, but by showing the method behind 9/11 with precision and details.

Let me say this first: I'm very much leaning towards believing that 911 was an inside job, but Tarpley's book, from a purely intellectual level, leaves a lot to be hoped for. His book is riddled with non-sequitors and false analogies. Don't get me wrong, I'm on his side.

Of course, the conspiratorialy minded Tarply would say those scholars are all bought and paid for by the new world order.

In support of this thesis, the author claims that George H.W. Bush was coerced by Dick Cheney et al into accepting to play his role in this coup. The thesis is quite extraordinary. The author attempts to substantiate this thesis, but the evidence is rather thin and conjectural. Apart from this theory, the book contains, however, a wealth of information on the events of 9/11, which conforms with the widely held view that the events of 9/11 had been engineered by the US administration or some elements thereof. It is a must reading for all those interested in the future of US democracy and in the truth on the events of 9/11, even if they do not agree with all the author's conclusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz Essential","review":"A rare find for any jazz lover's collection.

However, what is presented in \\"Fermat's Last Theorem : Unlocking the Secret of an Ancient Mathematical Problem\\" is little more than an outline, and it left this reader wanting for a whole lot more.

Obviously his Ph.D is not in mathematics"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea, wrong direction","review":"I think a book about the solution to Fermat's last theorem is an excellent idea. However, I think that this book ultimately fails because Aczel takes too much time discussing the history of the theorem and the developement of mathematics up until the point when the problem was solved in 1993. More than two centuries of mathematics is pigeon-holed into a book that is under 200 pages. In that respect, I think that the author was overly ambitious in his aim; it is simply impossible to explain topology in 3 or 4 pages.

In the story, Danilo is chosen by his uncle, Khelben, to seek out the answer to what is changing the history, memory, and life for the people in the Forgotten Realms. Unfortunately, he finds himself paired with his rival, the elf Elaith. With the aid of dwarves and elves and harm caused by sorceresses, dragons, and harpies, Danilo and his small group of companions set out to save their people and stop the evil within the changes.

There are many extras including some campy movie trailers from the same era/genre; there is commentary from from film' producer and genre film historian Bruce Eder. Thanks Criterion. You've done it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"great 50s sci fi","review":"This is the kind of film that used to be on TV real late at night, which I would watch with a friend who was staying over. This one, which is rather low budget, is really scary and mysterious. It starts out with an invisible creature, which is attacking people and seems impossible to understand - at one point, it cuts a tiny hole in a screen to enter a home. What could it be, one wonders? But all one can do is hear the sound of its movement, then witness the destruction of those attacked. THere some genuinely frightening scenes, like one I remember scared us so bad we shut it off: a guy is attacked and survives, but wanders into a meeting disfigured and moaning.While I found the explanation a bit disappointing, it is well done nonetheless, adding to our early mythology about radioaction-powered devices.REcommended for both nostalgia's sake and as a solid sci fi experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"fiend without a face","review":"This movie is so corny it's fun.

Released about 10 years earlier and a product of the British sci-fi/horror period of the late 50's, the special effects are excellent for its time. Kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie and had a very interesting (albeit rather unrealistic) plot. The ending was perhaps one of the best parts of the film, so it's definitely not a letdown, and at 74 minutes of length, the movie definitely does not drag. Some nice death scenes in this one too, and the acting is actually decent. If you're a fan of this genre, this is DEFINITELY worth owning. Criterion really packs in the special features too, as usual. Digitally remastered - picture and sound quality are outstanding given the age of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is without a doubt the worst \\"Secrets of\\" book in the entire series. An overtly extensive and unnecessary cultural background section comprises the vast majority of this book and it reads so much like a tourist's guide mixed with an undergraduate textbook that I wished I had saved my money and gone to the library instead. For anyone willing to sift through the pages of uselessness to find actual information of how elements of the Mythos manifest in Japan, I'm sorry to say you will be sorely disappointed as there is virtually nothing of value to be found. To be honest this book will be of some use to people whose only knowledge of Japan is that it exists but that will be only in the context I mentioned above. This book is useless and somewhat insulting to anyone with even the smallest knowledge of Japanese culture. A waste of paper.

I have a 42\\" waist so I ordered the large. The problem is that I didn't want to wear it around my waist at the belt line, but above it. My stomach and chest are considerably larger than 42\\", so this thing was constricting like a python.

After using it for a couple of weeks the earbud kept shifting within the unit, making it difficult to use. The earpiece holder it comes with is a good idea, but also fails to hold when the earbud keeps falling out. The connection time to the phone is slow.

It looks like a crude attempt to extract as much revenue as possible from large base of loyal fans.

I must, however, agree with the other reviews I have read for this title. This is an example of a bad DVD release - Other studios have discovered the success to releasing television shows on DVD - release an entire season in one affordable and complete set -this benefits both the fans and the studios (through increased sales). Why bother to release just one episode (the bonus episode of the pilot of \\"Law & Order\\" has already been released in the First Year release)? Law and Order has been on the air for well over ten years now - let's hope that it won't take another ten years for the remaining seasons of Law and Order , Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and Law & Order\\": Criminal Intent.

The story line is very close to my heart as it is about a whale, who is the king of the ocean, who loves his people so much that he is willing to die for them. You see, one of his people (or should I say fish) accidentally betrays him into the hands of his enemy. He knows he can do one of two things: Escape his enemy and let his kingdom suffer or face his enemy and save his kingdom. Like I said previously, he loved his kingdom so much that he was willing to die so that they may live. It is a great way to help your children understand the price that Christ paid for our sins.

I did like Remolino and Guitarra romantica, but not as much as the first one. I did enjoy Buscame, sang by Mary Carmen Segura, it was brilliant. I can't wait for Travesura chill, the lattest one. I think that Encinas is a master of the guitar, and also, has a good sense of arrangement as far as songs go. Too talented, with so much feeling, his music is magic. El Duende has taken a hold of his soul, for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!!

Of all the non-animated Tom Sawyer movies that I've seen this one's the worst. (The 1938 movie was the best.) The acting (both visual & audio) should have been better. I was disapointed with some of what was left out of the story -even though this is quite a legnthy movie. Some of the background music sounds Europian. And now the clincher: I suspect that this movie was dubbed into English from Russian from the 1981 Soviet Union TV movie: Priklyucheniya Toma Sojera i Geklberri Finna. The names of the director & lead actor were also translated. Stanislav Govorukhin became Stan Govorkin. FYODOR STUKOV became FRED STACK. Is this really so.

Poorly dubbed and edited Russian miniseries!","review":"This is a 135 minute version of Priklyucheniya Toma Sojera i Geklberri Finna (The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Hucklebery Finn), a 1981 Russian television miniseries with an original running time of 225 minutes. 90 minutes have been excised from this version, and the action abruptly jumps from one scene to another with oddly placed fades to black. Most of the actors have remarkably expressionless faces, and the dubbing is reminiscent of Japanese Godzilla movies. The last thirteen minutes of the disc were so badly damaged that the DVD player kept freezing, and we couldn't jump to the next chapter because the DVD is only divided into five chapters, each about thirty minutes in length. The film is deceptively packaged---the Russian names have been translated to English (star Fyodor Stukov is credited as Fred Stack), and nothing in the credits indicates the film's origins. Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth one star...","review":"Terrible, awful, impossible to follow! The characters would burst out into maniacal laughter for no reason. The dubbing was the worst I have ever seen (and my husband is a Godzilla fanatic, so I have seen a LOT).

However this Resource DVD is not what I hoped it would be. I have been studying Crazy Love with my 20 yr old son (who is in Iraq currently) and his fianc��. We read a chapter per week and I come up with questions for us to answer that will challenge us on what we learned. I was hoping the resource would be something that Francis Chan could give me extra help with for challenging questions. That is not the case. I would have preferred a study guide book with chapter questions, but this DVD is just a camera following him around during the day as he talks about the chapters, sort of, and I may only get ONE thought provoking question out of each chapter. It was not worth the money. Sorry Francis. But I would totally recommend the book... just not the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Crazy Love!","review":"I read Crazy Love, and I love the way Francis Chan presents the Truth clearly and unapologetically and straightforward. I have recommended the book as a small group study to anyone who will listen. Now, the DVD only enhances the book and will aid in small group study experience. Short clips for the chapters with questions following each clip promote discussion within the group.

Thankfully, I couldn't have been more wrong! This book is easy to read but deeply challenging. Chan's style is akin to Beth Moore, providing a fresh perspective on solid theology with an emphasis on passionate, practical application. Caution!

About 48hrs read time. Fast and entertaining along the way. You may never look at Ants' again in the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept and story, poor English reading","review":"This book has a very interesting concept that will appeal to those who like thinking of nature as a singular whole. Moreover, it is an interesting quasi-scientific introduction to one of entomology's most interesting members. However as other reviewers have mentioned, this English translation is lacking.I rented a copy from my local library and could not finish it, unable to get beyond the stilted translation of what could have possibly been a more elegant French text. If you are prepared to navigate a bungled use of English idioms, unbelievable character dialogue, and completely earnest sentences like: \\"[the ants] fired, propelling jets of hyper-concentrated formic acid with all the might of their sphincters\\" then you might enjoy this fanciful book. Otherwise, I would encourage you to spend your time with other literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe a decent early teen book","review":"If one had no knowledge of ants, this book might be interesting. I did not find it in anyway comparable to \\"Watership Down\\". Even \\"Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH\\" was far superior. The lack of character development and the methodical way that the Facts About Ants! was presented caused me to give this one to the used book store when I'd made it 4/5 through...sorry, couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Riveting Read","review":"I put the book away with the wish for another one as good as this one to be available soon. The information about the ants is fascinating, so is the storyline.

The combination of the mysterious unfolding plot and the incredible and yet authentic-seeming detail of the ants' lives is a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book hurt me.","review":"This is quite possible one of the 5 worst books I've ever read. If the autor new anything about ants he apparently wanted to hide this fact by not useing any correct iformation. The best thing I can say about the ant's in the book is they had the right number of legs. As for the people in the book...i can't even tell you how badly portrayed they are. The only bright side to the book is that he inserts little \\"clips\\" from a fictional book called The Encylopida of Relivite and Absolute Knowladge. The good thing about these exerpts are they make you glad you don't have to read that book as well. In my opinon don't buy this book, don't even look at the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I ordered this book mainly because of the great reviews that I read on the amazon.com page. After reading it, I must say I was disappointed. While the premise is intriguing, the author fails to engage the reader in that great thrall of adventure where one roots for characters one has grown to admire. Instead I found myself wishing that I were nearing the last page simply to get the read over with. As for comparing the book to Watership Down, I don't see the comparison, unless this book has lost something in the translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY AND USE THE LIBRARY!!!","review":"I feel that the reviews are correct about the ants and people.The book was good and interesting,but I really hated the abrupt death of one of the ant charaters and the rushed ending to the book was a BIG turn off.I hope that the other books are better written."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book stinks!","review":"I bought this book on the recommendation of the myrmecology (study of ants) mailing list. They loved it, I hate it. The ants are not at all believable. I really wanted to see what a hive mind might be like, but that's not here. The only thing that makes the ants look good is how poorly he portrays the people! And the surprise ending is the stupidest thing I have read in a long, long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Very thin on plot; the great mystery turns out to not so great in the end. Ant and human characters are weakly developed. Either skip this book altogether or borrow it from the library; don't waste money on it! Better: read Watership Down or Plague Dogs, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"captivating premise but ridiculous writing skills","review":"I am confounded by those reviewers that give this 4 or 5 stars. The plot is a good idea, and does provide glimpses of the fascinating complexity of ant life. However, the author attributes to the ants some complex behaviours and dynamics that go beyond science into SF and pure fantasy.That is just the tip of the disappointment. The human characters are so wooden that if I had not known better, I would have believed taht the story was written by a 12-year old with a big vocabulary. Maybe something was lost in the translation (had to be the case, the writing is so bad in some parts) but unless the translator made up things, the story in the original French would also be flagrantly bad.Perhaps those that gave this book high marks are children, in which case I can understand. I think that it may be a good book for children, but certainly not for anyone above the age of 16."},{"rating":"2","title":"engrossing, near perfect fiction","review":"This is a wonderful story written in a way that makes it near impossible to put down. It leaves you with many thoughts that will follow you around for days. And you'll never look at an ant the same way again.This is fiction at its best: smart, fun, imaginative but not pretentious or stuffy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Werber's Ants trilogy","review":"The Empire of the Ants is really a translation of the French book \\"Les Fourmis\\", which is the first part of what I would call the Ants trilogy. The two other books are titled \\"Le Jour des fourmis\\" (\\"The Day of the Ants\\"), and \\"La R��volution des fourmis\\" (The Revolution of the Ants\\"). It is still unknown to me if these books have ever been translated to English."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the greatest books","review":"I loved this book. Every time I started reading it I couldn't stop. Werber has lots of action and explains everything well. He puts many things about ants which are interesting. This book is very suspensful, and exciting. READ IT! By the way I'm 13 years old. And American."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and Interesting. I became addicted immediately.","review":"This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. The style of writing and vivid realism constantly kept me turning the pages. I agree with a few other reviews towards the development of the human characters. However, their inclusion added an anticipated excitement that coincided with the quest by the ants. These two stories both created that addictive drive to turn the page and continue to read. I definitely recommend this book with the warning that they finish all their errands beforehand because they will not finish anything until they finish reading this book. I have one piece of advice to reviewers: When reviewing anything (book, movie, etc.), do not give away the ending or major spoilers. It really ruins the point of a review for those who have not read the book. Anyhow, Thank you Mr. Weber for this book and pleasant reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something different and interesting","review":"Empire of the Ants is a great read. I got bogged down a few times by an over abundance of details, but not enough to make me lower my rating of this book. It is translated from French, so sometimes the writing is a bit bumpy. The story is really original and completely captivating. I even found myself dreaming about the story at night...This book was recommended to me by a friend and I went into it a bit skeptical, but it is amazing how much I got into ant life and the \\"characters\\" in the story. It is hard to find in bookstores...I ordered mine from Amazon. I have heard that there is another book that continues with the \\"ants\\" saga, but unfortunately, to my knowledge it is in French and is yet to be translated. One thing interesting...I enjoyed the character development of the ants more than I did the people.Overall, a decent read and definitely something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Knew?","review":"Empire of the Ants is absolutely fascinating. I have never read such a good story with such detail from a non-human animal's point of view.

Years after I read this book, my hairs still bristle, as I recall reading about the final battle..."},{"rating":"1","title":"great but enragingly disappointing ending","review":"Empire of the Ants is quite captivating and well written - and seems to be leading up to a mind-blowing final act. I found myself completely caught up in the story - the intrigue appearing to point toward some sort of a revelation that ants and humans are the same - not metaphorically, but metaphysically. I believe that the ideas I had for where I thought the story was going to lead me were immensely more interesting than the way the book ultimately finished. That is certainly not to say I am a storytelling genius - it is to say that the ending of this book really, really sucks. I mean, I was so let down I wanted to throw this book into a magma pool. However, there are no magma pools around here so I sold it to Half Price Books instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea, better without people.","review":"Empire of the Ants is a fascinating view of these social insects. By showing the ants' alien thought process in a context that the average reader can understand, Werber has created an incredibly vivid portrait of the world under our feet. The problem lies with the human characters that interact with the ants, leading to an anticlimax that takes away from the \\"Empire's\\" own struggles. Allowing humans to be supporting characters in this genre(Watership Down) may be helpful but they should not actively participate. It takes away from the world that was created and lessens it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and Unsatisfying","review":"I was completely disapointed with this highly praised (and marketed) book. Although the insight into the world of Ants was interesting, the human tie-in was boring and incredibly unrealistic to the point of being just stupid. (Like the police giving up their search because some of their men disappeared...ya, that happens). If you liked Watership Down, which this book is constantly being compared to, don't bother, because you will be hugely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want this on DVD!","review":"I love this film.

Still manages to be somewhat enjoyable and if you're a fan of the original series and haven't seen the cartoon.The episodes included herein are:\\"The Survivor\\"\\"The Lorelei Signal\\"\\"The Infinite Vulcan\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY CHEAP!!!!!!!","review":"I bought these for a 2001 Ford Focus ZX3. They fit decently enough. My main complaint about these is that the straps used to tie the headrest cover and the tops of the seat covers to the seat snapped off immediately. The ties pulled off like they were held on by one single tiny thread. I assure people i did not use extreme force but merely tried tying it as if tying ones shoe. I thought it was a fluke when the first one pulled off so quickly, but the rest followed. Its not even worth my time to send them back. Other than the straps, the seat covers seem nice enough, though i haven't really put them through any serious wear yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"hyundai accent 2009","review":"the covers fit well enough in my 2009 hyundai accent. the covers are easy to install and do not shift or slide. do not expect the covers to fit as perfectly as the picture. i am not about to spend significantly more money for \\"custom\\" seat covers for a budget car."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what was expected","review":"Ok product but the desription makes it sound like it is more. Price is better at Kmart for the same thing too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shiny","review":"These seat covers fit in my Ford Focus quite perfectly, however the material is very shiny and slick. Not really what I wanted. The grey color appears silver in real life and has a wet look it is so shiny."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FOR THE PRICE","review":"These covers do justice to the rest of my car's black interior which is still in decent shape. Unfortunately, the original seat coverings have largely disintegrated over time and these covers look good and are comfortable. Thought they were good when I bought them for $40 from a local auto parts store two years ago. They've lasted me about that long, and for Amazon's price, I am more than happy. Yes, the surround material and attachment straps are not the sturdiest. But if they last me for two years, like my previous set, I consider them a cheap and attractive alternative to getting my seats reupholstered."},{"rating":"1","title":"The item in the picture is not what I received!","review":"The product that arrived is NOT what is in this picture! What a pain! What a waste of time and energy having to return something."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice seats","review":"These seat covers are pretty awesome. i've had them for 2 1/2 years. sure they are not high quality, they are light weight, but have held up pretty well. they make my seats look great because of the fact they are black and grey. easy to put on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serves the Purpose","review":"I couldn't believe how fast I received these seat covers! I only actually needed one seat cover for the driver side (for protection) and I'm glad of that because the first one I tried to install came appart at the seam. It wasn't that noticeable but, instead of going through the hassle of returning, I decided to install the second one. All went well with this one and now I have protection for the seat. The color goes well with the interior of the car and I do like the look of the covers."},{"rating":"2","title":"fairfield seat covers","review":"Seat covers are easy to install and are good looking. you can tell they are 1 size fits all because the fit is loose but considering the price and ease of installation I guess you can't complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like fine wine.............","review":"So, I bought this CD when it first came out and I liked only one song, Windows to the Soul. It laid dorment on my CD shelf for years when recently I decided to listen to it more closely, as I was bored and needing something a-new.I started to absorb these songs in the car, when as you can imagine, the songs started to forment in me like a fine red wine. All day and night, these songs have entered into my mind, one way or another.Previously, Fire garden was Vai's masterpiece to me. After listening more closely to this CD it's starting to climb the alltime charts, surpassing Fire Garden. Everyone knows Vai's guitar playing is second to none, but his canny writing style \\"ala Frank Zappa\\" has started to blossom to unimaginable levels. Listen to Flexable, then swap to this CD's first eight tracks, like I did. An amazing turn, yet his style is still there........Buy this CD if you can appreciate fine musical talent.............maybe sip some wine when listening to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"mixed feeling tending towards positive","review":"The first time that listened to this cd my first thought was to exchange it for another cd.With repeated listens I have grown more accustomed to it.The album has elements of steve previous albums.You certainly cannot discount his compositional and orchestrational skills that are present here.There are a few less memorable songs here but it is the fore mentioned skills that saves them somewhat.My favourite tracks on the album would be The Blood and Tears, OOOO, and Windows to the Soul.I think that Fire garden was a better overall album than this but his vocals have definaetly improved.I think that you need to be in a certain mood to be able to listen to this all the way through.Overall I would give this album 3.5 - 4.I must admit that you will take notice when steve solos.Can't wait for the day when he does a real kick ass rock album......."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to disappoint","review":"Ok. Steve hasn't gone soft like other bands, which we won't talk about. However, many of the tracks he has done himself, which is more of a personal accomplishment, rather than an expressive musical statement. I much prefered the tracks where he hired a session drummer and/or bassist because they are more(but still tight) live, raw sounding. Sometimes the drum track sounds empty and too fake for my liking. It is all a matter of opinion however, and this is still a solid, worthy album."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],N={key:0},M={key:1};function B(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(o(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(o(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(O,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-b64c8801"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/66.md","filePath":"sponsor/66.md"}'),j={name:"sponsor/66.md"},P=Object.assign(j,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
