I had never heard of Michael Connelly until I read this book. After I read this book, I went to the library and have now read all the Harry Bosch books. I have enjoyed them all; especially Black ice. I really like to read books by authors that all use the same character such as Jonathan Kellerman's Dr. Alex Delaware. I'm always eagerly awaiting the next book by authors that use the same characters in their books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent detective mystery","review":"I have to admit being partial to Connelly - Bosch novels, though this is only my 4th read. I am now making sure I read them in order, as I have not yet read the first two in the series. These are books that I cannot wait to get back to. The realism of character and procedure are blended well with interesting and realistic story lines. I am rating Trunk Music a 5 out of 5 - 1 for plot; 1 for characters; 1 for twists; 1 for a writing style that holds the reader, and 1 for comparison with other mystery style / crimefighter novels (realism).I highly recommend this, as well as the other Bosch books - Concrete Blond and Last Coyote for those who like mystery, good police stories, with just enough human interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trunk Music","review":"Great story.

He grabs his first homicide case by the horns and goes against the FBI, the IAD and the mob as he follows the trail to Las Vegas from LA. He finds an old flame along the way that adds a complex element to the mix.

It is a novel where it seems several times that the case is closed but since there are alot of pages remaining, the reader knows its not. Harry is his same brash self, whether he is mouthing off to IAD and other police brass, throwing himself into unwise romantic liaisons or fighting with mob guys. This book introduces Kiz Rider, who along with Edgar team with Harry for a few succeeding books.

Billets and Rider are super new characters. However, the plot was meandering and overly complicated. How many IAD investigations/suspensions is Harry going to deal with? And the plot was not overly exciting or engaging. Still, it is Bosch and Connelly is probably the best mystery writer going to day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Bosch, holier-than-thou","review":"This was the third book I've read by Connelly, and the one that finally made me cry \\"Enough!\\" The plot, like all the others, is pinned to betrayal in high places, with enough red herrings thrown in to force the evacuation of a fish pier and keep one off-balance. But the character of Bosch, sheesh. He started out decent enough, but becomes in \\"Trunk Music\\" even more self righteous than the good cop delivering a lecture on a bad TV series. When he finally pitches his coup de grace to one of his (many) \\"tormentors,\\" (noone's as smart or good as Harry) part of me wanted the \\"bad guy\\" to jump up and eloquently defend himself against the raving lunatic. Ah well."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!!","review":"I've been waiting a long time to see where Harry would land this time. The brief detour for the POET was wonderful and only served to heighten my anticipation. What a letdown!! While the plot is still top quality, a Connelly stongpoint, the writing style leaves a lot to be desired. If I didn't know better, I'd say that this was his first effort. The prose is stiff, stilted and amateurish. Taking a paragraph to explain \\"code 3\\"-- Please!!. Many places with awkward dialogue and misplaced discriptive paragraphs. Luckily, I got it from the library and didn't have to pay for it. I'll be back for more, it only to see if it gets better.

His gratuitious ranting against the IAD types, to give us a supposedly \\"common enemy,\\" is hackneyed; the plots always revolve around a betrayal that one can figger from page 85, once one has slogged through one of his tomes.

The characters were the same but the people were alot different from the story. I hate it when they make these kind of movies from a novel or a play and they do some kind of a MTV version style which isn't anything like the book. Just like they did with the new version of Romeo and Juliet it was like the old version except they changed alot of things they put it in a 90's style version. Don't recommened on seeing this movie it's not very good stick with the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remake or not...It's a Gwyneth Palthrow tour-de-force","review":"I'm not going to claim that I have seen the original, nor remember reading the boring novel in literature class, but I did see this DVD. This movie is exceptional, stylish, and captivating. Ethan Hawke is brilliant, as the son of a poor handyman, who falls hard for the daughter of a bitter, old wealthy widow(played exceptionally by Anne Bankroft). The real show-stealer is Gwyneth Palthrow, the object of Hawke's affections, as an iceberg princess, incapable of love or emotion. This film shows that no matter what success we achieve in life, it is all hollow without the affections of those we care about most."},{"rating":"1","title":"very nice cinematography, but a big hole in the story","review":"I went to see this movie cause I like Ethan Hawke ( I was expecting he'd maybe do as well as in Reality Bites), and cause other recent adaptions of classics set in our time turned out to be great (Rome& Juliet), but the story of this one is just empty. The cinematography of the film is great, as well as the artwork and music, but that doesn't really make a good movie, does it!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is how all movies should be set.","review":"This movie is pure fantasy. Put it in your VCR and be taken away to another, almost, surrealistic place. While the story itself could be polished there was enough here to make it a favorite. Each actor did a really great job at epitomizing what their character stood for. However, I think the writer could have had made them more dynamic. I agree that it did end too soon without resolution. But isn't that the point...the longing?

There is spectacular use of the score and color to express the emotion of the film. I noticed the recurring use of the theme of the color green. Especially at Finn's art show you see the set and most costumes are in the color green, a visual strategy that works whether you know it or not. There is also good camera work, sweeping through the old mansion, going through shadows and fading images. The makers of this film are very sucessful in conveying the theme and feelings in the story, you can't help but relate yourself to the characters.I was very empathetic to this movie, but maybe I'm just sensitive :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Shot","review":"Have watched this movie over and over, relishing different aspects of it at each sitting.

Robert De Niro is out of place (as much as I value his talent). Hawke is kind of weird, especially in his badly executed \\"teenage\\" look. The New York's Art Scene is highly irritating, as is the \\"eccentric aunt\\" most of the times.

Anne Bancroft was wonderful, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ethan Hawk turned in good performances. I found Ehtan Hawk's performanace a little flat, but I always think his performances are a little flat.

I am very disappointed. The tags they suggest are Dickens and classic. It is neither of these. Its trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Expectations","review":"Although I first watched this movie in an attempt to avoid reading the wretched Charles Dickens novel, after seeing it, I wished I had viewed it for more respectable reasons. Everything about this movie was wonderful. Robert DeNiro was incredibly intense as the criminal (the scene where he hisses, \\"Whisper!\\" still gives me goosebumps). Gwenyth Paltrow was every bit Estella; she was equally painfully beautiful and coldhearted. Ethan Hawke also played an excellent Finn/Pip. The scene where he stands drunk outside of Estella's apartment and gives the \\"Everything good in me...is you\\" speech still comes vividly to mind. Plus, \\"Estella's Theme\\" (the guitar instemental that plays in the movie and over the main menu screen) perfectly chacterized every wonderful, longing moment of this film. Rising from the ashes of on of the most overrated books of all time, Great Expectations will blow you away. The bottom line is this is a perfect date movie, or for whenever you are feeling romantic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A film that misses the point of its title","review":"This movie attempts to recreate Great Expectations in a modern context but fails in every important way. It turns a fascinating study of desire and self discovery into a generic on again off again love story. While it has scenes from the book they all fall flat because they lack their original purpose and character. As such, the movie lacks charm and gravitas during its most important scenes. One scene undermines another as the work to make a character's action have meaning is not done. It fails to reach any emotional highs and seems to be content to make a hollow recreation of a greater story. It does not succeed in either making its own original story, or telling the story its name implies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Movie","review":"Great performances and excellent pacing make this movie a must watch for DeNiro, Hawke, and Paltrow fans. Chris Cooper is also wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hallmark channel meets pseudo-erudite art world/unrequited love","review":"This film overall is maudlin, over-wrought, completely unbelievable and basically God-awful. With the minor exception of some decent cinematography. Ms Paltrow's character appears to have borderline personality disorder, which does nothing to add to the movie's appeal. Should she lose 3 more pounds, she would surely qualify for an anorexia diagnosis. Her nude appearance is the only reason this film got any attention whatsoever as it is unfortunately Lifetime Move Network quality over a Sundance veneer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Story","review":"This adaptation of Charles Dickens\` novel is an interesting watch, but the final result isn\`t too engaging or surprising. Another variation on the old poor boy (Ethan Hawke, in another of his dreamer, innocent, young artist roles) that falls for the rich girl (Gwyneth Patrow, with a too wooden and bland performance). Director Alfonso Cuar��n presents some stylish and gourgeous sceneries, locations, people and music, yet the plot is still by-the-numbers, failing to convince despite some pretty and well-crafted moments. Not a bad movie, but not a memmorable one either.Passable entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a grate film","review":"I love this sinery and evreything in and about the movie is grate.

Although it left me in a world wind of confusion. \\"What was the girl's problem?\\" She was really flaky. While fin was a quiet and unusual young boy, he was also that way as he grew into a man. The girl, I forget her name, was a flaky young girl, and grew to be a confused young woman. She seem to be unsure of life and love. And the old woman that was raising her was a real piece of work, she was also weird. The story never tells if the old weird woman was her relative or not. Amazingly enough, I liked this weird movie. \\"How weird is that?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"So watchable","review":"Everytime I catch this film on Tv, no matter how far throught it is I end up watching it till its conclusion.

In this version, the two romantic leads have not suffered enough by the time the end arrives. The result is that the plot's final pay-off offers only a tiny fraction of what Dickens delivered in his novel.I was keenly disappointed and irritated because the director had done such a wonderful job with \\"The Little Princess.\\" Like most movies nowadays, the screenplay is the weak link."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow this movie sucked!","review":"This movie was so boring it was painful! I can't believe what an utterly waste of time this was for the viewers as well as the producers of this movie! This was the most awfully, painstakingly dull movie I have ever had the misfortune of suffering through! I never thought that I would see ANY movie more brain numbingly dull as Princes' Under The Cherry Moon, but Hazzah this movie makes Under The Cherry Moon look like; The Godfather! This movie is a slap in the face of the great Charles Dickens! It's hard to imagine that Gwenneth Paltrow became a star from this movie, her performance seemed as though she was just as bored with her character as I was watching her character! All in all this was a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Crap","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. If your thinking about watching it to help you understand or get some of Dickens work in a visual, then watch the old black and white Great Expectations movie. not this one. the older movie is more accurate, this movie is all over the place.

There's beauty and poetry in every shot, and the scene where Finn declares his love to Estella under the rain is more moving than anything I've seen in movies in a long time. The score is simply ravishing and the paintings by Francesco Clemente are amazing.Anne Bancroft, Chris Cooper, Robert DeNiro make a fantastic supporting cast, and Ethan Hawke is moving and utterly believable as Finn. I'm not a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but I have to admit she makes a pretty great Estella."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Not impressive, although I believed in the cast I found the film boring and artifical. The actors I actually bought the film for were Ann Bancroft and Gwyneth Paltrow - they were OK but lacked depth; Ethan Hawke looked like he was still in High School and Robert de Niro was dressed up as Fagin in the muscial Oliver.

You can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite Hawke movies.","review":"Besides being \\"Gattaca,\\" as another of my favorite Ethan Hawke movies, \\"Great Expectations\\" is another. Equisitely directed, excellent performances by Hawke and sexy costar Gwyneth Paltrow, and great scenery make this a stylized and sexy drama.Finn (Hawke) is encouraged to go to New York to seek an artist's career by an lawyer who represents an art museum director. He gets on a plane and flies there, only to be met up by Paltrow, who he briefly saw several years before, encourages her to come to his apartment for a private artist session. Not only Gwyneth poses, she strips down, baring some tempting curves and voluptous skin for Hawke to draw.This is an excellent modernized Dickens' adaptation, even better than the book, I should say. But you didn't hear ME saying that...Rated R for language, violence, and some generous and gorgeous nudity by the gorgeous Gwyneth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but incoherent.","review":"I'm a teenager.

I love how it delivers the message that you must have meaning to your life. It's also very symbolic. The enigmatic Bagger Vance could be anyone from a wise guy to an angel. Will Smith, as Bagger Vance, gave an outstanding performance. Matt Damon shone, as always. And the little boy who played Harvey Reed, Damon's character's tag-along friend, was amazing. I wonder why I haven't seen him in more movies. Anyway, this movie has a lot of emotion in it, and determination. I think it's cool that they made a golf movie after all those basketball, football, and hockey films. Some people think golf is boring, but this movie makes you really get into it. Well, I'd reccommend this to anyone looking for drama, but it has a bit of comedy in it too. This film is way underrated. Go see it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Time or Money","review":"This is a movie that was so overhyped because of Robert Redford's envolvement in the project that all common sense regarding good taste was apparently forgotten.

But this overwrought, over-scored, over-messaged movie misses the mark...and it's tough to finger the culprit(s).No, it isn't Theron's woefully bad Southern dialect or Bagger's corny dialogue. It isn't the allegory heaped upon allegory or Jack Lemmon's \\"grumpy old man\\" cameo.Whatever it is, this is ultimately a film for fans of the celebrity cast members, director or the game of golf. Trip Hamilton and Joel Gretsch do deserve mention for their standout supporting roles. However, your two hours will probably be better spent going to the driving range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helped to put me to sleep!","review":"The only reason this movie deserved even one star was that it can help a hopeless insomniac to fall asleep.

That was reason enough for me to literally chuck this DVD against the wall.Such a great cast, such a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Lopsided","review":"After the first 30 minutes I was ready to turn it off when Will Smith came on screen and saved it. After having lived in the South for two years, the southern accents came off as painfully unconvincing -- Hey Charlize, think you could try holding the accent for the ENTIRE sentence?! And the dialogue, who the hell wrote this, Robert James Waller? The biggest groaner, from an anonymous man on the street: \\"God Bless Savannah and the men she propagates!\\" Every character in the film speaks in godawful Hollywood-Southernisms; storms are always \\"a brewin'\\" and Charlize says 'ah declayuh!' --It's as if the screenwriters copped the dialect from Foghorn Leghorn and that 'Gone With the Wind' episode of Bugs Bunny. But even with this tortured dialogue, Will Smith's charm shined through. And after a while, the dialogue is kind of fun to rip on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"The Legend of Bagger Vance really touched. The symbolism and hidden meanings in the movie were numerous, making the viewer really reflect on his or her own life. All of sometimes fell as if we have lost our \\"Authentic Swing\\" at sometime or another. We would all be blessed if a Bagger Vance (played by Will Smith)would help us find it again. Robert Redford did a fine job in selecting the cast for this movie. Bagger should have had more scenes in between the golf tournament but the character was still solid. Matt Damon proved once again in this movie that he is one of the best talents in the acting profession today. Overall, this is the real deal.

I guess they were relate golf to life. It didn't work. The most irritating part of the movie was Bagger Vance (Will Smith).

It tries to be mystical and mysterious, but with sloppy cuts from scene to scene, and a poor plot, this movie falls apart early. Will Smith plays a character which should be hosting a show like Oprah, with all his deep thoughts on life. I became bored with that character within about two minutes. I don't know if it was just bad acting, a bad script, or both, but this movie was pretty pathetic. The only thing I liked about this movie was the sporting sequences where they actually were playing golf. If this movie was just about that without the lame story behind it, it whould have been much better.

Wait for Blockbuster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Film Adaptation... Misses Vital Elements of the Book","review":"This video would rate higher if there were no novel. If you enjoyed the novel, however, you will be sorely disappointed in this adaptation. There are two many missing plot lines to list, but the video comes across as a very one dimential show. The Charlize Theron charactor, who is barely in the book, is expanded into a main love interest, seemingly to \\"normalize\\" the Junah charactor. This fails miserably, as the only time Theron is even remotely interesting is during while she is stripping. Matt Damon appears way too young as the Junah charactor is supposed to have already played on a golf tour, fought in WWI for several years, been married & fathered a daughter, and travelled around Europe for several years after the war. In conclusion, there are worse movies out there, but there may not be a worse movie adaptation of a great novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fairy Tale","review":"I must confess, the critic in me tells me this isn't a particularly good movie. It has numerous flaws (including the curious casting of Will Smith) and, as others have said, it's a manipulative film (though, on the other hand, this type of story is supposed to be manipulative). I thought the World War flashback was a bit breezy for an event that had such numbing ramifications ... Yes, the critic in me has many reservations. However ... I loved the movie and watch it over and over again. I think this is because it is a fairy tale. Realism has no place in this sort of tale. It is a retelling of a story we've seen and heard many times before yet continually return to - the loss of our essential selves and the re-finding of that self. This is a great movie but only if you leave your cynicism at home and bring romanticism as your date.

Lets face it, it is simply a game, not some ancient Zen teaching that the Buddhists left us to figure out. Some good acting on the part of Matt Damon and Will Smith, but otherwise it was a very odd film. It was a film that also attempted to munipulate a simple game into something much larger then it really is. Not to mention it being incredibly boring! Directos must really come to face with the facts in the future, movies that are strictly about a sport aren't very good films, especially this one, where Will Smith tries to divulge the meaning of life through a golf game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Play Ruins Golf","review":"Matt Damon has a terrible swing and I would like a match with him if he reads this...Anytime, anywhere. Not only poor swing mechanics, but he, his playing partners and the whole movie take forever to play out shots. This may have been acceptable with a more compelling story, with major plot points explained or with chemistry among any of the actors. But in this case a 2 stroke penalty is in order. Sadly this film was one of Jack Lemon's last pictures, and one he should have never laced up his spikes for. Damon's southern accent sounded like Denzel Washington, and Will Smith and Charlize Theron also play over par. I've heard the book is a great read. Golf is difficult enough without having to put so much effort into this tale.Michael Durankowww.bootism.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor casting","review":"The problem with this picture, where at the premiere showing there were many walkouts is in the \\"casting.\\" Matt Damon is totally unbelievable as well as uninteresting in this movie. Pehaps the worse bit of casting is placing Joel Gretsch in the part of Bobbie Jones. Gretsch has only appeared in one previous film-a porno film, cannot act, everything is like in the same tone of voice, and he obviously is not ready for a role in a major motion picture. This film will open with the smallest gross of the three major releases set for Nov. 3rd. What a pity.

I work nights, and when I go home at 2 or 3 in the morning, the last thing I want to do is get out the scraper and scrape off the ice, snow or hard frost on a cold windshield. I got this knowing that it would be better for our environment than some of the methanol products available. This stuff performs quite well. Granted you do have to spritz a little more than you would the other products. Plus I like using the non-aerosol, which gives you more control and uses less product than the others, which can shoot across your car to the next one.The only issue I had with this product is that it left a grit on the windshield and sometimes caused streaking.

They actually have a well thought-out political view with which they assault anyone within a 40 mile radius. Adding a surprising twist to their ultra-liberal message, they are actually talente songwriters and musicians TOO! Agree with them or not, it is hard not to get absorbed in their music.Warning: Avoid this CD if you are offended by lines such as: \\"F*ck Zionism, F*ck Militarism, F*ck Americanism, F*ck Nationalism, F*ck Religion, F*ck Religion, F*ck Religion!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Large Disapointment","review":"This cd sucks.

If you do not know SW and are interested, do yourself a favor and get the MUCH BETTER albums Ungod first, then Wither Blister Burn & Peel. Darkest Days is a joke in comparison.

Check this record out yo. Its phat and whatnot. Actually, its none of that, its just really good. Easily my favorite, although the two previous are no slouches. Overall, good band, bad listeners.How is it that this band sells 4 copies of their albums and are great and Ms. (or Mrs.) Spears sells 400 billion. The world is ending and its no fun.

Chris hall will sing about anything that affects him deeply which is something of a rarety in music today. One thing about this cd is that it has the ability to make even a prozac eating hippy become a depressant. Every song is angry and distorted but thought the darkness and rain of the cd a ray ot light comes in the middle with the (in a way) love song \\"You complete me\\" The best song (I think) is \\"waking up beside you\\" It's a wonderful song will strong griping lyrics. The main subject portraied in the music is the pain and loss of loved ones(Girlfiends, friends) And the inablity to hold and keep together a happy,loving relationship.

Wither was truly mainstream, and Darkest brings them back from that to their industrial roots which shined so clearly in Ungod. Without Christopher Hall pouring his heart out in tracks like \\"Darkest Days\\" and \\"Waking up Beside You,\\" Stabbing Westward would just be another cheap NIN rip off like Gravity Kills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"The only reason i checked this cd out is cuz this girl i have a huge crush on likes SW so i bought the cd.

Also if you enjoyed this album I would also recommend UNGOD which is their first album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent But Not Their Best","review":"I think my primary problem with this album was how moody it is. I realize that Stabbing Westward is a moody band, but this album just didn't stand up to the test of time like their previous works did. I can only take so much dispair and anger. Eventually, you have to get up and do something about it.

They flat-out kick ass. However, they have a few minor flaws that could use some work, BUT THIS IS ALL CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM. First of all, they rely too much on guitars and samples. I just don't think they take advantage of their drums as much as they could, (I don't mean samples, I mean real drums) because it could make their music even more powerful. Of course, this may be because I'm a drummer, but that aside, their drums are a valuable asset they haven't yet utilized to its full potential. Also, Christopher Hall's (I think he's the lead singer, apologies if I'm mistaken) voice reaches a point after awhile where he's just sort of whining. He could change tempos a little more, it would really help the dynamics of the music, and make it still more moody. But this is a very impressive album, and a definite buy if you enjoy metal, industrial, or electronica."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a follow-up!!","review":"Considering the power of the music, the straight forward (if not unimaginative) writing style, and the true grit of Christopher Hall's voice, this album completely rocks!

It was produced by Dave Jerden who did a great job with Janes Addiction and Alice in chains- so seemed like a safe bet.The last track is great and worth my 2 quid (starts off Tubeway Army then riffs nicely) but the rest is pseudo depression music for middle class children who have no real problem beyond not being allowed to get their tongue pierced. Its like music for school kids written by the teachers.Everything about this album is contrived. I cannot hear any self expression, art or even meaning in any of these woefully cheesy pop songs. The most annoying thing about this record is that it tries so painfully hard to be deep, heavy and modern and it is none of these things.File under mild cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not industrial ...","review":"This is pure,easy listening pop music.If you want industrial music then listen to Ministry,NIN,Skinny Puppy,VAST,Coil,KMFDM,Cabarett Voltaire,Front 242,Einstuerzende Neubauten,Throbbing Gristle,Pig,Laibach and Foetus.Hail Industrial !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Industrial Rock Perfection!!!","review":"This wicked, totally underrated album by Stabbing Westward should be way more popular than it is!! The brooding, melancholy vocals coupled with loud, guitar-heavy music makes for a totally engrossing experience. Any industrial or hard rock fan should have this in their collection. With all the pop and hip hop garbage that owns the music chart these days, it pains me when an album of such talent and power as \\"Darkest Days\\" fails to do well. Furthermore, now that Stabbing Westward has broken up we'll never see another fantastic industrial rock album like this again! If you agree with me at all, you owe it to yourself to pick up this album. It's inexpensive, and it's absolutely awesome!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"when I first heard this I was shocked. I've never heard such a great industrial album. It's definitely matured. My definite favorite, on the other hand is \\"How Can I Hold On\\", one of the best industrial/gothic songs I've ever heard. Unlike Gravity Kills, SW hit harder and have a more developed band. Chris Hall and Co. were on tour with Sister Soleli and NIN which are both great. This here is a must. You'll be very happy you decided to buy this. Almost as good as The Fragile by NIN, this is also genius. Save Yourself wasn't even the best song. I first checked this out by samples but you know even from that that this is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best work by Stabbing Westward","review":"Two words descibe this album: Powerful and Catchy. Every song on the album has its own unique sound, and most of the songs are excellent. \\"Everything I Touch\\", Track 2 on the album uses the words \\"Everything I touch I break\\", sung in a very catchy way, and makes you feel SW's helplessness in the song. \\"Save Yourself\\" has experienced a lot of radio play. \\"Haunting Me\\" is also very catchy. My personal favorite is track 8, \\"Torn Apart\\". The lyrics are the type that I can relate to, as can anybody (if they try). Overall, I say this album is great...definitely buy this if you liked \\"Wither, Blister, Burn & Peel\\". You will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful!","review":"Great music style, one of the few NIN kind of bands that actually match up with NIN ( industrial metal, that's what they call it ).If you're a new skool goth, buy it, you'll love this thing so much that you'll kill yourself because of it. If you dislike goth stuff, then don't buy this album for the lyrics, it's hearing a person whine and brag about their self esteem problems and the such, but the music is still heavy and pretty hearable.The bad of the band itself is the fact that they only talk about their own self loathing and self esteem problems, they don't seem to open the subject more than it. Unless you identify with the band's whinnings then you won't like it. And that takes 3 stars outta the album... it's deep, but deep within a teardrop in the middle of a tropical forest and nothing more than that.But even so, don't mind my opinion, if you like fast industrial metal with lots of moanings, buy this thing, you'll probably like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stabbing Westward","review":"Darkest Days has to be SW's best album to date. Ungod was the music where you could definately tell it was made in the early 90's(Im not downgrading it at all), and Wither, Blister, Burn, and Peel was unbearably awesome untill I heard Darkest Days. I love how it's not just individual songs, but as how they flow together like a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One hell of a roller coaster ride","review":"At first listen to this CD, you are taken by the variety of sounds the album contains. Some are dark and heavy, some are soft and personal. But when you put the pieces together you get one hell of an album. Though it isnt a concept album, Darkest Days seems to start out with depressing songs and then moves onto more inspirational songs about our will to survive the trials and tribulations of life. The songs all seem to blend perfectly together, making listening to the whole CD straight through enjoyable. This is a very impressive CD and I wouldnt even consider myself a fan of the industrial-metal scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"I thought the music is really cool, though the lyrics are somewhat repetetive. Overall the Cd is very good and would be great for prople who like the Hunger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This CD is unbelievable. These guys get better with every album. I cant wait for their next album. \\"Save Yourself\\" is the best song ever written in history. Its to bad you cant listen to it as a sampler . . . . o'well. BUY THIS CD NOW!(thats if there are any left, it took me forever to find a store where it didnt sold out)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel it slipping away...","review":"Five top reasons why this is their worst album by far: 1. \\"When I'm dead\\", 2. \\"On your way down\\", 3. \\"You complete me\\", 4. \\"Desperate now\\" and finally, the headless guy on the inside of the sleeve. If you do not know SW and are interested, do yourself a favor and get the MUCH BETTER albums Ungod first, then Wither Blister Burn & Peel. Darkest Days is a joke in comparison. Laughably horrible lyrics and terribly forced riffs plague this album. Instead of progressing, SW has been regressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're even better live...","review":"Just adding my .02 to all the rest of you great SW fans who've been here before me. I heard SW on the radio back in the early 90's...\\"What do I have to do?\\" from W,B,B+P and I just loved it. Bought the CD and loved the whole thing esp. \\"So Wrong\\". Then, 4 long years later comes \\"Darkest Days\\" and it blows W,B,B+P away! And I have the chance to see them up close and personal in a small local club. And let me tell you if you don't know: they rock live! The energy, the sound, the light-show! What a blast! And their sound was awesome-- so often bands just tyr to be so loud, but they were perfect. you could understand almost every word Chris Hall uttered and hear every spooky effect from the keyboards and programming. If they're coming to you town (check Stabbing Westward www.stabbingwestward.com if that html don't work) go and SEE THEM you will not be disappointed. Save Yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't pay enough for this CD","review":"Stabbing Westward is easily one of the best bands in history. The smooth mixture between heavy and soft music creates a sound unlike any other. The lyrics bring out every emotion you can think of, and it's just a straight out amazing CD(though not their best-that title goes to Ungod). What I really like is how they can get heavy, with screaming vocals, and it still manages to hold its melodic rhythm. This was the first Stabbing Westward CD I bought, and it gained my intrest in one of the world's greatest bands. BUY THIS CD RIGHT NOW! You'll take it home and never want to stop listening to it. It's simple as that. So quit reading this. Buy the CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD connects to people's emotions and rings true.","review":"A friend of mine introduced me to Stabbing Westward. I got the CD, and every time I am in a bad mood I listen to it and it helps. The lyrics are depressing but they strike to the heart and soul of a person. The songs and harmonies are haunting and beautiful. I highly recommend this CD to anyone with an appreciation for rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, Emotional, Threatening, BRILLIANT!!!","review":"Having heard one song, and a re-mix of another off this album, I decided to buy it. After listening to it once, I immediately listened to it again, and again, and again. It grabs you with the powerful \\"Darkest Days\\", and throws you around with the strong lyrics, brilliant effect work and a really flowing, heavy sound. By far the best album I have ever heard, and all the songs are as good as each other. A must buy for anybody who enjoys anything alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redefines Industrial ! ! !","review":"Stabbing Westward is a band that has some of the best industrial songs that I have heard in a long time. I mean, tracks like \\"Save Yourself\\", \\"How Can I Hold On (Dog Attack)\\", \\"Drugstore\\", and \\"The Thing I Hate...\\" are juist astounding. They really push ahead through their genre. The guitar work is very good, but there have been better guitarists. The bass is worked very well and I am proud to say that the bassist is quite frankly one of the best in the genre. The keyboards is the highlight of the album. The synthing and playing are very talented and mindbending. Especially on \\"How Can I Hold On (Dog Attack). The vocals are very strange. His voice is squeaky clean which in most cases really are not the good, but some how, it really fits in this. The album in a whole is excellent, and is one that shows true talent and energy...-MC"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD that is the soundtrack to my life","review":"I have always been a Stabbing Westward fan. From the release of Ungod to the depths of Wither, blister, burn, and peel, I notice the pure and raw emotion that emits from the music. It tells itself in a story, never stopping from one track to the next, one album to the next. Always becoming its unbecoming. As I listen to this, feelings arise that would otherwise be difficult to deal with. This album makes it seem as though my feelings are shared, and understood. Its a great CD, and shows growth of the band as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent phone not as heavy duty as the original","review":"I got it at my local Target for roughly half of some of the prices on here.***Update...stopped working, more Chinese made junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cute....however","review":"The first review I have ever written. I got this for my girls' room last Christmas and sadly it broke over the summer. It will not hang up, it just will have a dial tone and then that annoying blast.

It may look great, but it is the worst phone I have ever had. Before every call, all you can hear is static while dialing and during the first part of your conversation. The static ultimately goes away, but what a ridiculous issue to have with a brand new phone! I didn't hook it up until the return window had closed. I never thought I'd have to send it back!

You could rattle the handset around and hear it bonking from side to side. I could hardly hear anyone after that, and I hadn't owned the phone for more than 2 months when this happened. Pain in the neck. So we gave the phone to the thrift store, just in case someone who was handy enough to fix such a think might find it.

However watching these shows on DVD really makes you appreciate how much Groening and his people put in the background. The commnetaries are OK, but sometimes they drag and are just the people watching the show. Also, Billy West (Fry, Professor, others)while talented doesn't add very much. But the commentaries with John Di Maggio (Bender, and others) really are pretty funny, give you some good background.If you are a Simpsons fan or a Futurama Fan, you will like these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"Sent as gift to son-in-law serving in Iraq.

The series pilot explains the general plot of the whole show and I found that I like the show now more than I did before, and I DID like it before.For humor, Matt Groening can't be beat and for a measly thirty bucks you can laugh ...for hours! This show has it all and pokes fun at every part of life.For those of us younger folk with a cynical chip on our shoulders, Bender becomes a hero with his sharp wit and put downs.If you like the Simpsons or Douglas Adams, you'll love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Futurama does not disappoint","review":"The DVDs are of pretty good quality and have a reasonable amount of the standard extras, the best of which is the commentary which always feel like the folks behind the show just hanging out. It's much more interesting than most commentaries. In terms of the show's content, you can see that it was early days for the show back then and it got better over time, but it even then some of its best episodes came out of this season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Futur-larious!","review":"Futurama is awesome! I love the way the writers think in terms of plot. The episodes are good on humor and twisting things and the series itself is actually an EXCELLENT commentary on history and the American society. The only thing I don't like about this series is that after awhile, the constant approach to humor that goes, \\"I'm saying one thing, then arbitrarily doing the exact opposite just for the hell of it!\\" gets a little old. There are plenty of times where it's quite effective, don't get me wrong, but when it's the main source of humor I get the feeling that they're dealing with writer's block. But, that's a minor point. If you like the Simpsons, if you don't like the Simpsons, who cares--this series is NOTHING like the Simpsons (even though the creator is the same as the one of the Simpsons).So what are you waiting for?

But even in that,there's not a lot of seperation between left and right,and a lot of times,the music is coming out of the center speaker!C'mon!Even The Simpsons Season 1 had a better sound mix than this!Like I said,it's just a minor complaint,which hopefully will be rectified by season 2.

I was so glad that I bought this box set. It looks like other people here have already put show descriptions on, so I will save you all time. Just buy it, watch it, love it, and when the next season comes out on DVD, buy that one too. The characters are a riot, and the different aliens, spaceships, and story lines are wonderful. I love the show because, just like the simpsons, I notice a new joke or detail every time I watch it. Matt did a wonderful job at creating a new world for us to escape to where our best friends are a really stupid 20 something year old, an alcoholic robot, a professor whos mind is starting to go due to age, and a hot chick with one eye.

Based on contemporary accounts, author Maurice Collis, a former British colonial administrator who served himself in the region, tells the harrowing story of a missionary's adventures among hostile natives, pirates, Portuguese colonists and his Buddhist counterparts at the Arakanese court. The title of the book refers to a sacred, golden statue of the Lord Buddha, which was the center of a cult of veneration in Mrauk-U, the capital of Arakan.A very knowledgeable historian and talent story-teller, Collis places the friar's tale in its historical setting, touching upon Portuguese imperialism, the spread of Buddhism and the history of the sacred image itself.Originally published in 1943 it is a good thing that this excellent work has been re-issued."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good book.","review":"For the most part was a good book and with detailed research to back up the authors assertions.

Well, this book was not helpful to me in any way. He seems to be focused on his own agenda in many areas and not on real, regular people. When he does offer insight or advice it is very simplistic, generic and obvious, for example - just \\"forgive yourself\\". He doesn't have anything original or interesting to say, he's not clued in to REAL issues affecting every day people, and he doesn't offer anything in the book that is even remotely helpful.

To be honest, it really looked no better than the DVD I have. It's quite grainy, and dark in some spots. Add to that, when the disc is thrown in, the movie starts right up, which I thought was strange. Then I realized that is because there is no menu for the movie at all. Are you serious?

(I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 only because I couldn't quite do a \\"hate it\\" and bring the overall review score down too much.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"the Truth....its a great movie","review":"Watched this movie as a young teenage girl and fell in love with it.

A must-see for anyone who has ever fallen in love."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little disappointed","review":"I was a little disappointed with my purchase. I do NOT like bootleg movies and once I played the DVD it was obvious that it had been copied from a legal DVD copy. The sound quality wasn't horrible but throughout the entire movie the sound is kinda static and shaky. I'm pretty sure I'm just spend more money and go buy it from the store. I did receive the movie in a very good time frame though and it was neatly packaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth hurts, well sorta.","review":"The Truth about Cats & Dogs is one of the better films of the '90s. This film is so true to life that it kinda hurts. Jeanne Garofalo plays the so-called ugly duckling to the glamorous, long-legged Uma Thurman. The two have little in common but both of them fall for a charming brit played by Ben Chaplin. This film is so cute, I never get sick of watching it. This film makes you think and you might just see a bit of yourself in it. I highly recommend The Truth about Cats & Dogs. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"delightful little comedy","review":"I'm not the biggest fan of these romantic comedies but I found this one very funny and entertaining.

However, the scenes are coming off as dark (as in unlighted) and without needed contrast. There was also one point where the DVD skipped. For less than $6 the DVD was worth it, but if it had been any more I would return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice (Uma is too:)","review":"This movie has all the right ingridients that make it great. It is a \\"feel good\\" movie and after watching it it cheered me up and put a smile on my face. It doesn't \\"try\\" to be funny, like lesser movies do, it \\"is\\" funny. The cast work well together, but, Uma Thurman just shines through. She is cute, sexy and funny and is pleasing on the eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as universal as expected","review":"I wanted to upgrade our old IKEA multi storage, but this one didn't accommodate the foil or paper towel rolls (standard sized). Also, changing out an empty roll involves some disassembly of the holding brackets, which affects the other roll not needing replacement at the same time.

But the power connector for my laptop wouldn't remain connected when the case was closed as it stuck out too far(one of the selling features). And then the zips failed. By the time I used it on a flight I was reduced to using the zip fastener on it's own to hold one side closed, as the zip had become permanently untied together. And then it came off the tracks completely.Basically, I would suggest not using this product.... And could the webpage at least use a proper picture for it, rather than a damaged one?!

This xylophone is great. It comes with four little songs that are not only color coded, but also have the actual notes written out on the staff. It's a great way to introduce a young child to music. The plates are in tune and the base is made of sturdy plastic. If this goes rolling down a set of stairs, it is going to be just fine. I like it and so does my daughter!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bad Bad","review":"Ordered this for my one year old. I play all instruments by ear. I am highly sentitive to the sounds that even toy instruments produce, and this one does not even come close. I have seen and own toy xylaphones that sound WAY better than this one. Not one single bell is in tune, and if I try to play a song on it, it does not even sound like the song I am trying to play. If you want your child to actually play music instead of making noise, do not order this!!!! Gave it to the Goodwill."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even meant to be a musical toy","review":"Completely out of tune. I don't expect a toy like this to be perfect, but you can't even play any recognizable tunes. What's the point of music sheets if no one can recognize what you're playing anyway.I called customer service and they told me that it's not intended to be a musical instrument (even though they clearly advertise this product to have \\"clear and accurate tones\\"). I was told that it's just meant to be a toy for banging on. When I brought the discrepancy on the product description to their attention, they didn't seem to care at all. They also told me that I should tap on it lightly. First, that doesn't make a difference. Second, a toy for toddlers that's meant to be tapped on lightly?! Seriously?!

I contacted Little Tykes' customer support, and was told that it wasn't supposed to be a usable instrument, just a toy. Er... My toddler has plenty of toys, but I wanted her to learn music, hence the xylophone.After I pressed them on their purported high standards, CS relented and offered to replace it, but the only option was to destroy the toy and send them proof, after which they'd send me another--with no guarantee that the next one would be in tune. I'd rather cut my losses and give this one to Goodwill than deal with the hassle.Lesson Learned: I won't ever buy an instrument online again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly out of tune","review":"This thing would be a fine toy except the pitch is so off, the songs are barely recognizable. The toy is little more than a fun noisemaker... but don't expect any musical ability to be nurtured by this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of tune!","review":"This xylophone is completely out of tune. The smallest bar actually has a lower pitch than the one next to it. I was disappointed that Little Tikes would make a musical instrument and not even take the time to make it in tune.

Unlike other child xylophones we've used, this one is completely out of tune.We tried playing 'twinkle twinkle little star' and 'Mary had a little lamb' on it but it's not possible with the bizarre notes assigned to the keys.It appears they had a manufacturing problem or quality control issue and sent them out anyway.This xylophone might pass as a toy but don't get it if you want to teach your child music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"We had this toy and returned it in 24 hours. I wanted a xylophone for my daughter who asked for one at age 2. This was a poor example of a xylophone. There are 2 keys that are the same length and therefore play the same note. The string for the mallet is so short you can hardly enjoy hitting the keys. It's durable and colorful, but that's not enough for parents to endure the shrill noise that comes from playing it. Little Tikes needs to go back to the drawing board on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of tune","review":"Really wish I had seen these reviews on the terrible sound quality (both tone and pitch) of this xylophone.

First of all, only 5 of the keys were in tune. One was so badly out of tune that even my 5 year old could tell the difference. If you can't actually play a simple tune or a scale on it, what's the point? I might as well give my kids pots and a wooden spoon and save my money. Also, you'd need to actually cut the cord to use the little hammer. My 2 year old was immediately frustrated by not being able to reach the last key easily.

George attends a class reunion at his disgruntled wife's suggestion and hooks up with his old high school band. Amazingly they start getting bookings which forces George to examine his career, his marriage and his family life and decide what his priorties really are.If you are a fan of Billy Ray Cyrus music you will enjoy the covers and the original tunes performed in the movie.

Sooo disappointed with the product. Billy Ray is a successful businessman with a beautiful wife and daughter. Music has always been his first love and he has reached a stage in his life when he wants to cut back on the corporate stuff and return to his musical roots - much to the annoyance of his less than supportive wife!! The acting is poor; there is no chemistry whatever between the two leads and the script doesn't really go anywhere - e.g. there is a potential new love interest thrown in - but nothing really happens and you are left to wonder - do they get it together or don't they? Finally,and perhaps most important of all - the music doesn't excite. All in all a great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"really just a poncho","review":"I completed the order on Monday and received it Wednesday with standard shipping.

I'd send it back but I've already paid the $8 to ship it here, plus it would be another few bucks to send it back and $5 for a restocking fee.

I was disappointed with this DVD set, do not plan to purchase future Angel DVDs, and even ended up giving away Season 2 because I never want to watch it again.

What really made season two great, at least for the first half of the season, was Julie Benz's tragically wonderful performance as Angel's sire, Darla. Not only did the character grow and become more than just a vampire killer, we got to learn more of the background behind hers and Angel's tempestuous relationship; including how Darla was sired by The Master. This was also a really great season for the supporting players, Cordelia and Wesley most of all. An of course we can't forget Andy Hallett's tour de force performance as the Host, Lorne. As the season progressed we got to know more about him, about what he can do, and where he came from. Not to mention the fact that he can sing! The end sets up season three, which is almost as good a season."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spin-off that's better than the original show.","review":"Just as Buffy was beginning to wind down, Angel was just getting started. Season two introduces us to Gun, Lorne and Fred; three of the Angel's current cast and solidifies the show's horror/comedy theme.

There are some really interesting episodes and some that are a bit silly but this is Angel, well worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess this was an experimental year for Angel","review":"Season two of Angel is not that great. It has one or two episodes that are really good but it is pretty cheesy on the whole. The first and third seasons were great but season two seemed like an experimental year. I don't think the writers knew where Angel was going at the time. I bought this DVD because I want to have every season of Angel on DVD. I didn't buy it because I love it and think it's a landmark season. The episodes are pretty weak and the extras are even more sad. There are a couple of extras but they are only seven or eight minutes long. You would think that Fox would have good extras to make up for the bad episodes of Angel. Season four of Buffy was not very good but it was full of extras. Why couldn't this set be full of good extras? I would just save my money for Season three if I were you and skip this volume.

The Maestro compares film making to painting because of the interplay of color and light.

The best songs here are \\"Butter\\", \\"Perfect\\", and \\"Slip\\". Try to also see them live, too, because their shows are packed full of ultra heavy noise from this Santa Barbara band. Ultraspank have a new album out on May 30. Pick it up first so you don't have to lie about getting into it before everyone else (I took that from a review of Full Devil Jacket).

But the movie is a delight. Macaulay Culkin is Henry, the young child who has everyone fooled into thinking he is a great kid. But he is really a youngster who loves to watch death. Elijah Wood(the kid in this movie who knows how to act) comes off much better as Mark, Henry's cousin and the only kid who knows Henry's true personality. The music is wonderful. Elmer Bernstein is a genius. And what can I say, even my mom liked the photography! I first saw the \\"TELEVISED\\" version on TV, following the real movie. Not a thing was changed! The reason for its R rating is Theme. Period. The violence is off screen, and besides Henry's one use of the \\"F-word\\" and some other expletives, there is nothing really here.

I must admit I was slightly disturbed by Macaulay Culkins character. He was bizarre and his actions appalling for a twelve year old. On the other hand, Elijahs performance was the relief of the movie. The innocence and childlike fear he conveyed exactly matched my emotions. The disgust and hatred he felt toward Macaulay's character was intense and he captured the essence of his character completely. Elijahs performance was the heart of the movie. Overall, the movie was suspenseful and interesting. Even so, it is not for the faint of heart or conservative watchers.

Perhaps this would be a candidate for the genre. Culkin and Wood are scripted and directed to talk and act like adults, throwing themselves at each other in knockdown dragouts, like little men. Elijah Wood is adorable, of course, and works in hard earnest. Macauley Culkin is a delight to hate; somehow the director must have picked up that by this point in the early 1990s we were all sick of him? Whatever the reason for this casting, and whatever transformations of maturity Culkin may have since undergone, he remains a right howl in this one.

I saw it first in 1993 and as a young boy, it did truly scare the wits out of me. But it is not very scary after the first viewing. The ending is always predictable but still rather well done. Yet, Culken is used as if he is the wire hanger. The rest of the crew and cast is the shirt and depends on the wire hanger to hold it up. A cute, young Elijah Wood can be seen in it.

UT was the best multi-player internet game,,, and 2003 just raised it up two more levels. Graphics are a 10, sound 10, gameplay is 10 evrything is improved. Also the people that dont like the weapons now are because they have no skill. You use to get away with some wreckless wild shooting because the blast radius is so big... now they are smaller but the weapons are even more powerfull.. you have to hit what your are aiming at,, no more luck.... oh well no wonder jcb56678 doesn't like this game and has NO SKILL<> COME GET SOME!

The sounds were so good, they made your spine tingle. So clear, so loud, and so well defined. When you fired a weapon, you knew it was going to sound good and rock the walls of your room.The same cannot be said for Unreal Tournament 2003. The weapons sound downright bland and boring. It is amazing that the game's developers would allow such a game to be released knowing that it's sounds are not nearly as good as its previous release.The only hope for UT2003 in terms of sound quality is if a sound upgrade pack is offered for it as a free download."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Eye Candy","review":"I played the demo and couldn't believe it sucked. So I called a friend who had the game to play for myself the full version and it still sucked.This is a Quake 3 rip-off. If I wanted Quake I'd go buy that. UT2k3 is all graphics and nothing else. It makes me wonder what they packed into the 2+ gigs this monstrousity takes on the harddrive. Even the original doom plays better. Developers have to understand that graphics don't make a game (just as special effects don't necessarily make a good movie). It is like finding out the prettiest guy/girl in college has gum disease, herpes, half rotten teath, and a stink issue. Good to look at, but you wouldn't want to touch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is nothing like what it tries to be. It's got extremely spammy weapons, terribly sloppy physics and the graphics and lighting are a joke. For example, you see shadows, but the objects for the shadows don't exist. The water is totally fake and jello (not even bubbles) and the lighting is all out of place. The double jumping is really fake feeling and the adrenaline power ups everyone absolutely hates. Plus, there is no cheat protection like Quake 3 has (PunkBuster).In fact, this game tries to be like Quake 3 and fails miserably with poor physics, terrible graphics, and spammy gameplay.If you want a truly intense first person shooter, with better weapon balance, and very solid physics and graphics, just get Quake 3!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Exciting at first, but dies a quick death","review":"At first this game really blew me away. The graphics and sound are impressive and the gameplay, and weapons in particular, are very cool. The novelty soon wears off though. The game is now gathering dust on my hard drive (hmmmm... I really should get that looked at), and once I completed the single player mode and got tired of multi-player, it didn't look like such a wise investment. I actually don't think the gameplay is particularly interesting long-term, and it all feels pretty \\"samey\\" after a while, but that's just my opinion. If you're a multi-player freak and have a good connection, you'll probably get a lot of fun out of playing online, at least for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game,great graphics, but you need a good pc to play it","review":"This is probably one of the best games Epic's created, but my computer's video card is not as good as others.

They put out a top-notch product that can be customized heavily (modders rejoice!). However, they seriously lacked in gameplay and in new ideas. It is almost EXACTLY the same as its predecessor, Unreal Tournament (with minor alterations on weapons such as the minigun and the addition of the game mode Bombing Run). You can spend your money on this if you want, but I would rather have spent my money on a game that has innovative gameplay over a game with only new graphics and engine."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOURE KIDDING","review":"Please, anyone who played the original Unreal will know that they took away all the cool stuff and emphasized the crap !Gone is the wonderful sniper rifle.Gone is the balance between all weapons (now 2 weapons are superpowerful)Gone is the stearable Redeemer (the new one steers like a bus)Gone is realistic movements (one second hes there, next hes not)Gone is any skillThis game sucks, online and off. Only the bombing run (online) is slightly fun, but is always screwed by guys who make the teams unbalanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"KickS As","review":"Ok in short. This game is great. The people that don't like it can suck a orange. If you are looking for a great FPS then buy it. No its not UT! Its a new game that is Mod-able. So if you want to change something write a mod.

And finished with nothing.I must preface this by saying that I always preferred Quake 3 Arena to Unreal Tournament, but this is bad even for that franchise. The gameplay is slow, the highly reviewed 'realistic lighting' is all but non-existant, and the AI couldn't hit an elephant with a cannon at 3 feet.If you're looking for a new thrill, relive Quake 3 on Nightmare, wait for Doom 3, and save your pennies."},{"rating":"2","title":"UT Rocks. UT 2003 Rocks a little less","review":"With Linux support right out of the box, UT 2003 really rocks. Now, if it only were as fast and as fun to use (violent?) as UT was/is... I guess that I will use my copy of UT 2003 to play when I'm so tired of playing UT... To play it resonably fast, one has to turn off a lot of dynamic settings and lower bit-depth and resolution. With UT I could play at full 32bit mode and 1280x1024 with my system; with UT 2003 if I do that the games becomes so [bad] that it's not even fun to see it. And after turning off most of the dynamic lighting/decals, etc... then it goes a little faster, but then what's the point? I have a pretty fast system and a lot of memory, so that's not the issue... In any case, I do like the game, just not as much as UT..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The new Unreal falls far short of the old one","review":"Boring game play and lack of fighting detail.

FPS DM/CtF type games are a proven winner, this one takes it to the next level. Speaking of levels, you'll find plenty in this one- enough to keep you busy for quite a while.Something that made the first UT so good are the people out there who write mods for the game- you will find such people for UT2K3 as well, these provide you with some very interesting changes in the game; assuring that you will not get tired of Unreal Tournament 2003 for quite a few days (months? years? milleniums?)Overall, this game was done *perfectly* in my sight- the ai and weaponrly seems balanced, there is just nothing i could think of that would make the game any better. If i could give it 6 stars I would. Enjoy Unreal Tournament 2003 - it's money you won't regret spending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the multiplayer.","review":"I like this game..I've noticed a lot of the reviewers here didn't like it but let me make a few things clear.This game's strength lies in its multiplayer, the single player couldn't hold my interst, I had the most fun playing on servers with new and unusual maps and mutators.Don't even bother with the campain unless your learning how to play, go for the instant action mode its much more fun without the pressure of having to win to advance. Even so the instant action is more practice than anything.The graphics are amazing, if you have a relatively high end system you can run it with max everything with pretty much no slowdown. Also for the most fun you should have a broadband connection.While this game probly isn't nearly as good a the orignal, open up a few new mods and you can have lots of fun.have a slow comp and narrowband???Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Priest Reviews UT2k3","review":"So this is like... a fighting game right?

I should have checked the demo at unreal2003.com before bying this as I assumed that this would be better technology but similar to UT. I miss the bow, sniper and some realistic weapons as well as maps. It was fun playing dm-bathroom , morpheus etc. in UT.Multiplayer connection/lookup is faster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing...","review":"This games boasts more of an engine than an actual game. I don't doubt the engine's capabilities, it does render gorgeous graphics and the polygon count on the models are very impressive. But it would seem to me that the developers spent more time on the engine development than on the gameplay design. It has not changed much from the original Unreal Tournamnent and I found the gameplay to be repetitive and monotonous. The only \\"breath-of-fresh-air\\" in this game is \\"Bombing Run\\", but it still won't improve my overall impression of this game.In a nutshell, this game is BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"The Demo played smoothly, but I purchsed the full version today and so far its been awful. ... System freezes, texture problems, sound problems are just a few of the things plagueing this game.I have several games that are more more system intensive, and play great. This game is just terribly engineered. 4 year wait...I would wait a few months for the dust to clear. Or shelve this.

I am newly introduced to the series so it will take me a while to get the hang of the multiplayer experience and the game in general.Other than that the game is fun to play.

The only real good thing I have to say is that the levels are interesting and the graphics are really smooth and nice. But then again I really dont buy 3d shooters for necessarily their graphics. I buy them for their game quality and this hangs one the worst game qualities of the decade. ... Its double feature move would never work against human players.

It is a good mix and balance of tutorial and reference material, explained in a clear way. Visual C# is the brand new general purporse language that you can use to write any kind of application. Mr. Williams teaches you the language first, and then he shows how to use the .NET libraries with your applications. So you get an excellent foundation before dealing with the .NET framework.The narrative is very easy to read and understand, and it will help you to see that the learning curve for C# is almost the same as VB.NET. This is the language of 21st century and with this book you will be a proficient C# developer in a short time, trust me.I am a former VB6 user and moving to Visual C# with this book was a wise move and an easy one. Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly done - Basically C# for Dummies","review":"I've been using C# for 3 years, but purchased this book hoping to glean some new stuff on C# and .NET.

However, this author definitely is not included in that list and shouldn't be writing professional books.

The author is apparently stretching himself too thin by taking on such a big assignment, and could have done a much better job by sticking to c# itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"This book lost the ground of its course.

Even the songs I was excited to actually find on here aren't the original versions of the songs, some are remixed, some are edited, and some that should be edited, like the mindless \\"Chlorine Bacon Skin\\", aren't. I'm glad Prince can be so proflific and release 10 CDs of music a year, but when the music stops being creative and starts being bland and repetitive then he loses the prolific status, no matter how many CDs he releases every month.

So I picked it up, thinking that Lagwaggon would rule and stuff. Nope. This album is just bad music. Sure Angry Days is listenable, and the remake of Bad Moon Rising is novel, but other then that, save your money. I hear that newer Lagwaggon stuff is good.

The unit works anywhere in our 17' boat. We only use our bow mount intermittently as we drift along the river's edge. The position of the on-off switch in the upper right corner of unit makes it very awkward when compared to the corded foot pedals we had on other Minn Kota's. With those, the motor would stop when we released our foot. Likely we will go back to a corded foot pedal.

She couldn't continue to write about something she didn't understand. It was that simple. Her books were about love-and Devan was a failure at love. She knew that Ryan was a brilliant editor, sensitive and fair.

Once Ryan finds Devon, he's astounded to find the woman he's admired for years, emotionally battered and determined to hide her head and heart in the sand. Devon doesn't appreciate the emotions Ryan forces her to feel, especially the ones that are making her feel alive again.This is another emotionally intense love story.

And with 15-20 seconds per music selection before it repeats itself, you will go nuts before you've listened to it for even one minute.

After doing an internet search, I found that others and a review also reported that this drive does not work with Vista. I thought it was very unethical for Lacie not to tell me up front that it does not work and maybe I should return it. They claim it does work. As soon as I confronted the technical support with the review that Lacie specification is not correct, they answered with that I should open another ticket for that complaint.

Then there are the maddening lengthy descriptions of the impossibly intricate sensory and illusory, cumputerized systems creating the characters (mostly their avatars), their environments and everything else.

It wasted a lot of bubble fluid also. I was upset when it completely stopped working around 4-5 weeks after purchasing.

It was a hit. We can use it in the house or outside. It goes through bubble soap fast, so here's a tip: turn it off and on. Just let a few bubbles go out, turn it off, let the kids do their thing, turn it on, repeat. Bubbles last longer and kids aren't overwhelmed by the sheer number of bubbles.Best part of all, you aren't blowing bubbles until you feel about ready to pass out.We've had it for a month and so far, it's still fine.

At first use it had issues. It comes with a weak fan that has a hard time blowing and I often had to turn the machine off and let it rest a while in order for it to work. This machine also doesn't work well on flat surfaces. I had to physically hold it up in the air at an angle in order for it to push any bubbles out and even that only worked for short periods at a time.

What happened to well-constructed American toys? For one thing, it eats up WAY too many batteries. They should make it run on a 9V one instead. All those AAs cost money! And then after a couple months it just stopped working altogether. My husband tried to open it up and fix it and could only get it running again by wrapping the whole thing up in black electrical tape. Everytime it stopped working my toddler son and I had to jiggle it just right for something to connect right again. Frustration, frustration.

They could play with it for hours. The Gazillion bubbles brand bubbles last much longer than other brands - but then again, cost much more. So you can use the cheapy bubbles but will have to refill more often.Problem: Toy doesn't turn on anymore.

I should have followed suit but this was a little cheaper. And Gazillion does have great bubbles, but the machine sucks. It never blew a single bubble out of the machine. I changed batteries twice, let it run for 30 minutes, washed it three times, tried two versions og bubbles. Not a single bubble, not one.

There is a drastic difference when compared to some other brands.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This bubble machine does have one thing going for it. It shoots tons of bubbles, just like it says. But because it blows bubbles so quickly, it runs out quickly too. I've also found it difficult to use.

I have 2 year old twin boys and I wasn't blowing bubbles fast enough, and the other 2 machines hardly blew bubbles the first time, but Ive used this one at least 5 times and I am impressed, I have still yet to try it with regular bubble mix which might defeat the goodness of having to buy the special mix all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase!

This machine produces many, many bubbles, and gazillion bubble solution is the best you will find out there. the battery compartment is above the fan and bubble solution, so solution does not drip into there to clog it up, as other reviewers have said. I simply rinse mine with cold water after each use and things have continued to work very, very well. My two year old loves playing outside while the bubbles are going, and asks for it ALL THE TIME! It's also fun for grown ups, because let's face it....you never really outgrow the wonder of bubbles!

I also bought a large refill for later.This toy is going to be a great accessory for photo shoots. Nothing gets my little girl giggling like bubbles.It uses 6 AA batteries. A tip to new bubble blowers: Shaking the bubble solution, causing foam, makes them not work very well. It always happens when my daughter handles the bubble solution. Whenever that happens, I always have to wait until the majority of the foam is gone before it will make decent bubbles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun while they (yes, we've been through 3) lasted","review":"Great fun to begin with, tons and tons of bubbles.Unfortunately we haven't had one live more than a week or so - we don't overfill it, we clean it with each use, we store it indoors, we replace the batteries to verify that isn't the issue, etc.They simply aren't durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet, another disappointment","review":"We bought this for our daughter 2 weeks ago and when we got home, she absolutely loved it.

My one complaint has been about the yellow rope. After one year in the midwest weather (stored for the winter, mind you), the rope started to fray. Not in a way that would compromise the safety (it's not unraveling), but the rope developed all of these little sharp spines that made it feel like you were holding on to a thorny rose.

The author removes all feelings of guilt about being inadequate when your kids act up, and, gives you permission to follow through on what makes sense based on your intuition and not standard convention. Both my children have bloomed in their attitude to just about everything, and have some of the most intelligent creative solutions to problems that I would never have dreamed of. A must for anyone interacting with children on any level."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating and often poetic interweaving....","review":"....of women's issues, addiction, control, and perfectionism from a Jungian-mythic standpoint. Not only enjoyable reading but packed with clinical wisdom and creative insight. Woodman has a sharp eye out for the mythic underpinnings of Western patriarchy and how its Apollonian overvaluation of mastery, domination, and efficiency has shaped the psyches of women and men. Although the case material could use some shortening, they enliven the book and keep it grounded in felt realities."},{"rating":"1","title":"More storytelling...less skirting","review":"My expectations for this book was high as the title held such promise , my therapy practice brings me into a deep engagment with the issue of perfectionism.This book tended to brush up against the issues and not really engage withthe deeper dynamics .Too much of the material was hovering and just out of reach. In other words only partly digested.The examples from the individuals lives did not really take the story apart .....so much potential but not taking us into the heart .Most importantly a deep loss of story ,so this felt remote and unfulfilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loopy cubed","review":"Jung is loopy. Jungian psychology is loopy. Jungian psychologists are loopy. It surprises me that people take this stuff as seriously as they do. Maybe there's a good Jungian explanation for that too. That said, Jung was, in my opinion, the Wagner of early psychology, and, like Wagnerian opera, there's a lot to be learned by mulling over some of the ideas presented therein. But remember, Jung was more of a Romantic philosopher than a psychologist. Colorful stuff.

I never lost interest in the characters or the plot. Every new chapter had some new twists and turns that just made the book unbelievable. I believe that any student that partcipates in atheletics during their high school or college years should read this book.

Totally lacking in anything that made the Damned the Damned. Can you tell I was disappointed?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the?","review":"The basic problem with this album is not the music, but the fact that it doesn't sound like the damned. The damned have been through countless line changes over the years but even so the energy and the spirit of the band has carried on into each new lineup, how ever on this album it doesn't.There is very little energy, the tracks tend to sound the same and everyone is doing their own thing, even Dave Vanian on vocals doesn't save this one, he sings like he's a million miles away and rather disinterested in the whole project.My advice buy anything else by the damned and you won't be disappointed but don't buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really the Damned","review":"This album is not really a Damned album. Yes, it features many of the original members of the Damned, but the music bears little to no resemblance to the band's classic sound. The only songs that resemble their older material are the energetic \\"My Desire\\" and the melancholy \\"No More Tears.\\" Other than these two numbers, the rest of the album sounds like, to quote Patricia Morrison, a \\"bar band.\\" The musical style of Not of This Earth is quite similar to Eric Clapton's later material, a pseudo-blues rock band with slick production. It is by no means the most horrible thing in the world to listen to, but it genuinely lacks the creativity that Vanian, Scabies, and the rest of the crew are capable of. Where are the psychedellic influences? the experimentation? the raw energy? the darkness? the sense of humor? These elements will not be found on Not of This Earth, an album strictly for completists."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Damned - 'Not Of This Earth' (Cleopatra)","review":"'Not Of This Earth' is The Damned in name only. I didn't even realize until later that vocalist Dave Vanian wasn't on this CD. Two original members were, guitarist Brian James and drummer Rat Scabies.As for the tunes that I thought were so-so included \\"I Need A Life\\" (the theme song to WAY too many of us anymore), \\"Tail Spin\\" and maybe \\"Shadow To Fall\\". I haven't found one other fan that even remotely likes this release. I think it's fair. I saw the Damned out on tour like a year after 'Not Of This Earth' came out, however, the group's two OTHER original members were there, Vanian and bassist Captain Sensible. After the gig, I met up with the Captain and he told me that THIS disc should be avoided at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is great.","review":"Fuel is such a great band. I had heard \\"Shimmer\\" on the radio ALL SUMMER, and also on MTV, because you know how the music industry has to knock so many songs into your head, so they play the song every two minutes. I never got sick of Shimmer, however, so I bought the cd in early September. At first I would just play Shimmer, but now that i've listened to the other songs more, it's definitely a great cd! My favorite song is \\"Sunburn\\" (track 5). I also saw Fuel live on Saturday, 10/10/98 and they were just AWESOME. I totally dig this band!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly awesome CD.","review":"This CD just rocks so much. While every song is quite different (and nothing like Shimmer), every song just kicks so much butt. Give it a couple of listens to get use to it, but then you WILL love it! I guarantee it, or, well, nothing. But this is DEFINETLY the CD to buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best cd ever!","review":"I bought this cd because I thought that \\"Shimmer\\" was great. I was expecting it to be like every other cd, with two or three great songs, and the rest just being ok. But I was wrong. Every single song on this cd is outstanding. If you close your eyes, you can feel every word that is sung. It is very emotional and true. I love it, and I can't wait for the next Fuel cd to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE GREATEST CD'S EVER MADE","review":"This is yet one of the greatest cd's ever made in the history of music.

Napster has introduced me to many new bands and I've purchased several CDs as a result. Bands who think Napster hurts them aren't considering the benefits of getting their music in wide circulation via MP3s."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool debut cd","review":"this band covered a nirvana song called breed. the songs jesus or a gun shimmer bittersweet and ozone rule. purchase this cd or miss out on a band that is like a nice band that can play really good songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock at its finest","review":"Sunburn is the best rock album of the 90's. I don't love hard rock, but this combines great chords with fantastic vocals. I've shared this CD with many people who don't like rock and even they have to agree that Fuel is an extrodanary band. Sunburn is only beginning of this style of hard rock. The music is a mix of Metallica and Creed. I RECOMMEND SUNBURN TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR A TRULY MOVING CD. EVEN POP ENTHUSIASTS WILL LOVE FUEL"},{"rating":"2","title":"FUEL Rocks! and SUNBURN is the proof!","review":"This CD is so excellent! There is not one bad track on the whole thing if you ask me. I have seen Fuel 3 times in concert, and have tickets to see them a 4th time at the end of Sept. If you haven't seen them live, do not pass up the chance, they rock the house like few others! This CD has everything, hard, surging rockers (Untitled,Mary Pretends,Ozone) to softer melodic tracks (Hideaway,Shimmer,Sunburn). One of the BEST rock CD releases of the decade!! STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND GO BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give me FUEL, give me fire.....Forget Metallica!","review":"This is one of the baddest CD's out there right now! If you're a hard rock guitar fan like me, you'll love it! The lyrics are filled with energy and passion. Songs like \\"Jesus Or A Gun\\", \\"Mary Pretends\\", & \\"Ozone\\" compliment \\"Shimmer\\" very well. Again, an album that is spectacular but is still overlooked by radio airplay. Buying this album won't leave a \\"bittersweet\\" taste in your mouth......sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll feel better!","review":"If you have *any* sort of anger, frustration, or pain inside of you, then listening to these guys will make you feel very refreshed. After cranking up & rocking to the heavy, very rich instrumentals, you'll probably listen to the lyrics and come to some sort of revelation about yourself. If you aren't into that sort of stuff, hey, it's still one hell of an incredible album! This CD is my new favorite. Give it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fuel Rules","review":"Now this is rock music at it's best. Every song on the cd is increadible. I think that these guys have the most talent out of all bands out there. Please I beg of you, let this be your next cd that you will buy, and I guarentee you that you will never regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it time...it'll vibe your mind!","review":"I first bought this CD on the advise from others. I completely forgot Fuel wrote \\"Shimmer\\". Though this song is amongst the top ten songs on the radio today, the album in its entirety is kick@$$. I didn't like the whole thing at first, but I listened to it three times through and fell in love with it. It's become one of my favorite CD's amongst thousands. The compassion behind the music and the words is great. The song \\"Sunburn\\" brings out the quiet emotion that this talented band exibits while \\"Mary Pretends\\" and \\"Jesus Or A Gun\\" reflects the raw power Fuel can induce a song with. If you don't give this album a chance, you'll miss out, but if ya check it out and give it a shot...you'll be glad ya did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fuel - My favorite new band.","review":"I saw these guys live in a small clup in Providence, RI named Lupos. They put on an awesome show. I've been to many shoes over the past years but this was by far one of the best. Most people like 'Shimmer' and 'Bittersweet' but in time you'll come to love all the songs on the album. They have the rare ability to effectively perform harded songs like 'Bittersweet' and still pull off softer ballads like 'Shimmer' and 'Song for you'. I can't wair for their next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album, but which direction are they heading?","review":"I'm not trying to sound pessimistic about the band, but I don't believe they can be considered as a great band just yet. They've had a couple of hits that I like: \\"Bittersweet\\" and \\"Shimmer.\\" Unfortunately, with the trend of most bands in the 90's, it's one, two, or three songs and then they're out of the picture for good. If they can continue to make great hits in the future, then I'll change my opinion.I really enjoy the song \\"Song For You\\" (Track #8), which is about letting go of someone you love. The melody has its own way of saying \\"Where do I go from here?\\" If I had the power to decide what was released to the radio, I would have released this song in place of \\"Jesus or a Gun,\\" which didn't buy much into me emotionally.Overall, the album's a decent blending of music and emotion. However, I'd give Fuel a couple more albums before judging if their tank is full or running on fumes for the long haul."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is amazing","review":"Fuel is an awesome band whose acoustics and vocals deserve to be honored! Each song is different and very powerful. Sunburn is one of the best CDs I have heard in along time. Fuel's image is also very cool. Bret Scallions, the lead singer and guritarist has provoked a bit of controversy over \\"Jesus or a Gun\\", the single that asked questions about the use of religion/violence. Buy this CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shagadellic!","review":"I bought this CD on a whim based on the reviews here on Amazon. I listened to it once and wasn't that crazy about it. But then I listened to it a few more times and I LOVE IT! They definately jam and are the definition of a 90s band."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUEL IS BITTERSWEET.","review":"I was very impressed with this album. I would like to give it 5 stars, but most of the songs sound the same and tracks six and seven kinda suck. Personal favorites: Bittersweet, Shimmer,Jesus or a Gun, Sunburn and Ozone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fuel's debut album remastered, thirteen songs","review":"I am receiving this CD In Like New Condition. I LOVE the fourth song, \\"Jesus or a Gun\\" I know that the album counts on the signature vocals of Brett Scallions. I am 21 years old and I Love Fuel. And I'm not just saying that, I mean it. Now I own all four of their studio recordings, Sunburn, Something Like Human, Natural Selection and Angels & Devils. I am also a fan of Hanson (18 years in) I am also naturally a Fuel Fan. The thing that makes this version special is that it has two bonus tracks, King for a Day (Track 12) and Walk the Sky (Track 13)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible CD","review":"One of the few CD's you put in and play all the way through without having to skip some loser tracks. Definetly not a one hit wonder. Expect to see a lot more of Fuel and hear tons more of their amazing songs in constant radio play."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"This CD is awesome!! A friend gave it to me because she knew I liked Bittersweet, but this entire CD is wonderful!! I love taking it for a spin, and I don't get tired of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Supercharged","review":"A great disc!! These guys have major talent with their catchy, though somewhat repetitive tunes, excellent lyrics, and a hyper-like feeling when you're finished listening. I believe it was Rolling Stone who gave Sunburn a B+. I give it an A, baby!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid album.","review":"Often it's believed by the most \\"knowledgable\\" Rock fans that if a band is in the public eye, it's no good. Many times that proves to be true, not the case with Fuel, who are truley a Rock band with a throwback that hints towards 70s Arena Rock. Fuel's debut album \\"Sunburn\\" is a strong one, each song different from the next, the album flows rather nicely and proves it self to be very listener worthy. It's not amazing nor groundbreaking, but it's good, and in my book that makes it worth every penny"},{"rating":"2","title":"totally unbelievable","review":"This CD is, in a word, fantastic. It is definitely one of my favorite CDs ever. As a band that doesn't receive the media attention it should and also one that not many people have heard of, Fuel presents a great CD with a mixture of pure rock tracks and meaningful, emotional rock tracks. The best tracks on this CD are \\"Bittersweet\\", \\"Song for you\\", \\"shimmer\\", \\"ozone\\", and \\"Jesus or a gun\\". Every song is worth listening to. Get it now!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't stop listening!","review":"This CD I can't take out of my CD player. I listen to it a lot and think it's fantastic. They have an interesting sound and their music is creatively crafted. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to listen to \\"fresh\\" great music. I haven't been this excited about a CD since Pearl Jam's first album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good album, just not great.","review":"This album is very good, especialy tracks 2,3,5. I just think it could have been a lot better. I just feel like the last three songs were stuck on this album so that they could release it on time. I think that they could have done a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is one good song on it.","review":"The first time I heard the song Shimmer I was hooked, so I bought the CD because I heard the rest of it was good. I was very dissapointed. I can't believe so many people liked the rest of the songs on this CD. The only good one is Shimmer, so get the single, but listen to the CD before you buy it, PLEASE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Fuel may give a good polished performance on this album, but there is not much else to it. The lyrics seem to be written by some drunk slurring inane drivel and the music, although catcy at first gets old very quickly. The band has taken a tried and proven formula and produced a mediocre album, nothing else. They're not charting unknown waters here, and this album is unlikely to be one that influences anyone else in music, as everything on this album has been done before. Even the name is copied!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give less than 1 star...","review":"This album is boring, unoriginal, uninspired, and sounds like everything else on the radio. One thing I do like about it is that it makes a good coaster. These guys are Name Theives... The original Fuel (88-92) was one of the most innovative bands of their time. This band sounds like every other crappy band on the radio today. I suppose if you listen to the radio and actually like what they play, then you'll probably like this too. Stealing another band's name (coincidence or not) is just weak and it serves as an example of how uninspired and non-original these guys are. I think I'm going to start a gospel-christian rock band and call it Nirvana - would you guys like that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad no 0!","review":"Tright lyrics, unoriginal hooks, horrible guitars! The fact is this was the worst album I ever bought. I sold it after listening to it 4 times. The lyrics are dumb and it makes you realize that anyone can become a rock star. Yes, shimmer is good, infact awesome. But the rest of the songs are just some of the worst things that have ever existed. I am not exagerating. If you only are going to buy it for Shimmer, DON'T! If you like Jesus or a GUn, well then buy I guess, the rest of the album is as tright as that song. One of the biggest dissapointments of the 90's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Til It Kills: Tilt's Masterpiece","review":"Til It Kills stands out as Tilt's Masterpiece. I go back and forth with Collect 'Em All and this album as my favorite at the time, but I acknowledge the fact that I think this is their best album, with their best overall songs and best overall lyrics. And to top it off, there is even a punk love song, Berkeley Pier\\"\\", which could not be more perfect. For those of you who like fast songs, Leanin' Like A Barn and Lips Tits Hips. And there is nothing like going to a Tilt concert and singing along with the Cinder to \\"Libel\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting","review":"Fancy a brave adventure filled with knights and chivalry?

Then you try to dim it and it will turn down to about a 75-watt bulb brightness (maybe as low as a 60 watt bulb, but still very bright) and then it turns off completely.

However cheesy that sounds, those terms are all I can come up with, and they hardly do it justice. For its scope and power, \\"Circle In The Round\\" ranks right next Coltrane's circa 25 minute take of \\"My Favorite Things\\" on the Last Giant album.

I like it somewhat better than Sweet Basil Volume 1, which is a little more stylistically uneven with some work bordering on pure rock, although I do like that album.The songs on this album tend to straddle the fence between electric fusion jazz and traditional bebop. To me, it's a great balance between the two. One of its great virtues is fine orchestration (although you generally expect that from Gil Evans), and some incredible solos, e.g. the sax solo on Snowflake Bop.And you get LOTS of music, the recording is about 75 minutes of bliss."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I have several CDs by this same artist, so that I felt confident buying any of his CDs.

I liked the look of the machine - very classic, almost bahaus design.When I disinterred it from its box, I was excited by the look but wary of the machine's weight. This initial feel, I believe, should have been the tell-tale sign: it is cheap. For the first week, it made great coffee and the steam attachment worked marvelous. By week two, however, the coffee was no longer warm and the milk was being sucked up the straw and not steamed or frothed, but merely recycyled into a different vessel out the other end, still cold.I called the Capresso customer service number and also got luke warm assistance. A thoroughly disappointing experience! Ultimately, if you want a disposable coffee maker the Capresso Pro is excellent. If you would like one that lasts longer than a week, I would recommend trying a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works Great...For First Few Weeks","review":"Then we had to return it back to manufacturer for repair.

After a brief call to Capresso, we had a new machine within two days which is still working like a charm 3 months later. Hopefully it will continue to do so!The machine makes great espresso (if you use the correct grind) with a thick layer of golden crema on top. It's very easy to use, not too bad to clean up, and not too noisy.The frother is great though we don't use it much - makes great steamed milk and froth.The three sieves for pods, single shots, and double shots are very handy.The only reason I didn't give a 5-star review was for the first bum machine, and for the fact that the espresso could be just a touch hotter for my taste. But that's my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: don't buy it!","review":"After a thorough and depressive-obsessive exegesis of reviews of espresso machines (My wife and I Italian and coffee-addicted), we decided that this machine offered the best cup for the buck. We were setting ourselves up for an over-roasted disappointment. The build quality of this espresso maker is mediocre. Plastic is everywhere, with loose joints and knobs. The metal-looking front bell is plastic as well. After only ONE cup of coffee, the machine started to spout hot water, and we could not do anything to stop it. We returned it. Even without this early malfunction, we cannot fathom how it could produce a coffee a day for more than one year. The lesson learned is that with coffee makers you cannot cut corners. We'll save a bit longer, but we'll be able to count on our morning coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but you absolutely need a good burr grinder for this","review":"Machine is working well, but one note for buyers...

The directions that came with the product are poorly written and the parts just don't seem to fit together very well. The unit did heat rapidly and it does produce steam, but again, we could never get frothed milk. So, we thoroughly cleaned all the attachment parts and ran steam through the system to clean it out (as per the directions) and we also double and triple checked the assembly of the parts to make certain that it was all put together properly, but still no frothed milk; just warm steamed milk. If we made any adjustments to the flow knob then we would just get steam.

The oxygen atom's story really takes off once the primordial soup spills into the making of the universe.This is an excellent primer that contains some sections with difficult understanding for the average non-science oriented reader and areas of guess work by Lawrence M. Krauss to fill the knowledge gaps without offering contrary theories. Still, anyone wanting to grasp the cross-discipline nuances between the Big Bang and the Big Crunch will find Mr. Krauss' homage to the life cycle of the oxygen ATOM an overall entertaining and insightfully easy book to read.Harriet Klausner"},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed Attempt-Stick to Star Trek","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but they quickly evaporated.The author introduces a device (one that has been triedbefore, actually) of following the cosmic history of anatom to discuss many aspects of science.

I spent my money assuming that author is serious about fostering intellectual inquiry for inter-faith dialogue. However, the whole book was disappointing to say the least. Clooney's intellectual \\"inquiry\\" seems to be more of defending the orthodox christian position, rather than a serious exposition of both from their respective positions -conceptualization of Goddess in spiritual terms in Hinduism, and comparing that to Virgin Mary in Christianity. Clooney's work seems to be a hagiography of Virgin Mary, rather than serious comparative theology. I will not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon has the best fast reads offered!","review":"I enjoyed 'Keeper of the Bride' very much and have even several others by this author, Tess Gerritsen.

I look forward to reading more of her books"},{"rating":"1","title":"Romantic drivel","review":"I started reading and had to check if I had, in fact, ordered a Gerritsen book. It was simplistic, didn't have much character development and was more of a romance than a thriller. I was under the impression it was a new book - big mistake. The author has come a long way from her first romantic novels such as this one.

I had never read one of her earlier novels so this one was the first 'old' book for me.This is a romance novel and I don't really like romance novels. I didn't know that when I bought it.

Probably should be listed under Romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the Damned's most bizzare early album.","review":"Turning their backs, mostly, on their thashier early days and moving forward is sudden death to most bands. Could the Damned pull it off? For the most part, they actually do, especially on the 'slower' songs(\\"13th Floor Vendetta\\", \\"Dr. Jeckel & Mr. Hide\\", \\"Silly Kids Games(w/Sensible vocal)\\",\\"History of The World(Part I)\\", & \\"Curtain Call\\") which bring, except for \\"Silly Kids Games\\" of course, Dave Vanain's voice more up front and show how much of a good singer he is. Saddly the faster songs are where the album is most at fault with a couple of possible exceptions(\\"Wait For The Blackout\\" & \\"Lively Arts\\" both work beautifully and \\"Therapy\\" has an excellent middle but goes on for far too long). The two Damned classics on it are \\"Wait For The Blackout\\" and \\"Curtain Call\\". Any album where the singer shouts:\\"I'm gonna be a lazy slob\\" has to be good. Not too bad of an experiment but totally subdued, no sedated, considering the fire of their earlier albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"A genre bending album masterpiece","review":"I've read this album to be the \\"Sgt.

Early signs of electro-pop, Beach Boys harmonies, standard rock, punk, it's pretty awesome all topped with the classic Damned song styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"Damned fans, curious listeners, and anyone seeking good music will like this one. A step away from their edgy punk material to more refined works. Curtain call may take you a few listenings to fully appreciate, but it is a deeply powerful song."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Damned great album","review":"Albums don't come much better than this in the whole scale of punk/goth classics.Such is the ability of the Damned to slip between punk power to keyboard eariness and darkness without missing abeat and too much care for genre specifics and still only sound like them selves and no other.Classic stuff from a classic band"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing read.","review":"Crisp, clear, penetrating, by all rights under the sun, profound truth from ages past so desperately needed for survial in today's death plagued world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Tiger Woods Game Ever","review":"I should have heeded the warnings of other reviews.The graphics on this game stink and the time it takes to go from the score card to the next hole is unbearable.!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good For Vista","review":"Have had software problems from day 1 on Vista operating system.

As I progressed in 'golfing' efficiency I realized that the game is not geared to reward good shots and penalize bad ones, but to some agenda of its creators. Doing everything 'right' can bring disastrous results, depending on this agenda. Life provides enough hard knocks without volunteering for them. Only a masochist will stomach this punishment for more than 30 hours or so. So... the question becomes: how much is 30 hours of moderately interesting entertainment worth?

My computer is pretty strong & it was crashing all afternoon while tried to play an entire game. Very dissapointing. It will keep me from buying 09 next year.

The graphics are solid - provided you have the video power, I had to upgrade my onboard Intel graphics - and the selection of golf courses is very good. St Andrews (The Old Course), The K Club, and Riviera are especially well rendered. There are several annoyances - incorrect score card yardages, bizarre club selections from the auto caddy, no way to see a running stroke tally, no way to select a course to play for a \\"casual\\" round, the same commentary (which is still inappropriate about 20% of the time) from Feherty and McCord that goes back at least to TWG 2004 - that really bug me. But overall the game is fun, and the several different game formats ensures it will be a long time before every scenario is completed. Recommended, but far from an \\"ace\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me play","review":"I love the Tiger Woods series,this is my third.

Oh well proving again looks aren't everything.First off this guy i choreographically challenged and when it Leslie says tap out he does side steps!Then when they do their \\"walk up 4 and back 4\\" he gets caught in front of a platform and can't move anywhere. Tjis really throws him for a loop. GEEZ!Also not that I don't respect how difficult maintaining weight can be but I almost didn't recognize MARY KAY!. Peraps she had some health issues but she looks much older and has put on weight. If anybody knows about this please comment. I hope she is ok.This video is really not good.

I no longer have to keep buying Leslie Sansone DVDs. This one convinced me there's nothing new under Leslie's lights. In fact, I suspect, despite the 2009 release date, that this session was shot several years ago. We've seen Mary Kay slimmer and I can't imagine she regained her weight. The intervals are good. The total is, dare I say it, boring. Pop in one of your other Leslie Sansone DVD's and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"I am a big Leslie fan. But is one is not so good. It is extremely disorganized and the sound quality is very bad...the music is hardly heard. The moves are sporadic ..and not fun at all.

I have been following her workouts for years and have many of them. Naturally I was excited to see a new workout dvd from her and purchased it right away. I was not thrilled after the first time through it. It seems very un-organized with the same moves being repeated instead of more variety used and also the moves seemed to be sparatically thrown in, just when you would get started into a move(like side steps)she would change it back to a walk. It just seemed very un-Leslie like. I will do it for a quick workout but have liked the others much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I love Leslie Sansone's DVD workouts and I have been purchasing several of them to add variety to my workouts. I purchased this a couple of weeks ago and I was so very disappointed. Unlike many of her other videos, Leslie and her friends are all over the place! The other walkers were continually making adjustments to try to keep up with Leslie and she does not give you heads up before she goes into a new move. It was so frustrating that I have not used it since. Beware. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout","review":"This one is a good work out too, but it only has 3 times that you jog.

Here is why.1. The music is better than a lot of Leslie's DVD's.2. The ability not to listen to her run her mouth is priceless.3. The boosted walk in a DVD of this length.4.

Even though you don't hop around like mad during her workouts, you absolutely break a sweat with her \\"walking.\\" I have a collection of about 4 videos of hers, and I find that I've totally abandoned the others - I think she's positively infectious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her best, but okay","review":"I have several of Leslie's walking programs and enjoy them. I wanted something a little more challenging. I do enjoy the program, however there are no mile markers at the bottom of the screen to show your progress like is stated on-line and on the case. The case says this allows you to choose a 1 mile or 2 mile walk. You cannot do that - the only choices you have are to listen to Leslie's chatter or just listen to the music and watch her talking the whole time w/o hearing it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her better workouts","review":"This was a very disappointing workout. Not Leslie's usual type of exciting/fun workout. The music wasn't good, sound track wasn't either. I have many (nearly all) of Leslie's videos and Dvd's and this one is my least favorite. It doesn't make me want to workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with this DVD.","review":"I have many Leslie workout tapes and DVDs. I was not disappointed with this one. If you are a fan of Leslie and her walking workouts, I think you will be happy with this workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to work out videos","review":"This will be my third Leslie Sansone workout video. It is similar to the 5 mile boosted walking, in fact some of the music is the same. At first, I thought that maybe I wasted my money. In reality, it is a good workout in that most of the workout is fast paced with the addition of the boosted walking. So if you own the 5 mile, just picture the faster pace of the second part of each mile coupled with boosted walking as your ENTIRE workout. The workout is 33 miles in length and that includes about a 2 mile cooldown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I've been using Leslie's tapes for almost a year now and can testify that her workouts actually produce results. I have a number of her other DVDs and though they are all great I was starting to feel they just weren't pushing me anymore. When I received this workout, I was excited to pop it in. When it first started I was skeptical-afraid it was the same as all the others as the warm up does mirror many of her other workouts. When it did get to the 'boosted' part of this workout, i was impressed. Though you know the basic four moves, the adjustments in this DVD really did take it to the next level and keep your heart rate up. The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars was because it is only a 30 minute workout. I wish there was another mile or two added on as an option, instead of having to replay or switch workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equipped and Ready to Learn...Thanks!","review":"The rating process is an easy a choice to make as the entire purchasing process.

He's a fine cellist, but I was curious to know how he does at writing. Well, he's terrific! This is a good story with a crackling plot that kept me reading, but what I enjoyed most was his humor, especially his funny wordplay. He captivated me from the start with his definition of the (Falneresc) idiom \\"Walk the Moons Road.\\" A list of a dozen or so very plausible definitions ends up, \\"to engage in a difficult enterprise, one whose outcome is uncertain; to be in love; to die.\\" I also loved one of his characters' attempts to speak Eloian, one of the many languages spoken on this planet. Hilarious! And the Lilith--the character at the center of the plot, neither man nor woman--is a truly enchanting creature, whom Jim treats with great tenderness. A good book, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mystery","review":"Another good mystery from William G. Tapply in the Brady Coyne series.

Still, if you can overlook that flaw, maybe skim those parts, the story is logical and enjoyable. Interesting characters and setting in the Maine woods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointing","review":"The oboe soloist, Marc Schachman, is not very good at all. He sounds constantly one step behind the rest of the group and misses far too many notes for a profession musician. There are plenty of good historical performances available on the oboe (try Ton Koopman and the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra's recording of the Mozart oboe concerto) but this is not one of them. The clarinet quartet, a transcription of a violin sonata, comes off pretty well but there's also a smoother recording by L'Archibudelli out there (and it doesn't stand up as one of Mozart's more important works). The string quartet (one of the so-called \\"Prussian\\") is quite fine, as the string players are pretty strong. Since the general quality of the recording is relatively poor, however, you might as well get Quatuor Mosaique's version and avoid the sloppy oboe quartet that opens this disc. It's too bad because the price is right, but the quality isn't up to par."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piano brilliance with cajun flair - forgot how good they are","review":"I happened to stumble onto this CD while reviewing recent releases and I thought, \\"Hey, I remember them! They had a couple of hits and I liked the piano.\\", so I ordered it! I was shocked that I had forgotten these folks and HOW MANY hits they had! I recognized about 3/4 of the tunes! This is a great recording that will stroll you down memory lane. I'm a product of the 80s and still seem to be, so this hit home.As another reviewer put it \\"Great Anytime Music\\".

They stink and the gameboy advanced stinks I wasted my money and my son is upset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Gameboy!!","review":"This gameboy is so so fun to play with. It has great games like Super Mario World, Mario Kart, High Heat Major Leage Baseball 2003, etc. I have a gamecube also. The gamecube has good graphics but Gameboy Advance's is just about as good gameplay and graphics. I suggest get one of these if it is your first video game system. Then soon get a Gamecube or a Playstation 2 or an Xbox after about a couple months. Enjoy!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best handheld ever","review":"I recently just bought a gba.Its really great the graphics and sound are awesome. nintendo really outdid itself this time.The games available for this system are great they re kid friendly just like all nintendo games the only problem is the screen lighting but it can be corrected by playing in a good source of light.Its so small it fits in my shirt pocket perfectly.Its of 32 bits but the graphics of the 32 bit PS1 are much better I ve got tekken 3(ps)and tekken advance(im a tekken dragonballz and digimon fan)but the tekken 3 graphics are awesome really better than the GBA version.If you think you want a system with really eye poppoing graphics your better off with the Gamecube or PS2 or XBOX"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT SHOULD I DO?","review":"I don't own a GBA, but I have been thinking about purchacing one sometime this year. I have done a lot of research and even had a chance to play it. Overall, I think its a pretty decent handheld, but im worried. The game selection doesn't surprise me that much. Super Mario World? Doom? Tetris? Of course there are some very unique and new games out there like Ecks Vs. Server and that Counter Terrorist Game which is a lot like the Metal Slug Series, but why does Nintendo continue to remake old games for brand new systems? So much for it being ADVANCED.Ive played these games about six or seven years ago on a SNES. Wasn't this the idea in the older gameboy products? Come up with some better ideas will ya?My question, \\"Is it worth it\\". I own a GBPocket but I rarely play it anymore. Will that be the case with GBA? Or should I just use the money to purchace games for my PS2?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great portable system with clear and sharp graphics","review":"The Game Boy has really become more technologically advanced since I received the original one with black and white graphics for my birthday in 1989. Now, 13 years later, I bought a Game Boy Advance, and am really impressed by the great 32-bit color graphics, which are very sharp and clear. The game music is great and a pleasure to listen to as well. I guess the only downfall of the system, which has been repeated in public reviews many times, is the difficulty seeing the screen without good lighting. I've found that sitting on my couch next to a bright lamp, and tilting the screen a bit, solves the glare problem. Overall, I would give this system a 4.5 out of 5 stars, which seems fair enough to me to round up to 5 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastically Fun System with very few flaws","review":"Essentially I love this GBA. The game support is growing, the battery usage is effecient. Only one thing that I would have delayed shipping until, and that is that the unit is not backlit.

Need to purchase a light unit for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"10xs better!","review":"This game boy is ten times better than the stuppid old rundown game boy! This advance game boy is just even better than the old Super Nintendo! It contains some classic games like - Doom, Duke Nukem, Wolfenstein 3D, Mario Kart, Earthh Worm Jim, Tony Hawk, and More! Oh yeah if you liked your games on regular game boy U don't have to throw them out you can still play them on your game boy advance!

While I would agree that the game boy console is very sleek and convenient for anyone to use, I have to say that I am sadly disappointed with my purchase.

I wonder if they got a different version. My version is unplayable under all but the most precise lighting conditions. And some games are unplayable no matter what. With a 80 watt light 1 foot from the system, carefully angled so to try to avoid the glare, Castlevania is still not playable. Its very frustrating because the sound is excellent and graphics(from what I can see) are good. I don't understand how Nintendo could release a product this flawed. That's why I wonder if they have revised it and are now shipping a new version. That's the only way I can explain the good reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nintendo calls this Advanced?!?","review":"I have owned every Game Boy that has been on the market and this is absolutely the worst of the lot. It doesn't matter how great the graphics are...you can't see them! The screen is so dark that you can only see under a really bright light ..and that is usually impossible when traveling. If your children try to use this, it will ruin their eyesight.

I even went back to a store that sells these because I thought mine was defective. They Told me EVERYONE HAS PROBLEMS SEEING ANYTHING ON THESE SCREENS! Then they sold me a useless accessory for $ 4.95 which was supposed to magnify and add light for greater visibility. It was actually designed for these poorly designed toys! I cannot believe that this toy was allowed to be manufactured. The problem is that my child loves it so much, he doesn't want me to return it. DO NOT BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Platinum Game Boy Color is the Best One Yet","review":"I've seen all the Game Boy Advance colors and trust me, this is the best one yet! The platinum paint makes the surface of the GBA look like metal, and it shines no matter which direction you face it. Plus, you can play Game Boy, Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games on it. And with a GBA-GBC cord and lights that hook on to it in matching colors, the possibilities are endless!If you don't have a GBA, or even if you do, get this one!

I paid nearly $60.00 for the GBA to ensure I bought a used one that was good quality. In total, I could have purchased a new DS system. But since my grandson wanted the same system as his cousin, I purchased this unit. However, you can barely see the screen even in direct light. I have had to buy 3 additional lights and have given up--I am now buying the Game Boy Player so he can at least play the games I purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible!!! defected item...what a bad deal like new in very good condition is so freaking wrong you get brokem ,defected crap!","review":"i would not recommend this seller at all..it is a hoax what ever this seller sells is boken defected and absolutly run down looking!dont buy something from that seller!i surely never ever again! shame on them to rip off people like that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy Screen leads to no fun","review":"Here's a little warning before you invest in the GBA:1) The LCD screen itself isn't backlit, so it's hard to see unless your under a solid light source2) The plastic screen over the LCD screen sratches very easily!

I loved super nintendo and this looked it would be the hand held version of that.However, one of the main drawbacks of the gameboy advanced is that there is NO.. I repeat... NO backlighting!!! If you aren't sitting directly under a bright spotlight you wont see a thing! I bought the gameboy so I would have something to do on my long train rides to the city but i spent half the ride trying to direct the gameboy in such a way that i could see it. Before i completely gave up on using it i bought one of the light attachments that where \\"designed\\" for gameboy advanced. But that didn't help either. In fact it add a bad glare which made it harder to see. I'm so frustrated with it that it's been sitting in the corner collecting dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but dark","review":"Purchased for my daughter as gift. It is very comfortable, lightweight and well made. I highly recommend purchasing a wormlight for this item. The screen requires a lot of light, you are unable to see the game screen in a low light area or it can even give off a glare making it impossible to see the screen. Wormlights are cheap, no big deal! An economical and easy way to play your Nintendo on the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Long Car Rides!","review":"My brother received this console for Christmas, and he loves it. The only disadvantage to it is that he's glued to the thing and Mom gets real mad at him, but besides that, it's a great distraction. Portable, works fine. It even plays regular Game Boy Color games also, so you don't have to worry about never being able to use those games. The games that go with it are about an inch tall and two inches wide - very compact. Get a case for it and you're set to go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Console, not the screen cover.","review":"the game boy advace is a nice console, 32- bit cpu and more memory than game boy color.

Nintendo should change the screen cover from plastic to something else because i'm just plain sick of scratching my screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatally Flawed","review":"I bought two of these consoles for my kids. I will be returning them tomorrow. Why? Because the screen is so dark that unless you are sitting under a 300-watt halogen light, you will not see anything at all. And, the glare is terrible.Some have suggested adding a light to the unit. But, that kind of defeats the purpose of having a *portable* unit. This really is an inexcusable design flaw on Nintendo's part. Their refusal to even acknowledge the problem is even worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"GameBoy Advance","review":"I give this product 4 stars instead of 5 because if you look at the picture you can see multiple colors on the screen. I thought the GameBoy Advance was going to be like a prototype for the DS (one screen with a bunch of colors) but I was wrong. You have to be by a light source like you do with the Game Boy and Game Boy Color but still have the slight glare of the mentioned light on the screen. The games for the GBA can be played on the DS (bottom slot) with a full array of color. The console works like new and plays games smoothly, I just had a problem with the lack of brightness/color it had. It can play GB color games which is a plus if you want to play like games with a friend (Pokemon was my pick here).I already have a Game Boy Color, SNES, Wii, and a DS for the reason that I am a big fan of Nintendo's line of work but for the time the GBA came out I can say it was a leap forward same goes for N64 to the Wii."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Duper Excited","review":"Thank you so much! I was so impressed on how it shipped out so fast and that I got it sooner then expected.

So much cooler then the old gameboy. Now my other son's are planning on getting one, too. We have a gamecube so the idea of using their games for the GBA via a adapter is a plus! We bought a light that also came with hand grips that attach on the back. That is the only downfall to the GBA is the bad lighting.

He uses it, as do his brothers, all the time!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as SNES or N64 but almost.","review":"It is a great system although I always need to turn the lamp on when playing it. The controls are kind of hard to use but in a way that is a good thing because it will take longer to beat games. My ffavorite game is Sonic Advance. Its like a regular sonic game and the graphics and music are incredible. A must have for any car ride, airplane ride, dorm room,hotel room,etc. My parents are mad because I bought one but who cares."},{"rating":"2","title":"It just needs one thing!!","review":"I bought the GBA because I found the graphics really nice and the price wasn't that bad. The only problem is that it doesn't have a TV-like screen. You can't play it by itself in the dark. I mean Game Gear was a portable god because it came out with that feature, and a decade later Nintendo STILL doesn't improve that part. The color is cute (glacier) and it is small which is pretty handy to carry around. I just hope it comes out with some really great games. It would have been a perfect portable system if it had that advantage to have a glow screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"What were nintendo thinking a hand held for 100.00 moola?BesidsI was really dissipointed when I got the GBA and I think it totaly copyed SNK's Neo Geo from the cartrige to the shape and layout of the system. the display dosent really look like its 32 bit I mean my SEGA Genisess (16 bit) look's beter.And it's really to thin for my hands unlike the Neo Geo witch is fatter on the out side and thinner on the inside.Besides nintendo's game boy has allwes been sorta outa date like wheres the backup battery or why dosent a menu appere when you turn it on with out a cartrige.Other than that the systen is kinda good bui if I were you I wold save my GBA money and buy a cheaper Sega Game gear or a SNK Neo Geo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everythings here","review":"The GBA is the best it has everything that is needed in a portable systemand more.

If I could take the two back that I bought for my children I would, but the boxes were trashed in the Christmas rush. I certainly will NOT bother to purchase any more games; I have already wasted enough money on this system. Nintendo should QUICKLY come out with a correction and let everyone who wasted their money on the first release trade in for FREE. Someone should sue Nintendo. And yes, I have bought magnifiers and lights. They do not help. Just more money down the tube. I have never been this disgusted with anything I have ever purchased before.

You probably already know this baby let's you play any Gameboy game, and has a widescreen format. IF you play an old game, the GBA let's you stretch the image to fit the whole screen, or leav it the way it was. And that well, there isn't any other choice if you want a portable videogame system. You might hear some complaints about the darkness of the screen, and I must say that with the first batch of gameboy advance games that was a fact, but the newer titles coming out for the system have aparently fixed this. It will have conectivty with the NINTENDO GAMECUBE, which will be released Nov 18, but don't expect conectivity stuff this year. I do know that there will be some neat tricks next year though, one of them Involving Sonic Advance and another one Kirby's Tilt N Tumble. both great games.

You deploy your soldiers and then helplessly watch as they run around the map and fight the enemy. Yes, I'm not kidding, you actually can't control the army in battle, it's reduced to you sitting there watching little soldier A throw things at little soldier B until one of them dies or runs away. The idea that you can't make real time changes during a battle is rather absurd, and as a result of the game design there's no strategy, you might as well wander off and do something interesting while the battles are running.

There is virtually no diplomacy, the game mechanics are rustic, anachronistic and extremely boring, there is no internal decision making to add any flavor to the game and ultimately it is like managing a warehouse with three materials and making sure the shelves are stocked. The battles are even worse. They are a big mess and it makes no difference where you position your troops they always end up in the same spot...all lumped in a big ugly, indecipherable mess in the middle of the screen. I loved both Europa Universalis games and was extremely disapointed with this sad game. However I am still loking forward to Paradox's Crusader Kings, I still have hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after only about two months!!","review":"I bought this because I wanted a stepper that I could use and then easily put away. It worked pretty well for about two months. I was using it three or four days a week for about 20 minutes each time. Today, I was using it as usual and the cable that makes the steps go up and down suddenly snapped. I'm an average sized woman and way below the suggested maximum weight for it. I'm really disappointed in this stepper. I may contact the company for a new cable but I'm not sure I want to keep using this thing if it's going to break again."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER BUY THIS STEPPER","review":"Cable wore out in 2 months.

First they made it smaller, now it is only 14 oz instead of 16 oz. They say it is a \\"new stronger formula\\" to justify this I guess. But it seems the same to me, it's just a solvent in a can. Also now they do not include a straw to spray through. It says \\"new power nozzle - no straw needed\\". Well they are wrong, it still needs a straw. What are they thinking - cleaning carbs without the straw - seriously? Next time I will buy a different brand, they are all very close to the same solvents - no miracles by brand name in carb cleaners."},{"rating":"1","title":"the spray stream goes all over the place","review":"It probably \\"works\\" fine, but the spray stream isn't well-controlled. It gets on your hand and is so strong that it bounces back out of what ever you spray it on -- you might want to use rubber(?) gloves, wear eye protection, and keep your mouth closed. Or just try a different brand -- hopefully it won't have this problem (or maybe they all do, for all I know)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best cleaner you will ever meet","review":"This is the best household cleaner you will ever find.

The missions in the game, a joke, you pretty much walk right into them. And walking around is even a joke, i've never seen such choppy framerate in a game in my life!! Also when you shoot your weapon it's so slow i'm surprised your not dead by the time you get your second shot off. My advice, dont waste your time or money on this game.

It's a personal challenge to get down to one peg, and then to one peg in the spot of your choice.I highly recommend this game for the thoughtful youngster or the adult with a few minutes to kill.

Heavy as hell, great musicianship and thoughtful lyrics along with Brock's unique vocal style make this a must have. Their second outing, \\"A Snow Capped Romance\\" is actually better and more mature, but you won't be disappointed in \\"Bitterness\\" either. I think the fact that they lived in Alaska contributes to their sound, they probably had influences from all over the country but yet no direct local influence because they were definately one of a kind in this area.

I first heard \\"Circle the Drain\\" about 4 years ago and have been waiting for them to get a cd out in stores. Definately worth the wait. The vocals get borderline painful, but good enough. The guitar, bass, and drum sound is good and I like the way they can transition between different grooves in the same song.

Wynton's playing here is blues based jazz at its best, and the supporting cast here is simply terrific. Production value is top notch, and the song selection is clever and the arrangements challenging.This is wonderfully accessible music that is clearly played by highly practiced and intelligent people, and its mood reflects the space artists can reach when they have done all of the necessary preparation.

The title had me anticipating something emotional and a little rougher hewn than the normally smooth selections turned out by Mr. Marsalis, and I was by no means disappointed.Wynton is by turns somber, playful and seductive on this CD. On \\"Baby Won't You Please Come Home\\" his trumpet emits an absolutely plaintive wail. This is the CD I play when I want to relax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love played for you on a trumpet","review":"The melodic and lyrical flow of these songs will place you gently in a space of complete contentment. Your ears are all you'll ever want or need after listening to this collection.Wynton's choices of songs guides you through this cd masterfully. The opening, The Party's Over, may, if you are not careful, bring you to recall a moarnful moment when you didn't want something wonderful to end.

It develops the basics on a \\"need-to-know\\" basis from a (component) developer perspective, and then going on to do things that are relevant for work.Getting into JSF, if you haven't done it before, can be a daunting task.

I absolutely put that one to use when I was going to shelters for months looking for a dog. There are so many 'cute' dogs; this DVD will help you pick the one that's right for you though. And I have to say: the dog I finally adopted (4 months later) is WONDERFUL! Our energy levels match perfectly, so my level of activity suits his exercise needs and he's content following me through my day-to-day and does so calmly and cooperatively. But again, and as Cesar will tell you: the DVD is NOT dog training.

The book does mention to keep your bird's cage out of direct sunlight (wouldn't the bird enjoy a little sun in the winter?) and to keep him out of drafts (in the summer wouldn't a nice breeze be appreciated?)

I think the last full album he released under his own name was \\"All This Useless Beauty\\" in 1996, and even that was a hodgepodge of older songs that he'd given away to other artists. Since then, it's been nothing but pure (did someone say pointless?) diletantism -- hangin' with Burt Bacharach, scoring Shakespeare productions, and now this highbrow monstrosity. Actually, \\"For the Stars\\" isn't really all that bad (in fact, the two new Costello-penned tunes that open and close the album are quite excellent), but I've docked it one star out of pure frustration, and another for the horrid lyric of \\"Just a Curio\\". Elvis: the supermarket tabloids and I are still sticking to our story that you are, in fact, still alive -- please don't make us look like idiots...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrelenting melancholy","review":"After seeing A-SvA and EC on Charlie Rose, I was so anxious to have this CD that I went out and payed full price for it. I was prepared for what A-SvO termed \\"nice melanchloly\\". Instead, I find an album that is extremely limited in both its emotional and musical range. There is so little to distinguish one piece from another that, rather a satisfying melancholy, its unvarying expression is, I find, depressing. I've tried three times to listen to the whole album and I just can't. After the last time, I had to put on some Billie Holiday right away to get out of my funk. OF course, YMMV (your mileage may vary)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Valiant Mismatched Effort","review":"This recording is a perfect example of how, sometimes, a beautiful, classically trained voice can utterly destroy the spirit and energy of excellent pop music.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the same songs","review":"This is my first Elvis Costello cd and I thought it would have him singing with the lady or some of the songs.

While classical-trained critics still tear off lieder and opera albums because of a single misplaced breathe, the same singers go and record this type of thing with guys who can not even sing at the neighborhood church. And we are supposed to smile and accept it in the name of open mindedness.So what's next? June Anderson with Steven Tyler? Bryn Terfel with Kelly Clarkson? Angela Georghiou with Eminem? I just can't wait to hear the next crossover sensation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a soothing itelligence at play","review":"i like this record. i especially like to hear ms. van otter sing so clearly- crystalline- with a slight reserve- forming each phrase and word like they were songs from her classical/art song repetoire. this is one of those weird albumns that bubble up every now and then- the best of voice, songwriting, & style (pop/jazz/classical/standard references throughout- nicely woven too!) and what seems like an effortless grace. i'd compare it to june tabor's work and also that great obscure quartet from sometime ago- shopping trolley."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's so funny about peace, love, and understanding?","review":"Nothing's funny about this boring duo. I picked this up FREE at my library and it didn't take me too many tracks to see why it was donated. The musical arrangements are hapless and dull, and her voice is Dion without the Vegas power finale. Come to think of it, the lyrics remind me of Dion; they are as saccharine as anything Dion has ever sung. I wasted a blank CD on this limp, sleepy pairing of two otherwise good artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"As an opera singer, I was so intrigued by what I heard on NPR when they interviewed von Otter and Costello that I ordered the cd that morning. I was not disappointed. Until now, I have never heard such a successful collaboration between two such disparate artists and the combination of von Otter's classical training (most of which is deliberately - and effectively - abandoned)and Costello's really remarkable orchestration is breathtaking in it's beauty. However, I can understand why so many Costello fans do not really like this album - it is certainly not what one thinks of when one thinks \\"Elvis Costello\\" (and, to be frank, had I not actually heard some of it, his name on it would have prevented me from buying it)- but it actually shows how very deep this guy's scope as an artist is to have pulled this off. My compliments to both and I hope that this is not the last time they collaborate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this CD","review":"Who would pair Costello and an opera singer?? Elvis, and somehow it works. I really love the tone and moodiness of it and lyrics that talk about love and life, failure and success.

If he'd left the singing to some other on his \\"Painted By Memory\\" album, he'd have had a classic there too. This is a classic-beautiful, haunting songs, brilliantly sung. You need to listen a few times and it's not a pop record you can just put on in the background. It's just wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Than Sominex","review":"Costello and von Otter separately are marvelous artists, but together they've come up with what I can only describe as a snorefest. The arrangements are languid to say the least, each one more sleep-inducing than the next. Mellow is one thing, but this is ridiculous! Perhaps the material just isn't to my liking; most of the songs have the bubble-gummy sound of The Carpenters B-sides. A valiant effort, but von Otter is just one more classical artist who should stick to her day job and avoid crossing over."},{"rating":"1","title":"No life in her (pop) art","review":"I am a big fan of both artists and wanted very much for this combination to work. It avoids the traditional trap of \\"oversinging\\" the pop material. But a few years after its release, in these American Idol era, is that really such a terror for pop music any more? So-called oversinging seems pretty popular these days!The big problem is that von Otter has not found a way to communicate any emotion in this scaled-down form of singing. All her classical techniques are stripped away, and there's nothing to replace them. Sure, her voice is gorgeous, but it sounds exactly the same no matter what the lyrical content. The songs could have been made up of nonsense syllables for all the emotional life she communicates.Deeply disappointing - but someone, somewhere, will figure out how to bring classically trained singers to the wonderful pop song repertoire that has been composed over the past 50 years. Elvis may very well be the person to do it, but not on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get out your insulin","review":"Elvis Costello should of course be allowed to advance into old age with whatever tastes his rapidly mellowing gray matter generates.

Horrible, contrived, like watching an old Donny and Marie variety show from the 70s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but not great","review":"I have been a big fan of Elvis Costello's for years. I still have the first album I bough of his on vinyl.I have heard Anne Sofie von Otter, but have never seriously listened to her before, and I will change that, soon.Her diction is perfect, but, my gripe is with the material. She's too much of an opera singer to sing pop well. She's too mannered. Her voice is thrilling, but this is not the best use, in my opinion. However, it is not as embarrassing as Kiri Te Kanawa's version of \\"South Pacific\\"I do not regret this purchase, and I'll give copies of it as Christmas/Chanukah gifts, but, to use letter grades, A for effort, B + for execution.I am still puzzled by the inclusion of \\"Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder) She adds nothing to this Brian Wilson classic.As others have said, the first track, \\"No Wonder,\\" and the last track, \\"For The Stars\\" are very pleasing pieces of ear candy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such beautiful music!","review":"This CD is wonderful.

When they arrived and I set them up, I was tempted to get an additional one. Really simple, elegant and streamlined. And well made. And, the best part is that the 12 bottle count does not include the space on the bottom of the rack - which can accomodate 2 additional bottles (granted they are not held securely in place as they are in the rest of the rack).

I've had it for 5 months, driven 5000 miles up mountain, over deserts, through fields and it hasn't so much as shifted an inch nor popped open. Even if it did pop open a little, the keys are held in place by a elastic band.

The \\"easy grip\\" pegs are almost impossible to handle--they slip out of large (grown up) and small (kid) fingers, and fall out of the holes. As you're putting one peg in, it's all-too easy to bump the other pegs and knock them out. The colors are different than the original, which might be fine, except the \\"key pegs\\" are red & white (not black & white as in the original), and the blue and green code-making pegs are almost the exact same color.

Dont get me wrong, this isnt a complete disaster, but its pretty close, with repitive songs, with almost none of the guitar work or drumming that the band is known for. Deicide was on its last nerve with Roadrunner Records, so they rushed the final two albums in the roadrunner catalog. They said that they were very disapointed with the last two roadrunner releases, and if you listen to this you can see why. The one track that really stands out is \\"Worry in the House of Thieves\\" which is the best song on this album. The title track is also very good, and the rest is just vanilla death metal, that falls short of average. If you want, go ahead and give it a try if you want to add this to your catalog, but I doubt it will be spinning in your CD player very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"in torment in hell","review":"hopefully some deicide fans have picked up on the scam behind this cd...in fact, im SHOCKED that someone has actually given it 5 stars! this album was deicide's 8th and final release for roadrunner records and the band took the $80,000 budget for the album, spent $3,000 to record and pocketed the rest. pretty smart financially for the band, but stupid if they expect to continue on with a career...fans are let down by the album's content including the horrible artwork and production. the music isnt even worth reviewing.

However, all I heard was pretty good Death Metal. The vocals and production could have been better, but whatever the album is what it is. Their record label had been rushing them to release an album.Those of you expecting something new and groundbreaking are morons. It's simply Deicide releasing another great Deicide album.3.6 stars rounded up to 4, plus 1 extra star to bring up the BS overall rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, don't buy!","review":"I love Deicide but this pails in comparison to any of their other albums.

Cliche becomes the foundations of the adapted Deicide style since it is apparent to all that the band no longer enjoy or care about what they are doing. Play this album for most death metal listeners and they'll think it's a parody of the genre until you tell them it's Deicide. Then they will simply be, as is this reviewer, disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"wait.....this is Deicide????","review":"I was in torment in my car listening to this piece of junk. Darkness radiates off of Lord Benton as his vocals sound as brutal and flat out amazing as ever, but that's where the good stuff ends. The music on this \\"Deicide\\" cd is horrible. Do yourself a favor Deicide fans, and potential Deicide fans for that matter, listen to a real Deicide cd. Pick up Once Upon the Cross, put that in your cd player, and hear what the exalted Deicide should sound like. I don't know what these guys above me are listening to....but trust me, this cd is NOT good."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is A Joke...Right?","review":"Deicide has definitely been a favorite band of mine since I heard their self titled debut, albums like 'Legion' and 'Once Upon the Cross' only strengthened that feeling...but, like a lot of fans, when 'Serpents of the Light' was released we were devastated because of how boring it was, then Deicide got us back with 'Insineratehymn', but with their final record for Roadrunner Records, they have again taken a step back...a gigantic step back. What in the he ll has happened? The album is a barely alvagable and weak attempt at death metal greatness, instead of trying out some new material, they just rehash the disaster that was 'Serpents of the Light'. With extremely shoddy musicianship and downtuned vocals (the worst Glen Benton has ever done)....this will be finished at a later time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good at All","review":"This sounded like their career was ending, but I think they were actualy saving all the good stuff for the next album Scars of the Crucifix, which I think happens to be their best release."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEIR WORST ALBUM TO DATE.","review":"I had high expectations when this album came out and it flat out disappointed me.The production was bad and the music was just too repetitive.Not to mention that glen bentons vocals sound horrible here.I guess they may have done this intentionally since they were gaven a small budget for the album and they were tired of their label.I really hope that scars of the crucifix lives up to its hype and really redeems them from this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"I am a fan of any kind of heavy music from Death Metal to Punk, but i am sure that any big death metal fan out there can do lots better than this.

Deicide combines soothing melodies, talented drum solos, and smoooooooth bass. These lads are so talented, you would never know they are only in their late teens to early twenties! Deicide has been playing the club circuit for about three months now, and they have a new radio hit on the way, \\"Bubbles\\". The sax solo in that song... breathtaking. Listen up for them; for the future for Deicide is so bright, they've gotta wear shades!Just kidding. This is garbage. They don't have a lead singer/vocalist, they have a lead belcher. \\"YURP! YURP! YURP! YURP! YURP! YURP! YURP! YURP!\\" Also, guess what else: NOT HEAVY. Also see my dumb review for Cannibal Corpse's meaningless CD. If you own this CD, use it for a coaster.Skip this one.

The best song on here, imo is ''En Vind av Sorg'' , or ''Triumphant Gleam'' Hail Satanas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This IS true norwegian black metal","review":"First of all id like to point out that norwegian black metal is dead. yes, the post-burzum early-90s-era is over and black metal isnt what it was. some of you may recognize bands like dimmu borgir and satyricon to still be black metal, but they are merely a shadow of what they used to be. darkthrone, though, has managed to keep the same raw and unrefined style to all their music. this is why they alone have maintained my respect all the way through to their newest release \\"Hate Them\\". \\"Panzerfaust\\" is arguably their best work through the years, followed closely by \\"Transylvanian Hunger\\". If you are looking for the definition of True Norwegian Black Metal, this is it, look no further. (Note: the title for track #1 is \\"En Vind Av Sorg\\" not \\"En Vind Ab Sorg\\", i know because the latter does not make sense in norwegian, my native language. it means \\"a wind of sorrow\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"APPLE -EMAC KEYBOARD","review":"The key board works great, great price on the item and shipping, The key board is in great shape for it age. thanks again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't ever buy REFURBISHED!!!

Great definitions for abreviations and symbols and how tos for reading patterns and applying them to your work. This book shows you how to do basic to complicated crochet stitches. I really like the color photos of differet yarns by thickness with suggested hook sizes. Great color photos of each one of the stitch patterns with suggested yarns and uses given on each one.

It seems to be made quite well. There is a plethora of colors to choose from. I bought the Navy, to play it safe, but may buy my Mom more of these sweaters in varying shades to spice up her wardrobe. This sweater has nice, clean lines, yet feminine with the subtle stiching details. Not cheap looking at all, attractive in appearance.

I thought the supplied batteries might have been dead but eventually determined it was a faulty battery cage. I used the cage from a similar flashlight with other issues and it is now working.

But realized it is caused from the LEDs seem to be mounted very loosly to the flashlight (almost like they are attached to springs) so that any small movement/shaking of the flashlight is amplified by the LEDs that shake.

I also tried my own batteries and still no success."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Flashlight That Doesn't Light","review":"Do not buy this product. It is impossible to align the battery cradle that fits inside the flashlight for a stable electrical connection.

After a week, mine started oscillating: bright/dim/bright/dim. I fed it 3 fresh new Energizer alkalines, which put it in a different phase: dim/bright/dim/bright. The problem with this little light is the unstable, inconsistent contact. Once any of the springs (4 altogether) loosens up the least bit, the light makes enough contact with the surface area to \\"work\\" but not with a consistently high beam. The solution, at least a temporary one, is to pry all 4 springs out just enough to insure adequate tension when you reinstall the 3-spring battery holder and the light itself. That should insure a non-flickering light until the process needs to be repeated, though it's unlikely the springs will permit this sort of readjusting indefinitely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"I just received this in the mail. The button broke on it the first time I used it. The light is bright, but the housing is cheap. I would not trust it to be durable. If you want a throw away flashlight, then get it.

You're better off paying a little more for a better made, higher quality LED flashlight. I bought it to use during an emergency in a storm, but I never even got the chance to.

They wanted to be pop stars and not rock stars. In fact one of the reasons for John Norums departure was the desire of Joey Tempest to target the pop audience. Not a recipe for longevity and the boys should of known it.Secondly the songs sound like keyboard washed out takes of good songs. There are some hooks in the songs, and some emotion in the ballads though a reworking of ballads from earlier in your career in search of a hit is never a popular ploy with the fans.More grunt and less soft rock pomp should of been in order. Also not doing the north american leg of the Def Leppard tour would have to rate as one of the worst business decisions in hard rock history......But this was a temporary low"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing 80's rock record","review":"This is just a plainly underrated record. True, it could have used a little less production (maybe that should take one star from the rating but...), but the songs are, for the most part, amazing. Tempest's voice is at its peak, and Marcello's fretwork is amazing. His blend of melody and shredding in the tasty, finely-honed solos is something not to miss for any guitar fan. I wonder how the record would have sounded, had Nevison (producer) given a rawer edge (and a little bit more space) to Marcello's guitar. The rest of the band sounds pretty tight...although drums are a bit dull at some moments (again, blame it on Nevison!).Being a long time fan (or \\"old\\" Europe and now of their new sound as well), I have to say that OOTW ranks among their best song-collection, if not the best.For those into 80's melodic hard rock, this is a must. For those not into the '80s sound, check out 2004 Start from the Dark and, soon, 2006 Secret Society."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of the 80s","review":"This is a great album guys, surely the best of this band and one of the best I've ever listened to.

Ten years later it still rocks just as hard! the musical arrangments are tight and hard, and the vocals harmonies are beautiful.

I am even using the \\"new\\" versions of the pictures to paint. That's something I couldn't have even imagined doing, without all of the editing capabilities. There are 2 drawbacks though, you need to pre-plan the picture, it's delayed between the time you hit the button, and actually taking the picture. Also, either use the AC adaptor,or use rechargeable batteries, it kills them quickly.

They have similar features but the pdc1300 goes one better on a number of features: 1.) higher res photos 2.) USB and parallel download 3.) macro mode (photos are quite clear) 4.)Flash works great even close up - doesn't white out the subject 5.) Slightly larger LCD 6.) AC adapter included. Positives: Very easy to use, great pictures, great price. Battery life is actually pretty good if LCD is kept to minimal use.

Windows formats cards using FAT32. Digital cameras use FAT16. Guess why it doesn't work.

I've never seen a game make it easier to hurt someone's feelings, ego or self esteem. You know those things you're not supposed to discuss in public? How about we put them into a game and make our friends feel bad? Yeah, awesome!Seriously, this game must have been designed by someone with either no friends, or someone who hated their friends.

However there is no translation of St. Maximous works to be found here, rather a interpretation of his works by Prof. Thunberg.Its a long and tedious read at best and unless the reader knows the early church fathers and thinkers like Evagrius of Pontus, a lot of what is written will be 'greek' to the reader.As such it should appeal to religous scholars interested in St. Maximous's theology. Others should steer clear of it.Its sad that such a fine intellect like St. Maximous still lacks a decent translator. So far the only accessible translation of some of his works is the Philokalia Vol 2.The reason I'm only giving it two stars is that Lungberg did not include a translation of St. Maximous and being a excessive tedious and dry read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get used to it.","review":"Alright, here's how it is.

Admittedly, I didn't care for it as much as their other albums at first, but after a couple of listens, I couldn't stop humming the tunes.

This sheath fits securely and it is easy to slide your KABAR in or out and it will be able to stand up to some abuse \\"out there\\" unlike its Leather counterparts which are prone to rot/rips/tears/weathering. It does not \\"budge up\\" when you are trying to draw your KABAR off of your hip belt at-all like many sheaths tend to want to do and it is just an all around GREAT buy and worth every penny of investment.

The sheath has many mounting options, from a simple belt mount to tactical straps, allowing this sheath to be placed basically anywhere about the body.

In this one, Barich has relocated to Ireland and is in the throes of a new relationship whilst chronicling the Irish jump season. The best part about the book is that, well, it's Bill Barich, who could make the phone book interesting; that the story involves horses and their people is just the icing on the cake. A Fine Place to Daydream spends less time on its author (Laughing in the Hills was a memoir before memoiring was cool) and more time on the Irish jump scene, which makes for compelling reading. I've been a big fan of Barich's for a long, long time, and this one has done nothing to dissuade me. Another fine piece of writing. ****"},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice magazine piece","review":"The book is TEDIOUS.

Maybe the ending is a corker, but I doubt it. Never got that far.This would make a good 1,500-word magazine piece.

Following the records kept by members of the Plimouth Colony (spelling intentional) and having actors/actresses act out those events brought home the sheer terror the dwellers of Salem experienced, along with the unimaginable torment experienced by those accused of witchcraft, etc., by various usually younger members of the society. One observation may have been far more representative of reality, that being the accusers allegedly rolling, screaming, babbling may well have been based upon their desires to have attention cast upon them. This would be fine, but there were a number of people whose lives were taken because of the 'testimonies'. This is an intriguing reenactment which could be well used to understand the paranoia of the Salem group.

The eneormous riffs, loud harmonics, and screaming vocals from their first 2 cds are gone. Im surprised that such a talented band would write such incredibly dull and boring songs such as \\"crashing around you\\" and the idiotic \\"american high\\".

We bought tickets to see Tommy Flanagan mostly because it fit into our schedule--not because we had any idea what a jazz legend he is. Seeing Tommy play live was a transcendent experience, and not because I had a couple of martinis during the performance. He breaths life into each piece and simply lets them go where they naturally wish to. The results are fantastic. After the show, I had the honor of meeting Tommy and I told him how much I enjoyed his work. He was very polite, even though at 21, I could offer no great insight into jazz. I resolved then to buy his CDs. This was one of them--and perhaps my favorite. It is called Thelonica because they are all pieces written in the style of the great Thelonious Monk.

I especially liked \\"Goin' To Vegas.\\" He may have one-hit wonder written all over his handsome face, but it's fun while it lasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"It starts to grow on you.","review":"It's like Elvis and James Dean taking a ride through Country while having a party with the cast of Grease.

It was more Hollywood oriented than I expected. It was great to see some Asian American actors and great to see some expression of what it is like to be an Asian American teenager. However, I thought that the violence in the film detracted from the larger meaning of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great advance for Asian Americans in Hollywood","review":"Overall, the movie ranks about a B+, but in terms of its contribution to Asian Americans in Hollywood, I'd have to give it an A.It's so nice to see Asian Americans being regular punk ass kids who speak perfect English. Too often all you see in movies are Asians who a)can't speak English b)are practicing martial arts or c)are playing prostitutes or geeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"MTV FILM IS NO ROCK AND ROLL FUN","review":"This film isn't deserving of the controversy it created in depicting Asian American teenagers involved in petty crime which escalates into heavier criminal activity. No, this film is guilty of much more. Just when it has walked the plankboard of typical high school teen angst as depicted in scores of other minority based films, it then jumps into the cold water relying on 'hammer to the head' dramatic shock value to give the aimless narrative some direction. Aside from this violent murder scene that the movie seems to celebrate, this is really dull stuff, like watching the kids from TV's \\"Beverly Hills 90210\\" walking down an endless school corridor sporting guns under their belts. The dramatic hook at the beginning of the film is a tremendous letdown by movie's end. \\"Better Luck Tomorrow\\" is tough luck today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been There, Seen It.","review":"At first it's mildly interesting that the kids in this paint-by-numbers teens-gone-bad movie are Asian American. Then, as they devolve into Asian American stereotypes--they're all academically driven genius nerds at first, then become a street gang--that slight interest wears off, and you're left with a movie that says absolutely nothing about teens that hasn't been said 100 times before. And it says that very very slowly and dully and over way too many minutes. Some fine acting, but it's wasted on this utterly unimaginative film. In the end it's kind of a cynical exercise in getting out the ethnic vote."},{"rating":"1","title":"a complete bomb","review":"I was barely able to finish it, I so completely lost interest in EVERY aspect of it. There was nothing compelling about any of the characters. The \\"love story\\" part of it inspires no emotion. The whole cynical modern youth theme is a joke here.

It's ostensibly a story of California Asian high school kids who are so smart they can engage in all sorts of criminal activity while their parents think they are studying.The movie just 100 minutes and it felt long about 90 minutes into it, but I liked it just the same. These guys spend the movie contriving all sorts of schemes for boredom more than money. The main character is really more interested in getting into an Ivy League school and winning over the girl in his science class (Jerry Mathers plays their Science teacher in a nice cameo).It was fast, sharp and funny.

This is the album that made this band. Another Day in Paradise and The Skinny Years ... were good, but sound like crap when compared to this album. I've been a punk-rocker since I was pre-teen, I've gone to shows and played in shows, and I will tell you from experience that this is what every punk band wants to sound like.

Maybe the program is good for geeks who know how to set it up, but I don't want to spend my life adjusting the settings, especially since I don't know what I'm doing. It sometimes interferes with normal (presumably safe) Internet use, requiring me to check and adjust the settings, but I am guessing every time I do this. I may be making my computer LESS safe. I can't tell, and the program doesn't tell me, either. Zone Alarm's \\"support,\\" unless you want to pay, consists mostly of answers from other users, most of whom are also geeks.

Let's be honest, fish oil is one of those supplements that you have to have faith in because the benefits aren't going to be seen simply by taking it for a while. The main reason I like it is because there is no belching, no after-taste, no digestive issues or upset stomach, and these are the things I was concerned about from my experience with other brands. I had my shoulder operated on several years ago and I can sometimes hear the joint when I rotate it, or even feel it. Since I began taking this supplement, the joint seems to work much smoother.

His music is easy to the ears and soothing to the soul. You will stop and pay attention when he plays his guitar, sounds seemingly laid back but is crystal clear and full of life.

This is an excellent disc, in my opinion his best yet. I haven't been able to displace it from my car stereo after 3 weeks.This work is a bit more uptempo than his others, many tracks have a pronounced bass drive and subtle programmed textures that add depth and complexity to the music. There's not a clunker on the disc, I highly recommend it. For my money Peter White is one of the best of the smooth jazz lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"There Is Nothing Confidential About This Artist","review":"Wow! Peter White has done it once again. A terrific album loaded with something for every Smooth Jazz listener. The cut with Christopher Cross is reminiscent of the Arthur theme. And Mindi Abair seems to be everywhere these days!

Of course, all the other collaborators are superb; Brian Culbertson, Paul Brown, etc. A must buy for any Peter White fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Instrumental Album w/ A Return Of A Classic Vocal","review":"This is a fantastic, breezy glide of an album. Peter White seems to have a lock on this groove and he's not worried about those who don't \\"get it\\".The album also marks the return of Christopher Cross, whos gentle delivery of \\"She's In Love\\", the Brenda Russell/Jay Graydon composition, shows how a classic, simple style can bring more to a song than the vocal acrobatics of others.

I was happy to read the description of this one because it fit my hair type exactly - greasy roots and frazzled ends.I tried this shampoo and the frazzled ends became worse! I was truly puzzled, and thought it was my imagination. I even purchased the conditioner and used it only on the ends but it just didn't make a difference.One of the other odd things that I noticed is that I had to use more of this shampoo to wash my hair. With other shampoos, I can get a smaller amount and start at the scalp and it will work through all the way to the tips. However, I had to use 2x as much of this shampoo, as it seems to just absorb itself into my scalp and won't spread to the tips.I have given it a fair shake; I've been using it for 6 weeks consistently.

I was sorely disappointed. In an effort to be \\"heavier\\" they made a hell of a lot of noise... making them sound ridiculous and brain-less.

If you want good music from Coal Chamber, get their Self-titled or Chamber Music (my favorite)."},{"rating":"2","title":"living in the dark days","review":"good sh!t. this is probably coal chamber's heaviest album thus far. it's much better than chamber music, and about on par with their self titled debut. something told me, fiend, friend, and one step are all amazng. a couple of the songs on here aren't that great, but it's very good. the vocals are probably the best ones out of all of the coal chamber releases. the lyrics aren't as angsty, but what are ya gonna do...?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coal Chamber ~ Dark Days","review":"I like this wicked album. \\"Fiend\\", \\"Something Told Me\\", and \\"Glow\\" are among my favorite songs on this CD. However, there is just one little problem: I wish Coal Chamber's headsinger (Dez) would quit trying to sound scary and sing with the normal talented voice he really has. Coal Chamber's past albums were perfect in my opinion, but in the album, Dez tries too hard to make his voice sound dark & disturbing. It can give you a head ache after awhile (depending on who you are). But anyway, this album still kicks buttocks and fans of black/gothic rock and heavy metal should be pleased. Be sure to buy the uncensored version of this CD since it's a lot better than the 'edited version'. You should get your moneys worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect. I love this stuff..........","review":"Coal Chamber kicks..., man! I bought this CD several weeks ago and I love this stuff! Songs like Fiend, Something Told Me, Alienate, Glow, and many more of the songs on this album really give me the perfect audio assault! If you love hard rock & metal (Slipknot, Marilyn Manson, Drowning Pool, etc.) then get this incredible album, man!!! IT KICKS MAJOR ...!!!\\"...\\" ----Something Told Me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is the best Coal Chamber album. The first album rocked very hard, but was undermined slightly by so-so sound. Chamber Music was let's say, lackluster. An overproduced version of the first. Dark Days isn't breaking any new musical ground, but it sounds 100 times better than Chamber Music. This CD is going in my top 50 all-time greatest. My favorite, \\"Fiend\\" sounds a bit like Marilyn Manson, and kicks the CD off nicely. The title track sounds like it came off of the first CD, but got polished a little bit more. Overall, if you're a disenchanted Coal Chamber fan (like I was), give 'em a break and give this one a listen. If you're a fan of the genre, this is a must have. And if you like your music hard, loud, and fast, this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coal Chamber at their most abrasive","review":"I've been a Coal Chamber fan since I heard \\"Shock the Monkey\\" on VH1's \\"Rock Show\\" back in 1999(yes, CC was on VH1). I liked that song and a while later came upon a copy of \\"Chamber Music\\" in a pawn shop and bought it. I loved every last song on that record so I bought their first one and loved it, as well. After this, I waited patiently for \\"Dark Days\\" to come out. I bought it a while after it came out and I must say, it rules! It has a more focused approach than on either previous album, and it is much heavier than them both. The only problem is, I kind of wish they had kept a little of the depth of their previous releases. While it is a great record, it gets a little monotonus after a while, and it doesn't have much \\"re-listen\\" value. I was hoping that they would incorporate a little more melody on their next album, but last week, I heard that they broke up. But, despite this album's shortcomings, it is a fitting swan song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about unoriginal....","review":"Okay, I know that most nu-metal will sound like KoRn, since they practically invented the genre (depending on how you look at it), but this is just unacceptable. It's almost the same thing as KoRn, but without the emotional power of Jonathan Davis. Coal Chamber's pitifully unoriginal, and if you were to pick between wannabes of KoRn and KoRn, you should just get KoRn.Now, this album does have the song \\"Fiend\\", but is that really worth fourteen bucks? No. Very mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as bad as Drowning Pool, but so close it's scary","review":"Well..to put it blatantly this album is horrible. One of the worst nu metal offerings ever. Dez's lyrics...well I don't even have to comment on them. But the man should quit trying to sound \\"scary\\" and actually sing. And Meeg's needs to learn songs can have more then 2 chords, also he should stop tap dancing on his effects pedals.Honestly it's albums like this that just make me laugh. They are so horrible it's amazing anyone can take them seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits into CC's golden line up","review":"Deff one of CC's greatest cd's along with their previous two. This is most certainly their most Metal and heaviest album. The most focused guitar attack by them too. Some repetativeness but overall every song has its good qualties and it has some of CC's best work. Somethign Told Me and Dark Days deff two of their strongest songs ever. This album would be the last quality work set forth by them in my opinion. I find myself listening to CC all the time on their first three outputs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably their worst effort","review":"This is a great CD. But not nearly as good as their s/t or Chamber Music. Chamber music was my personal favorite. Every song on this CD sounds very much the same. Not exactly though. The thing I don't like is that it has no regular singing like it does on the first two CDs. I would recommend getting this CD though, it's not worth the price of a new CD, see if you can get it used."},{"rating":"2","title":"is it Coal in here, or is it just me?","review":"CC's follow up to their '99 release is amazing. It grabs you by the neck from that first chord, and doesn't let go until the last note on \\"Beckoned\\" (the last track). Try it, just tell your parents the marks on your neck are from your girlfreind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely nothing to be gained from this album","review":"I gave this album an honest listen, with an open mind and ears. Brad Fafara's lyrics, just as in their two other horrid releases, love to repeat the same laughable lyrics over and over in the same format choruses. Sure, I hear they put on a good live SHOW, but that says absolutely nothing for this lackluster music. They love to live at the same tempo for darn near every single song on all 3 of their albums. Fafara sounds like he's gurgling phlegm when he yells, in comparison to some of the other more listenable howlers out there, such as Jamey Jasta of Hatebreed (*gasp* real lyrics, coherent too!). Once again, don't expect anything new. This has all been done before, there is absolutely no improvement in the band whatsoever.

I liked it because it was small and relatively cheap. Well I left in the car for about a month, until one day when i actually needed to use it, and it didnt work.Turns out that the batteries that came with the flashflight exploded inside the flash light and leaked acid everywhere, ruing the flashlight. This may be my fault for not using better name brand batteries, but i've never had this happen with any other batteries that come with a cheap product before.When the flashlight did work, I would only rate it as a 3 star flashlight. It feels very cheap as if it's not made of anything other than plastic, and it wasn't nearly as bright as I would have hoped. I would recommend spending a few dollars more on a nice flashlight and forgo the headache of this one not working when you need it to."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"thats the moral of the story. a cheap price for a cheap product.

They work out of the box but then go bad later. I wanted a reliable, durable, easy-to-carry, compact flashlight with a bright-enough light and this did the job. I know other customers had problems with the build, but my flashlight never failed on me and I didn't even have to use the back-up batteries I took with me. Its good enough for me at least. I dont think you will regret buying one. I went on a 2 day rock climbing trip and, believe me, I used this flashlight many a times while navigationg through the woods and rocks to what needed to be done. Definitely not the most powerful light out there, but I wasn't really looking for a floodlight and besides, the batter lasts longer when its not overly demanding/bright.."},{"rating":"2","title":"overall good","review":"Bought 3 of these flashlights in different colors. One of the units, the cool blue one, first started showing intermittent lighting, then died. After pushing on the glass face of the flashlight, the light came back on, but soon went away. After a few more tries pushing on the glass face, the light came back on, hopefully to stay. To ensure that it stays operational, I've added superglue to make sure the glass does not shift out the millimeter or two that seems to kill the flashlight. Still decided to give it 4 stars because for the price it does give out decent light to use on camping trips, and battery life has been good though I have not timed it. Also, to be fair, it did take some abuse from my son, and I don't really expect a low priced flashlight to handle too much abuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surpassed Expectations...","review":"I added this to my order to qualify for Super Saver. I had read mixed reviews that said it was a very iffy product that (more often than not) was very glitchy and on again, off again.

The beam is very bright and is created by 9 LED pin lights (one in the center surrounded by eight in a circle).

Even then, the lighting was inconsistent. When I opened it to try to fix it, the spring popped out & I was unable to insert it again - it was too far down in the flashlight to reach, even with needlenose pliers. You get what you pay for.

These guys are a surprisingly good combo of funny songs with tight music."},{"rating":"1","title":"wizo","review":"The way the instraments were played and the way this cd sounded was actually pretty good, but that was the only good thing. The cd is in german so if you dont understand german they have the words translated in the cd jacket. All of the songs are very violent. The first song TOD IM FREIBAD (Tod at the Pool) was about a rotting corpse that everyone was staring at while they were swimming. I really just got a very angry and hateful vibe from this cd. Another song, HOW COULD I'VE KNOWN, was about the singer rapeing a girl. That was pretty messed up. The band also seemed a little racist. They're an anarchist group and they say they hate religion. They probably just do this to get a rise out of people. Another thing i noticed was on the jacket of the cd. There is a drawing of a skull and it looks like it has horns. The nazis in germany always depicted jewish people with horns. its probably nothing though. All in all, this cd sounded o.k. but i just didn't like the message it was sending."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the Same!","review":"Of course these women are perfect, anyone would be with gads of body makeup and the help of a great airbrush artist.

What about Asian women? There are people out here who find black and Asian women attractive. Six blonde white models and two dark-haired Latinas is not my idea of diversity.

The author also proves the unity and harmony of the Bible by listing fourteen Old Testament prophecies of the Messiah which are fulfilled in the New Testament. I greatly enjoyed learning about the historical principles contained in each book of the Bible. For example, God's mercy and forgiveness is revealed in the Book of Ezra. This book helped me regain appreciation for God's Written Word!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Confirmation of the Legitimacy of the Bible","review":"The author is very efficient in explaining the history of the Bible. Holy men of God were anointed of the Holy Ghost, who inspired and dictated to them how to write the mind and will of God. How amazing that over hundreds of years with forty-four different writers all having different backgrounds, the Bible remained true to its theme of Jesus Christ as Saviour of mankind, leading man back to the Heavenly Father. The theme of the Old Testament is to reveal the coming of Jesus Christ, the Messiah; and the New Testament reveals Jesus as Saviour, establishes the church, foretells the future, and reveals what the Old Testament was really about. All sixty-six books present a beautiful light just as the candlestick did in the Old Testament with ornamentation of sixty-six bowls, knops, and flowers.

One of the ones that I like is Autumn Leaves. It has a woodsy smell. There is also a hint of sweetness to it; probably because of the cinnamon in it.

There are other times when I break them on purpose because I don't have time to burn a whole stick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile sticks","review":"This incense smells okay and burns for a reasonable amount of time; however, it is almost too fragile to handle.

This book is also a good political history of the CSA, although it often focuses too much on certain individuals. The reason I give this book just two stars is because while Davis would have you believe that his book is a new look at the Confederacy, this is really just a regurgitation of Emory Thomas' The Confederate Nation. Davis' book may be more mass market friendly and less academic than Thomas', but Davis' book makes all the same points Thomas' book made back in 1979. Both are worth reading, but know that Davis is not breaking any new ground and I'd say Thomas' work is the better of the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland overview of CSA","review":"Davis has done better. Although a thematic, rather than chronological, approach can work in general histories like this, it doesn't work here. There's a lot of jumping around and a lack of coherency at times. Also, Davis used 1/4th of the book just to get to Lincoln's First Inagural. Davis wrote a good history of the origins of the Confederacy, so I don't see why we need 100 pages of detail on that here.I give it two stars because there's always something to learn from a fine researcher. This one was a big disappointment, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"History Flip Flop","review":"I am confused on what is true history in our Country . I read Mr. Davis book \\"A Government of our Own\\" about the Confederacy written in 1994 and he gave a very pleasant and interesting view of the Government and how it was formed . After reading \\"Look Away\\" it was almost as if the NAACP was the Co Author . I have never read such a scornfull and dark book of the people of the South and the Confederacy in my life. What changed Mr. Davis mind since 1994 ? Did History change since then , or is it more politically correct to trash all things Southern now . It makes me wonder about other so called Historians and how much we really know about our past ."},{"rating":"1","title":"very flat account...","review":"I've enjoyed a good many of Mr. Davis' Civil War books, but I was less than impressed with this effort. For one, it is more of a political history of sorts - little mention of battles or military intrigues for example. An opening section concerning the \\"founding fathers-like\\" atmosphere of the Montgomery sessions was of interest, but thereafter the text mires in tedium. Davis seems merely to dwell on the negative back-biting political skirmishes of the important personages of the times - Wigfall, Toombs, Rhett, et al. Perhaps a better title would have been \\"A History of DISSENT Within the Confederate States\\". I will certainly be very wary of any future work done by Mr. Davis.There was very little I learned reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Ordered these for hiking in rainy fall.

(I agree with the other comments on the \\"Deliverance\\" sample, by the way.

I had been searching for it for years on CD and was stoked to find it about 10 years ago as a Fench import. I cannot add much to the above reviews except to say that the addition of the great jazz/classical flautist, James Hastings (on flute and sax) elevates this album from merely great to best prog-rock album ever. Listen to his unbelievable fade-out flute solo on the last track 'Limits' and weep along with me why anyone would be stupid enough to fade it out instead of letting him go on and on for another 10 minutes!

Tracks here I found to be most inspiring were the jamming opener title cut \\"If I Could Do It All Over Again...\\", the folk progressive piece \\"With An Ear To The Ground\\" and the fourteen minute \\"Can't Be Long Now\\".

Rieu's interpretation (shortened) of Ode to Joy with his outstanding female soloists was as moving as the Symphony's 300 person chorus. I suspect the backdrop of Cortina played a big role.Experiencing Rieu live is the greatest way to experience him, nevertheless, music lovers will get great enjoyment out of this well done DVD.

And that is the way the entire book reads. As soon as you think you have a handle on any of the characters, you learn something new that changes everything. The result is that it's almost impossible to make a judgment about anyone.Anna, in particular, becomes more tragic just for that reason. First we see her as the dutiful, virtuous wife of a passionless man. Then we see her easily corrupted by the decadent Vronsky. How \\"good\\" was she in the first place if she was such a willing victim? And even though we see in painful detail why she continuously refuses to do the right thing until it's too late, we still find ourselves asking why.Who is avenging themselves on whom, and why? Some of the answers are obvious, but some are unexpected and make the most righteous characters downright malicious, and the most unsympathetic almost pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big spectacular book that should appeal to many readers.","review":"This classic Tolstoy novel about love, loss and the nature of good is one of those books that should be re-read to fully appreciate their scope. As a teenager, you focus on the doomed love affair between Anna and Vronsky. As a thirtysomething reader, I read it as a book about compromises and trust. I can only expect that if I read it at midlife, I am going to find something else again.It is too big to be perfect, and you can pick nits with much of what Tolstoy has done here. But why would you?

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The highest of masterpieces, Anna Karenin surpasses review","review":"My main purpose of writing this is to highlight the important fact that Tolstoy (inarguably amongst the greatest writers that have ever, and will ever, grace bookshelves all over the world) wrote the most magnificent, inspiring, and beautifully genius books that I have ever read. Reading Anna Karenin creates something new in a person that I feel cannot be explained in a simplistic review, done by silly people who mis-state facts and practically pass it off as a tear-jerker-slash-adventure novel of some sort. It encompasses the truest passions and truths a person can endure, and it flows with such inimitable candor and breadth and insight that I doubt I will ever experience so much from reading one novel ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read!","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time! Though Anna Karenin is not necessarily an easy or quick read, you will thank yourself for persevering and reading this book. Tolstoi has an amazing way with characterization and descriptive narrative. He managed to find just the right words or phrase something in just such a way as to evoke real feeling from the reader; you can truly identify with the character/situation at those moments and appreciate the literary beauty of this novel throughout. Happy reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the critics","review":"To say AK is a bad book because one does not like the characters is absurd.

All the songs are decent to listen to with some of them I never heard before because the cd's their on you can't buy anymore.

This also includes 2 of his unreleased songs, \\"24 Hours To Live\\", and \\"Black Nigga Killa\\". They both ended up becoming singles off this album to prove how good they were and how sick of a voice Eazy had back in the day.

Rather, it's Jefferson's letters written in the mid-1780s, plus two biographical essays. Thus, while the title doesn't make this clear, it appears to be the digitized version of *one* volume of Jefferson's collected works.

The jokes were not socially concious and did not teach the audience anything valuable about life.

Comedians like Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor and Redd Foxx didn't make us look bad when they did comedy, and now their legacies have been decimated with this video and these men and others like them.

What more can be said? Their boring, overdone routine made me want to vomit. In short, they shouldn't be called the \\"queens\\" of anything; let alone comedy since there are other female comedians who are way funnier and have a thoudsand times better material than these blowhards.It's a real shame that the people in those DVDs wasted their time and money seeing something that wasn't funny in the first place.

This book was supposed to have been about a girl being killed and the person that the police believe is the suspect. The author even takes the time to do his own introduction.

I was very excited to begin listening to the story.I was all set to listen to a GREAT book on Southern life and the murder of this poor girl. ... With 12 CD's, I had no desire to listen to the rest.

Will Patton has been doing the voice on the abridged versions for years and is superb. He is Robicheaux. Hammer sounds like he himself is drunk much of the time, allowing the voices of different characters to blend together. His style slows down the story. While this novel is clearly not James Lee Burke's best outing in this series, it deserves better than Hammer can give it. My recommendation: go with the unabridged audio version or the CD version, both of which feature Will Patton. The producers must have taken the day off on this one. Very, very disappointing to this James Lee Burke devoted reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading instead of performing","review":"... Not only available, but unabridged and read by Will Patton, whom I feel is the best reader now that Frank Muller is hurt. Burke's descriptions are unsurpassed and Patton's performances are unmatched, certainly in the Southern dialect.Now, imagine my disappointment in receiving my audiocassette and finding someone named Frank Hammer as the READER. I use the emphasis to highlight that he is a reader aand not a performer. Patton's renditions are true art, Hammer just reads.

What a mistake! I could barely comprehend what was going on in the plot. The reader, Mark Hammer, was truly awful. He spoke in a slow, mumbling, gravelly-voiced monotone that made it difficult to understand what he was saying most of the time. He had two voices -- one white and one black. It was impossible to discern which character was speaking at any given time. Also, the character of Dave Robichaux on page seems to be in his mid- to late-50s. The narrator sounds older than my 87-year old grandfather. I stopped listening after about 3 hours.

I'd set it one position behind what for me is now Burke's masterpiece, PURPLE CANE ROAD, because the plot meanders a bit in the second act, but it's a very close second and the bar which Burke has set remains out of reach for all but a handful of contemporary writers.

It's poorly structured and erratic, working some muscle groups far more than others and a few not at all. For example, most of the upper-body work is triceps and the lower-body section works one leg, shifts to a section of ab work, and then works the second leg much later and with fewer reps. The workout is interrupted with two too-short \\"aerobic\\" intervals that are just plain confusing. Also, while it's billed as \\"low-impact\\" there's a section of jumping -- by definition a high-impact activity.Like most FIRM tapes, this workout requires a ridiculous amount of equipment, including several sets of hand weights, leg weights, a FIRM \\"tall box,\\" and for complete overload a specially weighted barbell and a towel.

The overblown production and at times painfully off-key vocals don't help matters here, either. And the SenseField worship becomes quite obvious in lyrics like \\"...I was thinking of my faaather\\". This is just one of those albums that might impress upon the very first listen, but subsequent spins reveal not much else behind the \\"heartfelt\\" thrust/tender whisper routine.

This band is in the business to make an honest buck doing what they love without much media support whatsoever.

The two driving forces drifting apart made the entire album likeable to everyone, not only \\"Tin Cans with Strings to You\\" people.Best tracks in my 'ever so' humble opinion-Bury White, Really Here, Mother Mary, I Like It, and MAN OVERBOARD (my personal favorite)."},{"rating":"2","title":"big feelings, fine lyrics and best musik","review":"I have this cd now for over one year and I never get bored of it. Sometimes you feel down and lonely, then you hear this musik and you are getting better. I heard FAR isn't existing any more -too bad! I hoped to see them in concert for one more time!

(well thats the only other one i have and im in love with it.) this cd is too happy... over use of melodys and crap. i mean.. sure it works a lot of the time but this cd isnt really that punk apart from the drum beats. trashed is punk. oh and you guy that said you listen to offspring and greenday and you say ur punk... man... get out more. listen to nofx, bad religion, casualties, OLD afi, circle jerks, OLD nufan, and then figure out which is more punk."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should be 0 stars","review":"THIS CD (...)!!!! I first bought Double PLadium then i took it back because the cd was skipping. The store didn't have an extra copy of Double PLadium so i bought Hoss instead. That was the biggest mistake i have ever made. Everysong sounds the same. I bought this cd 2 months ago and tried really hard to like this cd, but i couldn't. If you must get a Lagwagon CD then go out and buy Double Pladium. Double PLadium is 10 times better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but just not \\"Punk\\" more like Polka","review":"Well everyone gave this great reviews honestly I don't see whats so special about it. No punk, this is not punk at all. I like the beats, but the songs don't have that certain punkishness to them.Maybe it's just cuz I've been spoiled by Greenday, and Offspring, stuff like that, which is true punk. Man, I could of sworn I heard this on the easy listening station, haha."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great punk album!","review":"I first heard this album when i borrowed it from a friend, and ever since then i've been hooked on lagwagon. i love joey's voice. the guitars are awesome. the bass and drums just kick. this is just a great album! I love all the songs from the skate-rock of \\"violins\\" to the metal-esque \\"ride the snake\\" all in all this is one of my favorite punk albums, and you should buy it if you don't already have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"I'm not a huge Lagwagon fan but I do enjoy some of their stuff. One song inspired me to buy this album: \\"Violins\\". Overall it was a good purchase and I'm happy with the entire album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Punk Album Ever","review":"Hoss is by far the greatest punk album ever. I have played this cd for many people in my life and have never met anyone that disliked this music. Not even my dad. The Melodic Punk music that is Lagwagon emulates from Joey's amazing voice and creative yet poignant lyrics and continues through the fantastic guitars and bass of Chris, Leon and Jessie. The music flows from beginning to end, from song to song, and there is not one song that you will ever want to turn off before it is completed. If you like punk music and don't already know of Lagwagon or haven't yet heard this album, I promise you that purchasing this will change your life. I give this cd 10 stars and highly recommend it for any music fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is not worth the tape it is made of. What is so SICK about this movie is that it is package in a cool and scary cover but the movie and I use the term loosely, is nothing but homemade porn. I can't believe anyone ever thought that bad acting by trashy fools, ignorant plot, and shooting a movie with your mom's camera was ever a good idea. This piece junk was as bad as the movie The Item. Don't waste your time, money, or brain cells on these idiots that released this toilet water on anyone.

Actually, that is the last thing I would call this master work from the four woman powerhouse with the awesome stories and the drool-worthy men that is CLAMP. \\"A save Tokyo City Story\\" denotes that this would be a story full of giant robots and superheroes, rather than delicate men with supernatural powers and the secrets they hide. I'll summarize for you: Subaru is a naive(ish) sixteen year old boy who follows his family's profession as the Onmyouji (literally yin-yang magician)for Tokyo, where he sorts out the spirits of the dead and their (often multiple) problems. Along the way he is accompanied by sometimes shallow twin sister Hokuto and his crush, the older, mysterious Seishirou. And that's all I'm gonna say! Heh heh.

It may be hard for younger people to relate to this, as we use the railroad's competition: cars and airplanes. However, this is about the rise and fall of a product. In the same way that cassette tapes, snail mail, BETA, etc. have risen and fallen, this transportation did the same.

Is nothing sacred ? Is everything up for sale ? YES. YES.More discouragening is the gullable US public. Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather, M.Safer(all millionaires by the way) etc etc are simply reading/reporting (entertaining) what they are instructed to report by their corporate owners.

There is a certain amount of reverence when handling the subject matter of War. No matter how much action they contain, most Hollywood War films usually have a base of genuine patriotism at their core. Even an anti-war film stays true to its course. PEARL HARBOR is not about patriotism or any higher aspirations. It's really all about CG effects and the almighty dollar at the expense of real lives. What is the value of this chameleon-like book spreading the pseudo- patriotic message of the film?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for the price!","review":"I just bought this book and it totally blew me away. Contrary to another review here, I find almost every page of this book to be extremely informative and jam-packed with information on the real attack and the making of the movie, with LOTS of movie photos and a lot of historical photos too. Also included are short bios of movie characters, quotes about the movie and the event from cast and crew, and storyboards and a timeline of the events of that day. I HIGHLY recommend this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Distortion of history","review":"A book about Pearl Harbor, the Movie should be a book *about* Pearl Harbor, the Movie! Here, there are a few pages of cast bio in the front, and about 20 pages of information of how the movie was made at the back (well, a paragraph or two of information per page, and lots of photos). In between is the 'real' history of the attack on Pearl Harbor...but it is illustrated by scenes from the movie - which really bore little relationship to the actual events and to use them to illustrate those events is horrible! At the very least, a photo of the real General Doolittle should have been put beside that of Alec Baldwin (who portrayed him) a photo of the real Genda beside that of Tagawa, who portrayed him), etc. This book succeeds neither as a history of Pearl Harbor, nor as a Making of the Movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"I saw the movie before i read te book and i must say that both of them are great!

I have had it a month and it is already broken. Needle skips from first song to almost end of album. Will try a new needle but gee whiz, this one is only one month old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job, Fairly Nice Machine","review":"It's a decent, good looking machine for the money. Not fabulous, but serviceable and decent looking.The arm and the table area (inside the cover) are kind of plastic-y, but it plays well and we have had no problems with it. I like the fact that it has a floating turntable. Also on the plus side, it plays records well at all three speeds, and I like the fact that Crosley has replacement needles so I don't have to go hunting for them. As another reviewer commented, I wish the power adapter stored in the case. (Or, I wish at least it hand a standard cord instead of a chunky plug-in adapter.)Good vintage look, and it sounds pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retro looks, terrible sound.","review":"This turntable is certainly one that looks good if you're going for that retro look, but it's sound quality is almost unacceptable. It's nice that it can play 78's, as I've inherited some of my grandmothers old 78's, but for anything else, it's not worth it. The overall sound is tinny and a poor representation of vinyl's potential. I had motor problems not long after I received it; it kept stopping in the middle of a song, sometimes with enough force to send the stylus scratching across the record surface. I don't know if the motor was overheating or what, but it was unacceptable, and it certainly is not good for the records. I would recommend spending a few more bucks and going with a lower-end Technics or Rega instead of this, if you're looking for good quality sound. If not, and retro looks are all you really want out of this turntable, this is the turntable for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little turntable","review":"I bought this for my teenage son who wanted to play our old records that were up in the attic. We think that it is a good little turntable, nothing fancy, just the basic turntable but pretty good sound, just as I expected it to be.It was worth the money just to hear those old LP's again!We have only had it for a couple of weeks so I can't tell you how durable it is, but I if you are looking for a cheaper model turntable with no bells or whistles this is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Retro and Fun","review":"I bought this for my son who wanted to play my collection of old LP's and 45\\"s. He thought it was a great item and loved it. Shipping was Amazon's usual: speedy and reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORTHLESS","review":"If I could give this a negative star I would. Cheap, poor quality, the tone arm is NOT ADJUSTABLE which makes it sit heavy on the record and skip around and scratch! The sound quiality is awful. Sound like you have your head in a bottle and someone is playing music on the outside. I am super dissapointed with the good reviews on this (which is why I bought it). Do not waste your time with this unless you want to break in in revolt to how much it sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"This record player spins well-make sure to click the tone arm to start the spinning again! (Or you might think the machine is broken) I thought the volume control and tone control were decent. Not a record player for an audio fan, but I have really enjoyed it so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sound","review":"I was excited to play some old records I hadn't heard in years. The unit looked nice and the price was right but The sound was so terrible... its unusable. It must be broken. I'll tear it apart and see if I can at least make it usable. I'm assuming it must be a bad solder somewhere.A friend saw mine sitting in my garage and said the same thing. Oh you got one of those too? I said \\"Yeah, but its no good.\\" They sighed and said \\"Yeah I got one as a present and its unusable junk. Too bad cause it looks neat and is a good idea, just sounds horrible.\\"So some of them must work ok - I can't imagine anyone would give it a decent review sounding like the one I got. So its probably a gamble on whether you get a working model because they are manufactured so cheaply. I'll probably buy something else that maybe won't look as cool but will hopefully work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Record let down","review":"Very attractive case for the price but this is an embarrassing piece of junk. It was inoperable upon delivery. The drive belt turned out to be a plain old rubber band that could have been holding asparagus together in a previous life.Can't comment on the sound quality as the \\"unit\\" was immediately returned never to be heard from but if the sleek plastic composition of the tone arm is an indicator then Edison's gramophone probably was better in that department.If you want to be very disappointed and aggrevated I highly recommend this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"case too small to play 33 1/3 records","review":"I bougt this as a gift to my parents for christmas-spoke to them today and they were so disappointed because the albums my son gave them as well as there own 33 1/3 records were too big and kept hitting the back of the record case when the record spun around-I don't know why no one else wrote about this but that seems to be the problem with the one I bought. Will return for something else-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working on second use","review":"The second time I went to use this turntable the power light came on but the turntable wouldn't spin.

When he went to play a second one, the turntable started to wobble and would not hold record in correct playing position. For the price, that performance was unacceptable, so I sent it back. It appears to be cheaply made to such an extent that I would not recommend this purchase to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment!","review":"We purchased the Crosley turntable for our 14 y/o's birthday gift. The picture looked great and I had high hopes, but the actual item was made of flimsy cardboard. Placing the arm over the record is supposed to make the table turn, but it was so flimsy it broke within 5 minutes of operation. It was really a disappointment because this took place at her birthday party, with a stack of records ready to be played. If you purchase it directly from Crosley you won't save any money, and you will also have to pay to return a damaged item (about $30). Because I purchased it through Amazon the return shipping was free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok but no Cigar","review":"They don't make em like they used to.For the price not bad if your not particularabout precision.Don't look for audiophileperformance here at this price.The pros are it does looklike the 50's turntable.It does play but the volume is low.there are no outputs of any kind.It's just a basic player.There were cosmetic imperfections on mine and also manytechnically questionable items like speed variation,lack of precision in the tone arn lever etc etc.so if you don't expect much this little baby might give youa nostolgic buzz."},{"rating":"1","title":"thanks for ruining christmas","review":"this is terrible, the turntable doesnt turn, there is loose stuff shaking inside the record player, the arm does not trigger the turntable.

Didn't work either due to hardware problems or the audio conversion software provided by the manufacturer. So returned it but still wanted to have something to play records on. This record player did the trick right away out of the box. The on/off device is built into the tone arm so you need to move the arm first to the right to turn on the table but the table turns off automatically when the end of the record is reached. Also remove the plastic needle cover before trying to play. I didn't and it just skipped over the record until I figured it out. Other than that have been going through albums I haven't had the chance to listen to for years which is great! High marks for a very affordable record player."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice record player","review":"Overall nice record player for price no problems so far,love it, can't stop listenin to those vinyls good description"},{"rating":"2","title":"Made an awesome gift!","review":"I wanted something around [..] that had built in speakers.

Forget the older look and other cheap portables and buy a Music Hall or NAD turntable for your stereo system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"I opened my Crosley Turntable about an hour and overall feel like I paid way too much. This thing is a toy not a turntable. The case is sturdy but the rest is weak and I feel could break easily. It doesn't play 33's easily at all. I'd say it's all right if you own a bunch of old mono 78s and 45s other than that skip this thing. These days records are so trendy you can probably fine a refurbished decent turntable for the same amount and then get the other needed things. I don't know man. This thing is a sham. Don't do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great looks, cheap design","review":"I bought this turntable specifically to play old 78's, but at that high speed, the turntable seemed to shake. Plus, the tonearm is cheap plastic. After just two weeks of light use, it completely stopped working and I returned it to amazon.

I should have tried it out before letting her open it. Right out of the box, the tone arm assembly had been dislodged causing records to rub against the support. The quality of the whole package was what you'd expect for something more in the toy $15 price range. Thank goodness for Amazon's amazingly easy return policy including shipping.

However, I was sadly disappointed in this product. Thinking of a children's record player my sister and I used in the 1960's, I expected the same features in this record player. To my surprise, the needle arm movement is not automatic on this item. It must be manually moved by myself to the beginning of the record to start playing it. Also, there is no record spindle to stack records on to be played sequentially. You can only place one record on at a time. On top of this and more importantly the sound quality is poor. I expected better quality all around with the electronic advances made in the past 40 years. Apparently I should have done more research in exactly what was included with this model. I should also have checked into ratings such as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Fit","review":"I do a lot of comparison shopping- too much, in fact. I often become confused! I tried several different types of record players before this- from high end turntables to all-in-one models. If you are looking for a sturdy record player with integrated speakers to keep your record collection alive, this will fit the bill. I found the size, look and quality all to be right for the price. I paid more for a turntable that I hooked up to my sound system and wasn't as happy. I've found that when it comes to these items, the simpler, the better. This is a great record player- it has even inspired me to start buying vinyl again.

By the end of a year i was tired of putting the Belt/ rubber band back on the turntable. Instead of me throwing it out in frustration i threw it out because it just died shortly there after. Third model (this one) i currently have, very basic, same deal, for kids to listen to records. Currently we have to wedge a block between the cover and the on/volume knob to get it to work. Now it seems a lot of people like this model but perhaps the honeymoon is not over yet. Crosleys look good and structurally seem durable enough but if you have to disassemble one (over and over) the cheapness of the electronics becomes quite apparent.

He remembers the in his life and how they have affected him during his lifetime and during this voyage that he expects to be his last, as this Tired, sick, old man tries to find a place to spend his final years in peace.In my opinion the reason this book is called what it is, is the fact that they are portraying the general through his own mind, therefore the General in his Labrynth. The reader unfolds this long, dark, twisted hallway of the generals mind, reading about the people and events in his life, and also discovering the type of man that he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through it","review":"I tried and tried to keep reading this book, but it wasn't interesting to me.

The authors fill the book with various VB examples, which would be great, if I was augmenting my DTS packages with VB - but I wasn't. Rather, what would have been of great, are examples of raising errors, handling non-tabular input and output, and any nuances not revealed in Microsoft's help documents (which ended up being my main source of help).In short, unless you are looking strictly for VB answers to DTS questions, I'd wait to see what other books come out.

We are supposed to study the meaning of the text through it's historical and theological backgrounds not through some special lense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, not Surprised","review":"I have spent a long time reading \\"Has God Only One Blessing\\", to my dismay. Mary Boy's reflections are biased and almost anti-Catholic. I'm given the impression that to improve Jewish-Christian relations, I must hide behind, almost reject my own religion in order to appreciate another's. I hope that instead, I can live what Jesus taught and be self-giving to my Jewish neighbors. Perhaps those of us who have grown up in a post Vatican II time would do better to focus (and act) on how to be true Christians and less on (due to our admitted mistakes) how we can be less Catholic and more sensitive. Those two are not mutually exclusive. I do not agree with her point of view and do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing transfer/production values","review":"I failed to get WHAT WAS ADVERTISED as being the Tartini \\"Devil's Trill\\" sonata, which amazed me.

I'm 16, the age where I hate EVERYTHING that is childish, and I still loved this movie. It's a welcome change from the big studios who churn out crap in order to sell the songs to other singers like Celine Dion. If you look down upon children's things, and think that anything fun for children is below you, then you wouldn't like this film. For the rest of you, go out and rent this movie now!

I have enjoyed all his films so far, and this one is certainly no exception. It is based on the now-infamous book \\"The Wind in the Willows\\" by Kenneth Graham. It's live action, not animated, for those of you who wondered, and, while parts of it are somewhat childish (I never did like disney musicals much myself) the acting is good, the plot is good. Then, it being Terry Jones we're talking about, how could it not be?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overlooked gem","review":"This movie was barely released in theaters.

The story has a very juvenile theme and if you have young children I would recommend this movie to you (even though it's rated PG), but ... don't sit in front of it too long though. Your children outgrow Mr. Toad's Wild Ride; we are now on to Prince of Egypt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"This is a nauseating film at the very least. It was totally ridiculous.

HOWEVER, something went wrong with it before I had even had it a year. I plug it in and the computer won't even recoginize it. A friend said that it might be a power issue, so I bought an external power adapter, and plugged it in, and the thing shorted out my laptop for a while... talk about giving me a heart attack. Luckily the laptop started working after a couple minutes. I know the hard drive part is okay, as I was able to see some files before it shorted out the laptop... so I'm going to tear it apart and plug the hard drive into the computer with an adapter to at least get the data off. I emailed the support on their website and got nothing back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Untrustworthy Backup","review":"At first I loved my new storage device, looks nice, easy to use.

To have not read it would have been one of the greatest mistakes I could have made. This book is an absolute joy of plain common sense and wonderful insights into what makes us tick. It offers sound advice on ways to improve our lot in life and connect with who we really are.

Now \\"Vehicle\\" was just an everyday song to me as a kid, but because Bo's voice sounds like a fusion of Southern Rock, Blues, Soul, and Hard, Metal, & Classic Rock all at the same time, he's had me listening to \\"Vehicle\\" more times in the past several days than I did all throughout my childhood - even when it was at its height of popularity. Buy it for the voice!! You won't regret it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bo Bice: A Legend in the Making!","review":"As expected from his portfolio of performances on American Idol and his earlier material with Purge and Sugarmoney, Bo Bice has put out an amazing single!

I didn't like the ending as much as the ending we've seen him do several times on the show, but that is the only knock on that track.As far as the \\"A\\" side is concerned, he made me actually like what I considered the crappiest coronation song ever written.

Bo has a natural sound that comes across amazingly well in a studio recording. With apologies to the original performers of Vehicle, the Ides of March, I have to say this is better than the original. Strong vocals, great guitar riffs and a blasting horn section make this a winner.Inside Your Heaven is one of those forgettable songs. Trite and insipid, it plays to the teenage prom song set. However, Bo makes it his own with a heartfelt connection to the lyrics and brings some soul to a song I wouldn't listen to twice normally.All in all, this is a great beginning to what is sure to be a long and successful career. I'm looking forward to the full length CD to see what this talented singer/songwriter has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear!","review":"I'm sad to say I was very disappointed with the production of this cd. If you saw the American Idol series, you will be familiar with the way Bo belted out his rock songs with soul. Bo in this cd sounds like he is in a straight jacket, very restrained and contrived.

None of the original rock"},{"rating":"1","title":"The best is yet to come","review":"[...] I don't like the A side of this CD at all. I guess I've heard the Winners version so many times now it's just not the same. The B side however I like. I have the B side in my IPOD. I would give the B side a 4 star rating but the A sides a no show for me personally. If Bo had done SHA for the A side, now that would have been awesome!.

I'm looking forward to his fall release because the man can sing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Satisfied","review":"I don't like the way Bo sounds on both of these songs.

The two tracks could not be much different, but Bo excels on both. Inside Your Heaven has a nice catch to it and features Bo's smooth, hauntingly beautiful voice. Bo sings with emotion and you can feel that coming through your headphones. Vehicle. WOW! I have only one word, PERFECT. Richie Sambora was fantastic as usual and the combination of him and Bo is a match made in heaven for any rock lover.

Together on the Tonight Show, they showed us why this song is so hot. Whoever came up with this collaboration is a genius. The two sound great together. Add to the guitar, Bo's rich smoky growly vocals and you will have the best song of the summer. One you want to turn up loud and have a great time jammin' to.Inside Your Heaven is a love song which is complemented by Bo's smooth authentic vocals. When he sings, I believe it.Bo Bice is a unique talent with a voice unlike any other. It drifts, growls, prowls and pounces. His voice is like a wild and untamed jaguar. If you have not checked this cd out yet, don't miss it. It's a keeper and a collector's item.[...]A 5 star plus rating from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME VOCALS","review":"Bo Bice takes what IMHO are subpar lyrics (Inside your Heaven), and makes it enjoyable to listen to just for the fact that his voice is so dmned AMAZING. He has true SOUL in his voice; a rare quality -- and he could sing just about any genre and pull it off. He does a great job with both songs and I'm looking forward to seeing what he does on an entire ALBUM. More importantly, I'm looking forward to seeing what we can expect from Mr. Bice when his AI contract is up and he's free to do the songs HE wants to do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bo's Gonna be Around a LONG Long Time","review":"I'd never cared enough to vote for any of the contestants on Idol until Bo Bice came along--and his voice, his performance skills, and his look made me realize that once in awhile they may well discover a real musician. Amazingly, I found Bo's CD on Monday--not sure who goofed but I'm glad it was out on the shelves--and I was blown away by his vocals. He has that wonderful sexy rocker growl that reminds me of Edwin McCain, Greg Allman, and even Country Rocker Travis Tritt--gotta love that bluesy-rocker sound, coming from the South. Inside Your Heaven in a weak song--they could've found something better--but he made me like it. And he tears it up on Vehicle. I look forward to buying his CDs for many many years to come--and to seeing what he can do when he's the one in charge of picking out the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"Bo takes a mediocre song and gives it soul.

I highly recommend it. 5 stars!!!I had it pre-ordered and when I recieved it the other day, I was like a teenager again. I knew I would absolutely love \\"Vehicle\\", but I did not have high expectations for \\"Inside your Heaven\\", simply becasue I wasn't impressed with the song itself.I had heard Carrie's version a few times and it felt like a church song. What a delightful surprise was in store for me, because when Bo sings \\"Inside your Heaven\\" it becomes a passionate, heartfelt love song. I found myself in tears, I couldn't stop listening to it. BO'S VOICE JUST REACHES OUT AND TOUCHES THE DEPTHS OF YOUR SOUL.(My 17 yr old son and his gf are proclaiming it as \\"their\\" song.)[...]All I really need to say is ,If you enjoy listening to good music, this CD is for you!!If you're still not convinced, give Bo a second, listen to a preview and decide for yourself. His music speaks for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"BO IS ONE IN A MILLION!","review":"I just bought Bo's CD and it is amazing! Bo is flawless, such a unique talent. When Carrie Underwood sang \\"Inside Your Heaven\\", I didn't like it at all, but I can't get Bo's version out of my head! There is absolutely no comparison between Bo and Carrie - Bo is in a different league. I cannot wait until his album is released in the fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bo is such a breath of fresh air!","review":"I absolutely adore Bo. He's got so much heart and soul and he makes me FEEL the music. Bo's not your typical American Idol contestant who just sings; Bo writes and plays music as well. He's all about MUSIC. Yes on the new single he had to sing their \\"In Your Heaven\\" but he also got to do \\"Vehicle.\\" If you want to support Bo and see and hear more awesome work from him, go buy a couple copies of this single. Think back to the show when Bo did \\"Whipping Post\\" or \\"Spinning Wheel\\" or \\"For the Love of Money\\" ----- this man is amazingly charismatic and full of life. He's sexy and he's geniune and sweet and lovable and so incredibly talented and I want him to succeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bo's new single","review":"I received the single today and it was incredible. As colorful and soulful his voice comes across on the television--it is even more so on the recording. Really well done! And Carrie Underwood is credited for backup vocals for Vehicle! It's definitely a must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright But Lacking","review":"I give this a 2 stars because the songs are sort of boring, however Bo does sound ok in them. I think he'll do better when he's able to pick better songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Your Song Bo","review":"I'm sorry but \\"Inside Your Heaven\\" is just not a song for Bo. His voice is not versatile enough to sing slower songs or ballads very well. I wish he would have had his own single to sing, because this song does not suit him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok.","review":"Sounds ok but I guess I got so use to hearing a different type of voice sing the song that now when I hear Bo's version it's just OK. It is nice to hear a male version however. Never been a fan of the song \\"Vehicle\\"-- so no comment there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This CD is too boring.

Vehicle sounds bland and boring. I could hear anyone in a nightclub sing this song."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont recommend this!","review":"Please don't waste your money on this lousy CD. Bo Bice sounds like all the other lounge singers, nothing special and he's trying too hard with Inside Your Heaven. He's not versatile and simply does not relate the song beautifully at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bo Who??","review":"I'll admit I didn't follow Amerian Idol, just watched the finales. I heard a lot of hype about this guy so I decided to check him out and I honestly do not see what all the hype is about. His voice is not unique, he sounds like all the others. He really does not have much range, and has a poor selection in song choices. Now I've heard his and the other contestant, Carrie Underwood version of \\"Inside Your Heaven\\" and I have to admit, she made me like the song! I'm not even that big on this type of music. I agree with some people that he won't last long. He's just too dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Step Aboard Bo's Vehicle and Get Inside His Heaven","review":"While Inside Your Heaven may not seem like it was made for a rock singer like Bo, he takes this song and makes it unique and credible. A song this bad would sound bad on a sappy ballad singer, but Bo makes it sound good. Vehicle is a rocking great tune. I hope it's on his full album. Richie Sambora adds a bit of his own flavor. Carrie Underwood does the backup vocals. If the whole country thing doesn't work out, Carrie can definitely make it as a backup singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth the Wait","review":"Bo truly is a talent artist, and his voice is one that must be heard to be believed. With a rich soulful tone, he can make even a moderately good song like ISYH one that's worth hearing.Vehicle was one of my favorites from American Idol that Bo performed and this version sounds even better with the fantasic guitar accompaniment of Richy Sambora, it measures up every bit to the classic version.A great introduction to new Bo Bice fans and a welcome tide-me-over for us now devoted Bo fans eagarly awaiting his full album!WTG Bo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have CD : )","review":"Bo brings so much emotion into the words on IYH...this is sure to be a favorite Wedding Song for many.

His vocals are unbelievable. I really didn't like the song Inside Your Heaven, but when Bo sings it, I do. His voice is just so pure. Vehicle rocks. Has me rockin out to this song. The guitar is fantastic by Sambora. Can't wait to hear them on Leno tonight. Now, I can't wait for the cd. They can't get it released too quick for me. Love the cd.

This ride can only get better!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Voice","review":"Let me say upfront that I voted for Carrie in the finale. I love Carrie and believe her to be the better singer. However, I must say that Bo has such a great voice and performs \\"Inside Your Heaven\\" better than Carrie did on her single. Like it's been said, Bo sings with so much more soul. While, Carrie tends to seem a little boring no matter how amazing her voice is.Bo is a great performer and singer, but the only concern I have with him is that no one will accept him as a rock singer because he earned his fame on American Idol. I personally think he is great, though, and believe he will go far in the music industry.You should definitely try to pick this one up if you get the chance and while you're at it, try and get a hand on Carrie's which is pretty good too. I cannot wait for a full length album from both of these extremely talented finalists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expecting better for Bo's debut.","review":"I loved Bo. He was my 2nd favorite \\"American Idol 4\\" contestant- but these songs just do not fit him, especially \\"Inside Your Heaven\\". \\"Vehicle\\" is a tad better, but it was not as good as his \\"American Idol\\" performance. \\"Inside Your Heavem\\" is a song suited more for Carrie, but not Bo! I am expecting better for Bo's debut album since he will have a little more say in what will be on his CD. I was expecting better from \\"Vehicle\\" on this CD, but I knew \\"Inside Your Heaven\\" just wasnt Bo's type since I heard Carrie sing it on the \\"American Idol 4\\" finale. I wish they would have done with Bo Bice what they had done for Diana DeGarmo on \\"American Idol 3\\"- givin him a better-suited song to record."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?

I listened to it and was very dissapointed. It was like a totally different Bo!! It wasn't the same as what I heard on American Idol. Both of these song lack emotion. His voice sounded animated.

This guy is mad talented. It is no exageration. He's exactly what the music industry needs right now. Bo Bice is no tired and old formula. He's refreshing and exciting.I voted for Bo on American Idol because his vocal mastery is undeniable. And he commands that stage and keeps your attention. While \\"Inside Your Heaven\\" may not be the most enlightning musical track, Bo makes it worth the listen each time. Meanwhile, \\"Vehicle\\" was one of Bo's signature songs from the show. And the addition of Richie Sambora on guitar takes it to another level.Bo Bice can make almost any song sound like a classic. I'm so glad he's getting the opportuiny to record an album. I am looking forward to years of many great Bo Bice recordings. I can't wait to see him in concert. I would definitely recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only there were a rating of zero....","review":"Prepare to be disgusted......and very disappointed. And I'll save you the time--if you're buying this to find out anything interesting about backstage life, DON'T. If you enjoy watching men throw lunch meat at naked girls, well then...you'll love it. But if you were actually looking for some substance, I'm sorry--it's not here.I was sorely disappointed not only because the video was so boring that I spent more time staring at the wall than at the TV, but also because I do admire Matt Zane a lot. I expected much better than this from him. And also, when the video proclaims that Jon Davis from Korn is going to be featured, you'd think he'd at least have one story to tell. Nope. Jon's on it for about a total of 10 seconds, and only to introduce who's going to be on the video.In short, save your money.

I was one of the few who wasn't disappointed with Nastradaumus, but it's a step up shows a lot of philosophical and mature sides of one of the greatest rapppers EVER.

This CD features their pre-\\"Raised On Radio\\" hits, many of which sound better here than in their original form. The production quality is superb, and each member of the band performs exceptionally well. The live version of \\"Escape\\" is incredible, as is \\"Wheel In The Sky\\", a song I never liked in its studio form. Steve Perry's audience interaction on \\"Anyway You Want It\\" brings a new element to the song, and \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" has never sounded better. Even if you are only a mild Journey fan, pick this one up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great collection of songs but","review":"Captured is better. It has a better \\"live\\" feel than this one.

It's a collection of live performances. So it doesn't feel like a concert. (Compare to Aerosmith's live album \\"South of Sanity\\" where you feel like you are in the arena.) With this Journey album, the Producers hand picked the \\"best\\" live performances from several concerts. So it should be flawless, but it just isn't. For me, I'm not a big fan of Steve Perry's habit of trying to get the crowd to sing along. Take a hint from Aerosmith or Bryan Adams, you don't ask the crowd to sing along, they'll do it when they want to. My recommendation: stick to the Studio Greatest Hits to satisfy your Journey fix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like, gag me with a spoon!","review":"I was in a bar not too long ago and a cover band was playing a Journey song. \\"Oh my God, who plays Journey these days?!\\" say I, incredulously, not quite believing such a thing could be possible (or allowed) in 1999.

I was extremely disappointed in this one. I should of known better looking at the track listing. Would Journey ever open with Don't Stop Believin? Most of the tracks sound like they were recorded in the studio with crowded noise pumped in at the beginning of the song and the live crowd comes back at the end....some songs fade like a studio recording. These tracks have been stripped of the live feel. You know when you listen to a studio cd, the space between tracks? That his here also. No flow what-so-ever. Seriously buy Captured instead of this one (love that cd). Or even the Escape Tour cd. How can this cd get 4 and a half stars?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"This really works well on odors. I used it to clean up a pet accident.

When Darren begins to express romantic feelings towards her, Shenaid doesn't know how to take it. Her parents suddenly send her to a boarding school, and she and Darren are forced to spend (presumably) more time apart than they've ever done. Darren realizes that he can't live without Shenaid just as Shenaid realizes that she can live without Darren. Mayhem ensues.What I couldn't come to terms with was the lack of police. Any police. Whatsoever. Darren commits numerous abuses and crimes, even a murder, without so much as a siren going off.I understand it's a film, but there are some things that just aren't credible. Even in fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"In my opinion this movie should win a award for the worst movie ever made. Pig and runt, what is this crap?

The acting is amazing, and though the plot is a little slow at the beginning, I really got wrapped up in it after the first half hour. Watching the relationship between Pig and Runt evolve is like watching a train crash in slow motion: you know things will get bad, but you can't look away. The characters are so wonderfully acted, but even so, I don't think I'd see this movie again because it's so disquieting...a sign of a really good film that gets into your head!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the Point","review":"Michael Kamen wrote some of his best work for this series, but it looks like we dont get to hear it because they needed room to put another copy of \\"Sugar, Sugar\\" into circulation. I can get a better selection of 60/70's stuff from the bargain bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rearrangement of Earlier Score","review":"Michael Kamen's main score is really a rearrangement of his score for Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. In fact, HBO used the Robin Hood version in some of its promos. While that Hood soundtrack evokes swords and swashbuckling, it might help quench some of the thirst for the Earth to the Moon soundtrack that you really wanted, but didn't get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment!","review":"This was a great opportunity for the label and producer to record some of TV's greatest music from some of the best composers in the business. Composers who you rarely find on a disc. The scores of this epic series are outstanding. Kamen's main theme just carries the entire film, but on this recording it is wasted. The other \\"songs\\" from the 50's and 60's can be bought cheaper on other albums. But the musical score of this mini series won't be heard until an arranger writes it for the local high school band. Or, a Boston or Cincinnati Pop's album features a suite or the entire score, it was that good. A true attempt to rush a CD to market while the show was on the air. If the label had taken their time and recorded it the way it should have been, they would of made more money and sold more albums. Too bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Taught me a lesson","review":"Next time .. read the tracks before you buy it.

These tracks were well worth the price, but I feel a terrific oportunity was missed by not recording a \\"score\\" album. There was so much wonderful music by so many talented composers that will never see the light of day, because the producers of this cd went the easy, safer song compilation road.

Was amazed to find that this so-called \\"soundtrack\\" is almost an empty wrapper. The grand main theme it includes is painfully tantalizing.

Such describes HBO's behavior in regards to not releasing a full orchestral score of such a masterpiece of filmwork.

It complemented the entire work very well.Too bad barely any of it was on the CD!If HBO doesn't release the score -- a complete orchestral score and not this mediocre excuse for a 60's music flashback -- I would be sorely disappointed.

What were they thinking! The song played during the episode \\"Spider\\" when the LEM was completed is what made me go out and purchase this. The mixture of oboe, mandolin, clarinet and french horns we so wonderful with the repeating melody that I can hear the entire orchestration in my head note for note. Between that exclusion and so many others, I was so disappointed that I immediately gave it away. I can gather the songs online that they have on this CD all by myself so I can't think of any reason anyone in their right mind would bother buying this. If I could give this 2 negative stars, I would.

Like pop culture? You're a mindless drone. Invent your own culture (like filming your own backyard wrestling league)? You're a wanna-be who's just trying to be special when you aren't. Participate in a community by choice? You must be trying to surround yourself with people who value you so that you can soothe your need to be, you guessed it, special. According to him, the only way to be a decent person is to go live without electricity on an island in the middle of nowhere. Frankly, I wish Niedzviceki would practice what he preaches. Let him go live on an island somewhere - and stop publishing rude, insulting, condescending books that don't even make a coherent argument about what he expects a meaningful community to look like."},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Idea!","review":"The idea that rebellion has been commodified is not new.But note that in order for me to read the author's view point, I should purchase this book.Wouldn't it have been better for the author to make the book freely available in .pdf format so I can down load it for free?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Around and round we go","review":"Mr. Niedzviecki begins with an interesting subject: main stream culture has co-opted rebellion. The anecdotes and the witticisms are fine when he tones down on the condescension, but the book suffers from deep flaws.He leaves terms such as pop culture and rebellion ill-defined. However, I gathered that main stream culture is something that the reader does not be a part of. Once he lays out his argument that the main stream has co-opted rebellion, his arguments loop endlessly between the wish to get away from pop culture and the inability to do anything that does not lead back to being pop culture. Instead of trying to find a third path out of his binary sorting of \\"pop vs rebel\\", his definitions broaden until his narrative becomes diffused and nearly directionless at points.At several points, he touches on historical writing on individuality and masses, but fails to capitalize on these opportunities to deepen his argumnt or break the loop that he has built."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas, poor execution","review":"Though \\"Hello, I'm Special\\" has good ideas and a good premise, it features very long winded examples that alone could be theses. Although somewhat interesting, this book is too much of a chore to read and is, to be honest, quite boring as leisure reading.Niedzviecki could really also learn that using \\"I'm Special\\" or \\"I'm Specialism\\" on what seems to be each page really doesn't help pass the pages any faster.This was a waste of my time to read. Read the first 10 pages and you have the gist of the book; and if you know much about current society, you would be able to realize what he is saying without ever picking up this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retread of Wolfe, Lasch, and Frank","review":"The major line of thought in this book trace back to the 1960's and 1970's, including Tom Wolfe's \\"The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby\\", Chris Lasch's \\"Culture of Narcissism\\" and (more recently) Frank's \\"Commodify Your Dissent.\\" The author doesn't mention or cite any of those works.Younger readers who are uninterested in history might enjoy the recent cultural examples in this book, but I find it's got very little new to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these!

A long digression would then follow on some local custom or trade (sometimes pre-dating Pytheas by centuries).The worst thing about this book was that a modern author could give such a dry account that, I am certain, would have been far more enjoyable in Pytheas' own words, as all the translations of the ancients I have ever read flow more easily (including Thucydides)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sapo by Robert Beatty","review":"By far my favorite among Beatty's works.

What I love about this DVD:1. Jackie has created several mini combos for the entire body, where she combines two moves that work different muscle groups together. You switch back and forth, first one move, then the second, and repeat. This allows you a brief rest between reps without having to stop. I love when trainers do this. Keeps the pace up, but doesn't kill your arms and legs, allowing me to actually finish the routine.2. Jackie shows you the entire move before beginning each set. I love being able to watch the move first. That way, I don't feel like I have to play catch up as I scramble to learn a new move.3. Simple, effective strengthening routine. No fancy, elaborate moves. What I love about Jackie is that she knows that form, continuous movement, and a large number of reps is what gets results, not difficult moves that people who are already in shape could pull off.Love Jackie. Will always buy her DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another stellar workout by Jackie Warner","review":"I received personal Training With Jackie: 30 Day Fast Start as a Christmas present.

The whole CD seems to flow together, sans for three songs that are considerably heavier rock than the others (Straight to Hell, S.L.O.B, and Gene Machine), but those are still done quite well and are just those types of songs to amp you up for a fun event.

All the relevant and useful info in this book could be found in other books that contain discussions of all North American species.

I think that it was good that they went to the extreme and made a Spinosaur vs. Tyranosaur scene. It was getting boring always seeing the Tyranosaur picking on people, but now they put on a vicious Predator. The Velociraptors were more detailed and better drawn.

Again new material was added which changed the storyline.If I ignored the book and just rated the movie for its storyline, it was very entertaining. However I can only give it 4 stars because several scenes were just overdramatized. Had the first movie stuck closer to the book, it would have been even better.

When a tragic accident maroons the party of seven, Grant discovers the true reason his deceptive hosts have invited him along. In their perilous attempt to escape, the dwindling group encounters terrifying new creatures undisclosed by InGen, and Grant is forced to learn the dreadful implications of his raptor intelligence theory firsthand.

I came late to the Jurassic Park movies, only seeing them a few years ago, so I don't have any real attachment to the first movie. I enjoyed it but I couldn't stand the child actors and enough with the Chaos Theory, Jeff Goldbum. For me, number three was the best. It was fun and entertaining. Don't get my wrong, I understand why the Emmys overlooked this movie. However, I thought that the actors were good; the story was well thought out and it was overall an enjoyable, exciting movie. Don't get caught up comparing it to the original, because odds are you like that one best. Feel free to compare it to the \\"The Lost World,\\" because odds are you don't like that better... than anything.

Four years later Steven got up the courage to direct 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park', otherwise known simply as 'Jurassic Park 2'. What I meant by when I said \\"got up the courage\\" I meant he was taking a chance with the critics, if they were going to like it or if they were going to hate it. They hated it and so did I. 'Jurassic Park 2' is like Best Picture up against 'Jurassic Park 3', the worst film of the summer and probably the worst film of the year, but I haven't seen 'Planet of the Apes' yet.

The film is about a boy and his brother wave boarding, one day, on the outskirts of a deserted island. Unfortunately, the boat crashes, and the boy is forced to fend for himself. However, it seems that the island that the boy is stranded on is actually another Jurassic Park that was secretely under development a few years ago. It's now up to the paleontoligist from the original film to go to this island and save this young man before it's too late.

There is really no plot to speak off what so ever in this lousy follow up but another excuse to bring people back in contact with the dinosaurs.

Instead, he's replaced with a stupid Spinosaurus.And the velociraptors don't seem as vicious as in the first two either. Joe Johnston comes up with stupid characters that get so annoying you wish they got eaten, and some dumb shots. Jurassic Park 3 isn't totally terrible, but it needs work. I don't even want to think about how bad this movie would have been without Steven Spielberg as the executive producer. He breathes some life into this movie.

Why did they make this movie? I tried to like it but I have to say the only good thing about this one was Sam Neill's return as Dr. Alan Grant and Laura Dern's cameo. The premise of the story is that a boy and his mom's boyfriend are parasailing near Isla Sorna when they crash, then the parents of said boy go to Dr. Grant and trick him into going to Isla Sorna. The story itself was cheesy but what made it worse was the whole raptors are super intelligent (and I mean ridiculously intelligent) granted we knew Raptors were smart in the first couple films but now they have their own speech and...yeah it's...a little much. Another thing a lot of this movie is just a compliation of left overs from the first book (i.e. the river boat, the bird cage.)

All of the people get killed in the first few minutes. After that no one dies how is that suspenseful? The Veloceraptors talk too. This movie is very poorly written. It is as if the producers walked in and said \\"new dinosaur, veloceraptors talk, nobdy important dies; run with it\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than The Lost World","review":"Is it better than the original Jurassic Park?, I don't know about that but I found it to be a lot more likeable than JPII. In the Lost World the script had very little to do with the book and ended up as a combination special effects fest and theme park promo. I found the plot in Jurassic III to actually make some sense for the most part and the Dinosaurs were incredible. I even thought most of the characters were good, the mercenaries weren't as smart as they thought they were and they certainly paid the price. The boy surviving on his own would be a little of a stretch, Dr. Grant's assistant making it to the coast without them is the least likely thing I saw in the movie, maybe more than Grant's former assistant (Laura Dern in a cameo role)calling in so much military help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dino-Delight!","review":"This is a very cool movie. My Dad and I watched it and there was LOTS of action,comedy,and excitement.

The Spinosaurus Vs. T-Rex fight was very cool, but also too short.The best shot in the movie however, was when the raptors were shown running in the open field. Jurassic Park is my favorite movie, Lost World was a great sequel, but Jurassic Park III didn't quite capture the magic of those previous dino-fests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jurassic What?","review":"Let me tell you this first, I loved the first two Jurassic Parks.Then came Jurassic Park III.The basic point of the movie was so somehow they could make up a storyline believable enough that people would come and see it and the producers could make some money.This movie passes by too fast, your sitting down and putting the first popcorn in your mouth and WHAM! it's over.Bottom line -Unless your into a few fake dinosaurs, one old Jurassic park character (Goldblum wasn't in this one :(), and a short film...BUY ITotherwiseGo and see something good, like Lord of the Rings or the old documentary Hoop Dreams"},{"rating":"2","title":"JP III","review":"The third installment to the JP franchise is full of action and shows the viewer what they truly want to see in a dinosaur movie.

There are some awesome new dinosaurs int his one"},{"rating":"1","title":"So much room for improvement...","review":"\\"Jurassic Park 3\\" is probably the most disappointed with a film I've ever been. It had so much going for it, and delivered so little. The film's biggest problem is the silly plot. The first film was believable, the second film was fun, this one's got energy, but we've been there, done that. But back to the plot: Alan Grant (Sam Neill) is lured back to the island the same way he was lured the first time: with money. That Grant could possibly be so greedy and stupid is the film's most unbelievable part. Most everyone (the characters) in this movie deserves to be eaten by dinosaurs, but only a few are. In a way, I'm glad Spielberg didn't direct this one. This would have seriously hurt his career. It's not a terrible film, but it's not good. I'd say only hardcore fans might like this one. But that's only a guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor movie just an exuse to cash in","review":"this movie is poor in every way it is a rip off poor story poor plotting and a dino saur that is a figment of somebodys wild imagine nation and also poor acting liked the first two but this one stinks"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Best Jurassic Park","review":"Not only is Jurassic Park III the best out of all of them, but it truly brings on the terrifying moments when Dr. Alan Grant and Mr. and Mrs. Kirby face when stranded on Isla Sorna while looking for their son who got stranded on the island eight weeks earlier.

If you're going to spend all that $ on something, make it worthwhile.

We read it many times in a day. We both love the pictures and the rhymes. Some of the language is a little bit above his comprehension level but he's picked up the general meaning of the stories which he's able to recite in one sentence after seeing the pictures. The stories are very short so they don't get too complicated.

We started to read it to him the next day and realized the language in this book is not what I would recommend for kids. The bible is not exactly G rated as it is, but to put into rhyme form certain stories that I would not tell my kids in the manner they were told in this book was a bit inappropriate in my eyes. There is no reason a toddler should learn about Exodus 1:8-2:10...its violent and after seeing what was written in this book we have started to censor what we read him a little more. There is a time and place to learn about certain biblical stories but being a toddler and learning certain ones too early could be detrimental to the kids in our opinion. To hear a kids rhyme claim \\"He killed their male children, one by one...\\" seems a bit inappropriate among other stories of similar questionable wording."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie rules.","review":"This is best Lifetime movie ever made. Satanism? Check. Child abuse? Roger that. Animal sacrifice? You bet. Overprotective, but semi-abusive parents? You know it.I have been waiting for this movie to hit DVD for 6 years.

Because of this, the potential of this expensive software gets largely unused. On a whole, I think it's a small stepping stone towards helping users understand what ArcMap can really do. For such a large book, there doesn't seem to be much in it of serious value. If you're a first time user of Arc software and GIS, this might help. But if you're an experienced GIS user, it comes up way short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read, a must for anyone who has breast cancer!","review":"This book is about a woman who defeated breast cancer without surgery.

Not worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"The Prime Gig, directed by Gregory Mosher and written by Bill Wheeler, is good stuff. A sort of Mamet-esque tale of telemarketing and betrayal. Vince Vaughn and Julia Ormond do very good work together. Ed Harris, a favorite of mine, is not up to his usual standard here ... but is still delivers an acceptable performance.Overall, the film works. It's quirky and suspenseful simultaneously, and although the plot seems familiar at first, Wheeler takes it in unexpected directions. Mosher's direction is also good, without pompously drawing attention to itself. A well-made film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earns the rite to find itself in Walmart's bargain film bin.","review":"I almost cared about this movie. Almost. I mean, you can't go wrong with Vince Vaughn and Ed Harris, right?Wrong.The Prime Gig offers slices of entertainment that keep you modestly plugged into the movie, but ultimately, those slices are not enough to suffice. Characters come and go without us caring, and the main characters look as bored as we do. Vaughn plays a conman who goes to work for a master con-artist and ultimately meets his match. There's some attempts to make us care along the way, and some dialogue that tries to assert itself, but at the end of the day, we still don't care and strike 'The Prime Gig' from the first cut at the \\"Could Have Been a Cool Movie\\" tryouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Con's on You","review":"There are certainly worse ways to spend 93 minutes -- just check out your local multiplex. Shellgames are never boring, and the ensemble cast is great (as they nearly always tend to be, in con movies). But, as others have pointed out, this one has more holes in it than a shower head. Shares in a gold mine? Pur-lease! Where is any telemarketer supposed to find marks dumb enough to buy those? Why would any telemarketer worth his salt waste his time trying? And, given that the Vince Vaughan character makes it quite clear he's only marrying the girl to help her get a green card (and therefore presumably wouldn't have dreamed of putting his money in a joint account and giving her sole signature over it), what bank would be inept enough to let her clean out his account just because she could show she was his wife?"},{"rating":"1","title":"dull knives","review":"I bought these knives as extras for when I have people over for a BBQ. The serrations are very large,the blades are dull and just tear the meat rather than cut it.

Presumably one of three things happened in that case. 1: I did not get the same knives they did, 2: they got good versions of the junk I got, or 3: They were not honest about their comments. I do not know which it would be, but I can state, categorically, that these knives are pure junk. Not sharp, rip meat, loose handles that allow matter to seep under them, and leak water after the knife is dried. Two handles really bad, with cracks round the rivet and rough edges.If you receive the same knives I did, you will be truly sorry, even if they were inexpensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steak Knives","review":"Excellent size, and extremely useable.

And you cannot sync your phone with Outlook or any other PIM you may use, you can only copy the information into Samsung's EasyGPRS program for downloading into your phone. And the last problem I have with it is that each number is a seperate entry.

I have contacted customer support on a few occassions, and no one has given me any direction as to where to find a simple ring.

The supplied ringtones are nothing short of bizarre. It's easy enough to download new ones (my present one is the Star Trek red alert siren), but one would hope that Samsung could at least supply some decent ones.

The software and the ease of use is not as great as the Nokia's but boy this phone is just great. I switched from AT&T and the service in the Silicon Valley is just great. The best way to enter the telephone #'s is to use the pc and the web and xfer it to your phone. It beats the hell out of me as to why T-Mobile sends everything as a mobile #'s but there is a way you can change it by using the \\"Copy\\" command. I have tried it and it works.The biggest problem that I have is that the ring+vibrate don't work together. Other than a few minor issues, I love this phone, it is quite compact the sound is great (a little bit of static could be heard) and the T-Mobile service is great.

It comes with just the basic features (color screen, polyphonic rings, etc.) without all the frills of some phones (cameras, video recorders, radios, etc.) This phone is great for someone who wants to upgrade from that old green screen to something a little nicer but doesn't want to be out a fourtune on a phone with features that you have to spend a fortune to even use (picture messaging ring a bell?). The games are nice, and the rings are loud and very audible. The reception is great, and the price simply can't be beat.

I have read many other horror novels, including more by Stephen King, and they do not come close to \\"IT\\". The quote on the book states that the characters are so real you'll feel like you're reading about yourself: absolutely true. There are some parts when it felt like I was Ben Hanscom or Bill Denbrough or Richie Tozier. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing work, Stephen King does not disappoint.","review":"When I read \\"It\\", my overactive imagination instantly kicked in, and I read for several sleepless nights, gripped by the amazing story. Since then, I've read and re-read this novel, and each time I'm amazed at how well it flows. 100 pages seems like 10 as King leads you along the path of these teenagers. Scary and suspenseful, this book is a must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of King's poorest works.","review":"The original concept of the novel is quite exciting: a group of adults return to their hometown, where the nightmare of their childhood haunts their dreams once again. This idea is enriched with all of King's standard schemes: '50s & rock'n'roll, the misery of the countrylife in Maine, children with supernatural powers and a lot of magic. This story could occupy no more than 200 pages. Instead, the novel is unecessarily long and boring, with imcomprehensibly extended descriptions. Some parts of it (especially the final encounter with \\"It\\") are almost silly. I think that the author attached various pieces he had written in other circumstances, for other works - some sort of his \\"relics\\". That's how I explain the apparent lack of cohesion. I don't say it's uninspried, but it's certainly uninspiring. Only for King's fanatics..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A kingly page turner","review":"I read this book so many years ago that I can't remember, however, I do remember not being able to put it down once I started reading it. I've always been a Stephen King fan and this book just kept me enthralled, interested and anxious to get to the ending as soon as I read the first paragraph. When the movie came out I was sorely disappointed because it just didn't do the story justice. As an author of four novels myself, I must say that the book is always better than the movie. If you've never read any of Stephen King's books, you don't know what you're missing. This novel, in particular, will give you a whole new insight on clowns, for one thing, but better yet, you will see Stephen King at his most creative best!Joyce Marie Taylor, Author and Poet"},{"rating":"2","title":"The scariest page turner I've read by Stephen King","review":"This book is truly scary. The character development in this book is unmatched and I loved the idea of a group of misfits who take a stand and fight back for once. Truly, Stephen King is the greatest. I read this book about six years ago and I still love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King rocks!","review":"This is my favorite book by Stephen King and one of my favorite books period. The detailing and masterful storytelling are marvelous. It's very long but I didn't get bored while reading it. It took me two weeks to read the first time. If you like Stephen King and you let your imagination run free enough to believe read this book! The movie sucked but the book is great"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"\\"It\\" was never a book I really wanted to read, I'd seen the mini-series and it didn't inspire the least bit of interest (quite the opposite actually). But then I read the Dark Tower, and when I was done I wanted to read the books that touched on the Tower.The books is long, but I didn't want to put it down. It's the sort of book where you quickly get involved in the character's predicament and feel like you're the silent partner cheering them on in the wings, and you feel just a little bit sad when you have to say goodbye.To sum it up: Under no circumstances should you decide whether or not to pick up the book by the quality of the mini-series (even if Tim Curry is the scariest clown you've ever seen), it doesn't do the book justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"What a great book. I still have never seen the movie because of how great the book is. Scary as you wouldn't believe. Amazing. Very well written. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic","review":"Why can't we hold onto the magic of being young, when if you \\"stepped on the crack\\" you would \\"break your mother's back\\"? This is a story that focuses of the beliefs and the magic of seven friends who BELIEVED, really BELIEVED in the magic of themselves, and hung onto that belief when they needed it the most, even after it had faded into adulthood. This is so much more than a horror story, it's characters are so much more than just characters in a story, they are your childhood friends, the ones you rode bikes with down the longest hill, the ones who told you not to pick up that penny because it was on the \\"tails\\" side, and that was bad luck, the ones who believed in all the MAGIC of friendship. Once you pick it up, you won't put it down until the very last page, and then you'll want more. I took this book everywhere, read it everywhere, and I did it twice :) Let Stephen King take you back to the place where magic was within your reach just by holding onto the hands of your friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my favorite stephen king book","review":"the begging of the book was pretty good. but the rest was just not at all good. but i will say that my favorite boook by stephen king is insomnia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrifying","review":"It is a book that will put goosebumps all over your body.

I finished the first 200 pages in one day and after that it went VERY slow. It could of been slimmed 200 - 300 pages and been fine, but I had to read boring interludes, and hear fifth graders swear constantly. I don't think it was realistic and the sexual references were sometimes needed, but mostly not. I think King was more worried about having a long book, than having a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long time coming","review":"I read this book many years ago when it first came out. At that time I remarked to friends that it was one of the best 200 page novels I had ever read. Unfortunately, it is over 1000 pages long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored to Death.","review":"I was assured IT is the most horror filled book of all. I was horrified, all right. Horrified at how boring it is.In fairness, some of the writing is sublime dream weaving, and much of it is ham-fisted typerwriter bludgeoning.IT makes a great door-stop.After posting my review, I waited a few months and read IT again. IT could have been a first-rate horror fantasy with plenty of pruning and tightening of the plot. There are wayyyyy too many irrelevant digressions and flash-backs and zzzzzzzzzzz. And the adults in the book are almost comatose when it comes to excitement about the wholesale slaughter of so many kids.King coulda made the Derry adults hysterical and clueless, that is deaf, dumb, and blind to IT but definitely excited about the Kiddie Killings. The kids coulda been their skirmishers.How did the graphic homoerotic scene get past the editors?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heartbroken...","review":"Sorry, I've tried...God knows I've tried...but I just can't like this book. There's a lot here to love, but King just throws it all away. It's that idiotic child gang-bang at the end; I just can't get over it. In the space of a few pages, King wipes out the thousand pages of goodness which came before, at least in my eyes. What the heck was the *point* of the scene, anyway? My God, an 11-year-old girl would probably be torn apart by something like that! To me, this book was like falling in love...and then being horribly betrayed at the end of the relationship. Without that little child orgy at the end, I would have given this book five stars, easily. Some people can get past it and still enjoy the book, but I can't. Call me a prude, but child sex ain't my thing...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic In My Opinion","review":"I first read this a long time ago but since I recently bought the Kindle version I'll give my opinion. I was surprised to still be thoroughly entertained by this book. I had to skip some of the details King goes into, like with the town, but the suspenseful scenes kept me clicking to the next page.There was a lot of build up for the final confrontation in the end and it would be hard to satisfy every reader with such buildup. I would say I wasn't fully satisfied but nothing is perfect.Anyways if you haven't read this yet give it a try, especially if you like King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"It is perhaps one of the most complex, intricate and scary books I've ever read, re-read or now, heard. Steven Weber does an exceptional job narrating the book. Intense, and effective, his reading of this great book makes it literally come to life in your head as you listen to his wide range of voices full of well... so much. Excellent work read by an excellent artist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books.","review":"It's over 1,000 pages, but a little editing could bring it down to less than 500 without removing any important details. I forced myself to read the whole thing, and wish I could have just let it go. Especially after I read the scene where the 11 year old girl in the group uses herself in the worst way to bring the group together. That scene served no purpose. I'm not a feminist, but it made me angry to see a writer use a young female character like a cheap blowup doll."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT delivers forceful horror, if you don't mind its crassness","review":"I read this book after being impressed with Stephen King's \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.\\" I was captivated because of King's ability to write engaging and believable characters. He does this even moreso in \\"It\\", but many of the characters are crude, crass, and have very little morals. In fact, it is sometimes hard to respect them as \\"the good guys,\\" simply because they aren't very good(main character Beverly, age 11, having sex with the six boy \\"good guys\\" as a way to save their lives is a disgusting case-in-point) Aside from the crudeness of many characters and plot-devices, this book is very well written with a satisfying ending, and lots of runaway-train horror along the way. If you can stomach It's crassness, this makes for a five-star read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the last 200 pages","review":"I read that book in only 2 days, which says enough about the page turning effect this book has. But after I finished, I wanted to rip out the last 200 pages or so. The plot is so wonderfully intriguing and then this thing which would be called a gang bang in a sex-film.With children? And this comes from a country where great literature like(Nobel- prize winner) G��nther Grass\` \\"Blechtrommel\\" is forbidden due to a small man(about 3 feet high) of age 20(! ) having sex with a girl of his age. IT gets 5 stars for the story and 4 stars off for the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last King Book I Ever Read","review":"Ok, there's one thing about Stephen King books that I've always tried to ignore, but this book... [made me way too angry]. This guy really is terrible at writing women. In King's books women are always 1)rescued by the man, 2)protected by the man, 3)whiny and irritating, 4)treated like dirt by the man, 5)of subnormal intelligence. Men always think of women in a condescending way in these books. I'm not a radical feminist, but I'm an independent girl who can defend herself and it annoys me that there are no female characters that I can relate to in any way. This book has one female character whose main purpose is to have sex with the six guys. Come on, Stephen, get with the times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen King should be ashamed of himself.","review":"This book is my mark of shame. I am a voracious reader and have plowed through many, many books that were dull and dreary just to finish reading them.\\"It\\" remains the only book I have ever started to read that I have not been able to force myself to finish reading, no matter how many times I try. Dreadful and boring, hopelessly long winded and riddled with pointless asides. I find it hard to believe that the same man who wrote \\"The Stand\\" could bring himself to foist this morass of mindlessness on his readers.\\"It\\" isn't all bad; it's a sure cure for insommnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets old...","review":"The book needed a lot of editing. The endless dialogue and sub-plots become tiresome really fast. I could only make it half way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on IT","review":"First book I have read by Stephen King and I am not sure whether I will read another one by him. The story is long winded with pages and pages of boring detour which are absolutely useless. The story itself, even without all the junks, is simply not interesting. Maybe the first 20 or so pages appeared to be good and that's about it. Hugely disappointed with such a famous author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever!","review":"First off, I would like to say that I do not recommend this book for anyone younger than 21, because of the pure amount of adult references, references which more and more feel like something the author enjoys. And secondly, I do not recommend this book for anyone 21 or older because you ought to know better than to read this kind of trash.Basically, the book sucks. Some kid gets killed by clown, wacky hijiinks ensue, including the Creature From the Black Lagoon, fortune cookies, a bunch of dead kids, and the monsters only three weaknesses (?): sneezing powder, turtles, and the names of various birds! Overall the most incredibly annoying and stupid book ever. If you want something funny, try \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\\" If you want something scary, try \\"Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable characters...","review":"King weaves another tale of terror that follows children into their adulthood. A beast that haunts a tight-knit group of kids and returns years later to reap vengence against the adults they have become. The character development is awesome. It's as if I know these people. The storyline is great...until the end. I'll leave it at that. No spoilers here. Almost a 5 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT Is Awsome","review":"This book is very intresting and It will get you out of your seat.The killer is intresting because he does not look like a killer, in fact he looks more like a clown. The main charachters are the outcast, the kids who nobody talks to and the bullies pick on. The murders are very sick and grossining to your stomach.Well anyway enjoy the book!J.M."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another reason to hate clowns","review":"I agree that this story definately did lose focus and shift too far astray at many points, but the important thing for me when reading an entertainment oriented book is: was it a page turner? Did it pull me in quickly and make me not want to put it down? The anwer is definately yes. Stephen King has the gift.It's basically all about childhood fears and how they affect you later in life - repressed memories, and adults with 20 year old skeleton's in their closets. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my favorite, but a good book for sure","review":"I am a fan of most Stephen King books, and I would say this is a good one for someone interested in psychological horror mixed with a coming of age kind of feel. I liked the characters instantly and enjoyed the overall flow of the story. Got a little bored during some of the history sections, but not so bored to put the book down. Definitely one that makes you stop and think, even long after you've finished reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So scary I almost died of a heart attack","review":"This book is a good read, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it was a little too long and tended to drag in parts. Its is a scary book, and he writes so well, I could picture the whole thing so well. His images are excellent. I would say though that if you only are a part-time reader or don't like long books, but if you can handle a long book, and you love to be scared, I would definately read this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"FIRST YOU READ, THEN YOU DIGEST, THEN YOU ENJOY","review":"It's been a while since I've read this book, but I do remember that there were very few parts that got my senses reeling ON THE SPOT. Just like you can't expect to be drunk immediately after swilling down a beer in 15 seconds or less, you have to finish the book and process it first and then the effects take place. And, boy howdy, does this book have EFFECTS once you've digested them! By the way, if they HAD to do a miniseries (which was awful), they should have made it a four or five episode deal like \\"The Stand\\", as there were too many vitally important details cut out of the one they DID make, thus ruining it for those kinds of people who decide on whether or not to read a book by its movie. Fortunately, I wasn't one of those people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Stephen King","review":"The classical Stephen King story. A story which could be any normal childhood tale, taken to the extreme limits of bizarre by a master story teller. As King does in so many of his stories, he has you imagining that maybe, by some strange chance, this could really happen. If you travel to Maine, stay away from the storm drains!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It: A Sort of Closure for Stephen King","review":"\\"It\\" is perhaps one of the gratest horror novels ever written, simply because of the fact that the story focuses on the characters as much as the horror elements. He dedicates much of his prose to the seven kids that first encounter the terror, using multiple flashbacks, and original points-of view which leave you mesmerized. There is one minor problem about the novel: it's about 50 pages too long, but most probably King wanted to achieve that epic feeling that is only reachable with big, fat stories like this one. One thing's for sure; you'll never forget characters like Bill and Ben, or monsters like the fearsome It, after you read this book. An excellent read that I highly recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King's best book ever!","review":"THIS IS STEPHEN KING'S BEST BOOK! A MUST READ!

I have purchased a similar hard cover version of \\"the Stand\\" where it was normal hardcover size but would never be worth anything more than what i paid for it, which is fine i enjoy reading hardcover. What i got was a paperback sized book with a hard cover, so the type face is real small and if you have ever read this book you know it over 1000 pages and in this format it is actually harder to read than a regular paperback version. The product did display the dimensions on the page but who really looks at that when buying anything other than furniture or appliances? guess i will next time.Story is incredible and any fan of King will put this one at or near the top of their favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"greatest book/movie evar!","review":"i love this book! ive seen the movie so many times i almost kno it by hart:) this book i reccomend (sry 4 misspelled wrds only 15) its great. enjoy!<3"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book ROCKS!","review":"This was one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read. I've read about 10 King novels and this is by far my favorite. IT is considerably better than THE STAND. The characters are better developed and more likeable.

Otherwise, you'll just consider IT to be the only horror book you ever loved!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale of horror fiction","review":"In this story, King creates fictional characters who are in every sense likeable. Their innermost thoughts are brought to light, and the readers can identify. However, the plot is thin, and most people in the story dont let their characters shine through. The fact that an eleven year old can terrorize other kids didnt sound right to me, and I thought the author bared his soul. Other than that, I liked the idea of it taking place in the 1960's and that we know what later become of the characters.For the most part, I think people should take the time to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary, but not that scary.","review":"If you've taken the time to read a book over 1,100 pages, you must've liked it otherwise you wouldn't have wasted your time. This book went into a lot of detail about each character's past and present to give the reader the sense that he really knew each one of them. I thought this could've been scaled down some to make the book less of a chore to get through. There was also less a sense of menace about Pennywise than there was about Jack in \\"The Shining\\" (in my opinion a better book). I never did get totally involved in the terror and thought the ending was a little out there. But all said and done, it was a worthwhile read and second only to \\"The Shining\\" of King's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Writing","review":"Great Book!

I don't know if King was deep into his cocaine addiction by this time, but the book certainly reads like it was written by someone sky-high on coke and completely out of control.Avoid this book. Reread classic King instead: the admirably concise Carrie or The Shining (which rarely drags and earns its length)."},{"rating":"2","title":"so long, sleep!","review":"If you didn't think clowns were creepy before this masterpiece, you'll never see them the same way again. A brilliant cast of characters with real motivations and believable supernatural events, King is a genius at getting you to willingly suspend disbelief. Long live the King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner","review":"Another winner from Stephen King. His books are always engaging, and they age well. This one was written 25 years ago, but has only an occasional line here and there that sounds dated. At the end of his books, we usually get a small slice of redemptive theology. I thought King handled this slice better in other books, such as Needful Things and Salem's Lot. But these are minor points about a book with so many strong points. And, yes, there was one evening that I had a rare nightmare, caused by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a masterpeice!","review":"It is the first Stephen King novel I have read. I was not scared by the length, as I have read Pillars of the Earth and World Without End. Anyways, this novel is a great read, as It is different for everybody, and thus people will be scared and see It as their worst fear. I won't ruin the book if you want to read it (pun intended), so just go out and buy it. I took about a week reading It, but I was hurrying and it was so engrossing I found myself reading for hours late into the night.Overall, an amazing book. Read It."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Horror Books of All Time","review":"One of the best horror books ever more simply put...\\"It\\". I absolutely loved this book, what drove me to read it was the movie, which i also thought was outstanding it had every aspect of the perfect horror novel. The movie was awesome and very scary but when a book can send chills up your spine you know its good. And to make me want to read a book that is one thousand ninety pages confirms that it wont lose your interest or attention, it spectacular i couldn't put it down, and im not a person that particularly likes to read but it is a true page turner and very scary. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone, yes it is a very very long book but it is so great that you wont even seem to be that long, you will wish that it never ended. So if you enjoy great horror books or anything by Stephen King this is definitely a book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"It\\"","review":"Over all it was a realy good book.

Afterwards, they make a blood promise that if It ever comes back, then they would come back and face it again.

Even though it's a horror book it contains so much more than only horror. It's a book about friendship, growing up, fellowship and overcoming your fears. I think that's what makes the book so great. \\"It\\" could have been just another horror book but various things make it outstanding. I would almost call \\"It\\" a beatiful book because it really touches you; The characters, their friendship and their fight together. Unlike many other horror books, this one really focus on it's characters and their development. It's really just one thing that bothers me when it comes to this book and it's something that happens in the end of the book, involving Beverly and the other guys. If you've read it, you know what I'm talking about. That part was totally unnecessary and in my opinion, should never have been in the book. Except for that, the book is extremely well-written and definately worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb book","review":"Well its just scary as hell, well writen and without a doubt one of the best SK books.

It's characters are so real, you feel as if you know them, or at least someone like them. I found it a must to read more than once, and I've enjoyed it more each time.

I was gripped by this book as if gripped by Pennywise himself. I could not put it down, even though if would keep me awake at night.

You laugh, cry, rejoice, and mourn. You will not want to finish it. I didn't!What makes this book a true masterpiece is King's characterization. These characters are more real, honest, and genuine then any other character I have read. When you meet Bill, Ben, Beverly, Richie, Mike, Eddie, and Stan, you cannot help but feel like they are old friends and you are spending time with them after a long absence. Even the bad guys are genuine. You cannot help but feel like your running from Henry Bowers and his gang, just like the Loser's Club.The character make this novel truly interesting and enjoyable.

I would find myself running (speedreading) through the pages to escape what I thought would happen. I was bothed amazed and impressed by the plot and story line, but the ending, as in most Stephen King novels, was a little lacking. In most books by King I find that he builds you up to a point and then drops the ending, but this is one of the best books that I had ever read regardless."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the best book I've ever read and I'm only 14","review":"This was a book full of emotions, it made you laugh, cry and tremble with fear.

I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a really good book, so far.","review":"I have reached Book 2: \\" June 0f 1958\\", and so far, this book is greater than most of the other Stephen King books ever! I watched some of the movie, but my aunt taped over it. When I see the movie, I hope it is as good as the book (or even better) !

I've made it a habit to read It every year or two, because every time I do read it, I seem to discover something else. In addition to being scary as Hell, it is also touching and extremely human to watch this group of reject children bond together to fight an evil in their home town and an evil within themselves. Super."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"I read this book in two weeks (well . . . thirteen days) and loved it. One thing that most people don't mention is how funny King can be. I've read a lot of books by a lot of authors (Koontz being my favourite) but nobody can make me giggle the way King does.Yes, there are some rather scarry scenes, and I think I did myself well by reading it during the day, but this ISN'T a horror novel. Not on your life.So ya, READ IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite Stephen King books...","review":"Even though the plot of this story is completely fictional, I still liked this book (I usually like stuff that's a little more connected to reality). I think the two themes I liked most about this book were the fact that all kids were flawed in some way, yet together they've formed a pretty big force... The second theme relates to the fact that I hadn't finished reading the book in the correct order - the last part I read was the scene where all seven of the kids vow to return to fight It if necessary, and the fact that after that, they've never met all together, but rather in smaller groups. Maybe the fact that around that time they've all started to \\"heal\\" from their flaws had something to do with that..."},{"rating":"1","title":"a book with possibilities that evaporated at the end.","review":"king did a good job developing the characters in this book. the story builds and builds.....then he does not know how to end it. i don,t like reading long books just to be disapointed. mite be a good idea to not get so carried away with the story that he doesn,t know how to end it. stick to less fantastic plots. i tthink he outdid himself in a negative way. i like lots of sk's books but not this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too long...","review":"I checked IT out from my local library a while ago and started to read it. The first 200 pages or so were okay, but once you get deeper into the book, it gets more tedious and boring. By page 410 I had stopped reading IT all together and returned it to the library. Some parts are very interesting, while other parts will drag and drag until you almost go nuts. The basic story of IT is about 7 kid's who discover a big secret:... It's much more than that of course, but that's the overall idea. The book is extremely long at about 1,138 pages. That is ridiculous, how can anyone read that many pages??? Overall, if you're a fast reader and can survive through many pages of detailed explanations (and not to mention tons of profanity) then please, get this book, but if you're like me and are a slow reader and find it hard to picture something that the author is trying to describe, then skip this book and read Misery."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is AMAZING!!","review":"This is definately the best book I've ever read!!

I enjoyed the flashbacks to the \\"gang's\\" childhood memories, yet King mixed the memories up too much. The jumping from one character's life to another's, then back to the previous character was confusing. It was hard to keep the facts straight in my mind. I will admit, Pennywise \\"IT\\", is the most horrifying monster King has cooked up. He made the amusing notion that, \\"All kids love clowns,\\" when in fact it's the opposite. Most kids, whom I've talked to, are terrified of clowns, or any creature in costume. They appear so huge before their eyes and they are frightened. There's something not trustworthy about that forever smile on those faces. I loved the book up until the end.

For some reason Mr. King thought that by adding 500 to 600 pages to a story that's 300 to 500 pages long would make it better. WRONG! \\"It\\" the book is long winded, no exaggeration. He might as well put in the history of his characters first booger they ever picked all the way up to adulthood. King's trademark stock characters also lack believability (they're almost cartoonish) and they're in almost every book he's ever written. Read: Cujo, Gerald's Game, Pet Cemetary, Night Shift, Skeleton Crew, Carrie, Different Seasons, Deloris Claibourne, instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Best","review":"\\"It\\" is greater than everything else that he has done combined.

I highly suggest you read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books that I have ever read.","review":"King was truly at his best when he wroten this novel.

Still, this book is too long and it's not that I can't like long books because I loved \\"The Stand\\" complete and uncut. I stopped reading the book halfway through because of boredom. About a year later I picked it up and finished IT. Much of the middle section is boring and pointless. This book could have been much better if a hundred pages smaller.Still, I did finish the book and it was worth it. The end is good and the events leading up to the end are great. Henry Bowers was a very interesting characters, as well as others. The rock fight is the best part of this book and is one of those scenes that keep you reading.

His amazing talent is not only that he is a magnificent author, but also that he is able to have his readers relate to the fictional characters he create in his novels. This book was one great example of it since it involved young children and their obstacles through life and also goes on telling the haunted scenes 20 years after. I believe everyone can relate to one of the young characters in this book and this is what makes it truly scary and will haunt you forever.

Anyway, this book was a pleasant suprise. I read it a nights, which wasn't the best idea beacuse then I had a little trouble getting to sleep! ha! Still, very much a page-turner.

I didn't pick it up again until almost a year later, and two days later, I finished it. I couldn't go to sleep with the lights off for a week afterwards, I was sixteen years old.

Don't get me wrong; this book is as scary and atmospheric as anything he has written. Most of it is very good, and the length did not bother me until I got to the end. The payoff, where what \\"IT\\" is is revealed, was so lame and unconvincing (I won't say what it turned out to be, but it was an old, tired horror-movie cliche) that I was completely turned off. I couldn't help feeling that King spent most of the time he was writing this book with absolutely no idea what the mysterious monster was going to be. That's why the book starts out so well; as long as the mystery remains, it is a gripping, scary story. But when the time came to reveal the monster, I can't help but feel that King just couldn't come up with anything, so he threw together a slapdash ending and stuck it on the book to meet his deadline. a MAJOR disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"IT\\" is an \\"Experience!\\"","review":"3/12/11,Saturday.

The scenes are well sculpted, weaving together the events bewtween the Derry, Maine of 1958 and the Derry of 1985. All of the characters are well developed, and there's enough creepy stuff to keep you riveted.

His pure horror works have become increasingly erratic over the years, though this was actually one of his scarier concepts.

The book can be confusing at times cause it would sometimes jump from scene to scene and sometimes the reader wouldn't even know what was happening for example it went from a tradgic death to an event that happened later and it didnt even minchen what happened so the reader would get lost.

Why finish it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash!","review":"That is the sound that a Stephen King novel makes as it enters its final forty pages. King is almost unmatched in his ability to entice a reader into his stories, much like Pennywise the clown entices children to their death in \\"IT.\\" Stephen King so often promises great rewards and leads the reader to believe that the end will be worth being engrossed in 400-plus pages of prose, but with the exception of \\"The Stand,\\" he lures the reader into his web and then rewards the reader with a fate worse than death by Pennywise, a wasted read. Could it be that Stephen King himself is the ultimate embodiment of evil to the reading world"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Along the lines of The Stand, though I still like The Stand better. Very good epic about good vs evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you want in a Stephen King book","review":"Simply said it's his best. The seven characters who confront 'IT' both as children and again as adults become your friends by the time you finish.The book is 100 times better than the movie. The movie was terrible and left out 75% of the story and events. Read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Climax was great...but the ending wasnt the best","review":"The best part of this book was when the clown scared them, as kids. It was a great climax when they retrned and reunited, bt the end was not good. The idead that it was a spider is ok... i stress \\"OK\\" but they way they kill him ( which i wont tell for those who havent read it) was down-right odd. Overall, i reccomend it, it was enjoyable. Also Salems Lot is a book i reccomend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not JUST classic King -- CLASSIC","review":"This book should be read by everyone even if you hate Stephen King (which i can't imagine) or just plain and simply hate the Horror genre. Not only does this book leave you white knuckled, it also delivers in the actual story. The characters are developed so well it's scary (no pun intended). Even the antagonists are devoloped greatly. My only problem with the book is it tends to get long-winded in part. The book is 1,090 pages (paperback) and gets off topic at times (such as a whole chapter baisically completely dedicated to the building of a dam which adds nothing to the story except showing how the characters work well together). Read this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"oh my god...","review":"This is probably the best book i have ever read. over 1000 pages of pure terror and thrills, and once this incredibly long novel is over, you still don't want it to end. too bad they made the mistake of making a movie out of it (what a piece of s***) but this book is amazing. The story is set in the typical town for most of king's novels: Derry, Maine. Children have been disappearing then turning up horribly mutilated by an unknown...thing. A group of 7 friends decide to combat the evil. After growing up and going their seperate ways, the thing returns and they must once again kill the thing known only as It. The characters are believable and diverse and king shows the parallels and diferences of the world through the eyes of a child and an adult remarkably. An amazing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of King's Best","review":"Stephen King weaves a fantastic tale of friendships, promises kept, and above all else, the horror of an unknown creature preying upon the children of Derry, Maine. Seven of them who have experienced the terror and lived to tell about it have bonded to form a group that would stick together no matter what. Even after \\"It\\" had stopped its reign of murder, the seven promised to return if \\"It\\" should ever start killing again. As adults, they remember the details of their childhoods and what they must do to stop \\"It\\" once and for all. Incredibly vivid, imaginative, and well thought out, this remains one of Stephen King's best novels. It's also one of his scariest. If you have a fear of clowns, this is not the book for you. Otherwise, you'll be captivated by the story. One final note: this is not light reading. This book is over 1,000 pages long, and you must have the time, the patience, and the dedication to get through it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST KING EVER!","review":"Having read all of King's books, I say with total confidence that this is the best book he has ever written. Portraying 7 children we all wish we were, they battle evil and become fully fleshed out adults. One thing you can never say about a King novel - no cardboard characters here. I was all of them all at once while reading the novel. And no one scares the bejeesus out of you like Stephen does. All hail the King!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King is the master of book horror!!!!!","review":"The way Mr. King used each one of the children's fears against them was brilliant. The way he showed them as adults acting like kids because of fear, makes the reader realize that even adults are vulnerable.

Children are disappearing and being murdered one by one. The culprit is a shape shifting monster who usually appears as \\"Pennywise The Clown\\". Why this book is considered to be King's 'Magnum Opus\\" is a total mystery to me. In this book we are introduced to 7 schoolfriends who try to kill the monster and fail. Then 25 years on we see them again trying to do the job that they didn't get right the first time around.\\"It\\" is 5 pounds of horse manure packed loosely into a 10 pound bag and once again the reader is forced to endure every single thought that popped into King's head in the writing of this book. This book is masquerading as Horror but is in fact just a collection of nightmares had by a small child.I give this book 5 stars because once again King has successfully made millions of people around the world buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I'm afraid of Clowns","review":"This and The Stand are my two favorite books in all the world.

Or try The Shining, Pet Sematary, Carrie, or Salem's Lot. They are all great Stephen King books. Or try Dean Koontz or Jonathan Kellerman, they are both good too. Here I'll tell you a little about IT.In 1958, seven, twelve year old kids, six boys, and one girl find that a ancient evil lives in their town and is killing children of all ages. They christen the evil that can change faces \\"IT.\\" One of kids, his little brother was killed by it. The kid wants to avenge his brother's death and stop others from happening. So they go and fight it and kill it Or did they.....? Many years later, in 1985, all of the kids but one had moved away. They are know successful grownups, but one call will change their lives. The man still living in their hometown calls each one, with a chilling message. \\"IT's back.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Publisher laziness","review":"This review will not address the content of the book, but rather the formatting of the Kindle edition.A publisher would never release a print edition of a book without thorough and repeated proof-reading. However, they seem to have no problem doing so with e-books. \\"It\\" contains numerous formatting problems (e.g. spaces between periods and closing quotation marks) as well as many typos. Spending time trying to decipher the text takes away from the enjoyment of the book.It appears that the publisher recently pulled the book to do a clean-up, and while that may have taken care of some of the problems it has a long way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been twice as good with half the details","review":"This is the first Stephen King book I read, I am in my late 20's, and I found \\"It\\" quite disappointing. It's definitely not a masterpiece and not really scary.The story is about a monster ('It') that kills children; and a fellowship of 7 little children that decide to fight It. Language-wise it's an easy read, and the main story is kind of ok.The big minus of the book is the enormous amount of details that do not contribute much to the story. The passages of irrelevant details are so long, and the horror scenes are so sparse, that whatever thrill builds up from one horror scene evaporates until you reach the next one. Moreover, I can't help but think that the group-sex scene was a cheap trick for the book to attract attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Esoteric -- but sublime -- horror","review":"This is without a doubt one of King's greatest novels. It is my own personal favorite. Stephen King's undeniable abiltity for character development is at its best here.The magnificent portrayal of Evil is also stunning, as developed throughout the Derry Interludes. The creation of a personalized, creepy Darkness which inexorably links Derry to the monster It is worth the extra reading effort.What is the essential philosophical idea in this book? Simple: (King gives it to you from the get-go) Fiction is the truth inside the lie. Dare to believe in what you should not. Notice that all the children who were killed told themselves that \\"It\\" was not real.This book is all about the loss of childish innocence -- and belief -- that surrounds the process of growing up, and the story of 7 adults tied together by fate to see if they can once again embrace that absolute, simplistic belief and defeat the Evil Without a Name.One of the most superb modern novels I've ever read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare yourself for terror!","review":"I just completed reading this book at midnight. I cannot sleep. I'm scared of the diabolical inhabiting my neighborhood and Stephen King planted the seed of my recently acquired paranoia.This book will haunt you. The characters created by Mr. King are very real and his ability to make them so real is frightening in and of itself. The town of Derry is a setting not unlike my own community and probably a bit like yours as well. The meshing of plausibility with the paranormal confront you with terror and it is unrelenting.\\"Fiction is the truth inside the lie, and the truth of my fiction is simple: the magic exists\\" Stephen KingWrite on Stephen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I was a little disappointed that it didn't come with the jacket for the book but I'm happy with the condition of the book and the price I paid for hardcover.

Sadly he decided later in his career that long was sufficient and he could skip the involved and interesting portions. That being said this is classic King. When I first read this book I literally could not put it down, much to the dismay of my family. Even while cooking dinner I could be found with the book propped on the counter. You have to pay attention as it does skip between times but it flows nicely. Definately a keeper of a book and now that I own a Kindle it was one of the first books I was willing to pay to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll float down here they all do..","review":"What can be said that hasn't already been said.

Can't go wrong with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST HORROR BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the the best horror book ever written. King has the perfect ideas and IT was a perfect book. Clowns would probably never hurt a fly but yet they still freak us out. IT turns a dancing clown (Pennywise) into children's worst nightmare. The book was so much better than the movie but IT wasn't exactly easy to make a movie out of. Tim Curry did a superb job at Pennywise and I loved the sarcastic jokes Pennywise made. This movie is very scary as a young child but is more funny than scary when you get older. The book on the other hand will scare you cold if you are as young as 8 or as old as 80!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"This it has been a very enjoyable book.The characters are really well developed, not only in their personal aspect, but also in their interrelation.The outcome did not bother me, I consider that it is even, secondary in history, but in no way it disappointed to me.Do not let amount of pages scares you, because if you read IT, at the end you will see that IT was a time investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best King Book/Movie","review":"How can you not love this book.

This book, as I recall, was around 1,000 pages and I could barely put it down. I was reading it, when I was 17, when my family moved from Oregon to Wisconsin. We drove. My father was the type of person that when he went to bed, we all went to bed. We were all in the same hotel room and I couldn't sleep because I kept wanting to get back to the book. I wanted to read it so bad that I grabbed a blanket and laid it down on the bathroom floor of the hotel room. I look back at that now and I think, GROSS! But that's how good the book was. Scarry!

It will keep you going until the very last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magnificent tale of comradery, horror, and imagination.","review":"Stephen King did a magnificent job with this one.

Wrong.I watched the film wanting to turn it off so many times because the story line was extremely boring but I was waiting for a gay teen to appear. The movie is about 2 straight teens. I was very dissapointed but so frustrated that the movie lacked any kind of intelligent writing or acting. The ending is quite laughable.This movie is as flat as the Texas landscape that they mention. I cannot find any redeeming quality to recommend this to anyone.

The only change on Klaus Barbie is that it is renamed. All the songs on the record are great though and this cd can give a good introdution to the new Death in june fan, as it contains both sides of the groupe: the industrial and the guitar-based \\"apocalyptic\\" folk side.

It's not bad for music, but news programs sound like they are coming from the bottom of a wash tub.

I was expecting this to have some entertaining examples of smart people falling for intellectual fads and some insights as to how that happens. Unfortunately, no such luck. All of the examples are ones that are widely known and there is really no insightful analysis. The book is quite short - all of the interesting content would barely fill a New Yorker article - and one gets the impression that this was just put together over a few weekends.

I personally love it, and I would put it up with the Dropkick Murphys latest. Yes, I will allow that a punk version of this song will never sound as good as an Irish tenor version. Still, as wrong as it may be, it was this version of the song that opened up the world of paddy punk to me, including such great bands as the Pogues and the Mahones!

Robert has a beautiful sister (of course)who works for the poor house in town, and they have an elderly father who was once a very sucessful businessman. The story evolves when the stranger, Rafffles Haw, slowly reveals that he has more money that his new friends can imagine. There are a lot of human emotions involved in this story, but the root cause of the trouble is avarice and greed.

After 2+ weeks, 5 attempts to wash and remove, and multiple attempts to do my yoga on the mat, it is still slippery and unusable...enough to make my supporting leg slip backwards towards a deep lunge during a simple warrior 1 or 2 pose. Each time I've tried to use the mat, I end up grabbing my old mat to finish my session.Since I'm also a yoga teacher, I wanted to have a mat in better condition to use on a daily basis, and have unfortunately not been able to use this mat.

I have to admit, I was pretty disappointed when bringing it to class the first couple of times. I was sliding all over the place, and this was NOT a hot yoga, just a regular Vinyasa-style class. I had followed the instructions and wiped the mat off a few times before its first use, but it was still slippery. It was extremely annoying. The width was perfect-never felt too skinny or too thick. After about 5 or more uses, it became less and less slippery. I now hardly slip at all (save for the times I get very sweaty). It's maintained it's shape well, and I don't see any signs of wear at this time.

If you can find one with the squiggles, snatch it up, cuz this one stinks. It compares to the one I got at Target for $10.99. I slide around on it like its a skating rink. The website says: rub it with sea salt, clean it with vinegar - (I want to exercise, not prepare a gourmet meal!) and after daily use for 3-4 months it will not be slipperey anymore. While I would love to use daily, here in reality, Im lucky to get to yoga 3 times a week. So 7-8 months of stepping up from down dog becasue my toes slip too much to hop? Ugh. Find a different brand, and if it works for you, let me know! The reason it got 2 stars instead of one is because it is a dense mat, and even on hardwood is comfortable for your knees.

I have been using it every day for a month since then and just love it. I think the quality of the mat and the weight are a great balance.

Really, the only reason I rated 4 rather than 5 stars is the color. It is far more orange-y and far less red than it appeared on my computer screen, than the rustic colored mat sak and unfortunately than I had hoped for.

I think Manduka need to look at quality control10 hours to break a product in is a bit excessive but Manduka say it can be 3 months.3 months of slipping in practise would make it a chore.Its a wire brush to the may now to see if I can get some usage out of it before getting a new product"},{"rating":"1","title":"major disappointment","review":"I bought this mat to replace my old Gaiam natural rubber mat, which was falling apart after 6 years of regualr use.

My teacher suggested that it might need to be wiped down with mild soapy water to remove any factory residue, and probably just needed some time to break in. I tried both (including a salt scrub as suggested), and continued to slip and slide all over the mat after two months of 3-4 classes per week. I found it very distracting to my practice.

This mat is not sweat-friendly, particularly if you practice vinyasa. And, once sweat absorbs in the mat, the odor starts brewing (even if you do clean with the special yoga mat cleaner, herbal concoctions or whatever else).For profuse sweaters with a regular practice, this mat is not for you. For those who dare take an inversion with the Manduka, be sure to put a towel under your hands and/or wipe off your mat before moving into position.On a positive note, this mat does offer more cushioning for the knees (but is by no means as plush as a Tapas Ultra...not suggesting you buy this either because it falls apart). Oh and the Manduka holds up under toe-digging, which is another plus.Namaste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last a lifetime","review":"I bought this mat because it was supposed to last a lifetime (or two).

The cushioning is just right and is extremely stable, doesn't slide at all on the ground. I chose the midnight color and am very happy with the decision. The color is a subtle and calming navy blue... not too dark or too bright. I got compliments on it from the other students and my teacher. I am very happy with this mat.

My clothing, my water bottle, and of course, my mat. I noticed a cheap mat was not cutting it anymore and may have even been affecting my balance. After some research, I chose this mat and I'm more than happy. It is a premium mat and worth the investment. It's stiff enough to help you do your balance series, and soft enough for those poses where you are down on your knees. Slightly heavy to carry around, but it's not bad. And from what I understand, lighter than their other version. Lastly, I use this in hot yoga and I just love it. It doesn't smell like plastic, it's easy to clean and dry and stays sturdy. If you don't know Manduka, get familiar and invest in this mat. Completely worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Mat!","review":"Have a feeling this will be the last mat I ever use.

I sent a photo of it to Manduka and asked them what they thought. They got back to me right away and said they didn't know what might happen but I could return it now or wait - whatever I was more comfortable with. I requested a return/exchange with Amazon and within a couple days had the replacement in my hands. I couldn't be happier with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Manduka PROlite - LOVE it!","review":"I was in the market for a new mat - one that would last longer than a year - and I have to say, what a wealth of information to sift through. I was hesitant to purchase the Manduka, only because there were several reviews that said the mat smelled funny and others were concerned with how slick the mat was. I decided to just take the plunge, and in addition to the PROlite mat, I purchased the Manduka Mat Renew cleaning spray. The first time I used the mat, I just used it and yes, it was rather slick. Sticky at first, then very slippery as the workout swept into full gear. I then received my mat spray, and I have to say - this is an essential. After using the spray just once, the mat was no longer slippery at all, even at the end of the workout. This is my favorite mat ever, but probably wouldn't have been without having the spray to take the slippery away. Oh, and I didn't find the mat to be smelly at all. Not sure what those comments were about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I bought this mat with the expectation that it would keep me from slipping, since I tend to sweat alot on my hands and feet. I was in for a big disappointment. For the price that I paid compare to the other yoga mats, I was very disappointed. Lesson learned, find a yoga store and shop in person rather than on-line.For those of you who sweats alot, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS MAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mat!","review":"This mat is great. It's so much better than those cheap spongy sticky mats I've purchased in the past. Everything you read in the reviews about a rubbery smell is true but the smell goes away after a couple days opened up and hanging outside or in the garage. Well worth the 'inconvenience'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for my mom-- but have my own","review":"And I love it.

I wasn't sure if the fact that I was getting the lite version might be to thin for me but it wasn't. It's dense enough to still create enough protection for my knobby knees. So whey did I give it 4 stars instead of 5 was only because. I orders a 71\\" mat and somehow got an 85\\" mat. Still lot sure what mat that is suppose to be. Being that the long mat that I saw was 79\\". Still a mystery. The pro black dragon is 85\\" bit that only comes in orange on the manduka website. Still a mystery.

Not worth t he money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mat, worth the price.","review":"My wife and I just recently started practicing yoga, and the mat that had been laying around the house was worse for wear (the cat using it as a scratching post didn't help). Our local studio had the Manduka Prolites at a very reasonable price, so I decided to splurge. Best decision I've ever made!I'm a moderate sweater, so maybe that's why I like it so much, but during our Ashitanga sessions, I have plenty of support, cushioning and TONS of grip and stability. Backing all of that up with a lifetime guarantee makes this the last mat I'll ever need.Perhaps those who sweat more than I do will find a better mat elsewhere, but for my money, I am a very happy man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Mat","review":"A fantastic Mat.

So far, this mat is holding up very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"living the life","review":"The plot was good. The acting was OK. Secondary equipment makes it a bad film.

This movie arrived to me 3 times. Each copy was missing at least 3 fight scenes that had been either cut or omitted from the final product. Upon contacting the distributer all they could say was that they were not the manufacturer and refund my money. This is an excellent movie in its entirety if you can find it that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD has ALTERED FILM'S SPEED!","review":"VIDEO ASIA'S DVD transfer of INVINCIBLE ARMOR has an altered film speed. It looks like some silent film transfers do with an unnatural slowing down of motion, comparable to the effect a strobe light has on the dance floor. This is a shame as INVINCIBLE ARMOR is a great film with great fights. Unfortunately, it is during the fight scenes that this speed delay is most noticeable (and distracting). The original print of this film ran at normal speed (I've seen it on VHS) and this alteration is UNEXCEPTABLE. While the DVD is widescreen and for the most part has a very crisp picture (something I cannot say is true of VIDEOASIA's recent DVD transfer of CRANE FIGHTER which is fullscreen and blurry even though the box states it's widescreed), I cannot recommend this version of the film. Sorry, but INVINCIBLE ARMOR deserves better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best I've Seen In The Genre","review":"Invincible Armor is packed with excellent action scenes and humorously dubbed dialogue. The main star is an amazing athlete. He can hold a pot above his head with his arm fully extended straight in the air, then shatter the pot with a kick that is as high as his own out stretched hand. With other gung fu movies, I have found myself fast-forwarding through talking parts to get to the fight scenes, which are few and far between. This movie, however, is good throughout and both the talking and action scenes are entertaining. It has a more intricate plot than most karate films. If you like action movies set in feudal China/Japan where they talk of honor, venerate elders, grow their eyebrows really bushy, jump 15 feet in the air, perform \\"1 inch punches,\\" read gung fu technique manuals, train in isolation, and fight to the death, you will love Invincible Armor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old \\"skool\\" Kung Fu","review":"The Kung fu kid is right,,,,there seems to be a mild delay in the fight scenes,,,but WHO CARES.

This flick has to be up there on all of your top 10 best, and don't lie. If this one is not in the collection,,,you're not a true old school nut,,,PERIOD!!!

Twenty-six homes are featured, mostly of private residents with a few museum-types.My only complaints were a lack of exterior pictures. Since the book was organized by architectural eras, it left something to be desired that some of them just had interior shots. Also the captioning was a bit bizarre--pointing out objects of interest that were not in the picture and sometimes the wrong caps with the wrong picture.Overall though, the book is a treat. I particularly liked some of the modern interior design done in older homes. The photography is magnificent.

Furthermore, we've noticed several mistakes with the sparse maps and diagrams provided in the book - for example, the maps for Nanjing are filled with misspellings and mislabeling, even for big attractions like the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Museum.For the average traveler who only plans to spend a week or two in China, this is a great resource for picking places to see, but when it comes to the actual logistics of getting around and efficiently managing your trip, turn to the more informative Lonely Planet and Rough Guide books instead and leave this one at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"China","review":"China (Eyewitness Travel Guides) is the best book for traveler, which is going to visit China.

It not only strengthened my understanding of the many places, events, and culture which I experienced 2.5 years ago...it prepared me to open my eyes to a whole new world when I traveled in 2007.What sets DK apart is that it gives you not only practical information...But provide maps/pictures/illustrations which other's cannot present.

Although I had been in China for 27 years before I came to US, I only visited limited places that the book covered. I think this book is very nice and interesting because it contains some personal experiences of the author(s).

I've had the squirrel buster for several weeks now and the squirrels have given up. The feeder is easy to assemble and fill. The food is well protected and ventilated so there is no issue with the food getting moldy or spoiled. The birds adapted to it immediately. Since they are facing the feeding portals and have to put their beaks into the feeder they they seem to see the food better and there is almost no food sent to the ground. I've not had to clean it yet but the instructions on doing so look clear and simple. The feeder is larger than I thought, which is not a problem for my application, but if you are looking for a small tube feeder, this is not it.Great idea put into practice. I'd highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heft, quality and great customer support","review":"Though I have owned the feeder only a short time; my feeder had major damage due to a marauding bear.

I kept screwing them back in but over the weeks I have had it I am down to about 2 of them.

It would be nicer if there was a way to catch the food before it drops to the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only squirrel proof feeder I've found","review":"I've looked all over for a squirrel proof feeder and this is the only one that truly works. The squirrels quickly learn that they can't beat this feeder and thus they are resigned to scrounging off the ground for seeds that are dropped when the birds feed. I saw other reviews that claim this type of feeder can trap the birds, but I haven't found this to be true at all. I use the recommended tension that is the default setting for this feeder and have had no problems. The Cardinal ring works well too. Just took a few weeks for the Cardinals to figure it out. This feeder is expensive, but it's well constructed and will save you money on the amount of seed that previously went to the squirrels. There's plenty of acorns for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Bird Feeder","review":"We have had a squirrel problem from the day we installed bird feeders in our yard. The squirrels have destroyed three feeders and eaten pounds and pounds of birdseed. I did not believe there was such thing as a \\"squirrel proof\\" feeder.

It took s few days for the birds to get used to it, and a few for the squirrels to learn the gig was up, but now the birds love it and the squirrels can't knock it down, jump on it or get to the seed. I am thrilled with the product. On top of it's functionality it is very well made and attractive."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This feeder has cut way back on the number of birds at my feed station.

I am glad I did, since in the first few weeks I was disappointed in the results. The Cardinals that had been coming to my other feeder had just stopped coming by. I watched a couple of squirrels try and get defeated by The Buster, but since the Cardinals hated it, I was neutral. After several weeks a few Cardinals started coming back and by the end of 6 to 8 weeks, they were back at just like the old feeder, but without the squirrels eating all the seed. Needless to say, I am now very pleased with the purchase and would recommend it to anyone with a squirrel issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it.","review":"Came across this feeder a while back but the price put me off. I tried almost every other so-called squirrel proof feeder in the last seven or eight years but to no avail. Ordered this in April and it looks like I have found a problem-free feeder. Sunflower seed won't clog the openings and the smaller seeds don't run out. Squirrels can't find anything to chew on and give up quickly. When they try to climb down from above they find that the design does not allow for anything to hold on to. More Cardinals than ever but the smaller birds like it too. Built to last. Easy to fill.

The ability to clean seems better than most.However, I see 3 problems:1. A danger to birds in that while they are feeding, the landing of other birds endangers their necks.2. Not water proof. When it rains, the feed gets soggy and this makes an awful rotting mess.3. Cardinals do not use the feeder - even with the special cardinal perch.(This might be a selling point if you do not like cardinals as smaller birds thrive from the lack of cardinal competition.)4. The cardinal perch permits squirrel access from under.Bottom line - If your goal was to feed cardinals, buy something else. The one that we ordered is on the way back."},{"rating":"2","title":"squirrel free","review":"I bought a different squirrel proof feeder 3 times and the squirrels still managed to get the birdseed.

I have about ten other feeders that I have purchased over the years, and the squirrels always managed to get into them. I do have another one that fits on pole and the weight of the squirrel prevents it from getting in. As well, the squirrel can sit on the top, but can't penetrate the metal. This Brome 1024 I needed for hanging on a pole on my deck. Although the squirrel can reach it, it cannot get into the seeds.

It is well built and could not have made a better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!","review":"This bird feeder does exactly what it says it does.

After trying some other \\"squirrel proof\\" feeders which my resourceful rodents readily outsmarted, I ordered this, without much hope, and...success!!! The squirrels have tried, unsuccessfully, to raid it. They are back to eating acorns. The birds love it. Cardinals, Carolina wrens, chickadees, nuthatches, titmice,downy woodpeckers, and even some bluebirds all enjoy the sunflower seeds, and the feeder stays fillled for so much longer without the squirrel raids. I would recommend the cardinal ring, which seems to accommodate cardinals and some other species, more comfortably than the narrower perches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Squirrel buster plus works well!","review":"I was a little shocked to see a squirrel lift up the top lid and pick out bird seed.

They were defeated, and now just sit and stare at it in disgust.As an added bonus, the feeder offers the ability to adjust the closing weight to shut out the annoying big birds, like grackles who come to hog the feeder. They were frustrated and gave up after about ten minutes. The smaller birds now can enjoy and feed in peace.When we received the feeder, I saw the option of adding the \\"cardinal ring\\" that came with it. I thought this was just a naming gimmick since our \\"cardinals\\" had been ground feeders.

Although squirrels don't eat ON the feeder, they have discovered to launch (as in, literally!) themselves onto the cardinal perch ring from the screen door. The door is the only place for the squirrels to get a grip. It is far away, but obviously just barely close enough for them to consider it as a suitible sub for Cape Canaveral. As the feeder swings with the weight, the seeds fall out through the holes in the bottom. I think my neighbor taught them that trick. My goal is to keep them off - PERIOD. So although the feeder has slowed the squirrel onslaught, I figure that to keep those buggers off my shiney feeder, I'm electrifying my window screen. Just kidding! I meant my patio screen door.

DO NOT MOUNT THIS FEEDER OR ANY FEEDER WHICH RELIES ON WEIGHT TO ACUATE THE BLOCKING MECHANISM, WHERE THE SQUIRREL CAN DISTRIBUTE OR MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT PLACED ON THE FEEDER - IT'S COMMON SENSE! Place it in the right spot and there is no way gray or red squirrels are getting a morsel. Cardinals, finches, nuthatches - you name it - flock to this feeder.

This is the only brand, by far, that succeeds. The squirrels no longer even try to go near it because they can never get any food. The plastic tubing is so strong that squirrels can't bite thru it - the only feeder I can say that about. It even withstood a bear attack, with just a few dents that didn't break the plastic. Small to large birds can feed on this one - we've even had a huge pileated woodpecker using it. Don't hesitate about the price. This is seriously worth it, and you won't ever need to replace another chewed up feeder.I also have the smaller caged version of this feeder, which works well too.Note that if you want to hang this from a hanger off your deck rail, you will need a much higher than normal hanger, and one that stretches out off the deck quite far, else the squirrels will be able to grab onto it and possibly eat seeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth the $$ in Seed Savings (keeps the big birds out!)","review":"We have a minor squirrel problem here, but a HUGE grackle problem. They could empty a feeder in an hour! That gets expensive quickly.I keep this filled with sunflower seed and so far, the grackles have come, found they can't get into it, and content themselves with picking a few seeds off the ground, and then leave. As they can't get any large quantity of seed they like, they're also leaving the suet alone (this is an added bonus -- they'd go through a suet cake in about 3 hours and the little birds and woodpeckers would get none of it).The few squirrels who have tried to get at the seed have also been thwarted. They may swing it around and get a little seed to spill on the ground -- and some will spill in the wind -- but we don't lose much in this way.This feeder has already paid for itself in seed savings!

I've now put it up in the backyard on a silver maple and I live in fear that it will somehow detach and kill the dog.LATER: Works fine, with adjustable weight mechanism that can be used to block squirrels and even larger birds. With five feeding ports, the birds are gobbling down impossibly large amounts of bird seed. I believe I have attracted every bird in a five mile radius and the trees around my property are eerily populated, in scenes reminiscent of a Hitchcock film.

Our birds scatter when the squirrels come and we have no large birds in competion. The squirrels are chewing on the underneath while hanging on but so far only some small scratches.

We didn't have a long enough hook at first so we suspended the feeder with a thick wire. The squirrels chewed through it quickly but the feeder survived the fall.

They work just beautifully. I did have one cardinal ring crack. I called and Brome sent a replacement ring out same day... no charge, no questions asked. Squirrels have chewed the paint off from around the ports, but the feeders still work perfectly. I just ordered a third for my front porch. This is an amazing product and has saved me a fortune in seed. I've owned every type of Droll Yankee squirrel proof feeder. The motorized ones do work, but I got tired of constantly forking out $40 for replacement batteries. Additionally, when the batteries do wear down, the seed is a sitting duck. Therefore, the squirrels keep coming back. This Brome feeder works even better... because it works every time, time after time. It is a very high quality product at half the price of the DY. Easy to fill, easy to adjust the tension, easy to clean... it is just a superb design. I bought two and love them. You will NOT be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Birdtender","review":"This is a very nice bird feeder. Easy to fill and the birds seem to love it. Have it on a shepherds hook and mainly the smaller birds feed from it, but the larger ones feed from seeds that fall to the ground. Had one squirrel try to get into it, but between the pole and his weight the ports closed and he wasn't able to get a morsel and I haven't seen him back, even to feed on the ground. We plan to keep it filled all winter as well and have really enjoyed watching all the different birds who have come to feed. Well worth the extra money and is very well made and easy to clean. Rain runs off so the food stays dry as well. Best I have seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Squirrel Buster does work!","review":"It does work!

Finally, they managed to tear the Yankee feeder up. After hanging up the Brome feeder, I haven't seen one squirrel even attempt to get the seed.

Chipmunks can still go on it though. If you adjust the spring's tension too low to compensate for this you may not allow the heavier birds such as blue jays or even cardinals to feed - so I deal with the chipmunks. The paint has already flaked around the feed opening, but otherwise, well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bird feeder I have ever seen or used.","review":"Perhaps a bit expensive, but really really well worth it. Very well made. Superb design. We've used ours for many months and remain very well pleased. Everything the Brome people say about this feeder has proven to be true.

When two of my friends saw the results, they decided to buy the same feeder too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my feeder","review":"My local squirrels and chipmunk are pretty clever fellows. I have the feeder hanging 15 inches from my deck, since it's the only viewing location I have available. Both the squirrels and chipmunk figured out how to leap from the fence onto the feeder. The chipmunk weighs so little, that the ports remain open while he's chowing down. As for the squirrels, the feeder ports close. I attached sheets of plexiglass to the fence. It seems to deter all critters, at least for now. The feeder is constantly visited by a slew of birds. The house wrens think they're taking a bath in the feed ports, going from one to the next, scattering seed all over the deck. Squirrels don't need to remove seed from the feeder. The wrens do the job just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"After many purchases and failures of \\"squirrel free\\" bird feeders I found this one.

This stuff is fantastic for everything. Can be used straight from the bottle or you can heat it up for more cleaning power. Doesn't take much to get the job done either. It does tend to run a bit higher than others but well worth the price. Remove stains and odors excellent and with little effort. Get a small bottle and just keep refilling it with the gallon size. Great pre-treatment for rug cleaning as well, watch out if you add it directly to your rug cleaner you could end up with alot of foam! So I just use it on spots and use a spray bottle to mist large areas to refresh before I hit it with my rug cleaner, that way I don't end up with a ton of foam in the machine. I use it as pre-treatment on laundry for stains like blood and such, or sometimes just squirt some into the washer.

The battery is slightly loose and doesn't fit perfectly into the slot. It moves around a bit too. That is the biggest issue I have it.

It looked like a nice player, it had a huge screen and 8gigs of storage. When I got home I uploaded some music to it and tried it out. The sound was so drab and dull compared to the Sony I had. I fiddled with the Customizable EQ to see if that'd help, no go. I heard it had something called \\"FullSound\\" technology, but I could not locate this function in any of the menus.

Like last year's winner, Graham Swift's Last Orders, it is so literary. Nearly every paragraph contains a metaphor or a simile. It is good to have some of these sporadically placed throughout the book, but certainly not with the frequency seen in the book!. This book generated so much hype in the media but is a thorough disappointment for readers like myself. A tedious task to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roy is astounding","review":"Arundhati Roy uses eloquent language to describe the story and life of two twins, Rahel and Estha.

A tapestry of overdone style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely amazing","review":"Splendid. It's one of the greatest works from Indian-English authors.

The style of her narration is definitely one of the best i've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uniquely written; a fine and angry novel","review":"The narrative voice in this book is astoundingly real, and quite unique.

Beautifully done, and very revealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure filled with moments of true grace and tenderness.","review":"This novel certainly has several \\"down\\" times, and it may be difficult for some readers to overlook them. If you can, though, the special language and observations that Ms. Roy offers are both magical and heartbreaking. The children in the work are fantastic, believeable characters with honest voices and smart minds. There were so many times that I stopped to appreciate their insights and it is because of the whirly decriptions and quirky comments on life in general that I felt this book change me and force me to consider all of the deep emotions every man, woman, and child faces in the world. A world all of its own, this novel is a real gem for anyone with a sensitive side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"If you have nothing else to read I'd read this.

Well, the reason is the locale and marketing. Lisa Mason's books are about now and here in the cyberworld but all that is passe. Technology is here and so it is boring. A successful book will go to the margins and Kerala is as good an example of something unlike the West that one can imagine."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read!!!","review":"Roy's use of poetry in her literature was beautiful. I bought this book while traveling in Europe this summer and couldn't put it down. Roy has written a book like no other I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a beautifully written tale about an immoral world.","review":"Roy uses similes, metaphors, snatches of sentences to create a beautiful, intricate tale. She keeps the reader guessing by alluding to crimes still to come and past tragedies not yet explained. Her subject matter covers the gamut from sexual abuse, police corruption, parental neglect, and the horrifying results of the caste system. It is a difficult book to read but well worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring excepting at the end","review":"Roy is naive, but she has passion. Makes an unusual combination but that cannot rescue the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth it!!!","review":"I read this book for a college english class, and I went into it with really high expectations because it was being taught along with some this centuries best novels. This is not one of the century's best novels. The whole thing grows incredibly repeditive and sappy. During the first 200 pages the novel sccomplishes nothing, and in the last hundred it destroys the disaccomplishments of the first two hundred pages. Also at times the book is preachy. Miss Roy doesn't really know subtly. She interprets every action and beats you over the head with repitition and over explination. At the end I found the book wasn't really worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blasphemous book!!!!","review":"This book is the worst piece of fiction ever written.

Good first effort by a promising writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"inaccurate","review":"The book is worth reading,but should not be taken as the truth.Roy manipulates a small part in mahabarata to suit the need for a best seller.The ending of the story is a bit frustrating...but her English and style of writing does keep the reader wondering what might happen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"A finely wrought magical dream of a novel","review":"I wasn't sure if I would even finish this book when I first started reading. Roy's writing is ephemeral; reality is gossamer-fine and the reader is never quite sure where he or she might be treading. What kept me hooked, though, was the absolutely marvelous writing. Even if I were given an infinity to think, I don't believe I could come up with such beautiful phrasings. I would agree with other reviewers in saying that this book is not for everyone. If you like the concrete, stated plainly, then chances are this novel is not for you. If you like only books that on topics familiar to you, then I wouldn't recommend it. If, however, you're a sucker for remarkable prose and don't mind being a little confused at times when you're reading, then give Arundhati Roy a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"style over substance","review":"After completing this book on the third attempt I am left with mixed feelings. Here is my honest opinion. This is STYLE over SUBSTANCE at times...; Disjointed passages over story which is in the background if there is one; this is good marketing hype scoring over serious analysis and so on. Yet the book does have some evocative descriptions. SO in the end, not the best you will read, yet not too bad either..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything happens three times, or more","review":"Hard to credit the hype surrounding this book. Endlessly repetitive, rather silly word play, some scenic descriptions, but characters who never rise above banality of thought, word, or action.

The God of Small Things pales in comparison to beautifully written books by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, Kiran Desai, etc. I was greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death to the critics! I want my money back!","review":"I am appalled that a book this bad could have won the Booker National Award. It is undoubtedly one of the worst books I have read in years. Stilted language. No plot. Characters that are, beneath it all, quite trashy. A novel that goes nowhere and actually is offensive (the bathroom scene was the last straw). I tried to read through this book but it was so painful I put it down after 100 pages. Enough was enough. THis book has no redeeming qualities. And it really makes me question the judgement of the critics. (Are they on the publisher's payroll? What gives with all the hype?) To the critics: shame on you. This is no masterpiece. And it will be the last time I buy a book on your recommendations. If I had my way, you'd refund my money! With so many wonderful books out there, this is one big waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"grossly overated and boring","review":"I read this book with a lot of patience and hope! And as an Indian I wanted to believe that I was reading real literature. But frankly at the end of it all, it just seemed a trivial piece of diary writing. Again we should not always look for a linear flow of story in a novel, that is true. But then there should be something to at least sustain a readers interest. Here I could find nothing. The tale is set in kerala; Some, maybe most of the characters are autobiographical that much is obvious. And Arundhati is settling scores with her father and some relatives that too is clear. But a book definitely requires something more. And that is missing. What then explains the success of this novel? Clearly publishing hype, marketing strategies and Arundhati's looks. The real test for Ms Roy willo be her next book. You can write one autobiography and make claims to being a heavyweight writer. But the second one will reveal her true talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of _The God of Small Things_","review":"Excellent novel for semi-experienced and experienced readers (comp.

Yuk. Can't she see Anything Nice?? After all, the sky is blue and the sun shines brightly even on Bosnia. I haven't gotten to comic-relief point one, so far, even though I'm (finally) about one-third through the book.I really feel sorry for the child-characters but my goodness, isn't there some way to describe total, unrelieved crud without forcing the reader to wallow in it ALL THE WAY THROUGH??P.S.: There are too many weak similies and non-sentences. The creative capitalization gets old. It's cute the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre book","review":"This is similar to the stuff that used to be published in Eve's Weekly or Femina in India years ago. Repetitive language with a formula plot. The biggest hype of the past several years. God of Big Things, please save us readers from such writings. Shouldn't publishers be punished for misdirecting readers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"I am still trying to understand the reason for all the accolades the book has been receiving. This has been one of the most over-rated books I read in a long time. I read a great many books in my life time, and I can say with conviction that the crass nature of the prose was completely unneccessary. Nothing personal Ms. Roy, but this book looks like it is written by someone who lacks a moral compass. The central character, Rahel does not have a sense of correctness in her actions. The Western society claims that this books talks about the caste system in India, but that forms a small part of the whole story. You might as well read the last few pages in the book to get that story. The rest of the story is filled with two small children, pathetic uncles and aunts and an indifferent mom. There are then the episodes on abuse. I am sorry to see that the one Indian author who won the Booker prize in the recent times should win it for garbage like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love it or leave it...","review":"I think a lot of people either really loved this book or hated it. It just didn't appeal to me. I didn't like how slow it was or how the story was revolved around that silly secret. I read this after reading a lot of Rohinton Mistry though. Maybe my expectations were too high, but it just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful use of language...","review":"The book's greatest asset is the beautiful use of language. The various emotions in the story are nicely sketched with the best use of words. The character-sketch is strong. I also find the author's comic style and sense of humor interesting. The one aspect that I can think which made me rate it 4 instead of 5 was its pace. Apparently, I felt that the plot was patchy. There were occasions when I found it to be absolutely perfect while at other times I found it losing its grip and becoming a drag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good style","review":"A. Roy has for sure a very original style...Her novel is a like a puzzle, and we find different pieces of the story in every page ...Very well written..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I've read several wonderful novels about India, including Seth's \\"A Suitable Boy\\" and E.M. Forster's \\"A Passage to India\\". This one, sadly, is the worst of the lot. The author shows some promise: she is quite gifted at word play. However, she has not yet learned to to create vivid, three-dimensional characters and her many literary allusions are more than a bit pretentious; what do references to \\"The Great Gatsby\\" or Vladimir Nabokov have to do with this story or with her theme (if there is one)? Her self-consciously post-modern approach to telling her (trite) story doesn't help matters.To sum up: no characters, thin plot, pretentiousness, and some good word play. This is an author in desperate need of a good editor; with encouragement and a fine critical eye she might one day produce a real novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive recitation of stereotypes","review":"I am unimpressed by this book and frankly do not understand why it is getting so much publicity. I suppose trite emotional sagas and imitating Rushdie's style has become popular these days. \\"The God of Small Things\\" attempts to reach the scope of a \\"Midnight's Children\\" but if you want magico-realism, why not read the originals like Grass and Marquez? As far as her treatment of India goes, I find it patronizing and somewhat loaded with a nagging ignorance of issues (e.g. Marxism, her treatment of the caste system, law enforcement, etc.) I hope her next book is a more mature effort that doesn't resort to emotional gimmickry to get her point across. Her obsessive use of imagery and emotional drama reveals that she has yet to attain the literary sophistication and maturity of a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the fuss about?","review":"I approached this book with high expectations, given all the hoopla surrounding it. What a disappointment. True, the language is in some cases poetic, although the stylistic devices become tedious and irritating rather quickly. The exotic background and detail are interesting. But at bottom, it's just a very ordinary story about nasty people in a nasty society. It left me with a bad taste, and the conviction that if the setting had been America, this book would have fallen into the obscurity it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has good passages but a mediocre book","review":"This book is proof that marketing can do wonders to a product. Remember, not long ago Americans were lining up in droves to buy pet rocks! \`Small Things' plays to stereotypes about India, about caste, about Syrian Christians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the story? Who are the characters?","review":"I got so bogged down trying to figure who was who and where was where and when was when that I never did get into this book. As soon as I thought the book was going somewhere, or I was relating to a character, the time or place or character changed. The description was over done, and the incomplete sentences and capital letters spread pell mell throughout were annoying. There were too many instances of violence, vulgarity, abuse, and I really don't think we need to know who goes to the bathroom where, when, how, why . . . so often. The only reason I finished it was because it was a gift. I am amazed at how many great reviews this book got."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I've ever read","review":"This book was unreadable.

Ultimately, you didn't care about any characters or what happened. A total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"above average","review":"I have had mixed feelings about this one. In parts I wanted to lose myself; at others I got exasperated. Better editing could have resulted in a better and more fluent story. It is exotic in parts. U can feel a different land and its strange people who are different from us westerners. However like I said, this is definitely not among the best books I have read but still above average."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing beyond hype!","review":"Oh God! This is is supposed to be a great book!Yet why...? That was my reaction to the whole thing when I completed it. Arundhati Roy's much talked abput book is more of a personal narration of her life. If you sympathise with her travails, you may like it. Otherwise it is one continuous drag. The story is about twins, Rahel and Estha and their divorced mother. A lot of venom is poured on the absent and dead father. Again sounding like a bitter memoir of a child. But the story is not linear at all, making it so difficult for a reader to hang on. So many phrases which the author thinks are cute, made me tear my hair in exasperation! Some passages at the begining of each chapter are well written. The first page is quite similar to that of Alan Paton's Cry the beloved country. Yet...In the end ther is some confusion. What did finally happen to Sophie Mol? After a point u simply do not want to bother. So my feelings to sum up--- a pretty average fare...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever for the sake of cleverness.","review":"I couldn't get past the first few chapters.

A waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal about this book?","review":"I hated it. The writing style is contrived, and downright annoying. It offers no new insights on Indian culture, nor does it even really have much of a plot to speak of. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jasperreader","review":"The book was well written but the story, itself, was not enjoyable. Dysfunctional people raising two children who, in turn, are dysfunctional...."},{"rating":"1","title":"positively one of the WORST books I have ever read","review":"I bought this book on the strength of the review I read in our newspaper - I'll never make THAT mistake again! I absolutely don't get the hype over this novel. I couldn't follow the plot. I couldn't find a SINGLE reason to care about what happened to any of these characters. And I found Roy's \\"unusual\\" style distracting and affected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"After reading all the glowing reviews, I was disappointed with the rambling, disjointed, impossible to follow story. The poor grammer added to my disappointment. There are so many disjointed phrases, with periods at the end of a jumble of words, it was nearly impossible to understand what the author intended to say. Ms Roy is in great need of an accomplished editor. I read 75 to 100 books per year and this is the worst book I've read in 2001."},{"rating":"1","title":"College Essay","review":"While some parts were eloquently written, I couldn't help but feel the novice-level in which the story was portrayed. It was very any-climatic and over-hyped in my opinion. However, for those consumers influence by the covers of books, it's a grabber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let us reinvent the wheel and patent it!","review":"The book was upsetting for the crass commerialization of the issues that sell only too well! Interweaving of the issues with twin psyches was great; but the description of issues was crass if not totally vulgar! I have yet to see an author come up with a storyline that would suggest answers to the issues raised by this book: issues which have been raised only one too many times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roy tries too hard","review":"The book has some interesting character analyses esp of the children. But the overwhelming letdown was the prose and her style of writing. It is obvious she tries too hard to be different, which gets rather tiring. I had the feeling of being led round and round and ending up nowhere significant."},{"rating":"1","title":"the god of no things","review":"Where to start ... Arundhati Roy's writing style is highly derivative and heavily indebted to magical realism and Isabella Allende in particular. It lacks originality in style and content. It employs the over-used device of a character returning home and engaging in a series of flashbacks that eventually lead to the present ... and worst of all, buys into the falsehood of children being wise beyond their years (gag!). It's hard to feel any sympathy for a book populated with bourgeois characters that are each conveniently equipped with uncanny eccentricities. I fault the editor who seems to have locked her read pen in her desk when she should have been doing her job. This work should be edited down to a nice ten page short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roy needs to read a book on writing a novel","review":"I think the novel lacks a purpose from sharing it's 'emotional' side from the begenning. The first couple of pages are perhaps a flawed copy of Gerald Durrel's great work. Next, the author goes against the 1st rule of writing: she has told everything and shown nothing. The book is too slow and does not engage the reader. It rings a hollow and a rather disgusting tone of the Indian culture and setting. The emotions are not well delivered and only the disgusting scenes have been woven into a sick patchwork of words. The characters are no more than caricatures.By the way I am from Pakistan, so I know Indian setting better than most of those who I presume have read this book, and thus I believe that it could have been presented in a much much better manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Corny, confusing,queer book","review":"Well here is my honest opinion about this much touted tale of twins. This is basically a cute sort of kiddish story which sounds profound and arty because it is confusing. It took me quite an effort to complete it. All because half baked characters keep popping in and out of the book. Now what happens to them nobody really knows, and beyond a point u dont even care. Maybe the whole idea was to be arty by being confusing....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look for another book!","review":"This book is extremely complicated with an underdeveloped plot. The readers spends the first half of the book wondering who Sophie Mol is and eagerly awaiting the beginning of the plot. The second half is filled with the disappointment of realizing that the plot was not worth trudging through the heavy words and mixed up concepts. The sexual exploitation appears to serve no purpose in the novel except to offer a bit of shock value. It appears to be strategically placed in the middle in order to keep the reader from giving up. My advice is to look for another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, a waste of time","review":"This book was full of way too many descriptions and flowery language that I was bored to death and couldn't keep my eyes open. At a total of over 300 pages, it could be decreased to about 50 pages of actual information. I do not recommend this and I have no idea why someone would call this a good book.

I've given it to my mother, grandmother, and friends. It distills from the contrasts of several very different characters the basic patterns by which all of us live, and how those similar patterns in differing personalities and situations can interact to produce the world around us."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of forbidden love","review":"I bought the book mainly because it won the booker prize. At first I couldn't understand where it was going and was about to leave it when I skipped to the last pages. That got me pretty interested, so I continued. It's a wonderful book basically about jealously, forbidden love, the 'love laws' as she calls them. Baby Kochama was a vicious character, Amma a doomed one. A brilliant read."},{"rating":"1","title":"audio book is confusing","review":"too many names introduced, too much criss-crossing of timelines with no pausing or explanation...not to mention dull. Abridged version (6 hours) needs to be further abridged to 3 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll vomit","review":"This book is indeed spellbinding. I wouldn't call it beautiful but I would call it real. Real as in real life, which for many many people on this planet really sucks. Parts of the book may turn your stomach but Roy should be congratulated for not telling this story through rose colored glasses. This book will make you think and is a great cross-cultural study. The writing style may be hard for some to follow (hypnotic for some, confusing to others) but the metaphor is some of the most powerful I've read. This book is worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horrid book","review":"What a horrible little book by a somewhat petty moralist. It was done better in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" Which apparently the author read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-done, over-hyped, over-rated florid prose","review":"Too bad the author got so much praise for such over-the-top writing. Reminds me of creative writing classes, too descriptive, contrived, aiming to make an impression rather than tell a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped like an overbudgeted hollywood film","review":"It was a good book, if you read the last 50 pages, which makes it LIKE a man without a hat. The imagery inudated the reader LIKE ice pellets on the street during a storm. It was rather disjointed and difficult to follow LIKE a winding country road. After awhile, I began skipping any phrase that followed the word \\"like\\", LIKE a runner rushing towards a finish line. Poetic writing is wonderful, but not everything should be a simile..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book that demands Re-Reading","review":"The book that demands re-reading--not only because of its Complexities but also because of its purely amazing Roy's Language. The thought of completing this book never crossed my mind--and admittedly, I didn't manage to complete my assigned reading when first introduced to the book in my 101E (English as an Additional Language) class. But five years later, the book was recuperated from the shelf and \\"was suffered\\" as I \\"awardingly suffered\\" while reading it. The God of Small Things: one of the books I can claim to be one of my favorites... A second novel, Ms. Arundhati Roy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this book!","review":"Greetings from beautiful downtown Poughkeepsie!C'mon people, this book ROCKS!Beautiful language, interesting characters, maybe a wee bit too much history, and a terrible tragedy all wrapped in a haunting little message: Things can change in a day.Even the cover of this book is beautiful.The only bad thing here is that Ms Roy says she only had one novel in her. Lets hope she's just kidding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty vessels make more noise?","review":"I can't say I didn't like the book. But that's about it - it certainly is overrated.Maybe the main reason I liked the book was because of my age - I happen to be the same age as the author. I could identify well with a lot of things that happen in the book in the late 60s and the reactions of the twins to them - they brought back quite a few memories. Roy has a distinct style which appealed to me. She is good at fictionalizing fact and factualizing fiction. Except for her nobody will ever know what is fact and what is fiction.But all this does not make it a great book. Its too stark and overwhelmingly cynical. Too much time is spent in exploring the past and nothing much happens in the present or even in between. The ambiguous relationship between the twins is never explored to its full potential.This is a case of the hype being an overkill and defeating the very purpose its suppose to achieve!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Small Things Were Hard to Find","review":"I laboured with this book, I really did, which explains my poor rating and why Roy's first novel found itself parked on my coffee table for most of its tenuous existence with me. I am certain a great story exists within the pages given the recognition Roy has received, but after each chapter I kept asking myself: \\"Please Roy, just where are you going with this plot?\\". This verdict may be unfair and it is a shame because there's some great, imaginative writing here - wonderful visualizations and anecdotes. Unfortunatly, I just kept counting the pages until I was finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get it","review":"I have heard great things about this book and looked forward to reading it. I was in India for six months when I read this book and could see some of what she was talking about and I found that interesting. However, that is all I could find interesting about this book.I think she is a good writer, but only on a page to page basis, anything of more duration than that and I just didn't get it. I read sixty books a year and this is the only book in the last few years that I didn't finish. I gave up about thirty pages from the end. The story went nowhere (at least nowhere of interest), the characters were pointless, and I just couldn't force myself to read one more page when I quit.Everyone else thought I had talked to suggested this book and thought it was the duck's nuts. I just couldn't feel this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty interesting","review":"Very cleverly written. Some profound statements and this deep undercurrent of sadness made the book quite compelling. The innocence of childhood was captured quite well. The absolute lack of second chances that is so much a fact of life in India, particularly for women in small towns and villages, was the real issue that was presented superbly in this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious writing","review":"I really enjoyed the writing and the way that the narrative is carried out. I got a little bit tired with the plot and the characters in the last part, but even so I'm glad that I read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful. Real.","review":"I loved this book very much. It is difficult to paint real life, to show how for something (terrible) to happen, many other little, different and separate elements have to converge. It is probable, as she let us believe that a good part of it is a true story. If it is, this book was a seed growing again in that devastated family. Her way out. To take the words out of her. I did not know the book was famous and so controversed. I wish her well and hope that having her work commented on by the whole planet will not upset her too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"True India through an Indian's eyes.","review":"A literary classic in every sense of the word. The unrelenting plathora of paradoxes throughout the book really keeps you on your toes - from masterly elegance one moment to carnal, scatological descriptions the next. The serenity and the inherent passivity of typical Indian village life has been brought out with acuity.Arundhati, as a person has been through various experiences in her life and she has been able to give us some part of those experiences through this book.Truly remarkable and highly recommended for an enleavening catharsis of the self."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-linear. Interesting & fun read. Emotional story.","review":"Fun to read; halting style of narration that seems to cough words from a swallowed heart. Emotional story about love, family, social rights and obligations. Very fast read; once into the rhythm I could not put this down."},{"rating":"1","title":"The God of Small This","review":"Hello Customer Service,I am sorry to say this but I have the wrong product. I wanted the book not the tape. I haven't opend the package till now. Just now, when I got the time to read book, I found out it is a tape. Could you please send me the book and I will return the tape. Or tell me what is the procedure is. Thank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very entertaining","review":"I disliked this book very much. From the beginning it never caught my interest. I love to read and I usually can't put a book down b/c I need to know what happens next. This book however I would need to take breaks from it because it was soo slow. If I shut that book at any point I never felt the need to finish it. I don't recommend it. It is very boring and drawn out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poetic but sometimes pointless","review":"I don't usually read books which won the Booker Prize, but this came highly recommended by a friend. Well, I did read it to the end. You do, with this one, as the characters catch hold of you and you want to know what happens to them. Still, at the close of the book, you wonder if there were any point to the story. This book reminds me of movies such as \\"House of Flying Daggers\\" by Zhang Yimou - absolutely beautiful cinematography but you find yourself wondering \\"What's the plot? WHERE'S the plot?\\"Her language is poetic, and I especially appreciate the feeling of \\"coldness\\" she described. Still, not magical enough to warrant revisiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost optimism","review":"The novel is about a pair of fraternal twins who have been separated for 23 years and have to take down all their barriers to restore their bond emotionally. The reading level is high and uses difficult and flowery words. Also the story is difficult to follow because of the way the author goes back and forth in time so freely not giving much background to the story until the very end. The book is also for more mature readers because of the vivid account of a boy being sexually assaulted, the abuse of many wives, and the incest that goes on in the story. The plot is overall uneventful because of the way the book manoeuvres from memories to present, once you figure out that the story takes place in one day you find the story not fulfilling and has no point. The ending also (because the fate of the characters is also given to us) should have been more optimistic, giving light for a better future, instead the readers already know what happens to the characters so the optimism is lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Small Things","review":"I began reading The God of Small Things expecting another insight into India. However, I found the book to be confusing and never was drawn into the story. Skip this book and move onto Jhump Lahiri's books, Interpreter of Maladies and The Namesake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guh.","review":"The literary equivalent of being soundly thrashed with an olive branch after Sunday services and told to shut up and study your Catechism for the next three hours. I found it impossible to empathise with any of the characters, and all it comes off as is some kind of a ham-fisted, hare-brained attempt at...what? Nobody seems to know, and nothing is resolved. An agonizing, pretentious mess. Do yourself a favour and give this one a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"This could have been a great book.","review":"This could have been a great book. However, it's only a mediocre one. I found Roy's word play springing not so much creativity, but from laziness--especially as she uses the same phrases over and over again. In addition, Roy seemed to take great joy in muddling the timeline. She would go back a forth a day, a few days, a week, a month, and years. Even at the end of the book, I was still slightly confused as to what happened when. HOWEVER, the final chapter was beautifully written and seemed to be almost the work of a different author. This writer was mature, disciplined and willing to open her soul and expose the love and pain within. As a result, this one chapter was much closer to poetry than anything offered in the previous twenty. As I see it, poetry is more a state of mind than a state of words. If Roy can continue to write as she did in the last chapter of The God of Small Things, she will be a great writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for People with Literary Concerns!","review":"good language and all...but if you are looking for a gripping novel this is not it...its focus is mostly on description..frankly I didnt find it so compelling and I don't think i would read it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"poetry and prose meet head on and erupt beautifully","review":"incredible read. true, the plot lacked a bit, but the writing was so mesmorizing i honestly didn't care. the greatest aspect of this novel is how Roy captures the literal thought process of children. what an adult passes by as just another part of a complex world, a child stares at and wonders. this book captures that. its also so innovative. Roy plays with the misinterpretations of communication using the letters themselves to do so. (ex. the nocturnal bird living in the family's factory is a Bar Nowl to the children) read it, if not for any other reason than you've never seen language used in the way she does before"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much cutting and pasting","review":"Like The Celestine Prophecy, here is a trendy bestseller everyone is trying too hard to love. And like The Celestine Prophecy, it just isn't very well written. Ms. Roy shows some definite potential when she just lets her story flow and the characters talk naturally, but too much of the time the prose is cut into bite-size portions that digest way too easily. It sounds like a bad poem written by a nihilistic teenager. The characters get far too annoying too, with Ms. Roy cramming them so full of quirks that you get sick of it. The God of Small Things is occasionally poetic but more often than not ridiculous, contrived, and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good - but flawed - book","review":"I enjoyed The God of Small Things. The characters are brillantly drawn, particularly Baby Kochamma, the atmosphere and flavour of India feel real and the observations on politics, religion and human behaviour are perceptive.I did find the writing somewhat overdone and I feel the author tries to cover too many issues.Read this book and you will enjoy an excellent first novel - but don't expect a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful!","review":"With her \\"The God of Small Things\\", Roy has clearly established herself as one of the great writers of our time. Her compassion, creativity, and great imagination come out on nearly every page. I endorse this book wholeheartedly and it surely deserves every award it has received with more to come! Definitely one not to be missed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit boring and too descriptive","review":"I didn't like this book. The characters are all disturbed and depressing. I hated the way the author used sexual references even when discribing things like flowers and places. I first wanted to read this book because the twins 'Estha and Rahel' interested me. But I soon found that the book dealt with too many other characters and times in peoples lives, which made this book difficult to read and frustrating for me, as I like to understand what I'm reading. There were many references in the book that meant absolutley nothing to me, which added to the confusing nature of this novel. I am probably younger than most other readers of this novel, so I would only reccomend it to an older audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in Translation","review":"I had high hopes for this book when I picked it up. Halfway through this book and I find that I have to force myself to turn the next page. If you love reading interesting and in depth books that you can understand, this is not the book for you. The author's words are a spiral of mumbo jumbo that drags on and on. I often found myself re-reading the same sentence 3 or 4 times in order to grasp the meaning but it never comes. If I had to compare this book to something, I would compare it to a long a strange dream... it doesn't make sense and it's not something you would remember after 5 minutes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern day classic","review":"I cannot wait to reread this book that I had read when it was first published in the early nineties. As I recall, its poetic prose and moving story line are breath taking and troubling, all at once. It's a haunting story that stays with you leaving behind compassion and understanding for those who've suffered great sorrows. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Non linear chronology a bit frustrating, but it works","review":"Written in a non-linear sequence of events, this book truly frustrated me. After the first read, I understood it (as we were suppose to) and if I were inclined to, I would read it a second time and go \\"oooh.\\" I give it four stars mainly because of my personal taste about non-linear chronology, and I didn't see what it had to do with my class (Understanding Religious Traditions in Multicultural America). While religion is a topic in this book, I felt it focused more on class/caste systems and different cultural expectations the characters had. Tragedies are everywhere in this book; I can't find a single happy ending, but the characters are vivid and distinct. Non-South Asians may have a hard time remembering the names at first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Classic","review":"Arundhati Roy's prose is at once organised and distracted, sad and subtly comical, aggressive and slowly gentle. An impressive novel, making full use of the wide reaches of the English language to craft and emulate a whole language strangely its own. Roy breaks down the barriers of grammer, punctuation in the language which only a talented author would be able to achieve. The story seems full of tenderness, care and consideration for the complex themes, emotions and stories she succesfully manages to spin into this 300 odd page tale, from Baby Kochamma's becoming a nun, to Estha's meeting with the \\"Lemonorange\\" man.Remarkably written, albeit slightly over-hyped, this is one book to be remembered as a contemparory classic.Extra kudos to the author for not adding a glossary to her book, the practice of most Asian writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flavor of the Month","review":"Despite its powerful, playful use of language, \\"The God of Small Things\\" was a disappointment. After evoking a certain time and place -- Southern India in the 1960's -- throughout the book, Roy crash-lands into the worst conventions of 1990's creative writing programs. Did the world really need another incest story? I certainly didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't understand the detractors","review":"I would have read this book in one sitting if I had the time. It took a great act of will to put it down, and even then, the words haunted me. I took many a long lunch break to read this.To the critics: yes, what the author describes is often ugly. I think that's partly the point. But what she does so well, so very very well, is find the sublime in even the ugliness.It reminds me of when I was a child. I could be fascinated for hours by playing with mud, or by watching grasshoppers produce their \\"tobacco sauce,\\" as we called it. Ugly things to adults. But to a child, it can be a world of wonder.And as to the much ballyhooed incest: I'd ask you to think a bit more metaphorically. What are twins but two halves of one whole? And what might the union between the two represent?Those who love metaphor, who love symbols, I think will love this book. Those who favor the literal will have a harder time with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much publicised but terribly disappointing.","review":"With much expectations, I started reading this book. To be honest - I found this book is about spit, vomit, carcass and the like. The style of English adopted is extremely irritating. This book leaves no pleasant feelings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"It is unfortunate that she would write a book that caters so totally to the western world. And forget that such things really do not happen in Kerala. The book is full of inconsistancies. The book is jauntily written and it was quite a shame that it was declared to be one of the best books of the year. It shows that there is painfully little good English literature being written these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"A choppy mosaic with no heart","review":"The book reads like an eccentric MTV video withdisparate stream-of-consciousness clips shot at wierd angles and color combinations tailored together incoherently. Many saw \\"brilliance\\" in this mosaic.

The ending so unbelievably terrifying, yet undeniably apppropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dazzling word-play makes up for other minor deficiencies","review":"I was truly impressed by the spectacular word-craft displayed by this first-time author. This and the poignant underpinning concerning the twins more than make up for other deficiencies such as a superficial title, a cliched ending, and playing up to western fantasies of India! All said, hearty kudos for this ambitious author and I personally expect more good stuff from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"vivid images, complex personalities - today's Shakespeare","review":"A must read for the power, beauty and the horror of the human condition.

Estha really tugs at your heart, and Rahel's mental torture is brilliant in its silence. The visual writing style was appealing in its uniqueness. I did have a couple of the proverbial bones to pick with the author - why did the twins have to end up the way they did ? I felt the twins' fate was thought up as a commercialisation, something twisted to attract readers. I felt it was wholly unnecessary. And the use of the word 'laterite' with such relentless and unnecesary frequency irritated me. Why 'laterite'???"},{"rating":"2","title":"The God of Small Things is divine","review":"The God of Small Things by A. Roy is the most beautifully written novel I have ever read.

I definitely regret reading it. I did not enjoy a single page of it, wholeheartedly. Ms. Roy was successful in demeaning every character in her book and every segment of Kerala. May be she has nothing positive to say about life but in reality, even the worst sections of society have some thing nice about them. She managed to offend every section of that society, quite successfully if I might add. Her writing style may be good, in describing the scenes. But one has to ask oneself, what is it I am going to take away after reading this book. Zero. It left me angry as she raped every one of her own characters, mercilessly. I like to look at positives in every negative situation but Ms. Roy took that pleasure away from me. I am sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost interest early","review":"This looks like a book that English teachers would inflict on students because of its \\"brilliant use of language.\\" And while I have to agree that there are some amazing phrases, the bulk of it is filled with overblown prose that adds nothing to the storyline - if you can find the storyline, that is. I got tired of looking, so quit before I got halfway through it. The author wanders down rabbit trails that have nothing to do with the story, and the characters are never developed enough to evoke any concern about what happens to them. I wanted to like this book, I just couldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the damn story?","review":"Roy labours hard to describe events/things...flaunts her mastery of the language profusely...but excuse me where is the damn plot?

In this novel, it got to be almost laughable. Not only do we have the standard issues of alcoholism, child abuse, and indifferent mothers which seem to be in every novel these days, The God of Small Things throws in incest, murder, anti-Christian propaganda, and characters who have no single redeeming quality in their collective little, abused souls. After reading this novel, I wanted to take a shower to remove all the depression and filth it left behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disorganized, sensationalistic first novel.","review":"I am losing faith in the critics.

That is all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and money on this nonsense.","review":"If amazon.com would let me, I'd give this book a rating of ZERO, because it doesn't deserve even one point. This book was a YAWN. The writing is pretentious and irritating. The story is un-compelling and the outcome is obvious from page 1. I don't understand all the hype surrounding this weak piece of garbage. The only reason I bothered to finish it is because I was convinced it had to improve (or rather, I did not want to believe that the entire book could be so bad). Well, I was wrong. This book stinks from cover to cover. There are many excellent books out there to read, so don't bother with this one! The silver lining: If you have trouble falling asleep at night, this book will do the trick. It is an excellent sleeping pill."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book you are sad to finish","review":"The beautiful poetic style of this book hooked me. Craving that moment each chapter where something simple in life is described beautifully. I loved the way the plot was organized. I love that it is based on historical events. Characters are complex. I didn't ask much - I enjoyed the beautiful descriptions of life, the raising of societal themes, and a plot that kept me going. The characters stay strong in my mind and I feel blessed to have read about these characters and have their stories in my minds eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed - and ultimately disappointing","review":"You may be curious to read this award winner which has sold so well. But it is mostly all hype, and ultimately it is a difficult to read, disjointed novel. For anyone who is interested in India, Rohinton Mistry's \\"A Fine Balance\\" is a far superior novel, also an award winner, but delightfully readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most annoying books I've ever read","review":"I had high hopes for this book, having read a few reviews and enjoying books I've read about India in the past. However, the language of metaphors and simililes was WAY overdone and forced and made it difficult to read. The characaters were confusing and annoying also. Don't waste your time, I didn't finish it--- too many good books out there!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While I can appreciate Ms. Roy's use of language (her descriptions of the everyday small things we take for granted were extraordinary) I found the story confusing and dull. If you want to read mystical realism with language that sings and soars like an aria with compelling plot as well - try Garbriel Garcia Marquez' \\"100 years of Solitude\\" or \\"Love in the Time of Cholera.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written book","review":"Arundhati roy has written an excellent book. The story is setin Kerala. All the characters are well defined and are brought tolife. The language is simple and the reader is taken on a emotional roller coaster. The book is a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"impressive prose, but no connection","review":"The writer is talented, certainly, and her prose is amazing. She is perceptive, and has wonderful descriptive passages and insights. However, there was something missing -- something big and necessary. I could not bring myself to really care and be in any way emotionally invested in any of the characters. There was so much darkness, sadness, tragedy, and just plain ugliness in the novel, with not enough beauty and redemption to make it worth struggling through all the darkness. If you're going to drag me through all this nastiness, loss, and depravity, you've got to give me something more to hold onto than these characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeously Written First Novel","review":"So much has already been said about Arundhati Roy's debut novel; years later, it is still widely discussed for its fresh and complex prose and easy movement between the past and present culminating into somewhat of a mystery novel. Sadness and mysticism are rampant in this book which reminds us of the inherent trauma of tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE CONTENT!!!","review":"I can not believe that a brilliant individual would write such a nauseating, heart wrenching, terrible book. Our book club chose this book-only two of us suffered enough to finish it. After which we all put the book in the trash, where it belongs. It would be nice to read something that Ms. Roy wrote that wasn't filled with all the horrible things of this world-all which happen to be in the same book.

The writer kept going off on tangents and never quite got back to the circle of her story. The language was pretentious and the sentence *velvet over sandpaper\\" to describe a *calloused* hand touching a nipple, made me want to laugh. I had my eyebrows risen through out the book and if there was a story I couldn't see it. Maybe I am not an intellectual person and that's why the book seemed to be hanging on the tenous threads of bombastic language and description. I will pass on Roy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The God of Small Things","review":"The author had a knack for vividly describing scenes throughout the book. Unfortunately she relied too often on using mention of gross images to paint her pictures. Also, the storyline seemed to ramble on without any purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, naive, and oh-so-sweet","review":"This book should have been called \\"The God of Overwritten, Underanalyzed Things\\". The writing is so poor I actually put the book down and started to laugh several times (at passages that were NOT supposed to be funny). The Indian style of word play and the special mode of dialogue wielded so masterfully by truly talented writers like Rushdie, in Roy's unskilled hands simply comes off as cloying and immature. I felt, throughout, that I'd mistakenly picked up a Young Adult novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, disturbing","review":"Slow and depressing, I kept turning the pages expecting more.

If I wasn't so interested in the ''incest'' factor I would have left it all together. The book goes back and forth - present to past and back so many times - and that gets really annoying and you sort of figure everything out even before it's been said.The writing is a little annoying too - I can sort of see why it may be considered ''artistic'' but the whole thing kinda left me feeling that the award was given to the writer because she is an Indian writing about an Indian family, so it seems ''authentic''. Not fair! This book certainly doesn't deserve it.It was - mildly put - boring!And yes - what was the point of this story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Booker Prize or not, it ain't enough to keep me reading","review":"I'm a very big fan of Rohinton Mistry and was hoping this effort by another Indian writer living in Canada might be similar in quality. It isn't. After just 20 pages, I was struggling to figure out what the plot might be, who was related to whom, and mainly, why I should care about any of the characters. After 40 pages .... I gave up. The writing isn't good enough to carry the book. The style jumps from literary to casual modern to just plain unpolished and rhythm-free. The characters are uncompelling. There isn't much of a story. Roy has a long way to go to match Mistry. I can't understand how this won the Booker Prize."},{"rating":"1","title":"My First Amazon Problem Ever","review":"Unfortunately, I have yet to receive this item.

The language used is absolutely childish and maybe readers understand abused usage of English lingo. I would say, and I know that Booker Prize is very controversial. There is one South African Writer who keeps getting this politicized so called prize. Anyway she failed as a screenwriter and learned the ropes of getting a Booker and in the process made her a millionare. I'm sorry even Kindergarten kids laugh at the sentence structure, syntax, world play---which one reviewer calls \\"Jazzy\\".It sure is Jazzy as no good writer can write so badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad,bad,bad,bad really bad","review":"This the worst book i have ever read. made me sick to my guts. i can't believe anyone could reward this effort. total waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This nonsense won the Booker Prize?!","review":"I found this to be one of the worst books I have read in a long time, and I am an avid book reader. I truly cannot comprehend how this nonsense could have won the Booker Prize. The writing style is awful, at best and the main characters horrible, little children. Someody once told me that the Booker Prize was all political and not necessarily based on the ability of the writer. After reading this I believe it! Really don't waste your time buying this. I hope with the money she earned from this, politically active Ms Roy will take writing classes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It had potential, but failed to deliver","review":"I thougnt that there were many good ideas and themes emerging from the story, but that none were developed. I finished the book wondering if I was missing the next few hundred pages. I don't recommend this book at all. Not only is the story unsatisfiying, but the writing style is extremely annoying as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent lyrical prose","review":"this book is excellent not because of the plot nor because of the story. it is excellent, rather, because it is a lyrical masterpiece. the language shimmers with beauty. the entire book is a beautiful, intricate poem. i was slightly disappointed that there was no story per se but the writing was so good that i had to forgive the lack of story. it is an excellent read if you are looking for poetic writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"All glitter, little gold.","review":"Roy can write. She can make up new words. She can construct interesting metaphors and new turns of phrase. However, instead of using her skilfull language in the service of ideas and narrative, the novel seems to be largely a device by which the author self-consciously demonstrates her genius to the gallery. I get the feeling that the primary response is expected to be that the reader is to fall at the feet of a new literary titan and worship.As for the substance of the novel: it seems less of a novel than a short story bulked up on the steroid of flashiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woah!","review":"This was just amazing! Absolutely amazing! The poetry of her words is so powerful. I took the time to hold each word in my hand, such precious gems are not found often. Woah!

I think that is why many of us read it here becoz there was so much publicity given to it. I found it hard to remember the names of the characters and consequently did not know who was who while i read the book. pb"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard, clever, but ultimately stilted and tedious.","review":"The plot, echoing Akira Kurosawa's classic movie Rashomon in its revealing layer by layer the plot is very cleverly done, but, since this provides the main bulk of the novel, it lacks any real plot. This means it becomes thumb-twiddlingly tedious at times. The characters remain permanently unlikable, and the deaths become a welcome relief from the tedium. The Indian-English is somewhat stilted, and the short sentences can become confusing and excessively complex (at least when you begin), but, while clearly very rich and lyrical, it eventually decends into soapy trash. Good try, but no cigar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lived up to the hype. No, seriously.","review":"I rarely enjoy books that everyone else \\"loves.\\" The Namesake is an excellent example...This book was just brilliant however...the writing, the structure, the setting, the characters...I wish Roy would spend more time writing fiction and a little less in the world of politics.I have nothing to add that the hundreds of reviewers haven't already said...just a brilliant book, maybe not for those with short attention spans...or, you know, dumb people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good literary writing, weak development","review":"The book was written very well. The storyline was a lttile weak. I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters. There were none that I hated or loved. I felt the writer could have said the same thing in a less pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review: THe God of Small Things","review":"(I am a University graduate, and I want kids under 13 or any age for that matter, to read this review) THis book is honestly the worst experience I have encountered in my 26 years of reading. With a major in English and literature, this book is by far the most tedious novel ever written. It describes trivial, insignificant things such as dirt on the ground and organisms under the ground that beats your slight interest for this book to death. The title \\"The God of Small Things\\" indeed does speak for itself. With descriptions to a microscoptic level, this book is both extremely mind-numbing and montonous. I would like readers of this review to read the book and find my points substantial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"Like so many others before me, by the time I stubbornly finished this book I didn't give a damn about a single character (maybe Velutha). In fact, I was so tired of the whole lot of them that I wished them ill! I was upset with myself that I didn't give up on this book after my second try. This book is a short story on steroids; freakishly larger than it should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just say no","review":"I sincerely applaud anyone who can get through the first chapter of this book without falling asleep. Even my professor who assigned the book--a Stanford professor, if that means anything--admitted that it took him several months to get through the first chapter. Every sentence seems to be so profound that the whole book just dissolves into absurdity. If books that are needlessly complex and satiated with metaphors (see, I'm infected) appeal to you, have a ball. Garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"So disappointed in Roy's first book. What exactly was the point? -- did she actually think describing in detail the horrendous conditions in India would hold our interest throughout the book. Set the scene but get on with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good story awkwardly written","review":"It was very difficult to keep track of the characters and their relationships. If it weren't I had to finish it for a book club discussion I would have stopped reading it. Even though the story is compelling I found the writing style annoyingly and unnecessarily confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the story but the telling","review":"An odd tale, but told with a style all it's own. Somewhat reminiscent of Rushdie and with a descriptive power equal to Steinbeck. Definitely not Hollywood film material (I hope they don't attempt it). If this author plans a second book it had better be good or it will be bound to dissapoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"a cure for chronic insomniacs","review":"This book was written keeping a western audience in mind. An audience that would buy anything Indian and exotic.'The God of Small Things' is both with a dose of pseudo madness. This book is quite pretensious. It is more a statement than a serious book. Roy's 'style' is overdone and she's out to prove something and leave an impression, that's why the style takes over and there is nothing in the plot or characterisation to sustain one's interest. I had a hard time reading the book and I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waffling into tedium","review":"I'm beginning to the think the Booker Prize is the best reason NOT to buy a book. The God of Small Things didn't do it for me at all. I found it dull and affected. As another reviewer remarked, the similes are endless and, although they might sound good, for the most part are simply off target. Overrated tedium is perhaps the best way to sum up this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hype isn't sufficient","review":"This is a difficult book. This is a mindblowing, awe-inspiring, masterpiece of a novel. Much of the critiism it receives stems solely from the fact that people do not have the patience for its complexity. But it is inspiring, shattering, and brilliantly presented. A must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Charming Novel","review":"India has always seemd like an exotic, chaotic place to me. After reading this book, it has become more real; a country populated by people not that different from myself. Their ambitions, heartbreaks, and loves will be recognizable to almost anyone. I rarely find a book so riveting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Interesting First Novel","review":"If you like fast-paced literature, then you probably won't like this book. If you like to linger and savor beaded words, then you'll probably enjoy this story. I read that A. Roy did not edit this book. It was a first draft. I must say that whatever energy the author was trying to capture, she succeeded masterfully. This is the type of book that hits you a few days after reading it. It makes you think about the small details, and the sensory sentences that just doesn't leave you alone. Some people hated the ending. Even A. Roy was taken to court because of those last pages for allegedly violating indecency laws in India. I have to say that the last chapter was quite memorable and appropriate. It went beyond the laws of society, and the laws of most literary ending. It ended in ecstasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced, Overhyped and Over the Top","review":"William Faulkner and Yoknapatawpha, Thomas Hardy and Wessex, R.K.Narayan and Malgudi... and now, Roy and her Ayemenem. The difference is that Ayemenem actually exists, though its natives prefer to spell it slightly differently. The quaint little town, the stereotyped characters, the prose that is a shade too purple, all seem a calculated attempt at taking ethnic chic to the masses (in this case, eager foreigners). Of course, the book is successful. If clever wordplay and a minimal understanding of the social milieu can contribute to the making of a truly great novel, this has to be it. However, it seems to be a one-off effort and it is doubtful whether Roy can repeat her success."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Colossal Disappointment","review":"As a PhD student of literature and a lover of Indian literature in particular, I was very excited to finally find time to peruse this novel. While I understand that this book is critically acclaimed, I was extremely disappointed and actually dropped the book at page 270. Simply put, what could have been a great story gets lost in the author's attempt at fancy poesy and artfulness. Roy is about as far from straight forward as one can get. I kept hoping that if I continued to read on, I would hit pay dirt, but it never happened. The story gets lost under a mound of fanciful junk. I have only put down a handful of books in my lifetime without finishing them, and when I have, it was because the attempt to finish became futile because the interest simply ceased to exist.If you want to read a great book about Indian life, choose anything by Rohinton Mistry...you won't be disappointed. Thrity Umrigar and Padma Viswanathan are also noteworthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through it...","review":"I've tried on several occasions to read this and just couldn't get through. I found it slow and tedious, and just couldn't get invested in the characters or the plot (whatever the plot was, since it didn't really seem like there was one). After reading all these great reviews though, I must be missing something..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The God of Small Things","review":"Beautifully written and refreshingly different. The writing was very visual with characters that stay with you long after you've finished the book. For people who love prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult to get into, but well worth persevering","review":"I found this book difficult to read the first time round. The clever writing style, moving backwards and forwards in time and the unfamiliar Indian names made it a challenge. But having read it once I have kept going back for more, it is so cleverly written you glean more and more every time you re-read it. A very sad and moving book, highlighting the Indian class system and it's injustices. If you are having doubts as to whether to finish it or give up on the way, I would recommend you persevere as it really is a very satisfying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal, well written","review":"Arundhati Roy's use of language and structure is incredible. If you are looking for beautiful writing and complex, sophisticated structure, this is the book for you. It is not, however, a happy or even an especially hopeful book; this is a book about the bad things that happen to good people, exploring both interpersonal conflict and the bigger social and political issues that influence it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant Tedium","review":"I tried. God, I tried. After 50 pages, I sampled near the end of the book. The same.So I did it. I gave up on her. The author can write stunningly - but she writes as if answering one question: Just how clever and expressive can I be? She writes as if the storyline is only a tease for her 'where the hell is this going' descriptions.It made me want to go home and kick the dog.Update Autumn 2007: I picked it up this summer again and I finished the damn thing. I am stubborn sometimes.My assessment stands. A lot of work for little reward. This is a great book if you are never going to die - but for average readers who must account for their time, there are too many other excellent books whose authors write with the reader in mind, keeping them within a traceable arc of our common journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"Read it when your soul is quiet. Pick this book up when your life isn't too tumultous or else you will miss some of the gentle and nuanced pleasures of this book. Enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say more....","review":"This was one of the very few English books I read. And it was an amazing experience. Such fluid poetic language and such rythm. The relationship between the twins is just beutifully portrayed. I cannot but stop thinking that this is some way related to things that happned really. But so what? How many of us can write about real things so wonderfully? What more, can I add, just read this book when you can, and be slightly patient, you will never regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise and prose","review":"A wonderfully written book. Whilst it starts slowly the momentum builds to a terrible crescendo. Not many authors can pull off a tragedy but God of small things is one of those books that does."},{"rating":"2","title":"A battle between passion and the fetters or society... truely magnificiant","review":"I am an Non-Resident Indian reviewing the novel and I believe the novel draws upon the dark element of discrimination that still dwells in Indian society. Having lived in both India and Singapore, I can really relate to the issues of discrimination that are honestly portraited in this novel. I also loved the poetic language Roy uses to portray her characters and their conflicts. However I have to admit that, at times, the novel becomes a bit draggy; nevertheless it is an amazing depiction of passion and humanity. Thumbs up to Roy."},{"rating":"2","title":"emotional rollercoaster","review":"For someone attempting to understand the limitations of love in the asian sub-continent this is a must read. Instead of giving a superficial account, Ms. Roy delves into the frustration of an emotionally restricted society, where too much is taboo. This is an extremely honest portrayal and a true eye-opener. Ms. Roy is a master storyteller and her metaphorical use of the English language is matched by few. Sheer poetry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful use of language, just too much of it","review":"I love a good simile and metaphor as much as the next person, but this was a serious case of what my writing class teacher used to call \\"over egging the pudding\\"; too much richness makes you nauseous, like a small child eating too many sweets at a birthday party. There! I'm doing it myself! I think the word \\"like\\" must be the commonest word in this book. Each individual simile or metaphor was breathtaking and original (mostly.. some were totally out of place like \\"silence climbing the bathroom walls like Spiderwoman\\") but together it was all just too much and slowed down the pace of the story. This author would be better occupied as a poet. There she can give full expression to as many metaphors and similes as she likes. They are way overdone in this self indulgent work. I can't even comment on the core story because it was obscured by the language used to tell it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting for more...","review":"Impossible to put down. It draws you in with an ending and you are compelled to plow forward through the past to understand how the ending was created. Lyrical, passionate, and ultimately heart-wrenching. Arundhati Roy has exposed the reality of the human spirit - innocent imperfection - and I am patiently waiting for her to deliver a second novel in which to fall in love with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very average and is universal.","review":"The book talks of a particular community. The problem is that similar situations occur in all societies. It is an expanded version of the book by Ms. Mathai on marriages which describes of how a mother attempts to arrange a marriage match. So don't get too excited by the book under discussion."},{"rating":"2","title":"small things loom large in the eyes of children","review":"This book's brilliance was to be found in its characterisation of the children. The language was a child's language - the labelling of events, the repetition of words to form a mantra, the formation of new words through misunderstanding... and it was the language of memories - the continual return to well-worn phrases which become signposts back to the stories they contain; the moulding of thought by memory so that small things take on a significance they would never hold for the casual observor. What we have is a child's eye view which finds all events, big or small, looming large. To read this book is to remember what it is to be a child, to be powerless, but at the same time, to be the cause of big events and small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing....","review":"I had high expectations for this book: the reviews were great and it won the Booker Prize. I was disappointed. The book had only a few good moments. I admit that Roy did a good job with some descriptive passages. It wasn't enough to make this a good book. Throughout the story, all the characters remained unlikeable. While I understand that they were caught in a cultural web not of their making, none of the characters was able to break free. The literary devices employed by Roy served as a distraction rather than an enhancement of this story. Also, Roy's disjointed writing style was extremely annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Must Read for people who have nothing better to do","review":"The veritable hosannas for The God of Small Things from yourExpert Editor seem to me inexplicable. Going through the novel, Ifound it to contain wierd imageries, eccentric phrases and an absolute lack of direction. It is a novel that meanders on like the Ganges, directionless and more than a little sullied.It appears to be the product of an infantile imagination which gets sidetracked every so often and is unable to deal effectively with the novel as an art as well literary form. The staple diet of a hyper-educated,post-Woodstock generation, which no doubt attains the same glorious,if temporary,nirvana from this novel as the hippies did from more mundane substances, this novel is best avoided by the rest, who wish to preserve their sanity of mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it over yet?","review":"After reading so many wonderful reviews of this book, I thought I had to read it. The book started out slowly and it was really fractured in the sense that it jumped to the present then to the past, then to something completely unrelated to the plot at that time. I thought it was a quirky way to present the story but went along with it because I expected it to turn into this amazing story that I heard so many reviews say it was. I tried, but never got there. After reading almost halfway through the book, I simply couldn't take it anymore. It was so incredibly boring, confusing, and filled with events that weren't even connected in any way that I couldn't take it anymore. I gave up. There's only been a handful of books I could not read from beginning to end, and this is one of them. I gave it a chance to grow and see the characters develop, thrive, etc, but it never happened. I wish I could have my time back so I could have spent it on more worthy books."},{"rating":"1","title":"a battle to read","review":"I feel as if I've lost a battle when I can't finish a book but this one I put down after 2/3rds of the way through. I had little empathy for any of the characters and felt removed from scenes as if I was watching from a dark hallway...one filled with filth and obnoxious smells. A number of reviewers commented on Roy's magical style of writing...so what if it doesn't get to the point.Read Lahiri instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than a Novel - A Work of Art","review":"I was disappointed in what other critics had to say about Roy's novel. In response to \\"The God of Small Things\\" being a novel and therefore about story-telling: it is not only a novel; it is a work of art. The language, poetry. The layers of memory that unfold the story, beauty. True, it could be a bit confusing for some readers, but it only takes attentiveness and a passion for language to get through it. I definitely recommend this for someone who enjoys poetry, magic, and interpretive meaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I missed something","review":"My friend gave me this novel to borrow because of its \\"beautiful language.\\" I started reading it about six months ago and have about 40 pages left with no intention of finishing. To be blunt, this book rambles incessantly. Relationship scenes are more creepy than touching, it's hard to even care about the fate of the characters. The novel winds in and out of so many multiple page metaphors that it's easy to forget what the point was in the first place. I found myself rolling my eyes at ridiculous wording, especially when it was completely irrelevant to the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic characters, awful story.","review":"Could not get into this book.

Somehow thearchitecture and construction cloud the vision and prevent it fromtouching the reader's heart. This is ironic, for the flap says Ms. Roy is an architect by training.What I found frustrating was that I could never get close to the key characters and start to feel for them. Why? Because Ms. Roy continually interrupts, striving to look brilliant herself. This she does using a staccato, ostensibly emotional, style of writing, seemingly endless and trying nature commentary, a flood of parenthetical observations (too many of them, really... RE-A-LLY) and unwarranted capitaLIZations. These divert your attention from the plot and consume your energies away from the poor souls that inhabit her vision.But then, we have to commend Ms. Roy for her accomplishment - getting a book published, much the same way we salute anyone who gets a PhD.

It holds a hint of sarcasm surrounded by immense sadness. It brings you to a level of feeling where you fell unhappy but can't express it. Through Ammu, Roy explores the position of women in South Asia that fall off the marraige boat. Ammu's dislocation in society, how she is often pitied but never helped. Her love for an untouchable. It's all very touching and expressful. If you're bored of all the this happened first and that happened second, you should definitely read this book. My favorite personal favorite was how Ammu often feared her son's turning into another \\"male chauvinistic pig\\". but it is very depressing, so ignore it if you're already in the blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly scented","review":"The author gets credit for a heartfelt tale but I found the writing so overwrought and flowery. So much so that it detracted from the story.I'm all for metaphors but this book trys too hard with a barrage of wordage. A perfect example of more is less. Sorry, I wished I could have liked this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Stomach Wrenching and Insipid","review":"The style of this writing is uncreative and nearly drives the reader to insanity. Roy tries to pull off some sort of Pulp Fiction plot with the time frame jumping all over the place and making the novel difficult to want to follow. Her attempt to replicate the thought patterns of children is childish and a dismal failure in itself. I've never been more dissatisfied with a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Master of Language, Terrible at storytelling","review":"There is no dispute about it, the book is beautifully written in a very poetic language. But Roy is terrible at telling the story and portraying characters. Other than the general image of sadness and tradegy, the book offers nothing more than a superficial exotic shadow. This is a major Booker disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it!","review":"I loved this book. Really the type of book that changes you. The story and the characters and the prose become part of you. So finishing the book feels like a loss. Beautifully written. It is poetry. I found the book to be laugh out loud funny sometimes and also deeply, deeply sad. Read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My thoughts","review":"I did not enjoy this book. I judge a book, partially, by the distractions of the author's writing style and errors. This book is one distraction after another. I had great difficulty keeping track of the story line. The characters were not admirable or intriguing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal with this book ?","review":"I must say, I can't understand the hype about this book. Boy, Was I disappointed. Big time. The book just never did hook me into wanting to finish it. I couldn't care less about the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was lost!","review":"Arundhati Roy wrote a very interesting story and has a good command of the language. Unfortunately, I was lost in the stream-of-consciousness style of writing. She jumped from person-to-person much like Virginia Woolf, without using the Woolfian sentence structure. If that's not difficult enough, I had to unravel the chronology. She jumps between two different time periods and often jumps again within the same time period. It made for a confusing mess, to say the least. Nonetheless, the plot lines are solid and the writing itself is solid.If you understand Indian culture or have been to India, you would probably get a lot out of this book. If you have no interest in India, feel free to skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"It really is amazing how good this book is. I highly recommand it to everone, who loves to dive into the world of this family for some days, because I am sure, that once started you will finish it quite easily. Even now, one month after finishing it I surprise myself still thinking about this fascinating language and about the choice of words Arundathi Roy uses sometimes. Although it is located in India, to be more precise in Kerala - the place does not matter - this story could even be that of your neighbour, because you will discover that India is nearer than you thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"A prime example of poor literature and good marketing","review":"This is the typical novel that makes the reader wonder how on earth it ever made it to the best seller list? Was it Oprah? Roy does what so many other \\"artsy\\" writers try to do. She uses abstract metaphors to relay some weak message. Gimme a break. A good writer doesn't have to confuse the reader to send across a quality theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"sparse, falsely arty","review":"Being a big fan of Indian and Asian writings, I approached this book with a lot of enthusiasm and energy. However soon I found my interest waning. For Arundhati begins well but starts floundering by page 5. I started getting the feeling that the author suddenly discovered that she was onto a big book and wanted to make it arty as possible. So the story suddenly goes to the backseat. And in come gross and showy phrases. As someone said earlier this became style over substance. A simple story about twins in Kerala suddenly became complicated, complex and confusing. It is in parts an autobiography. In others just jumble of images and words. Sure there are signs of talent here and there. But, nothing warrants the hype. In fact some of the scenes inserted seem specifiaclly designed to show the critics that this is art and not plain story telling. For this false pretense I am tempted to give this one star..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title is the best part of the book","review":"If you enjoy repeated phrases (e.g., \\"fountain in a Love-In-Tokyo\\"), overused metaphors, and capitalized words in the Middle Of Sentences For Effect, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, rest assured that the title really is the best part of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book, like all great ones, is intensely personal","review":"I first read this book in 1997. Today, after 4 years and countless re-reads (and esp after reading some of the negative reviews in here, I owe it to the author I think) here is my observation: Arundhati Roy wrote this book for herself. We are just incidental readers. Some say that people destined to be writers (or those allowed a glimpse into the dark depths of life through circumstance) have just one story to narrate. Every time I read this book, I can't shake the feeling that she had tears in her eyes while she wrote this story - the one that was her destiny to tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly Amazing; Seductive,/a new voice for India.","review":"I have read this book twice, savouring every word and nuance. This book is seductive, exilerating and tragic. Coming from an Indian/Parsi family I am familiar with how twisted family life can be, especially for a women. I praise Ms Roy for her creative genius and her boldness, in narrating this enormous saga of family life and all the secrets that take place in a 'hush-hush' manner. Well done, Girl! This is slow reading. Every word has to be savoured and digested. I look forward to her other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story and characters; often mannered writing","review":"I am going to weigh in very briefly on this book. It has a great story, but it is marred by Arundhati Roy's too frequent displays of mannerism. Many of the characters are very original and the story is full of credible twists and turns, but every thirty pages or so, Ms. Roy lapses into several pages of writing in apretentious stream-of-conscience/surreal style that soon had me skimming toward the next section of narrative substance. Ms. Roy must have felt that she needed to show off how well she could write, but she ended up underscoring the fact that this was her first novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A picturesque and verdant imagery of innocence and guilt.","review":"There is a wonderful description of the beautiful land that is Kerala in India, and a provocative narrative style that is quite forceful.Yes, one has to be patient in absorbing the images as they form.The picturseque view of the verdant landscape of the village is enticing.The story has to be painted in the canvas of your mind, to really enjoy the interwoven patterns of abstractions which children can conjure up and the prejudices of the adult society of India.If you are looking for a book to read after say Equal Music by Vikram Seth, this could be the book for you.As you start reading this book you are immersed in nostalgia,led back to those emotions and feelings of your childhood and the inner conflicts with the world built by the adults around you.If Picasso was to review the book, he would have compared it to his famous work Guernica."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"I bought this book because everyone in my book club loved it. I am now the outcast. I did not get it. I never even could finish reading it. I do believe this was the first book I have not finished. I found it to be boring and confusing. I do believe I would try to read other books by Arundhati Roy, just as long as they are not like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intricate and exquisitely detailed.","review":"I must admit, I was rather confused in the beginning, but Ms. Roy has a fascinating way of piecing together a compelling story in a unique way. Her details were breathtaking and left nothing to the imagination. I truly felt as if I were right there, with Estha and Rahul. It not only revealed beautiful imagery of that region in India, but it was also a lesson on one aspect of Indian politics. There was so much to be learned. And by the end of the novel, I was left feeling satisfied that I had learned all there was to know about Estha and his muteness, and Rahul's hesitation in love. A tragic yet tender story. This reader will definitely be waiting for Ms. Roy's next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A well-meaning case of the vapors","review":"There are many people in this story, many smells, sights, sounds, traumatic events, nonsense words, distortions of time and perception, confusing paragraphs that require re-reading, -- all in the service of a James Michener-type of family saga that illustrates the sad-but-true dictum that talented people (or untalented, for that matter) can be so screwed up by lack of nurturance that they are essentially crippled for life. There is heartbreak and sadness and inconsolable pain in these characters' lives. But unfortunately, Roy's clutter-it-up approach interferes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable therapy without the long flight!","review":"As an earlier reviewer pointed out \\"The God of Small Things\\" has many curious parallels of setting with the wonderful \\"The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years\\" by Richard Patton. Both books visit and reveal similar regions in India and both have wonderful spiritual revelations. If you enjoy long hot baths with a good book, you need look no further. Ideally you would have Patton's book on one side of the bath and Roy's book on the other. Your choice of the poetic Arundhati Roy or the revelatory Richard Patton is the only decision you would have to make. That having been decided, you would be eased into a dimension where sweet smelling sand and exotic spices vied with compelling dialogue. - And it's far cheaper than a return flight to India!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a little too much of a good thing","review":"This book almost lived up to all the hype it has been receiving lately. The language is indeed beautiful and wonderful. In fact, I found myself rereading passages several times just to savor the words and how they were put together. The storytelling, in its disjointed, spiraling style, is equally intriguing and impressive. Characters are created that may never leave your memory. And I loved this book, except for the final couple of chapters (the ones after the story of the twins' mother and the god of small things is pretty much resolved) with their slapped-on feel, which forsake the magical language structure and vague (in a good sense) narrative style of the first 90% of the book for a tabloid style (in a bad sense) that seems out of place, both in terms of time and artistry, with the rest of this fine book. So, definitely read this book, but skip the last two chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow - not enjoyable","review":"This book was incredibly hard to follow and very difficult to read. I usually enjoy Booker prize winners but not this one! I do not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story but for the words!","review":"I nearly gave up at the first couple of chapters .... I just could not get into this book, which I had the misfortune to take along on vacation. What I understood throughout the first half is that Sophie Mol dies. Then we look forward to the climax of her death but alas it is lost among childish phrases repeated meaningless sentences & you think to yourslef when you finish the book: Oh why did I even bother!The writing is extremely pretencous with no taste at all, the reader is completely ignored through refernces to things utterly indian & are a mystery to most. The plot is lost in the book & it's not even a good one at that!If you want to read about India, try Rohinton Mistry's A Fine Balance.My advice to you about this stupid pretencous book is DON'T BOTHER!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Need an annotated version . . .","review":"This book has amazing metaphors and the ability to help the adult reader remember what it used to be like to think as a child. That being said, I found this book extremely difficult to read. The \\"plot\\", such as it is, continually and abruptly moves from one time frame to another. I understand the \\"stream of conciousness\\" concept, but some streams are very difficult to flow with and follow. Also, the author uses so many terms from India that this reader wished for a glossary in the back in order to understand what was being described. For someone who is not familiar with East Indian culture, it was very difficult to make sense of just what the author was refering to in many passages. I read for enjoyment and this book was just too impressionistic to be an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudo-intellectual","review":"I consider this book the written version of modern art's \\"big yellow dot\\". In any modern art museum you'll find a large black canvas with nothing but a big yellow dot on it. No matter what obtuse meaning pseudo-intellectuals ascribe to that painting, it remains that it's no more than a big yellow dot.\\"God of Small Things\\" is the written equivalent. It will no doubt continue to be popular in some circles as some readers ascribe deep meaning to its confusing plot lines and verbiage. But deep in my heart I believe the vast majority of people are saying (if only under their breath), \\"Why in the world did I read this book?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"frankly disappointing and difficult","review":"Look friends, I exactly am not dumb! Infact I got myself a masters from Kansas to prove that. But this book frankly left me puzzled and scared. Scared bcos if I admit to the world that I could not find it interesting people will call me dumb. And I ain't a dumbo... Anyway here I am tryin to be frank at the cost of my reputation. Yeah man this book takes a lot of PATIENCE! And it ain't the best story book in town.

But somewhere along the line the author got trapped in language. There is an overuse of phrases and a lack of clarity in them;I'm not aways sure what she's writing about. Obscure and mysterious are fine (after all whose life is so clear) but not when they obscure the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhythm","review":"I am shocked to read all the nasty comments that you can find on this page. I suspect that some of these critics have a tin ear for prose and don't hear what they're reading. Ms. Roy can stretch or cut a phrase like a sax player can bend a note (damn simile) and she 's got rhythm. No amount of whining about whether she deserves her prize or not can change these facts. The story unveils itself at its own pace, engaging all the senses along the way. Not having read Salmon Rushdie, I can't speak to his influence on Roy's writing, but I felt the shadow of Garc��a M��rquez, especially in terms of the lightness of imagination and the weight of family history. Perhaps we're all a bit tired of these kinds of family tragedies in today's fiction, but with talent at this level I can stand a few more."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I came to this book with great hopes as it had been praised by so many. I came to it on a real high after reading Rumpole's Last Case and the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night, both of which I really enjoyed. I found myself growing annoyed with this book almost immediately after I began reading it. Some of the prose is quite beautiful, but much of the time I felt it just got in the way. I don't mind long complex sentences, but I found myself skipping entire paragraphs here. Too many of her words and sentences seemed like needless window dressing and the small insights they proffered seemed inadequate for the effort it took to get them. I hate to give up on a book once I have started it, but this one is really trying my patience. I am about three-quarters of the way through, but there are many other books beckoning me that I think might be more rewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the story?","review":"The book was basically 90% descriptive and 10% story. I don't like reading a 10 page description of a flower. But, maybe that's just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthwhile","review":"I highly recommend that this book be avoided. I read it on the recommendations that I saw here and heard in person. It is not very interesting. The main characters are so steeped in abuse that they are almost unbelievable. The title mislead me to believe that if I made it to the end, there would be something positive after all the tragedy that occurs, but there was only more tragedy and dispair."},{"rating":"1","title":".... please.","review":"I had to read this book for school, which might be part of the reason I found it to be so bad. Usually, I'll read anything and most of the time won't have any complaints about it. I don't understand how this book won the Booker Prize. Many praise the language Ms. Roy uses; I found it to be annoying. She writes in sentence fragments. This book is a frame story and the reader already knows what will happen. The problem is that she doesn't give the reader reason to care about the characters enough to read on so I spent most of the book struggling to get through chapter after chapter of pointless description and local color. In retrospect, there wasn't really much activity in this book, just a lot of rambling and multiple descriptions of characters' pasts that got repetative quite quickly.I gave this book two stars instead of one because I believe that, in the future, Ms. Roy may produce something less devoid of emotion. But perhaps I am being optimistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful and Positive","review":"This book is up to date, fairly unbiased, and very complete. It looks at adoption as it is happening now, with a very modern look at all of the different types of adoptions that exist today, from the closed records of old time to the many new open adoptions, and the stages that both the adoptive parents and the adoptees go through. I found it to be very helpful, and if you are a prospective adoptive parent or an adoptee, it will touch on many of the issues that are inherent to this situation. I would recommend it over \\"Lost & Found\\" by Betty Jean Lifton, which I also bought, but which in my opinion was biased, somewhat negative, and more centered on adoptions that were originated long ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Band on Earth","review":"I think Me first and the gimme gimmes is the best band on earth,because they covered many songs and make them better.

This is a book best suited to readers 9-10 years of age. Why did Jean Rabe get the contract to write this??????"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book deserves no stars.","review":"Okay all you who think this book is semi to really good, read it again and tell me what you think. This book is incredibly dumb, boring and to top it off, it screws up the famous characters that Weis and Hickman created and who we fell in love with. My suggestion is to skip this series (or if you read it) go on to Weis and Hickmans' \\"Great repair on Rabes trajedy\\" Dragons of the Fallen Sun. This book basically points out that the New age stories are a Crock of bull and trys to repair the damage done by the butcher of Dragonlance Jean Rabe. Dont spend your money on this book. Stay with the Legends wies And hickman."},{"rating":"1","title":"I stopped reading DL after this book","review":"Initially, I was glad to see that the DL dynasty would not die with \\"Dragons of Summer Flame,\\" but now I think the series should have ended there. Instead, we have been left with an airport novel which tries to borrow from Classical literature (gee, I think I've seen that tempest scene a few dozen times), but instead becomes quite dull. Rabe's writing is pedestrian and lacks the oomph that other writers lent to the series. The book is readable, but never conveys the background of despair against which this story is set."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of an add on book then a 'main' plot","review":"Characters were unoriginal. Oh my gosh! Dhamon is a knight of Takhisis, what a surprise!?!? The kender was a poor man's Tasslehoff. The pirates?? disgusting characters..really..which cause you to sometimes think you're watching an episode of Hercules: the Legendary Journeys. Also, Palin was a complete and utter disappointment. He was supposed to be such a great character but became nothing more than a peon in the 5th Age. All the characters were poorly developed, cliche and boring. Rabe tries to make the characters unique like the kender with the glove, but doesn't succeed at all. Where's Raistlin, Tanis and Sturm when you need them? The plot is dreadful and boring. Even Weiss and Hickman's Chronicles weren't that great, they were interesting at least with characters such as Raistlin. But 5th Age? Give it a try, but dont' expect another Dragons of Autumn Twilight"},{"rating":"1","title":"This could have been so much better.","review":"I read this and I was disapointed, the feel was wrong Palin was wrong and the Kender were wrong.

The plot is shallow, poorly developed, choppy and uncreative, the characters are poorly developed and lack that special something that makes you love and remember them. The characters carried over from previous \\"Dragonlance\\" books (i.e. Palin Majere, Goldmoon, Usha, etc.)(written by Wies and Hickman) are unture to their nature. Jean Rabe lacks creativity, and in my opinion should go back to high school to take an english course. There are so many mistakes in the book! And sometimes whole pages do not make sense. If you love \\"Dragonlance\\", this book will only disappoint you and break your heart. But you must read it if you want to read \\"Dragons of a Fallen Sun\\". In Fallen Sun, redemption will be found!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dawning of a New Age","review":"This was my first Rabe book, and honestly, I enjoyed it. Giving the fact that she had to lead off from the creators of and greats of the DL scene. She held her own. It was more on an epic tragedy scale. Luminous dark tidings without the cursed gods who always seem to leave the inhabitants of DL hanging. I really like Rig's character and hope one day he dawns his own novel. I enjoy Dhamon as well and his tragic destiny of the whole trilogy but Rig was the rock for me. Also Khellendros is a most interesting and tormented dragon, and we all know who he is searching for..... Its a great read reguardless of all the other critics being so inapt about the details and \\"oh it's not weis and hickman!\\" Wake up, they chose Rabe to do this and she held her own. GET THE DRAGONS OF A NEW AGE TRILOGY, and THE DHAMON SAGA."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Start to the New Age","review":"TSR politics and conspiracy theories aside, Jean Rabe was given the task of continuing one of the most successful fantasy novel franchises in publishing history. This was a very tall order and due to the popularity and skill of the previous world creators, Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, many readers would dislike, even hatefully condemn Rabe's book, simply for the fact that Rabe wasn't Weis or Hickman.However, the argument that Rabe never received a fair popular or critical review due to her difficult position is moot simply because of how poorly crafted Dawning of a New Age is.Even if I allow that the new world order created by TSR within the gaming modules is a poor background upon which to draw, there is no rationale for the poor characterization, the awful scene description, the ridiculously constructed combat scenes, and the muddied, convoulted, hot mess of a plot.Simply put this book is not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mercy, please!","review":"I gave it one star because it was grammatically correct, for the most part. You'd be surprised how authors can write without grammar. I never liked Jean Rabe's style much, and I think that this book sums up everything bad about it. Her characters are badly done, and the characters she borrows from others are unrecognizable. None of the easy dialogue seen in other DL books. The plot seems to crawl along, going nowhere until the very end, and once it's over, it seems the journey just wasn't worth the trouble. You're better off reading Weis, Hickman, Knaak, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh and it only gets worse","review":"Rabe's characters are dull. Every fight involves forty thrown knives by Rig and the next two books in this trilogy are worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Th Dawning of a New Age","review":"This book was an excelant addition to the Dragon Lance seris that should not be missed. Any one who thinks other wise does not recognize good literature.

I am also a long time DL and Forgotten realms fan. When I saw this book I was eager to read it and very disappointed.One dimensional characters ( including the dragons),improbable fight scenes, some pointless deaths and a sudden ending. Not a cliffhanger - it was as though she just stopped writing ( and there is a certain blessing in that)The artwork - well some things are better left unsaid. There is nothing wrong in looking at traditional settings and characters from a \\"new\\" angle but some of the character differences were so extreme that she might have been better off creating a whole new world. Frankly it is hard to believe that this book was written by the same author as those Dhamon novels ( and I do look forward to Redemption )"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Characters","review":"Jasper is a dwarf who is basically a remake of Flint. Feril is a kagonesti elf who sure can use earth magic for a world where magic has vanished. She is in love with Dhamon. Dhamon is an ex-dark knight of Takkhisis who regrets his past, but still lives by honour. He accomplishes impossible victories in every fight. Rig is a sailor who didn't want to be involved, but eventually changed his mind. Blister is a kender, yet she posseses no traits of a kender. Her hands are scarred and they hurt when she touches anything, so she has an unending (annoying) collection of gloves with different attachments on them.This summary of the main characters is about as much as you will get from reading the book itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just one thing....","review":"Umm...Okay, I'm not gonna go into how reeeeeelly terrible the book was cuz everyone else has already said that. But am I the only one who thinks that Jean Rabe CANNOT write a kender's personality?! I mean, Blister could be a special case, but even Raph! She can't write kender! Somebody please post something showing that you agree with me on this; I want to know I'm not alone.And what's with that ending? Do I hear \\"sales gimmick\\"? Some stupid cliffhanger ending.......just a gimmick to get you to buy the sequels! JEAN RABE CAN'T WRITE."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dawning of a New Age","review":"This book is terrible. Rabe apparently has not read many other Dragonlance books. She starts off by taking away the tower of High Sorcery in Palanthas and then making Dalamar just drop off the face of existance. Her characters have no personality either. The plot is [bad] and since when does Goldmoon have magical powers? and just how many dwarven mystics besides Jasper are there? Rabe must have like scimmed through a couple of Dragonlance books and tried to just improv this series. The battles are always one sides with defiant victories no matter how great the odds the good guys always get out with hardly a scratch. It just not very Dragonlance like and the rest of the books get worse from here. Take my advice and dont even buy this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"First book I ever threw in the trash...","review":"I hated this book. The writing was terrible, the story was disappointing, and the characters were all boring.I am a big fan of Dragonlance and I have a great respect for books and literature, but this book was so bad that I had to throw it in the garbage. I have never thrown a book away in my life. I normally cannot bring myself to do so because I feel someone else may be able to benefit from the reading. But in this case I couldn't help it.I would read this book each morning on my train ride to work. Each day I would get more and more fed up with the [junk] the author had written. Finally, one day I got off the train and threw the book into a garbage can on the street. I couldn't believe I had done that, but in the end I felt better because I had wasted so much time on this horrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear god no....","review":"And from the sacrifice of a single small person, the end of the universe was averted and all of the trials of the Fourth Age were not done in vain... that is until this book was written. I haven't reached 'Dragons of the Fallen Sun' yet in the overall series, but somebody PLEASE tell me that this series by Jean Rabe is a dream sequence passing through the mind of a sleeping gully dwarf five seconds before it was squashed by a runaway gnomeflinger rolling down the hill on square wheels (which were supposed to stop it from rolling away in the first place since that was the flaw of the last version). Did Jean Rabe even research Krynn before writting this? Does she even know what a kender is? Some of the plot ideas were good. I liked Skie's return, but there was nothing else. Dull and predictable. Avoid this book unless you want to get to the next Hickman and Weis book. In the latter case, borrow it from somebody else. The six bucks ain't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like the death of an Era...","review":"The minute I picked up this book, I knew I was going to be disapointed. But my god, this book reeked. They completly destoyed the world of Krynn, that I and millions of other readers have come to know and love. I will not accept the Fifth Age books as part of the Dragonlance time line. If they had had Margeret Weiss and Tracy Hickman write these books, like they had them start the series off, maybe we could have entered the fifth age with some style. for me, and I think I speak for many more readers, when I say Dragonlance ended with \\"Dragons of Summer Flame\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Story - Bad writing.","review":"I have enjoyed the DL saga for many years, mainly because of Weis and Hickmans writing. And so now they have left a very important story in the Dragonlance Saga to Jean Rabe who obviously can't write at all. Her charcters are shallow and her villains aren't very interresting either. The only reason for reading this pile of incohernt babble is to get the background knowledge for \\"The War of Souls\\" by Weis and Hickman which is Dragonlance at it's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadness","review":"I have been a faithful devotee of the Dragonlance series since I was a lonely 12 year old in middle school with nothing else going for me but an uncanny knack for grammar and a bit of skill with a pen. I thrilled to the incredible writing of Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman and was inspired by their characters. However, I come to read this book and I am truly and deeply appalled. I find the writing lackluster and uninteresting, the characters typical and completely flat. I hated the heroes and I was bored by the villains. Every plot twist sounded to me like the plotless drivel I wrote when I was about 10 with a friend, and I just found myself devastated that the series I loved was turned over to someone without half of the skill that Weis and Hickman possessed. I almost boycotted the series in angry protest. However, with the Soulforge novels, I find forgiveness in my heart, but I do not at all recommend this novel to anyone who doesn't want to waste hours of their life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I can't believe this is actually a book.

I was anxious to read the new 5th age book, to learn more about Palin, and this new sorcery. But what I found was an empty plot. The characters didnt act like they should, especially the Kender. If it werent told that they were Kender, i would never have guessed. The first thing that came to mind when reading this book is that it resembled a children's tale, not a true Dragonlance tale. I had to force myself to turn everypage. The only reson I would recommend this book, is to learn about the new sorcery, blue spawns and such. Dont read it and expect it to be a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad.","review":"This book is just too linear. Doesn't have the feeling of a Dragonlance setting.

I was feeling a little doubtful in buying this book because it was written by Weiss or Hickman, but i figured they would leave the saga in good hands.Was I wrong! This book is simply awful! The plot is mundane and predictable. The characters are really, REALLY dull and aren't anything more than words on a page. The kenders do not have the feel of what a kender should be like(i.e. Tasslehoff) but come off as sounding very...well..human. What bothered me most was the sudden passage of time straight off the bat. By chapter 5, several decades have already passed between Summer Flame and New Age. Is the years in between just as gray haze of uneventfullness? I'd like to write more but it would extend way past the 1,000 word mark. it's suffice to say that ignoring this book and its sequels completely would be a step up in quality reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thrash from cover to cover.","review":"My review of Eve of the Maelstrom covers all of the terrible Rabe (read: rape) trilogy.

The token Burrfoot is a lass named Blister who got a burn when she was young and she becomes afraid a lot. Is the sea churning up?? She's afraid. Is there a powerful wyvern? Yup... she's afraid. I actually felt betrayed reading this and seeing Basic knowledge being ignored. Also....<and I know this was pointed out somewhat in an earlier post> in the last book of Flame it was basically stated that magic was dead. Hell Palin couldnt get Raistlins Staff to light up! Suddenly its not that bad? Methinks the corporation didnt want the cash-cow to die. Anyway true fans... let a friend buy the book and borrow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete garbage","review":"All this book did was to crumble my image of the Dragonlance world. So read this book at your own risk. Jean Rabe should have started a whole new trilogy instead of ripping off the Dragonlance name. Well, in the authors defense, Hickman and Weis did not give her much left to work with (they did a good job at completing the Dragonlance trilogy in Dragons of Summer Flame). After reading this book, I will not even pick up a new Dragonlance book unless it is by either Weis or Hickman (Soulforge is an awesome book). Don't read this book, save your money, your time, and your brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"DragonLance? Yeah, I remember that...","review":"This book is absolutely pathetic; no more than a cheezy spin-off of an otherwise classic series.

But as an objective reviewer, I must say that I like their new album, Til Death Do Us Part. It's not their best album, nor will it be the most popular, but it contains some good tracks and will be enjoyable by the majority of the Hill's fans. Featuring songs with Jamaican sensation Damian Marley and Puerto Rican reggaeton star Tego Calderon, this album has a distinct Latin/Caribbean style that I liked. Although the single currently playing \\"What's Your Number?\\" might not seem like standard Cypress Hill fare, it's got it's on little catchy quality. I enjoyed Stoned Raiders and Till Death Do Us Part, as I think Cypress Hill is moving in a good direction after IV and Skull and Bones, which were alright, but nothing to write home about. Pick this up if you can't get enough of Cypress Hill."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hill is Back!","review":"First off I like to mention that I've been a huge Cypress Hill fan since their debut in '91. So when I purchased this LP I really didn't think much from it since their last album \\"Stoned Raiders\\" was a huge disapointment. I was DEAD WRONG, Cypress take's it back to their roots w/ the hardcore beats and rhymes and Sen Dogg really impressed me on this w/ his flows. B-Real still comes wit it on his rhymes skills and of course Muggs w/ his dark hardcore beats. This album adds a lot of musical flava to it as well, from reggae to spanish hip-hop.

Tim Armstrong worked on this song, which makes sense why it just doesn't seem like a song that they would have done. One person mentioned that it sounded like the Clash, and again, that's Tim's influence. He has been influenced by the Clash, and has brought alot of that to his own music.

Jake is dense and rigid--he takes 3 years to decide to marry--waiting for his stalker to finish school--can anyone believe this stuff.

Even Simmons admitted in a interview that writing this book was his most painful one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow Man, hollow book!!","review":"As a Dan Simmons fan, it pains me to have to trash this book, but a trashing is more than called for. Simmons has a great idea but squanders it on a story that goes nowhere -- the plot randomly wanders around and then suddenly stops. The bulk of the story seems to be filler composed of bits and pieces of short story ideas (e.g. the Miz Morgan incident) whose sole purpose is to provide an excuse for the main character to arrive at the final section. I also have to ask how many more times Simmons intends to recycle the \\"old Jewish guy\\" character! The book is not a complete disaster since it does have imaginative ideas and -- if judged individually -- some well-written sections, but overall is still not worth reading.I'm left wondering if Simmons is on the same downward spiral that Arthur C. Clarke, Orson Scott Card, and William Gibson seem to be taking."},{"rating":"2","title":"reinforces what a creative genius Simmons is","review":"This book grabbed me by the eyeballs - like the best of S.King/R. Bachman - and didn't let go until the very end. A wild ride - thought provoking and well-conceptualized throughout. An on-the-road type book, the protaganist travels from Philly to Disneyworld to the deserts to Las Vegas to... and deals with lots of intense violence and good sickening horror. And reminisces about l-o-v-e on the way to stir the reader in a different way. I liked the Hyperion series a lot - Hollow Man was easier to read (maybe because it is earthbound?) and I liked it just as much (if not better). Only disappointment (which some may like a lot), too much math and physics. Otherwise great stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and disjointed","review":"I bought this because Hyperion was excellent and was very disappointed.

Children of the Night was OK, but with Hollow Man, Dan Simmons has bombed out. This book should not have passed editorial muster: the \\"plot\\" is incinsistent and never clear; the \\"science\\" fiction never comes alive; events do not follow logically, nor do they build upon themselves; even the chapter titles do not relate to the book. I found this a tough, disappointing read, and the final page and \\"plot\\" resolution, topped off the experience. If written by a no-name author, this book would never have been published (and should not have been)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of Simmons work I've read","review":"I was really surprised to see good reviews for this book. I bought it because I really loved other books I've read by Simmons - and was very let down. If you are looking for a story like Hyperion, skip this book. I can appreciate that others liked the romance/mystery/whatever aspect of this book. To me the weakness is the writing and the foggy plot made it hard to appreciate whatever inherent qualities the story was intended to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"After devouring the Hyperion series and loving it, The Hollow Man was set up for high expectations. Even without those expectations, I believe that I would have been extremely disappointed in The Hollow Man.The book gets hung up on meaningless mathematics. For such an intelligent person, the main character acts like a idiot. While some might argue the emotions that are driving his behavior, I find it a hard leap.Overall, very disappointing, and I probably won't pick up another Dan Simmons book unless someone convinces me otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"This can't be the same Dan Simmons","review":"Terrible.

In fact, I wanted to invent a time machine just so I could tell myself not to pick it up.The Hyperion series was excellent and for this reason I picked up \\"The Hollow Man.\\" This book completely lacks fresh concepts. The KIRKUS REVIEW is actually pretty accurrate when they say the author leaps but doesn't land anywhere.The book gets caught up in ideas based on made up mathematical equasions, concepts too ill defined to really sink your teeth into and a plot which could have been told in a thirty page short story. Simmons keeps moving between current time and flashbacks in a pointless way and never finds a sense of direction (much like the movements of his protagonist). On top of all this, there are no (repeat NO) new ideas here at all.I'm sorry I bothered with it.

The changes in my body over the past few years have been amazing, and every summer I can don a bathing suit with confidence - This video, however, is the farthest thing from a cardio workout. The step routines are boring and barely raise my heart rate, and the instructor is really annoying, The majority of the video is spent blasting lower body muscles with weight work - but even this is not done as aggressively as in other videos. If you're looking for cardio, i would reccomend any of the other firm videos. The workouts are intense and the results are dramatic and fast. This is just the one bad apple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good.","review":"I own 4 Firm video tapes and rate their top at 5 stars. This tape however, really is not that good.

It was never intended to rack up positive critic's reviews. Instead, it is 90 min or so of uninspired reflection wrapped in a pretty package. That packaging, of course, is the lovely Ali Larter. The strategy is to paste Ms. Larter over the majority of the cover, and try to dupe those browsing the video store that her screen time will be relatively proportional to her spot on the cover. This is not the case, and her one sexy scene was diluted and weak, positivly PG-13 by todays standards.

He makes certain alliances, certain people help him, they even compromise with him, but his tenacious demeanor gets him deeper into our plot.Overall, there's some good suspense and nail biting moments when you're holding back from screaming 'COME ON, CHRIS!' but mind you this is an old film.

Second, this book contains an excellent chapter offering great insights on illustrating the sermon. Third, this book has probably the best treatment of application in preaching I've ever read. As long as contemporizing the biblical text, helping people see abstract truth in a way that is concrete, pictoral, sensible, and expreiential and driving home the practical significance of the Bible remain significant priorities for you as a preacher, this book will stand the test of time as a significant resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off","review":"Turns out the cleaner solution is DISTILLED WATER.

There are songs on here that make you ponder about past relationships, make you wish you were in love, calm your nerves, and more. It's much like the Pumpkins' \\"Siamese Dream\\", but without the metal antics and with more lushness. Yes, it can put you to sleep, but just skip to \\"Stay\\" and you'll feel the yearning of love sweep over you. Okay, so that may sound cheesy! It's not a cheesy album by any means! It's quite beautiful. ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bernard has enormous potential...","review":"I have been a large Suede fan for a while now, and this cd is indeed the direction that they would have taken, if Mr. Butler had stayed on.

But it's sleep with a smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"this man has skills!","review":"great album. it nevers stays at the same pace or repeats the same riff, and the tracks are all varied in length, not limited to a verse chorus verse structure. it is entirely a guitar album - no songwriting here - but BB uses his guitar as his voice throughout the album. if you like a good guitar bassline and solo, and want an album rather than a set of songs, you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Studio Fop Forgets How to Rock","review":"The ideas behind the songs on this album are mediocre. The majority of songs on the album are much worse than mediocre, mostly because there's hardly and heart or feeling to them. Part of that may be due to Bernard's weak voice and unconfident phrasing, and part of it is because the songs don't go anywhere.

If nothing else, readers expect historians to get basic facts right. And as one reviewer has said already, the factual errors in the first pages alone are enough to destroy this historian's credibility. On the other hand, Brinkley is a great story teller and a gripping writer. Scene after vivid scene keep you reading, and in part redeem the book's glaring errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"kept me up late","review":"This book kept me up late reading night after night, and I read it to the very end. Most of these New York Times non-fiction bestsellers are compelling for the first few chapters, and then they get less interesting...

Noted that Blanco was treated far too kindly and there was absolutely no mention of Mary Landrieu's initial laurels for all the \\"heroic\\" Louisiana politicians followed by unending shrieking because the congress chose not to pass her demanded $250 billion recovery bill writen by lobbyists.

Both should be charged with negligence.I began to get very angry toward the end of the book, then realized how liberal Mr. Brinkley is.

Also, 95% of referrals were to \\"African AMERICANS\\" (and we don\`t know if all negroes were AMERICANs, do we?) as opposed to 100% called \\"whites\\".

And as for the bad NOPD officers -- there are just no words to describe their disgusting actions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Detailed Account","review":"The Great Deluge delivers extensive detailed accounts of the experiences of individuals involved with Post-Katrina rescue and relief efforts. It is the most comprehensive of the various books on this subject that I have encountered. Reading this book provided me with a gentle catharsis. As a member of an assessment team sent to Gulf Coast about a month after Katrina devastated the area, I've been laden with the burden of many wrenching tales that have largely gone unreported. This book contains a wealth of very specific and well-documented reports. First-hand accounts of personal experiences results in a certain amount of repetition, and that's as it should be. Each set of eyes sees individually, and the consistency of these accounts bolsters credibility. This book should be required reading for anyone choosing to present themselves as knowledgeable with regard to anything Katrina-related. It's not a pretty picture. It is a compelling account of who we are as a nation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of \\"The Great Deluge\\"","review":"Every literate citizen of Louisiana should take the time to read Douglas Brinkley's book, \\"The Great Deluge\\" before any forthcoming election, (local or national), and ask the difficult questions of the prospective candidates how they would react in similar circumstances and what action they would take to preclude a similar event in the future. There is plenty of blame to go around for that disaster and Brinkley is not shy about directing it where it should be cast. An excellent and very written book.

It has numerous factual errors, and a lot of the anecdotes collected by the author cannot be verified.

The author of this book relies on reporters mostly to gather his data. The parts of the book that describe events that I was personally involved with are grossly inaccurate and obviously written by someone who wasn't there and instead relied on an account of someone who didn't understand what was happening. Save your money. The book is too inaccurate to be considered a history lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bite on this one!","review":"As far as I can tell, this is essentially the same book as \\"Mosquito: The Story of Man's Deadliest Foe.\\" The first couple of chapters are interesting, but after that, the writing becomes vague, repetitious, and inconsistent in tone, diction, and quality. What should have been a fascinating book filled with both technical information and personal anecdotes (one of the authors is, after all, a leading researcher in mosquito-borne diseases) instead is filled with generalities and handwaving and reads like a C+ term paper hastily pulled from the internet (really!).

The NY Times even said that. Too bad he didn't write more about himself. Then again, he's probably as much of an ego maniac as the arrogant rich losers he profiled. How else would he have gotten them agree to be interviewed. I'd be quite curious to see how many of his \\"great leaders\\" are in jail in the next 24 months.

I now only after the first 8 chapters I no longer have a feeling of desperation to figure out why I thought I was not normal. In the book she tells that we are normal, God wants us to be at peace, and how the devil takes our peace of mind away. This is an awesome intelligent read. I would highly recommend the book to anyone struggling with their feelings and wondering where the next peace of mind is coming from."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book made me anxious","review":"Anxiety is a problem I have dealt with for years. I know God calls us to be anxious for nothing and rest on Him. I was hoping this book would encourage me and build me up as I learn to trust Him more. Instead, I felt like the author used the topic to justify her ministry. She relied too much on her own experiences and didn't provide enough truly practical or helpful advice for others dealing with anxiety. This was the first book by Joyce Meyer I have read, and I was not very impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough psychological components","review":"Too many bible verses made reading difficult.

It is great to use as a daily devotional at your own pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget your troubles","review":"Love Joyce Meyer's book. So often we get caught up in our day to day activities and stressors, and for what? We need to rely on our faith and know that we are not on life's journey alone. All we have to do is be open to God's tremendous gift of peace in our life. He does not want us to become tired, and beat down.

The speed, the energy and above all the tunes all combine to create something that is greater than the sum of it's parts. Their cover of \\"I Think We're Alone Now\\" is the obvious song people relate to Snuff (in fact my band still play this the same way to this day), but the originals is where they really shine. Fast, furious, glorious noisy POP! \\"What Kind of Love\\" is one of my all time favorite songs, despite stealing the tune from BBC's \\"A Question of Sport\\" and the fact that you can't hear most of the lyrics. Duncan (the singer-drummer), being the punk he is would probably cringe at this canonization, but screw him, this rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"some punks will probably like it.","review":"It's not that i dont like this record it's just since i got it it's just never really grown on me that much at times im listning to it and am actually enjoying it and other times it just bores me but having said that snuff have that effect on me around about half of there albums such as demma and disposable income etc... i really like and the other half such as numb nuts and flibby etc just fail to intrest me.

Roy Schneider was aware of this as well and alas, left the show. Of course there's one or two good ones, but that kid! It's like torture! And maybe a story here and there, but you'll have to look hard.It's funny because I remember liking the show at the time (Remember that's 15 yrs ago now) but a recent viewing will snap you right out of your escapist childhood.Just beware.

Michael Ironsides couldn't save it as the third season's captain. What gets me is all the producers had to do was get quality writers. You don't need a big budget if the characters are interesting.

A big star, great writing and the assistance of oceanographer Bob Ballard. I'm not sure America was ready for a submarine without a conning tower or with an aquatic system of aquafers on board for their intelligent dolphin. Imagine flipper on a sub. Don't laugh. It could work in reality. Then after a successful first season the writers caught the Voyage to the bottom of the sea disease. That is straying too far from reality to space monsters, flying saucers ect. So star Roy Scheider departed and the series was soon cancelled after season 2. In a last gasp effort during the final season Scheider returned to team up with his replacement Michael Ironside in a 2 parter. Too late.Bottom line get season one think about season2."},{"rating":"2","title":"SeqQuest","review":"Thanks for making the product available. I'll buy the second season just get it out there.Fast delivery. Loved every episode. It was the only good sci-fi show in the '90's. The fact that I can watch 10+ years later says something for the writing/acting. I found that a couple of the disks skipped during random episodes. I don't know the end of one episode on the first disk because it stopped and would not continue.

When this show was on television originally I waited every week with excitement to see what would happen next. I was young at the time and this was the first television show that made me feel that way. This was the show that hooked me on sci fi. A talking dolfin, a hot rebellious teenager who was a genius and great story plots that sucked you in immediately.

Just a little side note, it doesn't come with directions (really not necessary) but someone may be tempted to untie the knots in the string before putting the cover on the pool. The knots keep the string from coming out of the holes while stretching it over the pool. Once the cover is on, you can pull the strings and tie a bow, knot... whatever.

The characters were a little hard to understand at first. That's in part one of the book but in part two, they all seem to come together.

The main characters were unlikeable, the antagonistic blood-enemy was not at all evil; he was cowardly and more good than bad, and to top it all off, the final confrontation was so disappointing that it left me in literal tears.

Hi-Fi was not not expected but uniform sound reproduction was expected. I used an electronic timer and taped marks on the turn table and the base to determine the RPM of the turn table.

The music sounded like the record was warped, although I knew it wasn't. I kept trying different records, still the same quality. To make a long story short, after multiple e-mails and phone calls, Crosley agreed to have the record player returned to them for repair at their expense. Again, another disappointment. That was two weeks ago.

The Crosley CR-711 fits in well with retro-vintage fifties kitch stuff as a display model, but if you actually want to use it to play LPs it's a pile of junk. The turntable surface is made of cheap plastic with only three small rubber protectors placed on the carousel to prevent you from scratching the hell out of your vinyl. The rest of the mechanism is shoddy, it won't handle the weight of 78rpm records which cause the drive motor to bog down and end up slowing the playback. So records sound warped, and distorted.

There are no vocals whatsoever and it is 100% focused on guitar.Personally, I really enjoy the cd. I think it's fun in the sense of School House Rock. I've definitely played the game of trying to think of what movie or tv show inspired each song - there's an inspector gadget in there, a secret agent man kind of song, a western-theme song, all sorts of stuff, and all with impeccable musicianship.

Along the way she meets some nice helpful people that surprisingly believe in faeries (what a coincidence). Of course there is to be a sacrifice on Hunter's Moon, as anyone who is familiar with faerie lore knows, but somehow the characters are surprised by it. I'm surprised the author was able to fit a two sentence plot into 300 pages. Sometimes simplistic is good, if it is made to be endearing and entertaining for example, but this was neither.

The book is not so much about people or events, but the modern corporate culture (especially in the accounting field) that has gone awry.The author excels at covering the split between the accounting and consulting group, which ultimately led to AA's downfall. The author is biased, but never claims otherwise. However, for an \\"ethics expert\\", she seems as culpable as those she blames.

Prior to midway through the book I just wanted it to end. When reading it, I felt like I was reading something an outsider to AA was writing.

As other reviewers have mentioned -- the author is jaded, bitter, and angry at herself, but still tries to \\"teach\\" the readers a moral lesson. The result is a book that reads quickly but comes across as terribly one-sided and begs the question of whether this is really a fair portrayal or the work of a bitter ex-employee.

It sensationalizes the negative and overlooks the many positive things Andersen did for its people and its clients. The firm that I joined and knew helped many clients, and launched and enhanced many careers. The 85,000 people who represented Andersen are your friends, your relatives, your neighbors, your colleagues, your clients and your vendors.

The book reads like a montage to her personal successes and failures while at Arthur Andersen. It is heavy on subjective material, and lacks the objective material that is necessary to effectively describe the turbulent period of accounting fraud at the beginning of the new millenium. It also involves a myriad of \\"he said this to her associate who then relayed the message to her superior who memo'd it to his subordinate who subsequently memo'd it to the firm while contacting a potential client about an existing client\\" type of descriptions that can be very confusing and drawn out. I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be in the fiction shelf","review":"Wow - I am impressed that Ms. Toffler can crank out that much fiction. It is obvious that she is incredibly bitter about Andersen (and business in general). It appears to me that Ms. Toffler was the one singular and only individual with in the firm that was beyond reproach.Final Accounting is an ambitious and obviously cleansing exercise for Ms. Toffler because she has failed at many of her endeavors. Those that know the facts of her departure from Andersen will find her version commical (and a little sad).The book could have been a great case study, and I am confident that there will be a balanced study of the facts and the tangible lessons. Too bad Final Accounting isn't it. Too bad it ignores the facts. Too bad it is long on slander and subtle character assasination and short on anything resembling fact. Good thing that Ms. Toffler can go back to her ivory tower and ignore the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you people crazy!","review":"I used to work for Arthur Andersen and happily call myself an Android. As a manager in the consulting practice for over 7 years, incidentally three years longer than Toffler, I saw how we collectively worked exceptionally hard to serve our clients. At no point in my career did I experience anything other than think straight, talk straight...and by the way I too intereacted with many of the Partners Toffler refers to. The bottom-line is this...Toffler is trying to make a buck on the fall of the firm. Her inability to assimiliate and contribute to the firm has manisfested itself in her speculative and unsubstantiated rhetoric. Finally, Toffler tries to establish herself as intelligent and credible by citing her work at Harvard, etc. Hey Toffler, I had a professor in college who said \\"be wary of those of try to convince others they are smart by simply stating so.\\" DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don 't Waste Your Money","review":"Someday someone will write an insightful look into the fall of Arthur Andersen. This isn't it.I was very disappointed in this self-serving and surprisingly shallow work. It seems to have been written to generate a fast buck and to push the inflated self-view of the author. It does not contain any new inside stories or analysis...if that's what you're looking for, you'll do better pulling out a few old Wall Street Journal articles. The author was a junior direct-admit partner at AA. She did not grow up in AA and as such isn't qualified to describe the culture. Nor was she high enough in the firm to really know what was going on.Save your money...wait until a real inside story gets published."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE !!!","review":"Jane Eyre 1944WARNING!!! ....This is NOT the 1944 version of Jane Eyre with Orson Wells and Joan Fontaine!!
