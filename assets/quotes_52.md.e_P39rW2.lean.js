This game had an interesting premise but was absolutely painful to play even when consulting a walkthrough every other minute. The character was hard to navigate, the puzzles completely non-intuitive (who would think to get rid of a t-rex, you had to mix a leaf, twine, paint, and blackened pear to make fireworks which then you had to launch out of a hollow log???) AHHHHHHH! Also because of the super rigid gameplay, you would be unable to do one thing without completing some other menial task, so you would be hunting like crazy for the one little thing you didn't do - and this is after following the walkthrough verbatim. Please play only in the event of a pandemic and you are trapped in your house for weeks and have no other means of entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I usually don't play these type of adventure games, but it did sound interesting. However, I found out very early on in the game that you have to print out the manual to start the game moving forward. The cursor with the hand that is suppose to allow you to collect items, did not work all the time. I was unable to understand what I was suppose to do inside the caves since none of the items were working.Very disappointed in the game. I think that the maker of the game should try having people play this game before releasing it to the public, or at least test it and make sure that it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some things don't make any sense","review":"I enjoyed this game at times, but it aggravated me to have to rely on the walkthtough for some of the puzzles. Those I had help on would have taken weeks to figure out and the final answer so obscure that it would simply have been trial and error, no logical outcome. Also some of the items you had to combine to do stuff did not seem logical either. If you already have a knife, why would you have to combine 2 or 3 other things to do what the knife could do? Dealing with the cursor was difficult also for the same reasons mentioned in the other reviews. I would recommend this game to someone who doesn't mind relying on walkthroughs and has infinite patience. The story was interesting but loses a lot when it's so hard to play it out yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this game","review":"Yes, it had a few navigation problems, but to me they were not fatal, and the graphics were stunning.

But if you want a good story line and good game play, this will be your worste nightmare. navigations is unbearable at times. i got stuck numerous times as well. had to go back to a saved spot. it crashed on my a couple times too, and i lost everything because i forgot to save. stay away from this one. seriously. the gameplay and story is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful service","review":"the product was wrong. never got the right one. had to take action with amazon to even get my money back. was worst experience. & thats putting it nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"I received the bolero bracelet today and I was disappointed!

We eat large bagels (the kind made fresh by the grocer) so they just barely squeeze into the slicer. This helped with the uneven cutting issue like other reviewers noted, but for some reason the bagels toast differently than when you cut them with a knife. I think it's because the structure of the bagel gets crushed during cutting. My bagels came out hard and crusty most of the way through. I like them softer. Maybe freezing my bagels after cutting them has something to do with it too.

Physically the unit is about the size of a 19\\" LCD monitor so it takes up very little depth and could even be wall mounted if you desired! I put this unit in a room next to the cat liter box.

As with a lot of these Varese CDs produced by Bruce Kimmel, there are some peculiar arrangements that are so arranged for the sake of being peculiar. With her incredible range, everything from the tones of a lyric soprano to a belter/rocker (not here though), Kuhn can sing just about anything. She'd be a lot better served without having to stick to the structure of a single composer/writer (such as here) and just pick her own material -- whether pop or Broadway, Kuhn can sing it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure to become one of your favorite albums","review":"I first heard this album in a small theater store in New York City and it captivated me. From the soft and sensual rendition of \\"It's Been A Long Time\\" that begins the album, to the surprisingly good salsa-like arrangement of \\"You'll Never Get Away From Me\\" every song selection is a real treat. Her voice can be tender and wistful, as in \\"I Fall In Love Too Easily\\", or wonderfully full like in \\"Time After Time\\". Her sound reminds me at times of a young Streisand, and at others, of Barbara Cook. Her interpretations are intelligent, heartfelt and always right on target in terms of the lyrics. Judy Kuhn is a true singing actress that is a joy to listen to. If you like good theatrical vocals that you can listen to over and over and over, don't miss this album.

Sally's mother is handled tritely in her mental illnes. Sally is a characture of a child, adolescent, and young woman. Her dubious responses to surreal experiences are achingly banal.This is heartbreaking. I know Faith Sullivan can do much better; I have rated her a five in previous reads. Perhaps this was an off book; a forced sequel she was coerced into completing. I will not judge her by this disappointing offering. Read \\"The Cape Ann\\" and visit her strength and her artistic beauty as a writer. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Felt like revisiting my childhood!!","review":"I absolutely LOVED Party of Five when it was on TV, the characters were great and the storylines were gripping and for the time hard hitting.Party of Five isn't avaliable in England so to be able to buy this and relive all my favourite characters is fantastic. I can't wait for the other Seasons to be released on DVD so that I REALLY can feel like a teenager again!!I would recommend everyone who loved this TV show to go out and buy this DVD, it's nicely packaged and although there aren't many Bonus Features on it the show itself makes up for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whatever it takes","review":"Maybe it's because Matthew Fox is so popular on the TV series Lost, or maybe it's because there was such an outcry from fans for more DVDs.

It takes almost 10 years for me to recap some of the wonderful plots (mainly the story line between Bailey and Sarah) of the show. My only complaint is that its special features (just cast commentaries for 3 of the episodes and a half hour interview with Sarah) are a bit less when compared with those of season 1. Nevertheless, I believe every fans of the show will be more than delighted to receive the product.By the way, I'm a bit surprised that Jennifer Love Hewitt can do all the senseful talking in the special feature for half an hour withour boring the audience. She's really a gifted person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bone M does Mary's Boy Child","review":"I bought this primarily for the song, \\"Mary's Boy Child\\".

Hungry reminds me the pop/rock My Kind of Lady of the superb Famous Last Words. Hungry is Roger's as its best- very Supertramp sound.

From start to finish, this is incredible. RH's voice and harmonies are as strong and distinct as ever, the soulful themes are inviting, and the sound echos back not only to the old Supertramp days, but forward in a broader and fresh way.

I am really impressed that they have a very nice clean sound. The low-end is a little weak, but not bad at all. I only noticed lacking low-end running dance or electronic music (Daft Punk, Fat Boy Slim, Club mixes). In Rock, Pop, or just listening to the radio I didn't really notice it. At only a 45W max rating and using in-line crossovers (read: a capacitor on the lead of the tweeter), I don't advise hooking these up to an amplifier.

It would have been great if this book were really about Hrithik Roshan, or the Hindi film industry, or the Indian people. It was just about Justine's crush.

This album can be criticized mainly for its recurrent melody styles, vocal rhythms that just don't work, and the fact that most of the songs are dull and mellow. Although this band has exceedingly well written lyrics, it is difficult to pay too much attention to them since the rhythms accompanying them are so uninteresting. The only song I was able to tolerate, let alone like was \\"Title Track\\". This tune has a cool drum beat, a catchy rhythm, and the typical good set of lyrics. While Deathcab for Cutie fans would probably eat this album up, I simply can't stand it. Also, there are only ten songs on it, a rather unsatisfactory amount of tracks in my view.

Influence of Modest Mouse and Built to Spill is obvious. But there's something a little less jarring and a little more accessible about DCFC's approach. They sound like Elliott Smith improvising vocals for Pavement--hazy, shimmery, and utterly intriguing. Not to mention extremely catchy.

They combine the slow, beautiful ache of Mogwai with obvious references like Built to Spill and Elliott Smith. I'm not hearing any Modest Mouse here, this music holds a different kind of tension. The only comparison i can think of is when \\"Title Track\\"'s production blossoms, it lifts me the same way the first chorus of \\"Moon and Antarctica\\"'s \\"3rd Planet\\" does. This music may be boring to some, but it moves at exactly my pace. The melodies often mine similar territory, but the songs are so well crafted you never get that \\"these songs all sound the same\\" feeling.

When it finally does, I can't stop listening to it. This record's production is miles ahead of \\"something about airplanes\\". DCC has also dropped the beatlesque moments and optioned for a much more subdued approach. The result are songs ranging from modestlty upbeat, to the very downbeat. DCC does this wonderful thing where they make me keep thinking a song will eventually pick up, but it never happens! I like this. There may be influences, but the sound is really unique and satisfying.Comparisons to Built to Spill I've seen should warn listeners that they may love BTS, but this album may not have enough get-up-and-go for them.

Jackie Chan is not even in the actual movie. Sure, in the beginning you see him doing some kind of interview but thats about it. The movie is great if you like sapy revenge stories but the false picture of Jackie on the cover is a false lead. I thought that it was a sequal to first strike but this was not what I had expected. So save your money and buy First Strike instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCK,SUCK AND SUCK SOME MORE","review":"This movie suck so bad i wish I had rent it before I bought it. OK first of all they put jackie on the front of the box knowing he is not in the movie that made me so mad.

Jackie Chan only has a small cameo as a drag queen ! Its clear that Jackie Chan fans are being exploited by video distributors and I for one find this kind of abuse offensive.

I was hoping for a better understanding of the influence of gnosticism on modern thought, especially New Age thinking. Instead this is an introductory volume for a large number of highly detailed, thoroughly researched future books. In the intro. the author spends most of his time justifying the authors he will site in future volumes. There is little explanation of the intellectual roots of gnosticism or how it plays out in the current stream of culture. I have tried to stay with the reading but it has not been fun or truly enlightening. Read this if you are going to teach a Ph.D. course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy now!","review":"If you're into the old COF, I would recomend this cd even though it only has 6 tracks they are just amazing.

You don't have to force yourself to down chemical-tasting water.To the earlier reviewer who mentioned treatment time: 4 hours is a worst-case scenario mandated by the EPA for killing one type of organism (cryptosporidium) in water that is both very cold and very dirty. All bacteria and viruses, except cryptosporidium and giardia, are killed in 15 minutes (even in cold water). Cryptosporidium and giardia are both killed in 30. In cold, very dirty (cloudy) water, it can take 4 hours for a full crypto kill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight and effective...","review":"One has to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of this product based on one's needs or requirements. IMO, the pros and cons are...Pros: These tabs weigh only a few ounces, but can treat up to 20 liters.They are very effective at killing off viruses, bacteria, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium(EPA accepted). This product is great if you can't build a fire or boil water.Cons: One tab for one liter so unless you stock up, you can only support one person for 5 days if you use 1 gal. or 4 liters per day for roughly $10. Compare this to 96oz(~56000 drops) of Clorox for $4 and it only takes 16 drops to treat 1gal. of water. Katadyn claims that their tabs leave virtually no taste to the water, but I disagree. There is a very strange taste in the water that is less tolerable than chlorine IMO. Minimum treatment time is 30 minutes for both.Alternative: Boil water for 5 minutes at any desired quantity at virtually no cost! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked...","review":"It's impossible to tell if things like this work because if you don't get sick, you don't know if the water was infected or not. Nonetheless, on my last backpacking trip I planned on getting water from a stream that I saw on a map.The stream ended up being extremely low, almost dry actually. The water was brown, almost completely still and very sketchy looking... I was pretty reluctant to drink it but I didn't have any other source of water for the trip.I filled a 40oz container and added the pill. Waited 4 hours and drank the whole thing. Then got more water for the rest of the trip.

I can go for hours listening to Elmo, or watching Dora, and not blink. I can read the books, play the games and basically do all the things a mother needs to do to raise well adjusted children.This, however, sucks. The only reason it got one star at all is because it does introduce more than just your standard northern European fairy tales.

The stories are inappropriate for young children. Jack and the Beanstalk is the worst re-telling I have ever seen. It teaches children to steal, to lie and to not only kill the giant, who was minding his own business, but to take all his belongings after he's dead. Jack's mother actually praises Jack for killing the Giant and taking is things.

Mr. Catalano plays a fiery sax, with plenty of post-bop technique, but reaches emotional heights with one- and two- note repetitive phrases ala the r&b; sax players of the late '40s and early '50s.

Then you have to start all the way from the top and go through all the A's,B's,C's and so on. It is a pain in the butt!If your head unit accepts AUX input via 1/8, connect your Ipod that way.

Theodore Roosevelt was one of the greats and eloquently portrayed in this excellent and revealing book by Brands. I learned much about the human being as apposed to the personal persona of TR. Although not in the same category as Richard Patton's astounding \\"The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years\\", Brands biography does a very creditable job of placing TR in our sitting room. So if you want to know the human being with all his foibles,\\"The Last Romantic\\" is definitely for you. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bully! Hurrah!","review":"Surely this is one of the finest examples of human complexity ever recorded by man! Brands, an outstanding writer/historian, lays bare Theodore Roosevelt-- warmonger, peacemaker, elitist, common man, trust-buster, conservative, explorer, soldier. Roosevelt was truly a force of nature, and this book does a fantastic job of showing that. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for fans of TR","review":"As an admirer of Theodore Roosevelt, I was very disappointed in Mr. Brands' book. It appeared to me that Mr. Brands' intent was to analyze the life of this great man strictly from his critic's point of view. While any good biography worth its salt should present a balanced view of the man, Mr. Brands appears to go out of his way to find fault in almost all of TR's actions. TR was by no means a perfect man, however, history has proven him to be one of our greatest presidents. One gets the sense after reading this dreadfully long and depressing account of TR that Mr. Brands'truly disliked his subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This book is a must-have for grandparents, in giving wonderful ideas in spending quality time with their grandparents.

By all accounts it should not be as good as it is - heck I didn't think Superdrag would ever release another album! The band rip through some half-way decent material.

It showcases Steve Walsh's exquisite vocals, Kerry Livgren's wonderful arrangements and Robby Steinhardt's beautiful violin. The only downpoint is that the album doesn't flow because they took songs from different live shows and put them together. The other thing I didn't like about the CD version is that it was missing one song that was on the original album \\"Closet Chronicles\\" -- why remove a song on the cd version?? But all in all, this is a very good live album and deserves more praise than I've seen for it - so this is why I am currently reviewing it!!

However, I can't tell because this re-issue is copy protected and cannot be ripped to MP3. All the songs skip, like any CD that uses the insidious \\"Copy Control Technology\\". This especially sucks for people like me who listen to all their music on an iPod - at home, in the car and walking around.The Compact Disc logo is not anywhere on these discs or the packaging. Discs that do not follow the rules are not allowed to display the logo. This means that such discs will not play on a computer, or many types of modern players.It's a shame record companies insist on alienating those of us who actually buy CDs.

The 1990's was a unique time in Rock in that it allowed bands to talk badly about themselves, but somehow still remain cool. You never felt that they were actual losers, even though the lyrics declared it. I remember listening to \\"creep\\" by Radiohead and thinking that it was the first time I ever felt that a lead singer was sincerely down on himself - the sincerity of the self-defeating song was what made it forgivable, cool even. This Grand Mal CD is not forgivable. The entire CD is full of self-defeated expressions that come off as loser-ish. You can't declare that you've been beaten unless you've truly put forth extreme effort - so that at least you have a little beauty amidst your defeat - This CD is so half assed that when it comes time for the confession of self-defeat, coolness is not pulled off - but pathetic is."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"I bought 3!Ok, yeah they are fun till they break.

Excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak. Very weak.","review":"I've been a fan of David Weber for years; in fact, Mutineer's Moon and its sequels is still one of my favorite series. The first 4 or 5 Harrington books rocked, and I lovedPath of the Fury.But I've noticed a trend with Weber in the last few years - the last few Harrington books got so bogged down with political and technical claptrap that the story disappeared. It's very disappointing, because Weber used to be able to tell a darn good story.In Fury Born has followed the precedent; I couldn't get past the first 100 pages because of all the other stuff getting in the way. Which is too bad, because I always wanted to know DeVries' backstory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Weber I have read","review":"I can't wait until a new novel by David Weber comes out. I was extremely disappointed in this work. I had read the original and had found it mediocre. This added nothing but alot of words.

Probably only one I don't own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah, space opera....","review":"As a big fan of the Honor Harrington series, I have been reading a great deal of Weber's other works. This is one of the best \\"non-Honor\\" works I have yet seen. Weber is a master of the space/naval genre these days, and this work certainly matches to that standard.The only problem (and it's a minor one) that I had with this was that it covered too much ground. Weber did it very well, but it seemed that some things were compressed to set up the next stage of the story.Still, the whirwind tour of this woman's life, plus the addition of...well...strange mythogy appearing in an unexpected way, makes for a doozy of a story.

It's quite possible that I just have a faulty memory and that these two stories share a huge percentage of text between them.

Even though I knew how it is going to turn out (Alicia was going to leave the Cadre, she was going to lost her family ...), the novel still griped me from start to finish.The characters are well done and there is no one in the world that can write battle scenes as well as DW. All the battles are exciting, emotional but also clear explained so the readers know what is going on at all times. The tactics, use of hardware all seem to be very intelligently thought out .. which is a hallmark of DW's novels.I am now feverishly hoping for a sequal. This universe potentially can be as interesting as the honorverse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't realize it was an expansion of \\"Path of the Fury\\"","review":"I'm a big fan of David Weber, so when I saw two books about Fury I thought one was a sequel to the other and bought them both. \\"In Fury Born\\" arrived first and after reading the info realized that it was an expanded re-write of \\"Path of the Fury\\". I enjoyed the book, and when I finished it, I dove right into \\"Path of the Fury\\". The extra detail and character build up add a lot to the story, and I would highly recomend \\"In Fury Born\\".

Stovall takes a look at one of his favorite subject matters - the role of black people in society and in particular, in this novel, their victimization - through the eyes of a \\"somewhat\\" forgotten novelist - Yerby who has been on record as saying that black people are responsible for their lot in life.Yet, at the same time, they are asking Yerby to recant his words or they may never exist again.I found this book highly confusing to read and although I got the basic message coming out of the storyline, it felt as though the role of Yerby was overextended greatly.I am still scratching my head on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very different, but interesting.","review":"This was a strange and confusing book. It's about Frank Yerby, he is on his deathbed, and really unhappy about it. He's a writer who's books don't have readers, and the characters of his books aren't happy about that either.

Also, Yerby is an admirer of Victorian age writers like William Lord Byron. In addition, the story centers on Lady Sumayla who is a mother of a prince. This book is like an autobiography of Frank Yerby's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good general reference for any naval buff.","review":"The book is a good addition to any professional salior or naval buff's library. The pictures, for the most part are of good quality, but some are of little value as they are bow-on or stern-on shots. Also, the author gets the California and Virginia class vessels of the USN (CGNs) mixed together when they are two distinct classes. However, as all vessels of both classes are (or soon will be) no longer in service it is not a big issue. With the rapid pace of naval events a newer edition is needed; say in 2000-2001. The key recognition features of each class is a good feature, allowing the reader to pick them up from the picture on the opposite page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check your mike weight","review":"This gooseneck is the intermediate length.

It would be even better if it were a little stiffer/more robust.

It installed perfectly and ran faultless and quietly, for the first two months. Then it stopped working and refused to recognise there was even a DVD in the drive. The breakdown was sudden. It wrote a DVD and then it stopped recognising any disks. I tried it in another machine with the same problem so it is the hardware.I wont pretend that my experience is typical but it may have something to do with the fact that this is a cheap drive and maybe you really do get what you pay for.

In this sense, the best burner I ever plugged into my system. Unfortunately, as other reviewers also experienced, its durability is simply inadequate, making it a poor value for its price. Mine lasted 4 days beyond the end of the warrantee period. To their credit, the company still honored the warrantee, but only after considerable difficulty communicating with them. Only a computer tech friend was able to contact them effectively in order to make the arrangements -- not adequate support.

Pieces never lock together, even with the bottom \\"base\\" pieces.We resorted to putting all the Imaginext on a table for him to play, however, flat surface, bumpy surface, any surface, it falls apart.(...)When a 4-1/2 YR wants you to throw out his toys, somethings wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most played with toy ever bought!","review":"I bought this for my son's sixth birthday.

It stays together when playing with it, but my son loves to \\"blow it up\\" then put it back together. The pieces fit easily back together and can be reconfigured into many different designs.

The three pieces of the boat separate constantly, the rigging and railing pops right off, and the masts regularly fall over. There are a lot of small pieces, which are OK for him, but could be a problem for other young children.

He's a dextrous little guy, but this ship does not stay together despite help from an adult. The ship and accessory components are packaged in sections and must be assembled. Much of the assembly was easy enough for a child to do but, the toy wasn't fun because the sections of ship so not stay together when playing with the \\"finished\\" item. The masts fall off, and the main peices of the ship separate when you don't want them to. My son was so discouraged he asked if we could return it for a toy that \\"works right\\".

This is not the kind of book you can pick up and read cover to cover (unless insomnia is a real condition for you, in which case this book may help).

There is wealth of information in this book, if you can glean it out from inbetween the droning prose and historical diatribe.O'Reilly should be shamefully embarassed for ever letting this book go to print in the condition it is.

While I can't say it's actually missing important content, it is certainly the sloppiest O'Reilly book I've ever read. The very first example (on p. 6) is a glaringly ill-formed XML document (the second line contains spurious junk text, as if from a word-processing error), and it just continues from there.

Listen to the soundtrack all the way through with your eyes closed the first time you listen to it. You will find this to be incredibly sexual music. Though there are some words they don't distract and the delightful blend of exotic instrumentation (including human voices used in ways rarely heard outside of Indian Classical music) will inspire even the most timid.

Here is another fine score by Mychael Danna, with perhaps more emphasis on synth (which is not, by any means, a bad thing) than Kama Sutra, but this time from a disappointing, awful movie. I definitely agree with the other reviewer who compared it to Peter Gabriel's \\"Passion.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST BOOK I EVER READ","review":"not only was this the worst book I ever read, it was by far Steele's worst book ever written. I hope Steele's Klone that wrote this book is GONE and the real STEELE will return for a terrific comeback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Danielle really write this?","review":"My recollections: sparkly clothes, an alcholic bionic man, and tons and tons of pre-marital sex. I had to check the cover several times to see if Danielle was truly the author. I concede ... it had me laughing out loud several times, and I kinda wished I had a boyfriend like the outgoing, sparkly clone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Steel Yet!","review":"I'm usually the first of my friends to read a new Steel and then I pass the book along for the others to read. This time we didn't bother to go any further than myself. I don't know what Ms. Steel was thinking but she should stay with what we all know and love and leave the sci-fi & tech to those that write it regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"No wonder there were two copies available on the library shelf. It's not a good read. This book starts out okay but once the klone comes into the picture, its all downhill from there. Unbelievable & idiotic plot. I lost interest around chapter 4. The daughter was more mature than the mother. I didn't expect much from this book but it was worse than I thought. Thankfully I didn't buy this book & hopefully the next one is a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy - A waste of time","review":"My daughter needed a book to read for school. Never having read Danielle Steel before I gave her the book to read thinking it had to be a good comedy, all of Danielle Steel's books are good (I hadn't read it yet). After completing the book my daughter said she wasn't interested in reading anymore of Danielle Steel. Confused by her comments, I read the book and agreed with my daughter. The book is ridiculous and shallow. Now that Daniell Steel has tried comedy, she should go back to what she's good at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her best works.","review":"I didn't like the \\"Klone\\". I thought it was too far fetched a story. I love most of her books but this is at the bottom of my list."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted back the time it took me to read this book!","review":"I jumped on this book as I had every other Danielle Steele novel. Now I wish I had back the 4 hours it took me to read it. What a humongous waste of time! The story was ridiculous. I know that this is escapist reading but c'mon! Danielle Steele should stick to historical fiction - A Ghost Story was 100 time better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst novel ever.","review":"If I could rate this book zero stars I would. My mother and I both read her books and have always more than enjoyed them. However, we both bought this book on a mini-vacation and were horribly disappointed. Totally out of character for DS and utterly ridiculous. I am all for variety and a change of pace, but please."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was TERRIBLE!!!!!","review":"I have read every book Danielle Steel has written and this book is totally out of character for her. It is just silly and not very enjoyable at all. I am looking forward to reading Mirror Image, I hope it is as good as her old novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Storline, Bad Characters","review":"The story has no real point. It seems to go nowhere fast and gives us no real reasons to want to finish. Sorry .. but she can and has done much better in the past.

It lacks the characterization and thoughtful plot development"},{"rating":"1","title":"a dissapointing read","review":"I must confess - I have not completely read this book - I've struggled through 3 chapters and am only doing so out of loyalty to an author that I have followed since the begining of her career. This book can scarcely hold reader interest for more than 1 page at a time. The character names are annoying; I'm still waiting for something more interesting.Let's make this short and sweet - I hate this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, Spare me","review":"Being a huge fan of Danielle Steel's novels, I thougth she had learned her lesson with The Gif- her readers didn't care for those characters - they're dull and there was no there, there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget THIS","review":"A large online bookclub I'm in decided to read this book, heh, what a BIG mistake. Practically everyone hated this book, except this true die-hard Danielle Steel fan of ours.Hehe, to have some fun we all- yes ALL- of us decided to write a review for The Klone and I on Amazon.com, on the same day.

I read it all, but found no improvement by the end. I may never read again because of this! Okay, maybe that's a bit far, but this book was THAT bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE LOSS","review":"I am a huge Steel fan, and own all of her books - including this one, unfortunately. The characters are boring, and completely unsympathetic. You simply don't care about them, their lives or their careers. The characters are sophomoric and immature. They bumble through the plot. The plot revolves around divergent themes, that are never satisfactorily wrapped up. The book ends, leaving to many ends unexplained and completely without tie-in. Don't waste your money on the hardback edition, but I doubt they'll come out with a paper back for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe she put her name on this book of all things","review":"Somelse must have ghost written this horror for Steel. Or else she must not have been feeling well at the time. A klone! It was a klone who did this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Danielle Steel's best books","review":"Danielle Steel is one of my favorite authors, but this book seemed like two or three other books I've previously read.

IT WAS A MAJOR LETDOWN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had expected","review":"I haven't read Steel for many years. I bought this book with generally good memories of her previous works; I was very disappointed. A very quick yet superficial and disjointed read. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent but not as good as her last books","review":"I think that this book was totally predictable. You new what was going on by the first few chapters and the so-called surprise ending really wasn't a surprise at all because it was so predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"1star for the 1st half, 0 for the ending.","review":"I usually love DS, but this book was a major disappointment for me. I flew through the first half, thinking it was going to be a great read, but the last half was a complete let down. I hope she goes back to her surprise endings like in her older books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Time","review":"I generally enjoy Steel's books. However this one I only finished to find out if she had invented a quirky finish. I felt it was poorly researched, quite repetetive and seemed to have been written in a hurry..If you are a Steel fan this one can be skipped. There are many more good fiction books on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and Predictable","review":"I have always been a fan of Steels's. After reading the reviews in the publishing journals for The Klone and I, I fully expected to enjoy it. Now before you read the following, I have to admit that I am not the world's best judge of good writing and plots and been know to enjoy the trashiest of novels (I select fiction for a public library and am known as the Trash Queen for what I order). I finished the book but was quite annoyed with myself for doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up To Steels' Usual Standards","review":"As with all of her books, I eagerly awaited her latest work, and boy was I ever disappointed for the first time in all the years I've been reading her! While it is a thin,fast reading book, the plot-line was very easy to figure out. It is as if she just wanted to submit a quick story to his publisher but didn't really bother to go over it and polish it up. Sorry, but this was a true waste of time (and money). Hopefully her next will be back to her usual fine storytelling best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book for all possible costs","review":"Not the ususal Danielle Steel type of book but I did enjoyed it very much"},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining read","review":"I've read tons of books by Steel and I found this one to be completely different from her usual style of writing. In fact, this unusual change or style is extremely fresh, novel and witty. I do not understand why the ratings given by readers were so low. However, I am glad that I wasn't perturbed by them. So, for you guys out there, if you're looking for a quick read which can lighten and brighten up your days with grins, pick this book and you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This Baby For Your Sanity","review":"I borrowed this book on tape from the library for a long drive across the state. I had only read a few Daniel Steel books and I thought the book would at least relieve me from the boredom and monotony of the drive. The only thing I was relieved of was reality. I can't believe an author would intentionally make their main character so ignorant and unbelievable. Why is this \\"heroine\\" satisfied to play victim in her idiot boyfriend's plot to subject her to his alter ego? Is this type of character what women really want to read about? The only redeeming side of this book was to share it with my co-workers and laugh about how ridiculous the plot and characters were. I often wonder what other motorists thought as they passed me protesting out loud in my car at how stupid the characters and plot was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing it's still on the bestseller list","review":"Okay, I'm guilty. I read this book when it first came out in hardback. What I can't understand is WHY it's still on the bestseller list! Look at the reviews. They're terrible! Aren't people reading them or are they just buying the book just because it's Danielle Steel? Get a life people, buy good books by good authors, not terrible books just because it's by Danielle Steel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"This book was not only a total waste of time, it was a senseless waste of the lumber it took to create the paper it was written on. By far the worst book I have ever had the misfortune of purchasing. Amazon...this book is not worthy of even one star but that was the least you allow us to give."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steel's worst ever!","review":"I am a Danielle Steel fan, therefore I just coudn t believe that she had written this lausy book!I am just sorry that I ever bought this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book gets my top honor of....","review":"...the stupidest book I have ever read. I kept waiting for the book that would have a different plot from all the others she has written, and this is what we got. Needless to say, this was the straw that broke that camel's back and I will never read another Danielle Steel book ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Klone and I","review":"All in all I thought it was a good story. Four star rating instead of five due to the fact that the whole book is written in first person. I found that hard to get use to and a little annoying to read at times. But I loved the ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame as hell","review":"this book was pretty bad.. IT had no story point and i think the things with the klones was stupid. But i gave it another star just because she is danielle steel , and she is the shizzel..hey we all make mistakes..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booorrrringgg","review":"This book was so boring and lacked all descency that are normally in Steel's books. If you like a NICE love story don't read this or you will be greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is she kidding?","review":"I've read nearly every one of Danielle Steel's vast collection of novels...and this is \\"hands down\\" the VERY WORSE piece of garbage she's ever written. What a joke! It was as if one of Ms Steel's enemies broke into her house and forced her to write this mess!Don't bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Klone and I","review":"I had to see what others thought,that's why I signed on here... This has the be one of the worst books I have read in years... Do hope that there isn't anything seriously wrong with Daniele Steel. I once was a fan of hers and read most of her novels until I found myself bored with the plots and the words became repetitious.... I always laughed when I came across the much used word CHARGRIN... think that's when I switched to other writers for my pleasure... back to this one... I am shocked that it was ever published... if I wasn't laid up with a sprained ankle I am sure I never would have continued to the end of the story, it was that bad...The only saving grace was that I bought the book at a garage sale.. for .50... way, way, overpriced though... my daughter just informed me she is starting a book by Danille Steele... \\"The Cottage\\", for her sake I do hope that it is of some value.... as for me, doubt, I would ever try another of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Klone and I: A High-Tech Love Story","review":"This was truly the worst book I've ever read. The characters were unbelievable and the story line was absurd. The characters had bad attitudes and I wouldn't even want to know these people. I tried to get into the story line but couldn't draw myself into it because it was so insane. I was also disappointed in the writers repetition of rhetorical questions and inability to move on with the thought process.Just to give you a taste, there was a klone of a perfect mate that was made of wires etc. Steph has great sex with this klone as they do triple and quadruple flips throughout their sexual encounters. Steph thinks she has to make a choice between this wired klone and the real thing. I've read some of Danielle's good work but I can't believe they published this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"it not a danielle steel book","review":"I love to read Danielle Steel but this book was a total shock. I did not like it all. Too weird for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a crazy story","review":"i have read almost of all of danielle steel's books, and this definitely was one of her worst. after reading such a great story as The Long Road Home, which i thought was her best, i feel she must have just plain run out of ideas. i found myself chuckling at the story because it was so far-fetched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awlful!","review":"I have read all of Danielle Steels books and am an avid fan of hers. I always purchase her books in hardback the minute they are on the shelf: as I did with this book. For the first time ever, I just hated her work. I kept reading it in the hope it would get better. No luck. It's unrealistic, gimmicky, boring, and a waste of money. I took the book back. Listen to your readers and forget this new form."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Danielle Steel book written","review":"Do not waste your time ( even the 1 hour it took to read it was too much!). The premise is preposterous and though it started out fine, it very quickly deteriorated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money; go to the library","review":"The book is a creative idea but Danielle Steel copped out at the end. I was very disappointed. Usually I like her books. Save your money and wait for a friend to buy it so you can borrow it. But then again, you can't get your time back from reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding, Ms. Steel!","review":"Unfortunately I'm extremely backlogged on my reading and currently have 5 Danielle Steel books in the cue. I just finished \\"The Klone and I\\" and have lost my enthusiasm for my marathon Steel sessions. Do I dare pick up another one of her books on the off chance that it will just as disappointing? My advise is to steer clear of this outlandish fantasy. It is too far out there to be believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book","review":"This book was plain old horrible. There's no other way to explain how it was, it was just BAD. Really truely BAD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book. You have been warned.","review":"My advice to anyone that has not already bought this book is to borrow it or check it out at the library. The best advice would be to get a summary of what happened, (which is not much) and wait and see what the next book brings. By way of buying the books with my money you're selling yourself out. If more readers would do the same, maybe authors would think twice about releasing garbage to make money."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT UP TO PAR!!!!!","review":"I have been a huge Steel fan for 15 years. I must say I have been disappointed with her last few books...and now this!!! It was written at about a 5th grade level."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I paid money for this book.","review":"I will never believe that Danielle Steel actually wrote this book. How can the same woman who gave us such depth and intrigue and perfection in previous works allow her name be attached to this? With each new book released, the quality goes downhill. I will be hard-pressed to EVER read another Danielle Steel novel. This latest was absolute drivel. It really hurts, too. The story is there, but it just was not written with the quality that I know her is capable of. I am not exaggerating. I have every single work of his, in hardback, and buy each new work the day it is released. I feel like I have been sucker-punched. They released a book with her name, just so her fans would buy it blindly. I did. I won't again. I will definitely preview first, with my own two eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worn out theme and totally predictable","review":"I was very disappointed in Steel's latest outing.

I had the entire story figured out by the time I reached page 50."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too, shallow","review":"I started out enjoying the suspense Steel offered with his earlier books, however the last three disappointed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The same old DS stuff.","review":"This book is a typical DS stuff. The main twist in the plot is on an very weak foundation. Expected more out out of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO TOLD THIS WOMAN SHE COULD WRITE??","review":"Talk about writing for the simple-minded. And did someone say, \\"surprise ending?\\" I had it all figured out by the end of the first chapter, INCLUDING the so-called exciting climax. This story has already been done--about a hundred times! Maybe that's why it is so predictable? Anyway, it reminded me of why I've never cared for Danielle Steele's books. I'll never read another one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"Steel writes great stuff that keeps you on the edge of your seat. This one seems to cheat. What is going on in this book ?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not on the same level as some of Steel's other books.","review":"The Klone and I was a bit disappointing. It might be a fine light read, but don't expect anything on the level with The Ghost or The Long Road Home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb and Dumber","review":"I have to agree with others when I say \\"1 star\\" for this book is \\"1 star\\" too many! Ms. Steel should go back and review her earlier works!! Read \\"The Long Road Home\\" by Danielle Steel. That was her more recent GREAT book! The Klone had a totally unbelievable premise and was a waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: STAND CLEAR AT LEAST 100 YARDS AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!","review":"As a newly devoted Daniell Steel fan, I was very disappointed to read this book, which seemed to be written at a third grade level. The plot and characters were weak, and the idea of falling in love with a cloned robot was repulsive to me. The only reason I gave this book a one star was because it was the absolute lowest rating I could give."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment.","review":"I think that Mrs. Steel rushed a little too much with this one. The only reason I gave it a one-star rating was because it was the lowest possible score I could give. As a new dedicated Danielle Steel reader, I was disappointed that, unlike her other books, this one was very weak. When I first heard of this book, I ran to the library and read it, but was thoroughly bored once I started reading it. I hoped it would get better by the end, but unfortunately, it didn't. Try again, Mrs. Steel."},{"rating":"1","title":"i did not like it at all. i was disappointed.","review":"danielle steel is a wonderful author and i look forward to reading her books but this one was terrible,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperate for income?","review":"I think it's been said - thank God - by a number of readers in different ways: \\"What was Danielle Steel thinking when she wrote this?\\" Did she need the money that badly? I have always enjoyed her novels even though the endings are becoming more and more predictable, because they allow me to escape and fantasize just a little. I couldn't even finish this, because the premise was so way out! Leave science fiction to the science fiction writers, Danielle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Even bother to buy this book","review":"If you're going to read this book, don't. Just avoid it, even a die-hard Steel fan should not be exposed to such trash like this. Well, now that I think about it ALL of her books are trash, but I have enjoyed a few of her books, a FEW, excluding this one of course, it was terribly dull and common."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waisted time and money","review":"The story was the most silly and childish book that I ever read from this writer. Most dissapointed for a Danielle Steel novel. I had never had a book from Danielle Steel that I did not love but this one I don't know what else to say, bad, bad, bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Danielle thinking?","review":"I love Danielle Steel books. She has created some great female characters that I love being part of but I don't have a clue what she was thinking when she wrote this book. I can't give this book any stars. I kept reading thinking that somehow she would tie it all in together in a sensible fashion but she didn't. The main character has an affair with a clone? Please! I read until the end but I regretted sticking around so long!!!!! I only wished I hadn't bought the hardback and wasted so much money. Too far out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money.","review":"Aside of \\"Four Blondes\\" by Candice Bushnell, this is hands down THE WORST book I have ever read. If you like Danielle Steel (as I do) you will be sorely disappointed. I felt as though she had made a committment to write a book by a certain date and cranked this one out in one evening while drunk. The story about a clone could have been interesting, had it been written more believably. Don't waste your time. If you want to read a good Danielle Steel, read \\"The Ghost\\" (my personal favorite) or \\"Summer's End\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Having problems to go to sleep?? This book's for you!","review":"I really am a big fan of Danielle Steel's books, but was I disappointed by this one! I looks as though she had to edit a book, no matter the content. I really didn't find the style I usually love, and the story really is bad. What is the point of telling us about bionic aerobics?? It doesn't sound real at all. Usually, i don't let her books down until it is finished, but i really had a hard time finishing this one, and to be honest, i didn't give a damn about the end of the book. If you are fans of Steel's books, do not read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A biotech failure","review":"Just like Ms. Steels other books, this also strives for a happy and fairy tale ending. But I have to sadly admit, that it was a miserable biotech mistake. The plot is living in super hi-tech times, as well as going about with daily chores like car pools and bluberry muffins. I couldn't decide the time frame this story was set in. It was a mistake trying to mix technology to that extend with simple household affairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZzZzZzZzZzZzZz","review":"I picked this book up at a used bookstore, hoping it would provide me with an hour or two of entertainment. Was I EVER wrong! I just couldn't get past the first chapter. Was it redundant or what? Boohoo. Her gold-digger husband leaves her. But she doesn't love him. But she did love him. But she doesn't anymore. He was her best friend, but he's not anymore. Over and over and over, Ms. Steele repeats herself. After Chapter One I was sure that she would continue with the same mindless repetitive junk. If Ms. Steele continues to write lackluster paperbacks, I'll stick with other writers. Maybe it's time for her to retire!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Entertainment","review":"The Klone And I is a silly story of a love triangle between Stephanie,Peter and Peter's clone,Paul.The novel is simply outrageous and provides mindless entertainment.Too bad that this book got published.This is arguably the worst Danielle Steel novel I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Klone\\" really?","review":"I first read this book a few years ago but I remember the plot and characters quite well. I wish very much that I didn't. It was boring and definitely uninspiring. It wasn't original and had no plot whatsoever and the characters had absolutely no depth. What in the world was Danielle thinking? I was just relieved that it was a very short book so I could finally be done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever","review":"Haven't read any of Danielle Steel's books in a long time because I was tired of the same old story over and over again. I decided to give her another try and picked this one up used. Waste of my $3.00, waste of my time spent reading it. Horrible story line, predictable main character again. Will never read another of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it half a star? Or less?","review":"This book was a complete disappointment and I wish I could get the hours of my life back that I wasted on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steel should be embarrased: Clone lovers?","review":"I am mystified why Steel would try to design a bionic robot that acts as normally and performs as well in bad as a real man. Yes, Steel has done this. There is Peter, a nice guy and high-tech manufacturer. Stephanie falls for Peter. Peter has to go away. He sends an identical Peter, whosename is Paul to take his place. Paul is a robot with a heart. She can hardly tell the two apart. The time frame is hard to follow. Weeks seem to pass without notice but also things go so fast that keeping track ishard. Her concluding chapter is a mockery of confusion and deception.Save your money. Look to Vickie Thompson or Debra Webb for romance andintrigue. Read MESSAGE FROM NAM. My favorite Steel book, especiallyappropriate around Easter, Thanksgiving or the gift giving seasons isTHE GIFT. Save your penny and postage."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Tech & Funny","review":"I thought this was a very bizarre book. But, I did enjoy it. I sat at the pool and laughed all the way through it. I thought the ending was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I borrowed it from the public library.","review":"Danielle Steel has her moments, and this wasn't one of them! I read the book in under five hours--including time out for dinner--and was glad it didn't take me longer. The first two chapters were great! They reminded me of a couple I know who had similar problems. After that, the book became a cop-out and silly. She tried had to rehash her own worn out storylines and thought she'd be cute by making the Klone be bionic! Hasn't Danielle read anything about the capabilites of today's cloning? Boring! Don't waste the time unless you have a specific need to read all her titles--and borrow if from the library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow from the library. Don't spend your own money.","review":"I am a big Daniel Steel fan and was anxiously awaiting the opportunity to read her latest, The Klone and I. Although this was a very easy read it was NOT one of Steel's best. The plot was very unrealistic (even though cloning is big in the news) which made it hard to keep reading. Many of the events were very predictable and not much \\"action\\" was happening. This book was not like many of Steel's other best selling books, Silent Honor or The Long Road Home, which were hard to put down. Hopefully her next book will be better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally a waste of time","review":"One of the worst books I've ever read.

She usually gets to the emotions of people and it's good escape reading. I love technology; but Steel's use of it is out of place. I was so sorry I purchased this one! It is awful!

Danielle Steel needs to regroup; go to a sunny island with the love of her life; or at the very least, re-read her earlier works. Sad, sad, sad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a book of nonsense and a complete disappointment.","review":"I was extremely disappointed by this book. I had to force myself to finish it.

I read her other short work, THE GIFT, and liked it. I wasn't expecting another teenage story. This book was AWFUL.

PASS this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon wouldn't let me give no stars!!","review":"I'm glad that I got this from the library instead of spending my money on it. The heroine of this book has no redeeming qualities; I was rooting against her for the entire book. Every plot 'twist' was screamingly obvious. The characters were under-developed, and a huge suspension of disbelief was required to buy into the whole story. I think this is the last Steel book that I will read."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLUFF!!!","review":"This the first (and last) time I have read a Danielle Steel book. Talk about waste. This book is written for people that have a 5 second attention span. There is NO development of characters. The author glosses over months/years of time by saying... \\"Five months later\\"... or \\"It had now been three years...\\" This book reminds me of a Melrose Place episode...a lot of action, no substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Predictable!","review":"This book is an utter disappointment! It deviated from the usual suspenseful and riveting works of Steel. The plot and the characters are very predictable.This book is a waste of time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"forget it!","review":"I have always enjoyed Steel's books in the past...but forget this one!

The dialogue is trite and the relationships \\"old\\". It is more an expose on alternative lifestyles. I certainly hope the author can refresh herself next \\"go around\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steel has gotten all too predictable.","review":"This book has convinced me to give up on Danielle Steel altogether. I loved her books, but this book has fallen into a predictable pattern and no longer interest me at all. What I most dislike about these books (and, unfortunately, this goes back to her earlier ones also--even though it didn't bother me as much then) is the way the female ALWAYS gets into danger herself toward the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cause of Death: Weak ending.","review":"Good beginning, a lot of distracting characterizations in the middle, and Steel's affliction for bad endings caused the death of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor!!!","review":"a story with a neurotic self-obsessed woman.

A boring story and uninteresting characters make you wonder how you managed to finish the book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A deplorable book about a silly, venal woman","review":"I have never read a Danielle Steele book, and was appalled by \\"The Klone & I\\". What could possibly be romantic, or even amusing, about a woman who claims to love one man but is sleeping with another (even if he is a \\"Klone\\"), lies to her children about it; accepts extremely expensive gifts from the Klone that she knows were charged to the boyfriend, has no job, hobby or any apparent purpose in life, and is stupid in addition to being venal? This book is so amoral that I, an atheist, was just repulsed. Pure trash and poorer fiction!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a very stupid story.","review":"I found the story unbelievable and stupid. The Klone was very unappealing, and the descriptions of how he dressed were a big turnoff. He just seemed like a big loser. I couldn't believe that a woman would accept expensive gifts from the Klone, knowing that her real love would end up paying for them. It was as if Stephanie was 13 years old when she was with the Klone, without any brains at all. I've read most of DS's books, and enjoy most of them. This seemed to have no romance at all. I finished the book only because I was hoping it would get better, which it didn't. The ending was predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definantly Different","review":"This book started out ok but into the fifth chapter it got a little bit ridiculous, that's when I stopped reading it. I have read a numerous amount of her books and this one is the worst yet. It was so predictable.

I read all of Danielle Steel's books and this was one of her worst and most generic text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst piece of writing I have ever read.","review":"First of all, her research was poor in certain areas. The drug Depakote is used for seizures and for Bipolar [Manic-Depressive] Disorder. What the psychiatrist in this poorly written novel should have ordered for the main character in this book was an anti-psychotic drug, not Depakote. Her grammar was poor, the story too loosely written, and her attempt at humor was sour. The only redeeming quality was that she didn't use her well-worn phrase 'huge blue eyes' at all in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literature, it aint!","review":"This had to be in my bottom 10 of all the books I have read in the 42 years of my life as an adult. The plot was not well defined. The characters were handicapped by their author. And the surprise, just wasn't one, after the \`100th page. Oh, by the way, the writing was atrocious. What could her editor have been thinking??? The scariest thing about the book is that I gullibly paid $6.00 to read it. I had to give the book one star after trying to write this with no stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Danielle Steele's style","review":"I am a collector of Danielle Steel's books. All are hardbounds, but 4. I guess you can tell by that, that I am a big Danille Steel fan, but I COULD NOT take this book. I read 3 paragraphs and will trade it in to the used book store I go to.

I'll make sure I come here to check the reviews before I ever buy a book again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER AGAIN","review":"I read this book because I received it from Doubleday bookclub and neglected to return it initially, as I normally would have. It sat in my laundry room for a year, but out of curiosity (and an open mind for supporting writers, whatever the genre), I read it. I will NEVER read another Danielle Steele book. Since reading The Klone and I, I've heard that Ms. Steele employs ghost writers to pen some of her many stories. That might even be more inexcusable than actually writing such slop. \\"Writing\\" like this is an insult to readers. If you like romance, read Nora Roberts or Barbara Taylor Bradford. Another good author for romance readers is Maeve Blinchy.

She must be running out of stories, if she has to write about a woman who falls in love with a man and his klone. I was so disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Klone and I","review":"Being a Danielle Steel fan, I was disappointed. This book is definitely not worth the read. I felt like I was reading something from The Twilight Zone. However, I will continue to purchase her books. Let's hope she doesn't have writer's block."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have ever read. Ever.","review":"This book was awful. An effort to combine science fiction and romance. I also do not believe Danielle Steele wrote this. I have to wonder, does someone else write her books? This cannot compare to her earlier novels, some of which were very good. I was very disappointed. It was extremely far-fetched, silly and unbelievable, and could not even qualify as decent science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"fast reading for an obvious reason","review":"Danielle Steel is a funny writer, as far as I know after reading \\"The Klone and I: A high-tech Love Story.\\" She's funny because she thinks readers are dumb and gullible enough to buy her too-simple-to-describe plot... First of all, there is few description about cloning technology... I don't think so... Just imagine a clone arrives at the door of an ordinary house in suburban America. The female character should have called CNN first and the world should know about what's happening to the human race facing the dreadful consequences of irresponsible cloning scientists. It's very funny in the quirkiest way I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not DS at her best.","review":"I love Danielle Steel's work but this was not my type of enjoyable reading. Funny in the beginning I could not get a grasp of the concept that anyone could make a person so perfect as to make you believe they were real i.e. skin, hair, eyes, brain. heart. I guess that was my bottom line. It was not believable.It was definitely a step out of the ordinary for DS."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Klone and I","review":"A real disappointment by Danielle Steele. Not anything like any of her other books (and I have read them all) The storyline was so totally ridiculous and far fetched I even got tired of the humor that I assume was the point. No substance, no message. no heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"How I am enjoying this book","review":"I got right into this book. I do think that it is really strange. The plot is more than I expected. I have not finished it yet, but I am excited to find out what happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughing out loud!!!","review":"First, let me start by saying that Karen from South Carolina. Danielle Steel is a she, not a he. No wonder you didn't like this book. I thought it was great! You people that are saying \\"did she need money this bad\\" and all the other negative things, have you ever written a novel? Isn't Danielle Steel entitled to write whatever she wants? I doubt anyone twisted your arms to read this. I was laughing out loud when I was reading this. I loved Paul! Who cares that it was shallow. It was funny! Sure it isn't typical Steel, but I will continue to read every book she writes, and ESPECIALLY if there are more like this one!!!! Lighten up people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time and Money","review":"I have read all of Steele's books, and this is by far, without doubt, the worst book I have ever read bar none.As I read the book I felt that she was making fun of her readers (i.e. I can write pure junk and they will still buy it). I absolutely hated the constant references to brand names. I bet she used the words \\"Dr. Pepper\\" one hundred times in the first three chapters and in later chapters she refers to the \\"quadruple flip\\" over and over again. How stupid does she think we are?Lastly, the whole klone idea was just ridiculous. There was not one believable idea in this whole book. She has one more chance before I count myself out of her fan base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this anyway","review":"I have read every Steel book at least once and own most of them in hardback. I was surprised that I was able to get this from the library. Now I know why. No one else wanted to read it. It was the worse one she has written. She should stick to history and away from the future. Zoya was one of the best. Ghost was different, but still very enjoyable. Try again, Danielle"},{"rating":"1","title":"The absolute worst steele has ever written","review":"I have read all d. steele's books and for the most part have enjoyed her earlier books. They were easy and enjoyable reads. What in the world has happened....her last few books have been awful. After reading her last books, I have sworn that I will never read another one again. I wish I had listened to myself and not bothered to read the Klone & I. I did not find it \\"wickedly funny\\" and the book was full of much unnecesarry repetative narrative...if she mentioned the triple flips one more time...... While her books are always \\"easy reads\\"--lately she seems to be writing at a level directed to readers whom she must feel have a low IQ. C'mon, Danielle, give us little more credit. If you must read this...please don't waste your money..borrow it from a friend or the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this book","review":"This book was so bad that I couldn't get past the first 30 pages or so. I wish I could get my money back. The whole plot was so absolutely ridiculous that I found myself shaking my head in disbelief as I read page after moronic page. Who is Danielle Steel trying to kid? Her readers deserve MUCH better than this. It is my personal opinion that her books have gotten progressively worse. The last 3 novels have been extremely shallow and uninteresting. The Klone And I is proof that she should stop cranking out the novels at the rate of 2 or 3 a year. She should be embarassed to have even had this book published!!! I hope that Danielle reads all of these reviews and saves herself the embarassment of another such disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"well beneath Steele's standards","review":"Like others, I am a huge fan and buy her books as soon as they come out. I am sorry to have spent my money on this one. The only good it will be is as part of my collection. I would not recommend it or lend it out. I guess Ms. Steele finds it hard to come up with new ideas, but it wasn't necessary to go to such extremes. I will continue to read your books because I know how talented you are, please don't try your hand at sci-fi again, leave that to Stephen King."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worse book she has written--completely stupid.","review":"I have read all her books and this one is so rediculous I didn't even want to finish it.

I will be leary about buying her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fulfilling, Not the Usual, Not one of the better books","review":"I liked how this book was in a shorter format than her usual long novels. This is not one of my favorites, but I did enjoy it a bit. I didn't care for the clone plot and the romance was stale.I love the historicals like \\"The Ghost\\", and that leads me to continue cheering her on and buying her books.This story, was too unbelievable to be even fun. It was drawn out and boring. The beginning was good, it kept my interest, I wanted to see what would happen next... then the Klone entered the picture and it went down hill from there.

I should have taken the advice of many readers and critics, and saved myself the expense and effort of having this book shipped across many thousand miles to me. How disappointing!

I wish I had never read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"greatly disappointed","review":"I looked forward to reading The Klone and I, because I had so enjoyed Steels's previous novels. Part of the enticement to continue reading a book, however, is an identification with the characters. In this case, there wasn't any. There was none forthcoming. Instead, I kept on wishing they would use their native intelligence, rather than pure emotion (or in Steel's world, the scent or essence of emotion). I actually kept on reading just to see if they would come to their senses!! I was keenly disappointed, and in the end, their fates did not concern me. That is the ultimate failure of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mas o menos","review":"I really thought this book was going to go somewhere and as I got closer to the end, I was waiting for a great climax to the story.

Ms. Steel is clearly desperate to sell -- and quality be damned.

Outside of the first couple of chapters which were, indeed, very witty, this book is a complete farce. Steel is obviously out of ideas and borrowed this from some bizarre sci-fi publication - or she is now trying to compete with current authors who have surpassed her in originality and research in their subjects. It's only saving grace is that it was just 245 pages. My rule that if I start a book I should finish it kept me from throwing this in the trash - which is where it now rests.If this book was meant as a joke -- then the joke's on us - for contributing money to Ms. Steel and receiving nothing in return.

It's a good starting point for a novice but can be rather dry text book reading. Groz doesn't advocate a particular investment approach, and only briefly touches on some basic financial calculations toward the end, so if you're looking for a grand theory of market behavior or some serious number crunching this is not the book for you.

What the author does with it though is very confusing. I have not found one chapter that was fully developped or even well understood.

This is an interesting idea, but the author of a book such as this needs to have background in both physics and theology, and O'Murchu has little to say about classical theology and no knowledge of any kind of science. The list of scientists he has consulted is impressive (including David Bohm, Stephen Hawking, and Paul Davies), but it would appear that he threw out everything they told him; the book is filled with misinformation and outright lies about quantum mechanics. Beyond this, O'Murchu constantly invokes \\"energy fields\\" and \\"forces\\" all of which are undocumented in science but factor heavily in New Age type beliefs. In short, O'Murchu has no idea what he is talking about, and his writing makes for a nonsensical book that is filled with non-sequiturs and poorly explained reasoning."},{"rating":"1","title":"make the connection","review":"Having read perhaps sixty or seventy books concerning quantum phenomena, I was eager to enlarge my horizons with this one. Now that I have read it twice, I am still searching for some indication that the author has found a connection between theology (I grant him expertise in this) and quantum anything. In fact, though it is merely implicit, he makes the naive error of considering the quantum as something large, when semi-informed lay readers know that the quantum is the smallest measurable amount of energy. thebigo@gte.net"},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible text","review":"If there is one book that will expand your definition of God, it is this one. The author manages to breathe new life into Christian theology, no easy task in these days of stultified dogma and mindless tradition, using the findings of quantum physics to express a new, and far more empowering and life-affirming, perspective on the fundamentals of Christianity. It is not just Christians who will profit from reading this book. Anybody who has even the vaguest interest in things spiritual will find something, some concept or idea, that resonates with their current beliefs hopefully showing that whatever we hold to be true, we are all partly right. After all, all religions and beliefs are simply different paths up the same mountain and Quantum Theology describes that mountain like no other book I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Donna Fargo CD.","review":"Numerous Fargo hits updated to CD format.

We still enjoy playing the hot seat together as well as separately conquering the game.This new installment adds some more features and characters to it. Which equates to more fun. New leaders add another bit of that fun spice to the game. Graphics are awesome. We use an iMac and love the way the whole thing looks. We have watched all of the \\"wonders\\" videos and still find that we like to re-watch them every time we play.For people who enjoy strategy games this is a must as far as expansion packs go. If you don't have Civ IV yet get it and enjoy it.I gave this game 4 stars for the fact that there is always room to expand."},{"rating":"1","title":"end of game is slow, requires disc","review":"you will need to have the disc to start this game. a bummer when you're on a laptop on the road and you just want to play a video game. most people don't carry around the cds that come with their software anymore. it also doesn't stop people from copying games illegally or cracking them to use without discs (do a google search).that said, the game play is good, the graphics are nice, but the end game gets to be pretty slow moving. i have a fairly recent macbook pro and this game gets really sluggish as there are more units and map revealed. kind of sad since that's when it gets more interesting.buy world of warcraft instead. this game is a poor port to the mac platform."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for mSata SSD's","review":"I received them in time, they are correct size as advertised.

I really don't understand how a work of FICTION can be criticized for inaccuracies. But I won't dwell. Ms. Jalavits paints a bleak picture, one sure to disturb some readers. But it certainly is enjoyable and rewarding reading when judged on whether it is well-written, interesting, compelling and moving.

Offensive? Yes. But not entirely inaccurate. This is not your \\"feel good summer beach read.\\"This is the kind of book that comes out of writers' workshops. Overwrought and over-long with symbolism overwhelming story at every turn of page.Mineral Palace is bleak and tedious. Too many plot points end up being pointless. And how do such cardboard characters withstand such raging duststorms?As a work of fiction, I don't care whether this is an accurate depiction of Pueblo in the 30s. I do care that I was lured into this town with the promise of a good story and left with just a few stunning images (The Buffalo Mass Suicide)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Misfire","review":"Stripped to its basics, this novel amounts to little more than a series of concocted images of the macabre--all, I assume, to build a menacing atmosphere in an otherwise common-place story of an unhappy marriage. The effect, sadly, is the opposite. Rather than shudder at each pointed reference to blood, pus, feces, scabs, roadkill,and prosthetic limbs, the sheer redundancy of these images became an irritating distraction and prompted me to abandon the book halfway. Where, I wondered, were the editor's red pens, good sense, and bottles of white-out?..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and inaccurate","review":"I grew up in Pueblo and was a teenager during the 1930's. I bought this book with the great expectation that wonderful memories from my growing up years would send me down nostalgia lane. There was abosolutely no similarity to the Pueblo I know and remember in the novel.With the exception of a few familiar names like Gast the characters were far different from the people I knew well. The Gast's were neighbors of mine. They were well respected in the community and beloved by all who knew them. Julavits depicts Pueblo as being in the dust bowl. In the 55 years that I lived there, I do not recall one single dust storm as she described. I guess if you are going to write fiction, you may as well make everything up.The story itself was difficult to follow because her style of dreamy surreality was boring. The plot was weak and the storyline odd and very depressing. Sorry Miss Julavits, your first attempt was a stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I kept hoping this book would redeem itself. Line after line, page after page I was disappointed. The writing wasn't bad but the story itself simply did not work. It was as if the author tried to force every scene and character into some bizarre and glum mold. I enjoy many genres and have read tragic but compelling stories. The only tragedy about this one is that I wasted time reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling and haunting but a tad overdone","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Bena is a complex and believable character, and her psychological journey is spookily mirrored by the barren landscape and the unpredictable weather she faces in Pueblo, Colorado of the 1930s. I wonder, though, if the symbolism isn't a bit too much; in some ways, I think the book might have been stronger without the overdrawn picture of the abandoned and rotting mineral palace. Still, the author deals with many essential questions about the nature of male-female relationships and the limits on honesty in such a relationship. A great book for a book club discussion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mineral Palace","review":"This book was so filled with erroneous information that I couldn't focus on the author's craftsmanship. Although this was an Oprah book and received excellent critical reviews I was extremely offended by Miss Julavits' lack of responsible research. She wrote a book about a real town and real people but she distorted the facts. I lived in the town in l934 when the book was set and there was no resemblance to the actual town of Pueblo, Colorado or the people who lived there. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reader","review":"Ms Julavits should have, at least, visited Colorado prior to writing this novel. I am a native of Colorado Springs and found the description of that area very objectionable. Her description of Pueblo was even worse. Perhaps had I not been from this area I may have found the book to be a fair read--but perhaps not. The characters just weren't believable. I purchased the book because I wanted to read a book about the history of Pueblo. I knew it was a novel, but the majority of (good) historical novels have some basis in reality. I was very disappointed that this one did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"some truth, please?","review":"...another book hyped by pal Dave Eggers here on Amazon, a site glitch revealed last year.

Ooh--first one to spot Zadie Smith's wins! I just love this bold new 'indy' alternative to publishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing her trademark","review":"Julavits is certainly an unusual author. She's not the best at making believable, relatable characters, and she doesn't quite succeed in pulling the reader in to the story -- usually you feel more like a disjointed spectator.However, she does a fabulous job of playing these little mind games with you that make you question your own reality, question people's motives, and ultimately makes the book almost an interactive experience to the text because your interpretation of events affects the story that takes place.She did an excellent job of this in The Effect Of Living Backwards, and a decent job in The Uses of Enchantment. Unfortunately, this book contained the shortcomings of her writing without the strengths. You still feel a lack of empathy for the characters and a disjointedness from the setting, but the story is missing her trademark psychological elements. I guess it didn't become her trademark until later."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull and unrealistic story.","review":"How is it that a dying town, ravaged by the harshness of the physical and economic climate of the 1930's, managed to support a seemingly thriving prostitution business? And was there a faithful spouse in Pueblo? It appears not. The characters of Bena and Ted were odd and quite unbelievable. One wonders how they ever got together at all.Julavits has placed far too much emphasis on the physical side of human nature. The characters are mostly portrayed in psycho-sexual terms and very little else.The plot meanders far too long and the ending is flat as the Colorado plains."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the WORST books ever.","review":"The only reason I finished this book was to see if something interesting was EVER going to happen.

Sally Mavor shares her best ideas for designing whimsical characters and shows how to display them to their full advantage. The directions are clear and easy to follow. The pictures are lovely.

Have you been a Christian for some time, and you want to deep, really deep, with God? This set of books (now sold as a bundle of the original three volumes) is an excellent place to start.Lewis and Demarest have taken a six-step approach to analyzing topics ranging from \\"God: An Active and Personal Spirit\\" through a detailed examination of \\"Salvation by Faith.\\" The reader is not only pointed to the scriptures, but to history and church tradition. Common doctrinal objections are also presented and defended. Finally, the remaining truths are presented and applied to the Christian life.This isn't a book to sit and read in an afternoon or a week. It's a book to study, to learn and to help you grow deep in your faith.Scott Advan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Referance piece","review":"Integrative Theology is one of the better theological resources because it doesn't just focus on one aspect. Most Theology books look at a system, a few focus on the biblical data on a specific issue. For each issue, Demarest and Lewis run through half a dozen formulations for the issue at hand, followed by a summary of the Biblical texts, and conclude with a systematic formulation and sections on apologetics and application. While the volumes do not cover as broad a range of topics as some comparable works, the depth in which the important issues are covered is difficult to understate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great idea but it lacks rigor","review":"I am so thankful these men have developed the \\"integrative\\" approach to theology. It is a major step forward.However, there are so many, many, many flaws, biases, and unsubstantiated statements within the three volumes. In short, it lacks rigor. But, then again, most theologies and commentaries are more a reflection of the author's position, than a rigorous presentation of the evidence.Buy the book and study it, because it brings so much information and analysis to bear on the points. However, read the book critically and analytically, because it often pontificates rather than reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Yannick!","review":"I love this CD and so do my kids!

He's a nice guy and his music is light, fun and pleasant to listen to even if you don't speak French."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"City of Villains is way more graphic intensive than City of Heroes, trust me, I know. I've suffered with lag in CoV until I got a new computer, and lag is gone. It is a great game, but i prefer CoH more because it is more populated, and you need to team more in CoH to level. CoV is focused more on damage (i.e. the inherent powers boost up the damage of every arch-type in CoV). in CoH, the inherent powers are usually about teams, well some of them anyhow. I do enjoy playing CoV because I believe it has better powers, but I only bought it so I could use some special features only available to CoH&CoV owners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must have internet connection","review":"This game is very fun to play. But you must have an internet connection in order to play it period.

I found the CoV gameplay to be extremely repetitive and chaotic. I also found the amount of supergroup/team spammed invites without so much as a 'hey' in-game tell to be infinitely bothersome. Maybe under different circumstances I could have enjoyed it - but it just didn't match up to world of warcraft...

Many people run around asking you for sex on this game if you play a female character.FEES: There is virtually NO technical support. It costs $15 per month to play this game, even after you buy it.

I was very excited about getting some shirts for my daughter, but when I received the ten shirts I ordered I was a little upset that they had no tags on them and the second tag on the inside of the shirt was cut from all the shirts. The invoice stated that to return any items they had to be new, but how could they be returned if they did not come with tags? Also, the fact that one of the inside tags was cut makes me think that these shirts are not Babyluxe brand, but some other brand that you, as the seller, acquired and jacked up the price.I will be posting this same comment as a review of your item because I think buyers need to be aware of what they are really getting.The shirts are cute, but it makes me wonder if I received what I really bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"somewhat entertaining but poorly written","review":"Well, I just got back from a trip to Rome and read this book on the plane. Yes, at times it was funny --- as the other reviewers have noted. Yes, I learned some things about the Vatican I didn't know before. But the book is also disjointed, repetitive, poorly edited, and written in a style that was wordy, manipulative of the reader, and with barely veiled sexism in his repeated references to the physical appearance of the women he sees or meets. I had the impression the author was just trying to fill enough pages to make it book length. It was not a pager turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed this book.","review":"For starters, it's hilarious. I laughed out loud many times. And while the author is irreverent, he's never offensive. He's a loyal Catholic who's not afraid to air out some dirty, and usually hilarious, laundry.The book is also fascinating. I often didn't want to put it down or was sorry to see a chapter end. And most of the chapters left me wanting to learn more. I especially liked his amazing account of the discovery, loss, and rediscovery of the bones of St. Peter. And his historical account of the outrageous shenanigans of some past popes was both entertaining and amusing.I also found myself wanting to visit all the places the author visited - and even to meet some of the fascinating characters he came across.If you like to laugh and you're at all interested in the secrets of the Vatican, you'll love this book, even if you're not Catholic and never plan to visit Italy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grande Nostaglia","review":"I found this book thoroughly enjoyable. I travelled to Italy in my teens several times with my Uncle who was a priest. We visited the Vatican often however there are some areas that I was not privy to during my Uncle's personalized tours of Rome. My Uncle was a linguist and flawless in Italian but he neglected to escort me to certain areas below St Peter's. These very trips I took with him endeared me to Italy and it's culture. If you remember experiencing il sciopero, Piazza Navona and gelato you will love this book.It makes you want to book a ticket a' Roma presto presto.

The author provided me with an entertaining experience, and I was also inspired by his evident love of the Catholic Church, despite all the superficial evidence to the contrary. Although I have lived here for about a year and a half now, I learned some interesting tidbits about places I walk by every day, and laughed out loud on more than one page.

Giancarlo is convinced that Natalia is having an affair with her boss, who is married to Giancarlo's only sister, and in true Sicilian fashion, promises vengance. Vengance turns to seduction, and seduction to ... surprises! One of the features I liked most in this book was Reid's technique of weaving between Natalia's viewpoint and Giancarlo's viewpoint.

You can tell by its sales ranking: The Rockwell Box Set did better. The only thing that makes this CD look good is by compairing it to their new CD, Analogue, which should be sold with an apology to all a-ha fans. A-ha got lazy, and greedy on this one. A-ha got back on track with Lifelines and most certainly, Minor Earth/Major Sky. But East of the Sun, West of the Moon, no good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good overall, some are fantastic for melancholy moods","review":"East of the Sun, Crying in the Rain, and Slender Frame are the favs here. Those are great for driving through melancholy times, whether it's in a car through a thunderstorm, or when feeling low in spirits and need the music to commiserate with you. The rest of the tunes are decent in my humble opinion, thus the four star rating (though I wish four and a half was an option).This seems to be my general opinion of a-ha's works. A few top-notch (must-have) tunes on each CD, with average material interspersed. Definitely in my top 25 favorite bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's wonderful!","review":"I loved the fact it was so inpired by their own mythology.

It's a sudden change in direction for them, it seems this cd is more low key and eclectic which is okay for some folks. I generally don't mind it but i didnt feel that same connection that i did to previous efforts (Hunting High and Low and their first effort). East of the Sun is by no means a bad cd, it has a few tracks that i did enjoy like:Early MorningWaiting for HerRolling ThunderCrying In The RainIt's enough to give 4 stars for this cd but the group needs some extra oomph in their next effort for me to warrant another cd purchase. Perhaps more listens to this one and i'll like it a tad bit more we'll see. But for now East of the Sun, West of the Moon is a slighly above average purchase for a-ha fans. For those that are new to the group, you might want to try their first cd or Hunting High and Low (which i believe are better)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one to have...!","review":"Unless your ears have been frozen in Antartica, this album will sound melodious to you.. While A-ha have some limitations with their lyrics, the melodies in this album are haunting. The thing with these guys is, their tunes are so original, you have to listen to it a couple of times to really grow into it..Its hard to pick out favourite tracks, they're all gems. Sounds like some real hard work went into the production.. A definite step up from 'Stay On..', and a vital link in the evolution of their sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"A-ha's best record!","review":"I am from Norway, A-ha's country. They are the only popstars we have had ever (except Aqua \\"Barbie Girl\\" Lene), and we are still talking about \\"Take on Me\\" and so on.

The prose of book, however, is what native Guyanese would call 'high falautin' and, toward the end, I disagree with a few of his political theories on modern Guyanese politics; moreover, significantly, there is some repetition.

Some of the songs were hits in England, but not in the US; some are obscure non-hits.The fourth volume is \\"soul\\" (Build Me Up Buttercup is soul! ). The fifth volume is a repackaging of lead singer Tony Burrows work (and repeats songs on the other volumes in the series).Overall, they are consistently fun to listen to. Sure brings back memories of much more carefree times for me. I like Volume 3 the best and would give it 5 stars.

He provides a dutiful recounting of the facts of Jefferson's life, but never makes him come alive. His thesis--that Jefferson saw the use of reason as the highest human undertaking--is certainly valid, but Jefferson was a man of enormous contradictions, none of which are truly explored here.

This book is obviously a brief account of the life and career of Thomas Jefferson. As such, it compromises on a detailed discussion on any one aspect of Jefferson's life, but this is understandable, given the limited scope of the book. Even so the discussion on Jefferson's presidency is a little too brief. However certain topics-such as the Emabargo, are handled fairly well. overall, this book is usefull to anyone who wishes to obtain a bird's eye view of Jefferson's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one volume biography of Thomas Jefferson.","review":"A very balanced biography.

The book seemed to quickly skim over his life, for example giving only one chapter to each of his presidential terms. The Lewis and Clark expedition is barely mentioned and I would have liked to know everything that led up to that famous journey. His scientific achievements are also only alluded to during the course of the book. Although it is an easily readable book, I came away wanting to know much more and feeling I did not know the man. Compare this to the excellent John Adams: A Life, and this biography falls well short.

It is a very balanced look (not Michael Moore-style at all) that focuses on interviews with military, political and civilian institutions that were there, and how the decision making took place.This documentary doesn't pass judgment on whether going to Iraq in the first place was a good idea, what it does pass judgment on are the decisions made after the US took over and how that affected the chaos that ensued.

This documentary shines a light on most of the blunders and out lines the cost to America. Both financially and on a human scale.The errors in judgment and lack of military experience within the administration are both appalling and telling of the Bush white house. Every military expert was systematically ignored or sidelined. It's as if the Bush administration's primary and sole interest or concern was the protection and acquisition of Iraq's oil provisions.This film is a testament to the complete and absolute failure of the Bush presidency."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devastating expose of war's incompetence","review":"I cannot too highly recommend this DVD.

In fact, there are only three legitimate American hits here, which are \\"I Must Be Seeing Things\\", \\"Princess in Rags\\" and \\"Backstage\\". The rest of the album features flop singles and album cuts. However, I must say that the person who chose these songs did an excellent job. These may not be hit songs, but they are good songs. If you already have the Gene Pitney Anthology, and you want more of the \\"Rockville Rocket\\", the CD would be a good one to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gardenia's personified!","review":"The fragrance is so hard to find, and thankfully Caswell-Massey do this exceptionally well.

Well, it broke in less than a month. The drive tip snaped off while I was tightening down some fuel pump bolts. I really do like the design and it is easy to change from forward to reverse with one hand, but I thought the quality would have been better. I think the wobble head design seriously weakens the drive tip. I guess I should have bought the standard tip model but who knows. It would be great around the garage at home but I wouldn't call it a professional grade tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had to return it","review":"Had to return it because I purchased two pairs for the size but the product itself is very good.

Well, the songs from the original Rise album are not the original versions. The song 'Rise' is cut down with about a minute, and the bad thing is you can hear where the cut was made, it's not done very well. Then for no seemingly logic reason at all the song 'Rotation' is faded in the end. I don't know why on earth they did that, only to save about 30 seconds from the original running time??? I was very irritated from this. Then the three last songs are really just crap. 'This guy's in love with you' is a very nice tune though. But I'd rather buy a dedicated Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass best-of-CD instead of this, and then I WANT A RE-RELEASE OF THE ORIGINAL RISE ALBUM ON CD...PLEASE! It seems to have gone out of print, which is understandable but no excuse for not printing up more copies. Also the price of this cd is ridiculously high and not justified.

I do use the option of the external power supply to the USB port, and Im not sure what happens if it wasnt plugged in, but I would recommend using the power supply if you can. You do get a slight decrease in speed using this device, however. I wanted to transfer data between my two hard drives that are both plugged in to the USB port. the transfer rate was slower by 25% then if I had just had them both plugged into my computer directly.

They worked great! Almost all of my USB devices connected via the hub worked as if they were directly connected to the computer - this includes some pretty heavy duty devices. So when I bought a laptop and decided I need two more, of course, I thought, I must buy the same hubs again. Well, Both of the hubs purchased through Amazon.com came with a wrong cable included. The cables for powering the device are fine; but the cables supplied for connecting the hub to the computer are A/Male to micro male USB connectors, not the USB A/Male to B/Male obviously required (as seen in the photo). I've used the Startech support website to see if they'll correct the problem. No fix yet. As is, these are useless - can't even connect to the computer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong AC Adapter shipped!","review":"Included in the package is the wrong AC adapter that can't even plugin. It puzzled me how this can happen. The only explaining maybe they sent me a customer returned product and the previous owner packed the wrong AC adapter with it. Very disappointing. While it works well without AC adapter on some device, any USB device that draws more power (like portable HD) will require it to be plugged in to power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor purchase","review":"I would highly recommend avoiding this item. I read these reviews, and I considered myself technically savvy enough to figure out any problems I encountered with this product. Right out of the box, half of the ports consistently didn't work. I tried using the ones that did, and every few minutes the hub would disconnect and reconnect, causing my two external drives to reconnect as well- if I had been writing data to them, it could have been very bad... So I played around with safe devices for a while and didn't have any successful attempts to get the hub working.Long story short: don't be dumb like me and ignore the bad reviews- if you get stuck with a lemon, it's essentially worthless. Unless you like returning things.(Two stars because if it had worked, the small size and amount of ports is a big plus.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"The problem with this hub is that it has horrible latency. If you're planning on plugging a thumb drive or external hard drive into this, forget it. If you're trying to run a keyboard & mouse, it'll probably work fine.

The problem with this is that it will eventually ruin the battery in your iPod, giving you decreased runtime and eventually killing it altogether. This is why high end battery chargers stop charging when batteries are full. Kensington actually admits to the continuous charging on their website in the FAQ section. I found this out from the staff at a Genius Bar in an Apple Store after I purchased the Kensington dock. Luckily I was still able to return mine and get a dock by a different company that stops charging when the battery is full.I would recommend the Belkin TuneCommand or the Keyspan AV dock. Both of these units are basically identical to the Dock 500; except that they both stop charging when the battery is full.

Before the band took the stage, I thought they would be no good. But before the performance was over, I was hooked permanently. The albums was no let down.This first album was their best, before the $money$-centric big labels could corrupt M3 (but not enough to ruin them). This is pure M3 and this is a must own for anybody who like hard rock. I guarentee this album is so good, it'll blow your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Five Star album from the Marvies","review":"OK, so this is the first album, and I got it last out of the first three (and only three, right now).

I like \\"The Last Sleep\\" a lot, not to take away from the other songs which are great as well. I would definetly suggest picking up this album.

Tough guy Dave Bautista, as Ray walks through The Rising Sun, a strip joint in Grand Rapids. It has illegal gambling and prostitution upstairs. Ray is an ex-cop who just got out of jail and works for a guy named \\"Vinnie.\\" While watching the door, some gunmen rob the place and shoot Vinnie's son.Vinnie wants Ray to use his police abilities to find the guys who killed his son, and bring them to him. As Ray investigates the murder, his suspects die, making it look like he is involved. In fact so many get shot and killed at one point I was laughing. As the police and Vinnie's boys hunt down Ray, Ray must try to solve the crime to a sound track of metal and hip-hop music. The grindhouse aspect of the movie wanes as it becomes an action/drama.

The only thing that completely killed it for me was Batista's acting, he could not get away from his bad-boy wrestling act the ENTIRE movie which is fine for 5 minutes in the ring but dragging it out for an hour and a half was dreadful. He was dull, emotionless, \\"too cool for school\\", and looked like he was staring at a wall in his dialogue - it never changed not once and it got old.If they would've gone with a different actor for the main character this movie would've had great potential, but they didn't so *insert fart noise here*."},{"rating":"1","title":"spurious logic","review":"This is a book rich in logical flaws, wrongheaded conclusions, and outright mistakes. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"mind blowing...","review":"Off he goes is a sad and moving song about loss and forgiveness.

Emitt's work is certainly better than McCartney's bad stuff, but falls drastically short of McCartney's successes. The attempt to copy Paul is blatantly obvious, as was his work with Merry-Go-Round was his fall-short attempt to be the Beatles. I would have loved to hear his music minus the fake British accent. (You're from So. Cal., Emmit). Anyway, Emitt is a GREAT, HIGHLY-TALENTED artist that deserves MUCH more recognition.

The game itself is a market. And a given market breaks down into one of 3 categories: Monopoly, Oligopoly(Limited Competition), or Panopoly(Full/Open-Competition). The original game itself actually starts as an oligopoly or panopoly, with price fixing(READ: Government subsidy or regulation), and the objective of becoming a monopoly.You cannot have a monopoly faction competing against a competitive faction. If this games illustrates anything, it illustrates the detrimental effect of government regulation subsidizing one faction of a market, and forcing another faction to compete against them.

If you're looking to buy a board game please, please, please, please, please, please don't pick this one.The point of the game is that you can choose to be a competitor or a monopolist, and there are different rules for each.

We used to play the original but I grew tired of it because everyone had their own rules. In this one, students had to make educated decisions. In regular monopoly, you could buy everything mindlessly until the back row. In this one, you have less money and you need to make calculated decisions, like preventing a monopoly and building at the right time.

It's a story full of touching romance, heartbreak, anger, sadness, and loss. The characters here seem real and troubled, and their lives are messy, complex, derailed as often as not. Is there a clue to Barthelme's genius here? Well, sure. He was witty and ambitious and very damn clever. Funny, he was funny. His life seems to have been not quite so charmed as his work. This is a vivid portrait, complete with parts of Barthelme's life that may not have been so savory, and it humanizes this man whose work is always at pains to present only the carefully polished surface. An excellent introduction to the artist, his milieu, and his work. Ms. Moore-Barthelme writes with assurance and grace, and is always generous and forthright."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not great","review":"Please see other reviews of this recording in the standard CD version also available at Amazon.First of all, the sound on this disc is great with a very wide dynamic range and crystal clear high and low frequencies.The majority of the movements are really very good, but Mars falls short for me.

This CD doesn't feature \\"The Original Surfaris; it features \\"The Surfaris\\" of \\"Wipe Out\\" fame. The CD is the Varese Sarabande Records follow up toWipe Out! The Best of the Surfaris. Sort of a \\"Best of the Surfaris, Volume 2\\". Perhaps surprisingly, there was actually enough good material left off of the first CD to make a good second CD. There are 16 good surf instrumentals here, plus three pretty cool songs about motorbikes with vocals. Seven of the instrumentals were previously unreleased, but it was not due to lack of quality. Surf music fans should enjoy this CD a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Order the book and get the same program for FREE","review":"It's amazing to think that anyone would buy this program when it can be downloaded from the Microsoft site for free.

The flexible arm is too weak to support the large rainfall head. From day one it wanted to droop down and not stay in place. If I managed to get it in the desired position it only took the slightest touch to make it fall back down - forget about the button for spray selection. It's very disappointing considering I had an older \\"gooseneck\\" shower head from Waterpik that worked without any issues, but it seems they decided to go with a cheap design that renders this product essentially unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"never got to try it...","review":"I am in disbelief this thing ever got marketed. The first time I attached the flexible hose it would not hold up the weight of the shower head. I tried tightening it, twisting it, you name it no good. It hangs down at a 30 -60 degree angle at best. I thought perhaps with water flowing through it things might improve. Nope. Just got worse. The engineering team on this one should be fired. This product should get the bonehead design of the year award. How the heck something like this ever got produced really blows my mind. Waterpik -it's coming back to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very well made","review":"Of course it works great - for as long as it works. After some time, my unit develped a leak. Unlike better showerheads, the part connecting the head to the hose is assembled in two pieces that separate after time, causing the seals to not set properly, resulting in the kind of leak mine developed. Unless you want to replace your showerhead every couple of years, I'd stay away fom this model. And good luck navigating Watrepik's website to get any help."},{"rating":"2","title":"We like it...","review":"I love taking long showers, so I think the showerhead is an important part of the experience. This one is really nice because the rain setting really does feel like rain. Some people say the water pressure on this setting doesn't rinse the soap off, but if you stand out in the rain, wouldn't you have a hard time rinsing soap off? The setting is for those of us who really just enjoy standing under the water. The 2nd setting is for rinsing the soap off. And for how easy it is to switch back and forth, I wouldn't be complaining. No problems with the product sagging or leaking at our place. Good product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great if you don't need to adjust it.","review":"Like many other reviewers, I'm having the same issue with this; the arm can't support the shower head.

Waterpik has been great about replacing the units, but, finally, enough is enough. We did not have a problem with sagging, but did have issues with the switch for spray/shower breaking (all three did), which then created a leaking problem. As we speak, only the center spray position works. The breakage occurs after about 4-6 weeks of use. We have 5 people taking showers every day, which may be the problem with the showerhead.Overall, an under-engineered product for moderate to heavy residential use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I returned this showerhead the day after I purchased it.

While the spray itself felt great and I liked that fact that it can be switched from a wide, gentle spray to a concentrated spray, it was overall very disappointing. The arm is not strong enough to hold the head up well - even without the water running. Water also leaks out of the switch that is used to change the spray. We plan on returning this one and purchasing something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well","review":"I have owned this type of showerhead before and was difficult to find in stores, Works Great, Great Price!!

Shame too cos the water it puts out is VERY nice and the rinse more intense setting is great for washing long hair.Even though we don't adjust for height in our house, I hit the darn thing a few times with the towel (throwing towel over glass door) and it takes like 10 mins to get it to stay up again.Had to return it that is a no go.I was surprised that even though it was positioned higher than the shower door, becasue the spray is downward....water did not go outside the shower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"For a company with a good reputation, I'm very disappointed in Waterpik. The large showerhead is quite heavy and the gooseneck can barely support its weight, so unless you can mount it fairly high up on the wall, the showerhead won't stay at a proper horizontal angle. Or it will stay up for a while, then slowly sag. It has recently developed an annoying whistle; those holes are tiny, so they are probably clogged, but how does one clean this unit since it doesn't come apart? Stay away from this one, and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not recommend.","review":"I wanted a large diameter showerhead with some power option and purchased this. This shower head is supposed to have a power shower option but I found out that it just narrows the range of shower to the smaller circle (doe snot come out from the full range) and stil weak. You'll just never get warm or soap off yourself by using this shower head. If you are looking for a soft pour, you might like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems so far","review":"I bought the showerhead a few days ago and, so far, I love it. While it isn't *really* like being drenched in a rainshower, it certainly is a more enjoyable experience than my smaller regular showerhead.I don't see any sagging problem but I've only had the unit installed for a few days. I don't think I'll be moving the flexible handle very much, though, so I don't expect the unit to begin sagging on its own. And, so far, no leakage issues.If performance deteriorated in the coming weeks I'll revise my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shower Head Flop","review":"This item is so heavy that the flexible arm will not keep head in position to spray anywhere but wall of shower.

It works great at first, and the toggle switch is easy to use. I really enjoyed the experience of having the water fall down on me like rain, and the adjustable arm is maneuverable enough to raise the shower head fairly high. Unfortunately the housing is cheap plastic and breaks easily. I didn't even move the showerhead after the first couple weeks and left it in the same position all the time, but on all three showerheads, the plastic housing broke at the point where the white meets the adjustable arm, and leaked. On two of the models, the adjustable arm failed and would fall down and no longer hold up. There are better and stronger showerheads out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"WaterPik Cascadia","review":"Very disappointing. The shower head itself is massive - the size of a small dinner plate. It is attached to a long hose which is so flexible it can't support the weight of the head when the shower is in use. Predictably, when you turn on the shower, the head drops groundward, spewing water in a horizontal spray. Installs easily, but save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend the money toward a better one","review":"I bought this for my nephew. He loved it functionally. On a visit just 9 months later I was visiting and had a chance to use it. He had to rig a support for the gooseneck to keep it focused on him. This had broken just a few months into his ownership. I bought him the S-style from Amazon.com at a greater price and it's worth every penny. He loves it and it has a much greater span of spray plus range of motion on the head movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"It might be drenching if you were a leprechaun","review":"But if you're a normal-sized person, this is nothing like the \\"Sunflower\\" (can-type) drenching spa showers. My home has great water pressure and terrific water flow, and using this showerhead is like standing under a VERY gentle summer rain (definitely non-drenching)---it doesn't even deliver the same water flow as my normal showerhead. Go for a slightly more expensive option, like the Pegasus 8\\" sunflower. I gave it a fair try (it's been in for months now), but this showerhead is not worth even its modest price; although my husband is kicking up a fuss about his installation labor, I am taking mine out and installing a different showerhead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with this","review":"I was not happy with this at all.

The rain is wonderful, and the center rain is great for getting shampoo out.One and only one con: it's extremely hard to position the neck. But, you should only do it once, so it's not a big deal...

I removed it after 2 weeks of this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Last","review":"I have been using this showerhead for about a year now. At first I quite liked it.

Despite installation that included teflon tape, we could never get it to stop leaking. Also, we could never get the shower head into a comfortable position and get it to stay put. The biggest problem had to do with hard water. Although we don't have exceptionally hard water, we had to have it replaced twice in two years. The switch stopped working and we had water continually coming out of both settings. On a good note, Waterpik was very accomodating about the product warranty.

This means in order to take a shower you have to stand under it, hold the head up with one hand & wash with the other. Otherwise it will fall down & hit you on the head! This could probably be remedied by installing it as handheld, but that requires an adaptor shown in the product instructions. Problem is Amazon doesn't carry them, I can't find one at any retailers carrying Waterpic & it's not even shown on the shower accessory page of Waterpics's own website! This piece of junk is going back tomorrow & I'll get a rain showerhead worth owning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn around and run","review":"I had one for about 7 years, yes it worked great, until one day it broke and would not stay up.

It was explained to him, that Turkish people, like Indonesians and other Asian people refrain from rubbing an obnoxious substance into a tender skin with paper, which Western people have been led to believe represents cleaning, but rather prefer using water and their left hand.People that use their right hand's middle finger to signal derision, don't know what they are signaling about.

It's funny, detailed and somehow manages to keep you on a cliff hanger throughout the book. It was only after I read that chips cost 32p that I realised this book is quite old. I'm guessing it was written in 1981 or before that date so it's quite hard to get the feel of the book when everything is so cheap! That's my only complaint (it's not a very good one though!) so other than that, this book was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adrian Mole is a real intellctual!!!","review":"This book is one of favorite books of my friend.

Even the most normal events turn tragic when Adrian and his family are involved.Adrian reminds me of a Woody Allen movie. It's brilliantly funny and I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!!!","review":"I discovered this book right around the time it came out,when I was in grade school. I read it over and over,checking it out of the library three times in a year. I thought Aidy's life was far more interesting than my humble origins and laughed at all his problems, I even did a book report on it for 6th grade English. Adrian thinks himself intellectual though he is far from it at this point (later books he gets closer to having the kind of booksmarts that would make him a true intellectual),writes bad poetry and pines for treacle-haired Pandora. Almost makes me want to visit the UK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many unsubstantiated claims","review":"This book contains several wild and unsubstantiated claims:- The Bible was widely read and understood by the common man in the Middle Ages- The Roman Catholic Church made vernacular versions of the Bible widely available- There was really no need for an English version of the Bible- Roman Catholic translations are highly accurate, whereas Protestant translations are \\"swarming with errors\\"- The Roman Catholic Bible has the exact same content as that of the early churchOf course, those who are unwilling to look into the accuracy of these claims will accept them at face value. Graham provides very few references to back up his bold claims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed.","review":"I wish it were possible to give ZERO stars.My wife gave this gift to our sons for Christmas.

The 7 year old will have nothing to do with this game, and while the 4 year old loves to play the game it is almost impossible to win (not that he seems to care).

You know it's bad when the writers have to resort to the time worn and redundant storyline of corporate pollution for profits backfiring which leaves some pollution eating creatures a bit upset and revengeful.(2.) Tiresome overuse of animal carcasses.(3.) Over reliance upon night/darkness for cheap effects.(4.) Over reliance by special effects crew dragging a sled (or whatever) through the underbrush to create cheap critter moving effect. That really got to be a yawner.(5.) Over reliance by special effects crew to loop the same animal noise grunting sound for the entire movie. Became as endearing as elevator/grocery store background music.(6.) Best of all was the use of the same fake boar's head through out the entire movie although relative to moving brush and grunting sound the actual seeing of a wild piggy was only 1% of the movie anyway. How do I know it was the same piggy head because it had a tattoo of a human's head on it's rear end. Dead give-away."},{"rating":"1","title":"My wallet fell prey to this film. It's one of the worst B movies released in North America in 2011","review":"- I did not check the box of this DVD before renting it. It shows it was released in 2009 in France. Next time, I'll check the reviews on Amazon of any movie before renting it.- The special effects are bad jokes. They look like kids' stuff. They're obviously fake.- There is no suspense. The plot is predictable. The acting is wooden. For example, in the first 15 minutes, there are 2 short scenes between the young doctor and his pregnant wife. They failed to stir up some emotion because of bad directing and they were given too little time.In short, it's a waste of my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, bit difficult","review":"The book was a bit harder than i thought, however a little extra challenge is never too bad. Has some proofs, some logic problem solving. The reason i rated this 4 is because of where everything is placed in the book. After you solve the problem, u have to go to another page to see the answer, or if you dont enderstand the problem, u have to dig in the book to see where its solution is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy","review":"Got these to adjust the headlights on my Porsche. The 5mm is perfect, with a shaft length of almost 8\\", and a total length of 12\\". Much easier to use than regular allen wrenches.The 2.5 mm is also good for dismantling kitchen faucets. Again, a screwdriver grip is so much nicer than a plain allen wrench."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely wet - extremely disappointing","review":"The point of language immersion is to put the student in an environment where the new language is used exclusively. Every CD in this set has more English than French. Rather than being immersed in French, the student barely gets wet. Instead, it repeats the standard approach, and is just like most of the language learning materials not claiming to be using the \\"immersion\\" method. Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"So cool","review":"Even though I'm nowhere near a good enough guitar player to keep up with most of these songs, it's still cool to see Hubert play and chat with Jimmy Vivino about the music. Levon Helm being in there is a special bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointig","review":"Collected over a hundred years ago by an excise man, I was interested to read this as a witness to Celtic spirituality. However the amount of invocation of the Virgin Mary and prayers to saints leads me to think it is more to do with Roman Catholic spirituality. It is an interesting compilation of a now mainly lost oral tradition but one is not alone in questioning the historical bias of the author. Presbyterianism was not the malevolent influence on music and dance in the Hebrides which he makes it out to be. Read Donald MacLeods more contemporary assessment for a very different view. I confess this is the one book among my reviews which I did not manage to read to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal at it's finest!","review":"This CD is, as another reviewer wrote, an \\"absolute shred fest.\\" Fantastic musicianship combined with excellent songwriting makes for a real headbanger with a distinctly gothic feel. The song \\"Pharaoh\\" is worth the price of the CD alone. If you like metal music in any way, shape, or form, especially progressive stuff, this is THE CD to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite masterpiece.......","review":"Divine Wings of Tragedy pretty much defines progressive metal in my opinion. Well written music and great lyrics are abound. Michael Romeo plays a MEAN guitar. Vocals change from crystal clear to a growl as the songs seem to demand it. This one will have you shaking your head wondering how these guys can perform like this and not be a mainstream name. Give it a shot, You'll be glad you did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Divine Wings of Tragedy: An incredible display of talent","review":"Symphony X's masterpiece, Divine Wings of Tragedy, surpasses every other prog metal group I've heard. I don't even like the whole CD. In fact, a few songs I can't even stand to listen to. But several are absolutely incredible. The Accolade and the title song alone are entirely worth the cost of the CD. Those certainly aren't the only good songs on the CD though. In addition to the others, Of Sins and Shadows and Sea of Lies are both VERY well made. A few of the songs' lyrics seem a little forced to me. Almost like the lyricist is trying too hard. Aside from that, I recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys music with a solid foundation of complex, well-written compositions."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST albums EVER","review":"Hi! I'm the webmaster of \\"The Edge of Forever\\" -- The definitive site devoted to the biggest progmetal band ever: Symphony X.Let me start saying that I got the idea to design \\"The Edge Of Forever\\" after listen to this album (although TEOF is from Damnation Game). So you can imagine what this album means to me (and for many other X'ers).This have a permanent position in my TOP 5 CD from all time. If you like Metal -- don't matter what genre: From the most traditional metal bands like Metallica or Iron Maiden to most progressive bands such as RUSH (yeah! ), Dream Theater and even Shadow Gallery... You'll LOVE IT! All Symphony X members are monsters and considered by many as their personal hero.You guys should check this album. Believe me: You'll love it.

I've seen your other reviews (Fish -Sunsets on Empire, and Marillion-Brave) and i agree with you 100% on those reviews. But on this one, i just don't get it... How any serious prog metal/rock fan can down DT i'll just never understand. Feel free to email me freethinkernj@aol.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album from Symphony X","review":"I wasn't quite sure how to rate this album going into the review. I mean, I've listened to all of Symphony X's albums, and I think without a doubt this is the best one. The opening to \\"Of Sin and Shadows\\" is great...nice and thrashy and then moving into a great keyboard sound. Also, the songs are varied quite a bit, unlike \\"V\\", in which I thought all the songs had a certain sameness to them. The first 3 minutes of \\"The Divine Wings of Tragedy\\" are one of the best pieces of music I have ever heard.On the down side, the lyrics can be a bit cheesy (but not as cheesy as on \\"V\\"). Also, the solo sections are quite predictable after awhile....guitar then keyboard then guitar then keyboard.I don't like the endless comparisons everyone has been giving to Dream Theater, so I won't include one at all. All in all, this is a great album within the progressive/symphonic metal genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEW MILLENIUM TRUE HEAVY METAL!","review":"Well, at first Im a Dream Theater fan. But this is amazing.. no comparasing with DT.. this have it own styleProgressive metal with very heavy guitar riffs, an excelente vocals, a completeley power bass and cool drums. So if u like good playing metal this is for u.Michael Romeo is an excelent guitar player, like a heavier and better Malmsteen... and the keyboards solos r cool too.And the band is amazing too.. Listen to songs like Pharaoh or Of Sins and Shadows if u want power.. or The Accolade or The Divine Wings of Tragedy r cool long porgressive songs...So this is an album indispensable... If u like european metal like Stratovarius u will like this too..Soo buy it now.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genuine Masterpiece!","review":"This album is without doubt one the milestones in the Hard Rock/Heavy Metal genre. Every track is a masterpiece.Unlike other progressive bands, you don't have to be a muscician to appreciate Symphony X. They simply write great songs. Catchy and very, very heavy. No matter what kind of rock or metal your into, you'll love this album!Please for your own good BUY this album, and make sure to check out their other albums, they're almost as great as this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the top 10 metal albums of all time!","review":"Who the hell needs Dream Theater to give us progressive metal....this disc makes Images and Words sound like John Lithgow's new CD of childrens songs! Michael Romeo is a sick and viscious guitar player..and this disc shows of his amazing talent. The songs are well structured and relentless. Even the title track (clocking in at just over 20 minutes!) will hold you in silence from begining to end....you won't realize the time is up. This is their heaviest disc to date...and it F*cking Rocks! **Rumor has it there is a US deal in the works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Pertains To This Re-Release, Not The Music!","review":"This review pertains strictly to the re-release. These new re-releases of the Symphony X disography is a terrible concept. Inside Out records has packaged the music to where there are no individual tracks. Merely one large one. It's a bummer because you can't rip them onto your computer so that you may place any of the individual songs on a \\"best of\\" type CD for you car or Diskman.Go with the regular release."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Album But I Cannot Figure Out Why","review":"After all the hype, after all the glowing reviews about how this album is supposedly one of the great prog metal/neoclassical releases ever, I finally picked up Symphony X's The Divine Wings of Tragedy.Boy, what a let-down. It just did not \\"grab\\" me in any way. All the ingredients are there to make this a great album from the Dio-like vocals, and very Malmsteen-like guitar and the Queen-ish vocal harmonies and Dream Theater sound but when it comes right down to it, I didn't like this album.I'm not the biggest fan of neoclassical metal but I do like progressive metal minus the technical over-the-topness many so-called \\"prog metal\\" bands indulge in. The funny thing is that Symphony X's technical indulgences are, for the most part, tasteful (except for the keyboards that are a bit too much at times), I should have liked this album. But I didn't and I still can't figure it out. All the ingredients are there. Hey, maybe it was the songs. Who knows?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not progressive","review":"After sampling some of the tracks it became obvious that this is just hard rock and does not even come close in style to groups such as; Camel, Yes, Steve Hackett, Peter Gabriel, or even Dave Mathews.

This book is silly, but has beautiful passages that transcend age and time. A wonderful collaboration! Amy Botula's blood may even be splattered on one of the pages as she cut her foot while creating the book and had to get stitches at the infirmary, is this true?

Well the doll has fabric hands. So if that does not bother you it is a great doll. I am just irritated because had I known this doll had fabric hands I would have chosen a different one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but Vol. 2 is better","review":"Being a DNAngel-obsessed fangirl, i have both soundtracks. This volume, Volume 1, has some really good vocal songs, like Whenever, and Fanatic, as well as the TV versions of the fantastic opener, True Light, and the closing, Gentle Afternoon. The other 29 songs are the music. some are short, some are long, some annoying, some beautiful. If you're looking for the vocal songs, try the drama CDs. If you're looking for good music that you can say \\"oh, i remember that scene\\" while you're listening to it, get this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect garden glove","review":"I have been using the same pair for a year and they are still in excellent condition. I have tried numerous gardening gloves and these are by far the best. I use them mainly for pulling weeds, planting, and pruning and have found them to like using my bare hands. I'm in Florida and often the gloves I used made my hands sweat and feel uncomfortable- these do not. Also my hands are completely clean after hours of working in the garden. The only drawback is that they-and your hands-get wet if you are working in moist soil. Since this doesn't really bother me, I'm giving them the maximum 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute but ........","review":"Because the gloves are knit they do not give you much protection from weeds and plants that you would not want to grab with your bare hands, like thistles or anything with prickers (ouch). Weeds also stick to the gloves.

True, you can brush her hair but the head is already \\"made up\\" with glitter paint so it's not really a make-up toy. It comes with a pot of lip gloss that is transparent on the enclosed applicator so really only adds a shine when put on the already done up doll face.The little compartment on the front and the bottle caps that open just reveal pictures. Once you've looked at those, that's pretty much it.One week after Christmas and this toy is sitting on a table unnoticed. Doesn't provide enough interactivity.

Lots of reenactment footage and commentary, though one of the \\"historical speakers\\" made us think of \\"Tim the Enchanter\\" from the Monty Python Grail movie. Mostly it's a good video.The Wales one is feeble-- lots of shots of a bearded guy, pretending to be the single great Welsh leader (so it would seem) standing on a hill side thinking. After the 12th take of this same shot... well, it was tedious. About 25% interesting stuff and the rest filler, it seemed. The Britain video is also filled with lots of silly druid types, with a few actually good actors doing readings from the period.

It arrived on time and in good shape, and I'm using it in coffee. You have to use more of it than sugar because it is less sweet, but it has no fructose, which is why I bought it. I like the quality of the sweetening it provides...it's not cloying or overly sweet. In the end, though, I prefer Erythritol, a naturally occurring sugar that is found in our bodies as well as in fruits and fermented foods like soy sauce. It has no calories and is a bit sweeter than dextrose. I found the Erythritol at my supermarket labeled Zero. It has no artificial ingredients or calories and is GMO free.

Oliver argues that speed and customer responsiveness are keys to the new world of business. To stay alive, companies must flatten their corporate structures, do away with old roles, and embrace the technology that allows data mining and Internet-based purchasing. The author predicts that in the new century companies will sell directly to consumers, job descriptions will become more fluid, and smart cards and knowbots will become ubiquitous devices. This compelling, thoughtful book examines the trends shaping the global economy.

Overall, a nice souvenir of another era. But it's missing one of their best songs, \\"Land of 1,000 Dances\\", for which they did a Kinescope video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep Purple is the only good song on this CD","review":"Incredibly painful collection of bad remakes of classics and their own tunes.The way I see it is that they had a hit with \\"Deep Purple\\" and then attempted to create that success over and over again. It didn't work.If you are into the camp value, I could see perhaps a good laugh on the first listen. After that, however, it is just dullsville. \\"Teach Me Tiger\\" is the most insipid song I've ever heard, complete with April Steven's whispering (didn't she ever get tired of whispering?) \\"whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa\\" over and over again.If you really like the song \\"Deep Purple\\", like I did, please do not assume that this means that they were original or talented. They apparently were not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone has a whack definition of \\"Like New\\"","review":"I received the package in a reasonable time frame. I was so excited to get it finally. I opened it, the jewel case was questionable but not cracked and the sleeve seemed in good condition. I was optimistic.I immediately put it in my car player. I wouldn't play. I double checked that all settings were fine. It didn't play. I ejected it and replaced the previous cd to make sure it could play and the other cd played just fine. I then turned the recently purchased cd over to see if it might have a hair or piece of fuzz on it and was appalled.The cd was more scratched than I had seen any CD since cd's came out....as if it had lived out of its case on the floor of someone's car for a couple years.

If you buy both you are wasting your money in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the companion","review":"Though advertised as a continuation (i.e. 14th Edition)of the \\"Filmgoers companion\\" it is only a list of people in the movies. Gone are Halliwell's definitions of movie tradecraft and lists of themes, individual classics and personal notes. A fine actor like Lee J. Cobb gets a single line, while Jayne Mansfield, known more for her off screen antics, gets many more. The quotes from the movie personalities is a nice touch, but when I look up somebodies filmography I do not want to see etc. at the end of an incomplete list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to legend","review":"Back when this originally was issued, it was an expensive and rare album to come by. I'd never heard it, but being quite the Monkees fan, I was anxious to hear it, and felt sorry I didn't go see them when the toured the US. Once the CD finally came out 20 years later, I realized (as happens more often than not) I didn't miss a thing. As has been stated, the album is horribly recorded - I've heard better audience tapes! The performance is pathetic. These guys should have been ASHAMED at their performance. It's no wonder the project didn't continue. It was an abomination, and an insult to the great original work they did together. A lot of times, the legend of a recording is more exciting than the recording itself. This is a prime example.

Our western lives are so yang-based and it feels so good to give your body permission to hold these poses for 3-5 minutes each...like a series of mini-meditations. This book is very helpful, including instructions on how to get into the poses as well as suggested sequences. I would highly recommend this book to anyone beginning a yin practice.This book includes a large number of poses (plenty for anyone beginning their yin practice), however, it does not include all yin posees I have seen described in other sources. It hits all of the main ones and then some, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect accompaniment for yoga class","review":"My yoga teacher suggested Yin Yoga, and I'm glad she did. It gives us a written reference for many of the things we talk about and do in class. The author explains the chakras and yin and yang energies. He also gives photos and descriptions of many useful postures, along with some sample routines to try. It might be dangerous to try these postures without a teacher to make sure you're doing them right, but the book is a perfect supplement for my class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yin Yoga Stretches more than tissue","review":"I took a Yin Yoga workshop from Sarah Powers and that's how I came to connect with Paul Grilley's book.

Paul covers all the bases! I have a number of students wanting to purchase this book. You won't be disappointed with this book. You can read it ina couple of hours but will find you keep refering back to it because there is so much information in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different kind of yoga","review":"Yin Yoga is counter-intuitive, if you've developed traditional yoga intuition.

Andis is a good brand of clipper, \\"however\\" $80 for this pair of clippers is $70 too much.

It does a decent fade job and my 2 boys(3 and 4) are mixed and seems to cut through their hair with a little more ease than mine.However it seems that my past corded clippers had more power which translate to easier cutting and trimming. My wife has to constantly go over various spots multiple times because it did not hit the spot the first or 2nd time.My recommendation is to do your research and go with another pair of Andis clippers, stay away from this pair, or you'll be finding yourself writing a review saying I agree with the first guy that reviewed this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke","review":"I haven't quite finished this book yet (and I don't know if I even will), but I just have to say that this book is laughable. A filthy-rich computer-and-software mogul named Gil Bates? A woman named Harriet Clayton, whose husband had been a governer and then voted into the White House for two terms (as VP) but who was plagued by sex scandals, and the woman then ran for Senator. Does this all sound somewhat familiar?This story would have been better if the writer had actually used his own imagination to create new and believable characters, rather than using thinly-veiled versions of real people. His opinions are very obvious, and if he wanted to write a book to make jabs at public figures he doesn't like, he should have done that.Oh, and the plot of this story? So far it just seems to be a rehashing of post-9/11 military and political actions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product.

However, I would HIGHLY RECCOMEND this book to professional photographers looking to actually run their business like a business. Although some of the sales techniques in this book are \\"high pressure\\" they can easily be tuned down to fit the individual photographer's taste. The negative reviews I have seen in here so har have mostly been from people who are only interested in the art of photography, and not the business side of it. All I have to say is that digital is making the market far more competitive. Not making the transition to digital today would be like not making the transition to color a few decades ago.

For instance, it explains how to speak about digital photography to your clients so they see it as an advantage/so they feel that they are getting more than they would if you shot with film. Most of the book is not helpful, though. For instance, it includes the advice that one does not buy on credit and wind up paying interest on purchases.

The Japanese authors spent 10s of 1000s of hours replaying the game to make sure what they wrote are without any mistakes and contains ALL the information the readers need.But this book is not only full of mistakes, it's missing important information (such as a guide to the underground dungeon) and doesn't have enough references between chapters.It doesn't even tell you where to get each accessary or item, they just listed them, and pretend that's enough.Don't trust those descriptions on the back of the book, this guidebook will only misguide you."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS!","review":"NOT ONLY THE GAME SUCKS!

Dan Birlew is one of my most favorite authors in the Stragedy guide book section, but this was one of his worst. Unlike Kingdom Hearts, he made many flaws, and a couple not true statements. Although the bestiary and guide through the game is good, he doesn't show all the main characters like Nooj, Gippal, or Baralai for instance. Also in the guide an error is in the part to get a book for that big thing in Djose in chapter 5. Many errors were also made especially in the mini-games section. Although it is a complete guide and gives a walkthrough through the whole thing except for the last battle in the game which is against Shuyin and the guide for 100% part were not in there and flawed, I gave it a 4 star rating for it because I've seen other guide books and believe me, either I couldn't understand them, or they didn't give enough information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst ever","review":"Strategy guides published by Brady Games always seem to be rife with errors, but this one is quite possibly the worst one I have ever seen.

While i will admit that some parts are definately helpful, this does not make up for what the guide lacks. There are a number of tasks the guide neglects to mention that are required for a number of items that could otherwise be found. The author has the uncanny ability of leaving out important points until chapter 5 or later, at which point he mentions, \\"oh, but if you'd done THIS in chapter 1, you chould get THIS...\\" Of course, now in chapter 5 and 150 hours into the game, this does little to help a gamer out. Important notes should you buy this guide: (1) During EVERY chapter, check back with the completion guide at the end of the book. They've conveniently neglected to mention everything one should do in the correct chapter, but included it here. (2) Read through all the side quests before beginning in order to circumvent the above problems. (3) Spend your money on something more worth while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soooooo helpful","review":"This was so incredibly nice to have. I got to the very end of this game and had no idea how to beat it, so my sister and I went out and bought the guide. We started a new game and used the walkthrough inside it. It shows you step by step how to complete every quest and side quest, where to find all of the dress spheres, and about everything you could possibly need to know.

Jam packed with limp mid-tempo, trite R'n'B ditties, this album is definately one of the weaker solo debuts from the Spice Girls.Nonetheless, deliteful indulgances include Midnight Fantasy, I Wish and Unconditional Love.

Her song with Truestppers \\"Out of Your Mind\\" is proof, it's my new favorite song.I really hope she finds some good writers and producers for her next album.To sum it up her album is just a missing link to a spice girls song.

There aren't any tracks I'd skip, and I definately recommend this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me wonder","review":"Why a Spice Girls would put out an R&B influenced album, but it does work and it sounds absolutely wonderful, the album are wonderfuly produced and Victoria Beckham comes off a totally new artist separate of her Posh Spice persona. My Favorite track is Midnight Fantasy, Not Such An Innocent Girl, Watcha Talkin About (I also loved the version with Missy Elliot) Girlfriend, and Mind of its Own. It truely makes me wonder what could have been of Mrs. Beckham's music career if her second album had been released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album from all the solo Spice Girls!","review":"Victoria Beckham/Posh Spice was always my favorite member of the Spice Girls. I also thought she was the most attractive out of all of them too! Well it just so happens that her solo debut album is the best solo debut out of all the Spice Girls! I like every song, especially \\"Not Such An Innocent Girl\\" and \\"A Mind of It's Own\\", both hits in England. The songs on this album are well written and she sounds great! I don't know why a lot of people say she can't sing, I think she has a good voice. I think she deserved more solos when she was with the Spice Girls. So anyway if you're a Spice Girls fan or like Posh you'll like this album like I did. It's definately worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Surprised...","review":"I thought a former Spice Girl's solo work would be less than amateur...I was wrong! This cd has tons of US potential and sends a chill up your spine when you hear the dance tracks.

This is far from 'Spice', it has RnB influences with dance background, and a ton of attitude!

Along the way, they encounter an no-B.S. drill sergeant, a completely horny captain, and a motley crew of Army cadets who joins Murray and Ramis' characters to Europe to stop a plot by the Soviets to invade America.

Not a big deal, except that it covers up a bright white light. After a month of using the replacement charger, one of the 2 plastic tips that help keep the charger and phone connected broke off.

It never seemed to make a solid connection with the phone. The plastic tabs that hold it in didn't break on my charger, but they seemed to be a very weak link. Also, perhaps the contacts were not long enough to keep contact with the phone. The slightest jiggling had the charging constantly starting and stopping.This is the second (the first was a different brand)that had similar problems.

The sound alternates from bad Eric Benet and Jon B. impersonations to just bad. And when you think you've found a song with a nice beat, original chords, and decent vocals (\\"It's Over\\"), you're utterly disappointed by the lyrics.

He is a good writer but he uses it in a way less effective way since his songs aren't \\"to the point\\" like they use to be, it seems like he rambles on and on instead of stopping the song and leaving you wanting for more. Also his acerbic wit is gone which made the songs have a nice sting to them. If you want a great GP record check out: Heat Treatment, Squeezing out the Sparks, Howling Wind to start. This album is only good for hardcore fans and customers that want an average predictable album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy just never misses","review":"Another in a long line of outstanding, kick-ass rock and roll records from Graham.

There's not much I can say about GP that hasn't been said before - so few people know about him these days. Fans should definitely pick this one up. And if you aren't a big GP follower but liked albums like The Mona Lisa's Sister, Your Country, or Struck By Lightning, you won't be disappointed. It doesn't hearken back to the Howlin Wind or Squeezing Out Sparks mode, but don't let that deter you. This is a serious and powerful record from one of the greats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skeptical, But Really Seems to Make a Difference","review":"After reading some positive reviews and recommendations from places like King Arthur Flour, I decided to give this bread add-in a try. I was skeptical a tablespoon or too would make a difference in my bread but it does seem to increase shelf life and slightly soften texture of all the loaves and rolls I've tried it with so far (sourdough, sweet rolls, dinner rolls). There is no distinct taste difference but the dough gets (much) easier to work with after the addition and it even seems to boost the rise a bit.Not an essential bread-making tool, but if you make from-scratch loaves a few times a week, like I do, a tiny, yet worthwhile investment and great addition to your pantry. A pretty good, overall \\"secret\\" ingredient."},{"rating":"2","title":"malt powder","review":"Purchased this malt powder to make pretzels for an Octoberfest.

It's written by a Waldorf educator, but the book is meaningful for any parent, even those not interested in Waldorf. A reviewer gave this book only 1 star because she said it is just full of common sense, but that is the point. Our culture has lost its common sense!I especially appreciated the gentle, non-judgmental tone the author has toward parents. She encourages us to trust our hearts. The first part of the book discusses child development. My favorite part is the latter part of the book, which discusses in separate chapters the child's imagination, artistic ability, musical ability, and capacity for fantasy play. It's a unique book because it explains why daily rhythms (not schedules) are so important.Some of the resources are very dated.

Her view of moms in the workplace, sleep methods, disipline-- I could go on--are archaic. She makes the modern mother feel guilty for wanting to be successfully both in and outside of the home. She condemns those who want to let their children learn to fall asleep on their own, even if that means letting them cry a little in the process. An heaven forbid you are not a successful breasfeeder...Dancy would be the first to call you out for bad mothering!!! Oh, and by the way, despite the years we've spent trying to become equal partners, fathers and mothers are not on equal plains according to Dancy.

(A way to sell more, just repackage but put the same thing inside!) But it's worse than just a remake. The tape is minimally changed, but all changes are for the worse. Her voice and intonation on this new tape are not nearly as good or soothing as the previous tape. She has also changed phrases here and there; just enough to jar someone who has listened so much to the original tapes. The background music is also not as soothing as the original. WHY REMAKE and then remake less well?

My husband is very sensitive to perfumes and gets headaches from so many of them, with this scent he has not had a reaction. I used the last of my bottle about six hours ago, and I can still clearly identify the scent, yet it's soft and not harsh like others that last all day. This is another one of the products I have to buy online only. As the retail world has discontinued it.

This is the first CD of his that I have had the pleasure of hearing, and it is worth every cent. I am absolutely blown away by this CD. The notes and the rythms are just impeccable. To paint a picture of how sweet this album is, imagine it like this: On a hugh scale,If you saw someone in Heaven, you would probably have the utmost respect for him just because he made it to Heaven. But when you break it down and see all the LITTLE things that he had done on Earth and how harmoniously he lived with love and peace, then with each recognition, you'd find him to be a greater being. This CD is synchronious with the analogy. Poncho's music is beautiful, even if you only hear the music on a broad scale. But if you break it down to instruments, tone, melody, style, beats, rythm, etc., it is sensational. MUCH love to Poncho and the fam.

There is nothing thrilling about it -- it's predictable, the dialogue is unrealistic and juvenile and you are so unsympathetic to the main character at the end you don't care what happens to her. The writer must truly hate women to take a smart woman and make her so incredibly stupid.

However, it is an understatement to say that I was I was enormously disappointed. Not only is the plot ridiculously predictable, but the writing itself is unrefined and contrived. The characters are nowhere near realistic, and the dialogue between them is even worse. I can't believe that anyone would speak of this book and those written by John Grisham in the same sentence. I would not recommend this novel to anyone, even if they were fans of trashy romance novels (which is the only category of which this book could viably be a part).

She was correct. The book was both comical and [bad] in its vain attempt to be serious. The characters' dialogue was insipid, stilted, and contrived. The author's penchant for trying to impress fails miserably and is all the more transparent. In addition, as someone who works in the industry, the author portrays a overwrought and completely unrealistic image of how Wall Street works, including basic factual errors. Evidently, the closest the author has come to working in investment banking is putting together pitch books in the copy room.Readers are invited to visit out the author's web site (check out the Elvira wanna-be look). There is supposedly a forthcoming movie based on the book. Who is this C-level director? The only people who will see this movie are those plugging quarters into a booth in Times Square."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's Tormenting Whom?","review":"I found this book to be quite laughable.

I am on page 65 and I'm wondering when the book is going to start revolving around Cleopatra's life, instead of her father, her father's father, this city, that city, this man, that man.I love to read and was looking for something more entertaining - Anne Weir is a historical novelist she at least makes her written word interesting.This is B-O-R-I-N-G.The only reason why I give it two stars is due to the research.

His strong belief in duty, sense of right and wrong and his ever important sense of humor show in everything he writes. He's an optimist that made it through the war with all these attributes intact.

I don't have much else to say- it does exactly what it says it does, which is a great thing!The only thing that would make this product even better would be a thermostat in the vent controller rather than a timer (or a timer+thermostat), but this is still a great product without it.One other thing- I expected the batteries to die quickly since they are only AAA and they run the flap twice per day, but they last for months and months.

Too many different colours used in recipe titles, unattractive pictures, silly snapshots of all the ingredients used in each recipe, with the pepper mill appearing every time.......

So, I ask myself, why would I, or anyone else, want to put a penny in the pocket of such a arrogant prima donna such as Rocco? The are far better and finer Italian cook books on the shelves for anyone from a novice to advanced and I recommend that anyone looking skip anything with Rocco's name on it.

'Flavor' would look great on any bookshelf or coffee table, however it is not very practical as a cookbook. The information in it is a very overwhelming and not something the average person is going to be able to make.

The Transformed Man by William Shatner isn't flawed or ill-conceived, it's perfectly dreadful, reaching sublime and awe-inspiring new heights of schlock. Each passing minute finds listeners recoiling in astonishment as they struggle to believe their ears. This smorgasbord of embarrassing implausibility and pompousness is only possible through the offices of Shatner's hideously bloated ego which has blinded him to the project's breathtaking stupidity. If the phrase, \\"So bad it's good,\\" is in your lexicon, The Transformed Man just might be your guy.

There are only two explanations as to why William Shatner would subjugate humanity to this horror:Probable Explanation: Shatner's greed is the only thing that exceeds his massive ego and he got paid for this excursion into insanity.Trekkie Explanation: After the U.S.S. Enterprise-D encountered the Ferengi, section 31 decided to construct a doomsday weapon against them. An agent was sent back in time to abduct Captain Kirk and, using Romulan technology, forced Kirk to make this album. In the event of war, this recording would be broadcast on all Ferengi communication channels and, with their hyper-sensitive hearing, the Ferengi would be vanquished within minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Set phasers on \\"buy\\"","review":"If you dont wet your pants laughing hysterically after hearing this CD then you have no sense of humor.

I mean really, who thought setting up the theme from Cyrano and Mr. Tambourine Man as a medley was a good idea? His Mr. Tambourine Man is the most hysterically awful cover. Ever.

Standouts include the haunting \\"Forgiven\\" and the radio-ready \\"What Have You Got to Lose\\", which echoes in your head long after the iPod has been turned off. \\"Spin\\" grabs the listener with its lyrics of pent-up frustration (\\"What you want / is anything I can't conceive / What you dream / is everything you'll never be / You'll never have to say you're mine / You'll never have to walk the line\\") and the sensually charged \\"Charity\\" showcases Lord's voice to its best effect.

The only warning I would give is that is designed to be used with the larger of the 2 spark plug sockets. For my little car that wouldn't fit so I had to grind down the end to work with a smaller socket, but that was a simple enough fix. Also as a pointer I would say use a lot of grease when rethreading the hole. This will capture all the metal shavings and prevent them from falling down into the engine. Go slowly and pull out the tap to wipe off the shaving frequently and it is a simple enough task that saves you a large shop bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spode Collector","review":"I collect this pattern and was very pleased with the quick delivery and the quality of these dishes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"It's a 6 foot USB cable, it works, and seems to be well constructed.

What bothers me is the voice at the center of this \\"whirlwind of creativity\\". Ms. Williams oftentimes is loud, and her voice is definitely full, but her presentation lacks inspiration/character. Isn't there a problem when the back up singers sound better than the lead? For this music lover, it's an intollerable imbalance. If you're looking for NoW music with explosive, seamless tracks, lyrics and voices that move you professionaly, you'd do better with other tried artists like Stacie Orrico, Out of Eden, Virtue or Mary, Mary."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't sit well in my mind","review":"I read the book and it seemed to be way too gruesome for bedtime. If I was a child alot of the stories would have frightened me.For example, there are alot of references to murder, devils, demons, corpses, and other topics which could have a negative affect on young children, especially if they are prone to nightmares.It might be a book for older children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Postive Reinforcement Training Dogs In The Real World","review":"Our Vet recommended this book before we picked up our new puppy. It is an interesting book written more from the dogs point of view. It is helpful in understanding how a dog thinks and the importance of postive reinforcement instead of using punishment for training. It is an important idea to understand before trying to train your puppy or dog. It isn't difficult to understand and can be read in sections. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Anointed!","review":"This book is dynamic! It is packed with deep truth and wisdom. This book is very challenging, yet with an encouraging and understanding approach. The author, who I assume to be a woman, has really gotten into the mind and heart of God and men, delivering a message that instructs us on how to walk in purpose while addressing the issues we face and giving us God's answers and instructions. I was motivated by this book and impressed with it's biblical correctness! Definely a must read, should be in every Christian man's library"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling","review":"This book is in a way unique. It is different from medical thrillers as it describes life itself. It creates its suspense and its attraction from the fact that the real world, real events are interwoven with fictional characters who themselves are based on real characters. Everything is authentic in this book. Close consequently does not ask questions about his characters' motivation or their human defects. They are heroes as human as they can be. And all the more admirable. An excellent book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it, just go for The Hot Zone","review":"It took me forever to finally get into the book and by then, I just wanted all the characters to die from it and the book to be over.... Richard Preston wrote a much better novel, even if he wasn't there."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....","review":"Agree totally with all the 1-star reviewers. I read the Hot Zone and was riveted. Admittedly The Hot Zone was a bit more sensationalistic, but it was exciting. This supposed true account was dull, dull dull. Much of the book dealt with the interpersonal dynamics of the Sisters, rather than the Ebola outbreak. Based on the book's cover, I was expecting a detailed, somewhat scientific account about how the outbreak was discovered, investigated, and resolved. It certainly didn't do this."},{"rating":"2","title":"you'll never think about the diseases the same way","review":"I enjoyed this book very much;sure it wasn't the rollercoaster ride of \\"The Hot Zone\\", but it gives you the back story of the epidemic. You learn in detail about the people who were only briefly mentioned in \\"The Hot Zone\\". Those people's courage could inspire us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful summer read!","review":"Although this book does not move as fast as a fiction novel, it is genuine page turning enjoyment. The books main focus is on the people who had to fight a then unknown killer, and their own fears. If you want science fiction try Stephen King, but if you want instead to get to know the brave people who really faced the Ebola epidemic, then read this novel. It WILL touch you with their humanity"},{"rating":"1","title":"E-BORING!","review":"When I first saw this book, I figured it would be better than the Hot Zone because it dealt entirely with a real outbreak that the author had witnessed. Was I wrong! Preston is clearly a more talented writer and the Hot Zone is a better book. Close nearly put me to sleep talking about everything in the African village except Ebola. The interesting parts covered all of a page or two. At times the book reads likes a soap opera with Ebola as a backdrop. Skip it and stick with Preston and other writers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring boring boring","review":"You would think this book would have an edge over 'The Hot Zone' since he was actually in Africa during the outbreak, but you would be wrong. It took me forever to finish this book. The disease was much less horrifying in this book than it actually is; it was almost like he was writing about a flu outbreak or something. If you're looking for a real yawner to help you get to sleep at night this might be the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"best RATM album","review":"this album is definately worth the 27 bucks. the guitar solos kick ass! it is the best RATM album i've heard yet. if you're a rage fan, get this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is awesome","review":"This CD really rocks. The new Rage songs are awesome. They are some of Rage's best. The $30 price tag may seem high but the cd is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Rage CD So Far","review":"Live & Rare is by far the best Rage CD so far. Rage sounds great live, because they don't have sounds stuck into their songs that they can't reproduce on stage. The band seems to get into the music more when they're on stage, this makes the soungs sound just that much better. Another great thing is the CD contains some songs that are not on any other CD. Live & Rare is a great CD that any Rage fan should have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This is a great live album. Songs like Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos and Zapata's Blood are great rare live preformances. There is a great cover of F*** Tha Police and also a poem by Alan Ginsburg put to music. The version of Darkness is different from the version on the Crow soundtrack. The one problem with the CD is the liner notes aren't always accurate, but the words aren't anything you can't figure out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying for a RATM fan...except his collection","review":"MOCK Sony Japan and the producers for having released such a poor collection of songs. Sony Japan didn't even seek Zach (main vocals) and the rest of the band's permission, and they just threw it out like that! I've listened to almost all of their songs and seen some of their live videos, but never have I heard such poor singing from Zach. I must say that a newbie would immediately be put off by Zach's uneasy singing on stage. However it's wierd status makes it must have in a fan's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love this CD and wish there were more new CDs to purchase.

This album brings out some interesting aspects of the band you won't find anywhere else. While I would ratehr listen to Bombtrack on the self-titled album, Hadda Be Playin On The Jukebox and Darkness are excellent tracks, two of my favorite. The only problem is some of the songs on this CD are a wee bit repetitive, but the other songs make up for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Kickin' Album From RATM!","review":"Wow, This album is great! An amalgam of some of Rage's greatest tunes! Includes live versions of many tracks on Evil Empire and Rage Against the Machine, as well as cool exclusive tracks like Hadda Be Playing on the Jukebox, and Zapata's Blood. Includes full lyrics, in both Japanese and English! Very cool, and definetly worth the price. Great gift for any hardcore RAGE fan!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another legit rave cd","review":"This is another tight RAGE CD. The songs are all live except for two UNRELEASED tracks, which are very tight. You also hear F**k tha police live for the first time, along with a cameo by Chuck D. Its a tight CD, and also the poem that Zack reads onstage with a little bit of background help by tom is excellent. overall this is an excellent excellent CD and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live and rare... must purchase for the true Rage fan","review":"Where as the sound quality may not be the best, you have to understand the band is not an according to Hoyle... a studio band. They use this stage to bring out the true meanings and feelings of the songs recorded here...If you can get to the meanings behind the music played here, you can only then truely appretiate Rage.... The song Had to be playin on the jukebox, is a true deppiction of the America we live in... then and now... It also brings out other political artists such as Chuck D... of Public Enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not deliver results as promised","review":"After using almost the entire box as instructed, there was no noticeable change.

It seemed like its really not a movie but small vignettes tied together. sure, one scene led to another but overall it seemed very predictable and at times boring. The movie tries way too hard for humor with shock value and unfortunately for the viewer-goes nowhere. I love gross humor like anyone else but this movie did not work for me. the characters were typical and uninteresting. the trailer was much funnier and basically it showed you the funniest moments. in the film those scenes came into the movies first 15 mins!!!!. the rest of the movie went down the drain. this is one restaurant worth closing."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome","review":"this movie is like holariouse i dont know why i never watched it before and since i work in a restaurant now i have some pointers lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Welcome to Thunderdome B@@@H!\\"","review":"I have to admit that at first I did not know what to expect from this film, but as it turns out it was a very pleasant surprise!A good comedy, Waiting, brings to the screen the story of the crew manning a family restaurant called Shenanigan's.

Instead, I was served an assortment of shallow, uninteresting one-note characters prepared with a tasteless glaze of sarcasm and covered in a mound of genitalia references.This supposed comedy was dull, dreary and, worst of all, not funny.Otherwise talented actors, Anna Faris, David Koetchner and Wendie Malick, are wasted in thin characters with nothing funny to say. Luis Guzman is the only one able to generate any laughs.Some compare the film to Clerks. The only real comparison is that the writer of Waiting seems to have lifted the character of Jay from Clerks and split him into the two busboy characters who attempt a pale imitation of Jason Mewes.If you feel you must watch a movie that spoofs the banal and corporate theme restaurants, watch Jennifer Aniston's scenes from Office Space.

It's just annoying beyond belief. I'll admit the only reason I actually decided to watch this movie and rated it 2 stars was because Dane Cook was in. I figured, being a huge fan of his comedy, that this one might actually make me laugh..WRONG. He barely had any parts, and those were the only parts that were funny. But they were few and far between. I also want to note how cheesy Ryan Renyolds charcatar was..I cant quite pin if it was his acting or what, but it was painful to watch.

Then you grow up and think twice about complaing to your waiter.Watch this movie if you've ever worked in the food service industry and had to quit because it wasn't very fun.

I made it (painfully) through a half-hour before I just turned it off. It was way too crude and profane for me. I'm not into that type of movie. I felt dirty for watching that much of it.

Most of the movie lacked a decent plot and was just full of freshman [...] gags over and over again. I wouldn't recommend this movie, but if you want to see a funny movie that is similar to this, but that's hilarious all the way through, go with Clerks.

What they have in common is heavy reliance on Latin percussion to keep the groove going, and the lengthy solos of Carlos. The other main instrument featured in solos is keyboard/organ; some of the players are great, some are so-so. Some tracks have vocals, many are instrumentals.A few of the cuts cause me to wonder, \\"Why did they include THAT one?\\" And others that should have been here were not included (no \\"Oye Como Va\\"?).

A good rule of thumb is that if the shoes require a break in period that means they're too small to begin with, and you should go a bit bigger. They should be comfortable as soon as you put them on your feet (If they're not, don't get them).For the record I also ordered a Capezio Women's Groove sneaker in size 13 and it was too small.The Dansneaker is lightweight & very comfortable.

Returned it and ordered a 14. I just barely fits. I'm keeping it, because I like this shoe and hope that it will stretch a bit. A 14 appears to be more like an 11 1/2 for men.

I think your preference of shoe fit is important as well as width to consider...if you like them snugger, so smaller, but if you are like me and hate tight shoes, then go with the bigger. The do get warm, so expect that your feet will get sweaty. I love that they work for me both in the studio and on the carpet here at home, though.

It's difficult to write about a moving target, but I thought Eliotte Rusty Harold's XML Bible did a much better job, and his second edition will be out shortly. I was also disappointed that the authors didn't address grouping problems (Muenchian grouping, etc.). Overall, the book does seem to target the MSXML platform and goes into a lot of depth with that product, though other products are covered.

The metal is very sturdy and would have no issues putting a 40\\" tv on it. It pivots all the way to 90 degrees, so it is perpendicular to the wall it is mounted on. When I want it against the wall, it folds up nicely, giving the appearance that it is statically mounted on the wall. it only sticks out a couple of inches.Wire management is acceptable but not idea- it comes with zip tie like clips that snap into the bracket.I would buy another one of these in a heartbeat if I had the need.

Every song sounds the same. Still a good record, but didn't have the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Happy, Joy Joy!","review":"How could anyone dislike The Strokes? Being voted one of the worst live band performers in 2005 and recieving many critics' batterings has probably contributed to their unpopularity but honestly, as far as the general public is concerned, have many people ever honestly listened to and taken in this band? I love this album...every song is colourful and exhuberent! Sure, there are the Blink 182's of this world but, to me, they relay a common sound. The Strokes offer more...a raw, sharp innocence that just grabs you by the throat and says \\"Hey, wake up\\"!. Go on and listen to this album. Don't be put off by critisisms if you havent heard it already because you could very well be missing out on something that will uplift you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple","review":"I'm sure everyone knows \\"Last Nite\\". The video to that song was great, and was what got me interested in The Strokes to begin with. But having purchased their album, I was disappointed to find that what I thought would be a simple yet refreshing style is nothing more than simple. Lead singer Julian Casablancas uses the same radio effect on his vocals on practically every track, which becomes very irritating to listen to. I want to hear some variation from someone who is obviously a very good singer. It's the same deal throughout the entire album, with all the band members showing flashes of talent every once in a while, but not often enough for this album to be anything other than 11 tracks of exactly the same sound. They've taken their simple, energetic style and stretched it over an entire CD. Yawn. These guys should take some time with their next album, try and explore different themes and styles on the same CD, and above all else, ignore the hype. Guys, you're not that good yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"The return of rock!","review":"This band sounds like nothing else on the radio. It is a refreshing new sound to our derivative Rock and Alternative radio stations. With bands like this as well as White Stripes, they are touring together right now, The Hives, and Vines might finally end the horrid era of Nu Metal and Candy Pop.This is the best album I have hard since the debute of Le Tigre and the last Queens of Stone Age album."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmmm........i think they're pulling our leg.","review":"the strokes are definitely one of the best marketed bands to come around in a while; so i won't get too personal, i'm sure they're just a bunch of young pretty boys having fun. but the saviors of rock and roll? come on, man. to 'save rock and roll' in this day and age -- if we are to believe the strokes are the ones doing it -- is merely to prop up a cliched corpse and hope no one says anything disparaging.there is so much exciting and groundbreaking new music out there right now -- why jerk off to this stuff?if they hadn't gotten so big, they would have been a fun band to see on a friday night in nyc... but not too much more than that, not if you're looking for something that sticks to your ribs.peace (and borrow this cd before you buy, everyone and their dog has this)"},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmmm........i think they're pulling our leg.","review":"the strokes are definitely one of the best marketed bands to come around in a while; so i won't get too personal, i'm sure they're just a bunch of young pretty boys having fun. but the saviors of rock and roll? come on, man. to 'save rock and roll' in this day and age -- if we are to believe the strokes are the ones doing it -- is merely to prop up a cliched corpse and hope no one says anything disparaging.there is so much exciting and groundbreaking new music out there right now -- why jerk off to this stuff?if they hadn't gotten so big, they would have been a fun band to see on a friday night in nyc... but not too much more than that, not if you're looking for something that sticks to your ribs).peace (and borrow this cd before you buy, everyone and their dog has this)"},{"rating":"2","title":"good album!","review":"Hmmm...a while since I've written a review and I might well just type ... here.

Not over-produced American rock (thank God, don't care if it's a gimmick, I want mistakes, feedback etc), good delivery - spirit, good songs - not over-produced, good riffs, spirit of 77 hiding in there...they're self consciously cool, yeah...but we want our rock bands to be cool don't we?

Almost all my friends are, if not in bands themselves, then avid followers of the local punk, garage, psychobilly and related music scenes. The first anyone I know heard of The Strokes is that they were signed to a major and they were being pushed as the next Big Thing. They have nothing to do with the scene here. They're basically just young kids whose parents have good connections in the record industry. There are dozens of unsigned, unheralded bands in NY who blow these kids away. Seek out those bands. Ignore this pale imitation of rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you all that weak?","review":"Just because there are 600 and something reviews, I give you my opinion. I shall say that this is one of the worst most over hyped piece of (enter profanity) un-creative releases thats ever entered my possesion. What is wrong with you people? Why support this? These are our new generation artsy musical saviors?? Mabey you need to look a little harder for it. Its out there, just listen a little closer next time. Oh yeah, don't forget to turn off MTV at night when you fall asleep before it starts a vacuum secretly sucking any last bit of creativity outta your soul. Sweet Dreams!

Revere me!","review":"Bunch of sorry saps want cred for knowing the bands that came before this one and that one. Please, take it to your local used vinyl shop. The nosering dude behind the counter might care, i definitely don't.Strokes debut is taut, edgy, and LISTENABLE. Don't take my word. Check it out. Too bad for you musical luddites if you wanted another <insert band with cred here>. Too bad that YOUR sad and derivative attempt at making indie music is never going to get past your basement four-track for the rest of us to laugh at.Too bad for you that new bands are going to keep on appearing, and new songs are going to be written and sung while you will be hopelessly clinging to your record collection shouting \\"but they were here first!\\" Have fun with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"you have got to be kidding me","review":"I still habe a hard time believing that this CD and bands like this one actually sell CDs to anyone other than 10 year old kids trying to learn how to play the guitar, and yet, we have people actually listening and enjoying this drivel. Has the rock world and record companies sunk so low that they have to sell this junk by shoving it down your throat by having the radio stations play it a minimum of 5 times a day? there is no attempt at creative song making, creative lyrics, nor anything more than a simple beat, the same riff, and bass line, and a very boring singer who's hardly on key. bottom line: dont buy this CD, dont waste your money, unless you wanna buy into the whole \\"im a drone and pawn of record companies and radio stations and listen to what i am told is cool\\" genre, cause this is boring, mindnumbing and just a tad awful, Hey Amazon, where's the zero star button?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yea, this is it.","review":"I bought this album because of the hype and critical acclaim by itself, which is enough to convince me to buy an album. I didnt like it at first, but once the melodies of the songs start to sink in its a wonderful CD. Its alot like Weezer- nothing too special, good, short, rock songs, and somehow it works. The standout tracks to me are numbers 3, 6, and 7. Their new song that I saw on MTV2 after i purchased the album is a catchy song you'll find yourself singing for days. It has a great melody, and takes us back to the style of the 70's. This whole album sounds a bit like a 70's druggie album, actually. And that could be a good thing. With all this nu metal, death metal, alternative rap stuff thats out now, its great to have just a good, lo-fi, organic rock band. Its all up to them to save rock. Its a big task, but I think they'll be able to do it. Last Nite has just made top 20 on the Modern Rock charts, and I see it being a big hit. Definately buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Do I Read Album Reviews?","review":"All of the accolades and hype lavished on this album and on The Strokes themselves are about as easy for me to understand as a typical episode of \\"The Power Rangers.\\" To even suggest that The Strokes are heirs to The Velvet Underground's twisted vision of some 30 years ago and to mention them in the same breath as Television and, in some camps, Johnny Thunders, is just wrong. A more accurate comparision might be Jonathan Richman & The Modern Lovers, as \\"Is This It\\" features jangly guitars way up in the mix, which is great, but songs that just never seem to go anywhere, which is bad. Call me a dinosaur, but I'm still a big fan of songs that have a beginning, middle, and end. Brings back bad memories of the good money I threw after Joe Strummer's \\"X-Ray\\" album. Back to the drawing board, guys..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Better Not Be It","review":"I really wanted this cd when I heard a few of the strokes songs...I bought the cd and realized I had made a mistake. I was looking forward to the seemingly different songs this group was said to have...if different means bad then they achieved being different. My advice is not to waste your money unless you are sure you like the everyday \\"we are different\\" bands..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype-1, Strokes-0","review":"The most appropriately titled album of the year.Okay, it's not that it's a BAD album, it's just a little wanting for ideas. Hopefully, they'll be able to ignore the hype (and inevitable backlash) and write something a little less self-conscious next time out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel cheated","review":"I feel cheated by this release. I know that The Strokes are trying to circumvent this by releasing another DVD later this year, but I feel a certain sense of entitlement for having found The Strokes' music sooner, rather than later. I first bought the album on Ebay when the ship date was pushed back, and then I even bought the US copy for When It Started (terrible compared to NYC Cops). I don't want to have to spend more money on a product other people get for \\"falling in,\\" so to speak. I will still buy the DVD when it comes out...I really like The Strokes, but I don't condone this sneaky tack that they have taken up."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehhhh","review":"well if you really wanna listen to this cd... dont bother buying it... just download one song from itunes and play it 11 times! TADA!i have one question for the strokes...IS THIS REALLY IT!?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have NO taste AT ALL in music, you'll love this B.S.","review":"I can't believe that people actually buy this B.S.!!!!! There is obviously a large market for absolutely TASTELESS \\"music\\" (and I use that word as loosely as it possibly can). How these talentless individuals (I will NOT call the musicians for that would be a HUGE insult to TRUE musicians all around the world) got signed I have NO idea. Some idiot with a lot of money and perhaps a BIG favor being owed obviously conned someone into it. And a lot of idoit sheep follow the \\"trend\\" of people who have NO idea what good music is."},{"rating":"1","title":"listening to this will make you dumber","review":"The Strokes are an incredibly image-consious band concocted by a record label to try to sell the same boring alternative music that's been polluting the airwaves for years as \\"indie-rock.\\" Dorks who know absolutely nothing about music and are easily influenced by hype will probablly get into this and feel real cool. So if you are the type of person who shops at hot topic all the time and likes putting little pins with the British flag on them in your clothing, then this is your new favorite album. However, if you are interested in listening to something intelligent and unique, steer clear of this at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"way way way to overhyped","review":"this band was way to overhyped. They pull you in with awesome singles like on this cd Last Night which is awesome and the only reason I got this cd and then they put out 10 crappy songs to compliment their great songs. Wait 5 years before coming out with your next cd Strokes that way you can weed out the crap and come out with a decent cd because you can do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Not much here. The whole album is very repititous. All in all it's standard, and not much more.I wouldn't mind the standard chords and rather bland instrumentation if the lyrics were there to back it, but they aren't. As another reviewer said, there's nothing here that's new or innovative. That said it's not horrendous, but also not particularly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply astonishing","review":"The first time I ever heard The Strokes, I was really interested by the way they sounded. Not being familiar with them, I thought Is This It was made many years before I was born. I picked up the disc about 5 years ago and my initial reaction was wow how did they even get signed? I stuck to listening to only Last Nite and Someday. I kept listening to it though and over time it just took over me. I can listen to Is This It? for ever. Definately one of the best albums I've ever heard. The original version was even better, the only difference being that the song Alone, Together was not there and New York City Cops was. The album version with New York City Cops is where music comes to a pinnacle. A simply breathtaking album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a chance and you will love it.","review":"Okay, even though I am 17, I have been stuck in the 60's and 70's music wise. I am a big fan of the Beatles, Rolling Stones, some Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane, Pink Floyd, etc. Recently I have been listening to newer music, (Franz Ferdinand, the Killers, etc) and while browsing my local library I picked up the strokes. When I first listened to it, I hate it. The songs all sounded the same and Casablancas' voice sounded strange. However after listening to the CD several more times, I could distinguish between the tracks and now I love this album. My favorites are Last Nite, Someday, and Soma, but all of the tracks are great. Yes, they are no Beatles, nor are they revolutionary, but look past the prep school image and you can find some really fun music. Enjoy it and don't worry about whether they deserved their hype or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Throwback that doesn't completely suck","review":"Some of these songs remind of earlier Misfits albums with Danzig, though not as intense. This is something I picture being played on College radio stations for years to come. The songs are catchy, but are not deliberatly so. Get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on Guys","review":"This is a New York band? I thought New York had edge. Come on guys, get out there and live a little. What are you, holed up in some foofoo penthouse living it up or something? Girls and parties? Go to Harlem, go to the meat packing district - go somewhere and find yourselves some inspiration. God - is this CD bland or what?I live in New York and there are a lot of new bands with a point of view. There are a lot of bands trying to DO SOMETHING NEW. Not these bums. And some of those bands went to prep schools that are even hoity-toitier than the ones these jokers went to, so that ain't the reason. There's one decent song here and all I can say about it is that its fun. Jiminy Chrikit, if I want fun I'll listen to some pederast LA ska band!!If I wasn't going to return this CD I'd throw eggs at it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It","review":"I'm not going to waste time repeating the names of the bands they ripped off. Several people have already listed them. I saw an interview with them; they seemed shallow and self-conscious. I saw their boring and pretentious video. They look like pseudo-junkie Banana Republic models. Rock n' roll is dead. Buy the old stuff and stop whining."},{"rating":"1","title":"in a word, boring","review":"that's about all there is to say. do not waste your money on this stuff -- it's a lot cheaper and more enjoyable to just dig out those old VU records. it is sad that corporate america has coopted the underground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"talk about One Note Johnny's???what is this Lenny Kravitz's Backing Band(minus the Drummer who is tight) or something?in that Lenny Vein of One Chord Jams.too Quote Forest Gump Basic is as Basic does.the drummer never goes anywhere no changes&tired Vocals.sounds like only another 100 Billion Bands out now.no change in tempo or nothing.little to No Wonder that a Group like U2 way past there Prime&Peak still gets Love when this is the best that can be Hyped up??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Saviors of rock 'n roll?? WHAT!?","review":"OK, you can say whatever you like about these guys -- good, bad, boring, exciting, original, rip-offs (personally I find it to be incredible shallow sounding and boring), but they are SO far from being \\"saviors of rock n' roll\\" it's not even funny. FACT: This CD DOES NOT ROCK. Just a warning before you buy. It is very limp rock, and this is inarguable. Whether you like that style or not is another story, and you have a right to your opinion... Hype or no hype, this simply ain't rocking music, folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"yeeeeeesssssss","review":"This is a godd debut(not the best) and (in my opinion) better than room on fire. It sounds like the stooges playing television-esqe(????????) riffs with ol' julian trying his hardest to sound like a more passionate lou reed(he sounds A LOT like him on \\"modern age\\"). The guitars are pretty simple like the stooges, but spikier and more wirery like television. dig it? And everything is poppier, while trying to seem intelligent enough for the indie cult. This is good, pretty fun and cacthy music, but it doesnt really pull the whole intelligence act too well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This, most probably, is it.","review":"Right place right time or wrong place wrong time? The Strokes stepped onto the world stage at the center of such a large amount of dubious hype that it's still uncertain whether the band will be able to survive it. \\"Is This It\\" offers some evidence on the positive side, however. The trick the Strokes have perfected - and it's an impressive trick - is to evoke every great 70's New York band while actually sounding like none of them. Julian Casablancas' vocals are a charismatic upgrading of Lou Reed at his most tuneful; the guitars mix Television's ethereality with the Feelies' strum'n'chop; the rhythm section motors along like they were the CBGB's house band. Every note on the album is played at the service of the songs, which are all of a uniformly high quality. Their second album will inevitably be released to mainstream disappointment, but I've got a feeling the band wouldn't want it any other way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut Album","review":"The Strokes are just fun is that so wrong, what it's not cool to have fun anymore. Well if is pick up this album it's great. Is this it is kinda slow but good. The Modern Age is a sheer visceral thrill. Soma is probably the best song on the album, the ending is great. Barely Legal is a song that is great in the car. Someday should be played at every graduation instead of that stupid green day song. the next is a great filled with great solos. Hard to Explain is kind of an 80's flasback at first. The next is a very good jumpy song. The next is a heartfelt song that is amazing. And finally Take it Or Leave it is a fast paced roller coaster. And the DVD is icing on the cake."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME BAND ALERT!!","review":"The Strokes. More than just five drunk guys playing music. Ok, so that's the way it seems at first, but as you listen, there really is more to it.They are very talented. Yes, they do have influences from other bands, but who doesn't?All in all, they have an original sound that is very unique and stands out among the pop crap that is out in the world today.The Strokes are a refreshing whiff of air that isn't like the rest. It's nice to hear something different than the same old.Sure, there are other bands out at the moment, but I think that when you look over them all, The Strokes just stand out.I think, in my opinion, that we will be hearing more from them soon, and hopefully they will go up rather than down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different Strokes","review":"This is not a pop band, they are not manufactured to appeal to the masses. However, if you are actually into punk rock, and like at least one of their songs, yes, buy it! I first heard of The Strokes when I saw their video, Last Nite. I liked what I heard so I bought the album. If I could give it ten stars I would. They have a fresh and unique sound, songs that really get the adrenaline going. All of the songs have a strong beat, and catchy tune, meaningful lyrics, and incredible guitar combinations and solos. Even the baselines are hummable. Not to mention the infectiousness of the album- you'll find yourself loving them instantly, humming their songs all the time and recommending it to all your punk loving friends.Come on people- if you bought this album because it is popular, has great reviews, is selling lots, and you are giving it a bad review, give your head a shake! You should at least listen to something once before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good album....","review":"but the media may have hyped it up a bit too much. Anyway,this is the best rock music I've heard out of any band in a while so why are so many people complaining? Sure, they use simple riffs and chords, but that doesn't mean they don't have talent. Has anyone seen them live?, I think that would answer their questions about talent. These guys can really play and solo. Songs like Soma and Someday have a really good sound. Julian Casablanca (thats quite a name) sounds ok using that microphone distortion thingy, but it could get a little old. I think he should use his natural voice more on future LPs. Overall, I think that the album definitely is one of the best of 2001. Its a nice change of pace when the music industry is crammed with boyband imitations of imitations..."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks","review":"This C.D. is too old fashioned. To many relaxed beats. If you like slow 80's stuff then here is the excellent disk for you. I like the heavier stuff so I'm not very impressed buy this. But you have to give them credit for trying. Thats why I rated this 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun but......","review":"OK let me start off by saying i like this cd a LOT- but as i listen to it more and more the songs kind of start to melt into eachother and theres a few of them that i cant really tell apart- sure there are songs like last nite that differ greatly from everything else but teh first two songs just dont sound THAT different- its usually the same chords- i dnno, maybe i just haven't listened to it enough but overall- its a great cd and its worth buying"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This album is full of great guitar hooks from the bass line in \\"Is this It\\" to \\"Take it or Leave it\\". I didn't like this kind of music back when it came out, so I guess you could say I am immune to the hype that everyone talks about. I can certainly understand how peoples expectations disappointed them, but this album certainly didn't disappoint me. I think that it is still the greatest album to be released this millenium. The guitar hooks are so incredibly catchy and fun...and they are in every song. Every song will stay in your head. It is impossible to skip any of these songs. I would reccomend this to everyone who likes rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calling All Indie Rock Lovers","review":"This CD was and remains one of the best mellow rock CDs I have ever purchased. This is one of the only CDS where I can honestly say I don't have to skip a single song on this album, I enjoy every one. This is a great CD to put in your headphones and just lay back and listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing new, but very fun!!!","review":"Lets face it, the Strokes had a lot of help from Iggy Pop and the Velvet Underground in making this album, but you know what; it's still a great album. I especially like this one when I am rolling down the freeway in my metal coffin.Is this it? If you want something original, this ain't it. If you want something to bop your head to, this IS it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cd but small bummout","review":"This Cd really is amazing(for the most part). All of the tracks are the kind that you can really get into; however, I am alittle dissapointed in the amount of pop radio aimed content. This CD is deffinatley on my top ten list but isn't quite number one because of this. Everyone shold own a copy ,though, but I relly feel like the guys in the band sold out a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums to come out in a long time","review":"A lot of people say. It's all hype and this really isn't all that great. Which is fine people are entitled to their own opinions. I bet though if Pet Sounds, Revolver or any other classic album came out today those people would be saying the excact same thing. The point is years from now all the people who say it's all hype and this and that will have to eat their words. Is This It is the best album to come out in a long time. It made rock 'n' roll fun again. It made rock bands cool again. It's packed full of catchy rock and roll songs. There isn't one filler on the album. Even if the band never top this we still have this album to listen to as much as we want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Band in the World","review":"The Strokes \\"Is This It\\" does not have a bad song on it... I have memorized the entire CD, Julian's vocals rock. I love all the songs on it, especially \\"Last Nite\\" and \\"Barely Legal.\\" Strokes=Love. Everyone should buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take your time.....","review":"I first heard of the Strokes in Feb '02. I was planning to go to the Ozzy gig at the Budokan in Tokyo, and called a friend to ask if he wanted to come along. He said, \\"Why are you going to watch (old) Ozzy? Come with me to watch the Strokes instead\\". I watched the Ozzy concert anyway (he is the prince of darkness, master of the universe, after all), but bought the Strokes CD. It took a couple of listenings to get used to -- hey, there haven't been any good rock acts in the late 90s, but the Strokes are brilliant. I positively love them. And while Ozzy still rules, the Strokes are it for 2002 as far as I'm concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Real","review":"Everyone thinks that they know what music is. Everyone thinks that there idea is the right way. Critics of the strokes say that they ripped off the pixies, and half a dozen other bands. How dare they say that when all we have to listen to today is Brittany Spears and Creed nock offs. You say, \\"Well they think they are the saviors of Rock and Roll.\\" No, rock and roll died about 30 yeasr ago. The Strokes, Oasis, and The Black Crowes were just born in the wrong generation. One thing is for certain though, The Strokes are very refreshing and you can't hear that anywhere else. They might not be the best musicians out there but its a lot better than the pop b.s. of MTV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful","review":"The Strokes are one of my favorite bands. They keep it real with simple melodies and smooth groove rhythms, backing the humble, incisive lyrics of Julian Casablancas. If you're tired of the overproduced, pandering to the masses mold that encompases the vast majority of todays top 10 lists, give this one a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent music, zero originality, but good listening","review":"There are a few things I can see to be bad about this album. One, it has no originality, true music critics, including myself, agree about this fact. They are a mix of velvet underground, rolling stones, and maybe some creation, IMO. But, the tunes are good, without a doubt, and so are the lyrics. You might have a problem with the image these guys try to create, and the fact that they fashion themselves artists. But no doubt, this is not disappointing if you just listen without trying to wear it down and criticize. And as one other reviewer said, it's a welcome change from the downward spiral in mainstream rock today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take it or leave it? OH LEAVE IT PLEASE!","review":"Originality? Nope. Talent? Nope. Good lyrics that make you think or are at least are well thought out? Nope again. Strike three. This album's out. The Strokes had the audacity in the first place to act like an indie band, and they still act like it. Yeah they may look cool and act all mellow and have this \\"we're not in it for the money\\" attitude but they are most definitly the opposite. For starters, the lyrics are atrocious, and are quite possibly some of the worst scribbling any band has ever done. The melodies are nice and catchy (sometimes), but for the most part there is no attention grabbing tune that makes you think, \\"Man, this rules!\\" A huge letdown is what I'd call this album, as the way peopl are hyping it up. Listen to the Beatles, Velvet Underground, heck, listen to American Boychoir before you listen to this piece of [stuff]. Fake indie at it's most average. If that's attainable...."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a c.d.!","review":"Is this it? It certainly is, This c.d. is one of the best cd's i have seen in the last 5 years. Why? 1. originality 2. Beautiful Lyrics 3. Awesome base lines, guitar lines, drum lines, and vocals. All of the songs carry a sence of emotion. The song \\"NYC Cops\\" brings a Raw, energetic feel, that complements every other song. \\"Is this it\\", their first album, makes a good first impression, and i believe that if their cards are played right. They will go far.As Far as the video's are concerned, I thought that they were excellent. It's amazing to me how care-free they get sometimes. Julian , the lead singer, is drinking heineken right in the middle of songs, for crying out loud! They all smoke cigarettes, and have fun! And could care less what other metal-heads and Punks think about them. They bring the coolest message a band could ever concieve.....\\"Can't we all just get along\\" (and party, and drink)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the EP...It's better","review":"I picked up the Modern Age ep a few months ago and was blow away at the raw, hard rocking sound. I also had the opportunity to see the Strokes live a month or so ago and they were true to form with the EP. I just picked up the LP yesterday and was disappointed about the amount of polish the mixers put on the songs. Not to say that this lp is bad, it has some great songs, but it lacks the power of the ep.If you already have the LP and love it, but the ep and take it to the next level.If you're thinking about picking this up, buy the ep instead and save your money for the next release. Hopefully the record company will let The Strokes sound like they do live on that one. Raw, Powerful and Hard"},{"rating":"2","title":"35 minutes of fresh music","review":"This is 35 minutes of fresh music that is breathtaking. From beginning to end it is absolutely awesome. Finally someone has figured out that the offbeat adds interest and texture to music. The record has a garage feel to it throughout. I think people are primed to hear something with some originality and feeling in it. You absolutely must listen to this record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"PULEASE! stop this absurd PR campaign. I bought this CD based on the hype you see here and elswhere (RS). I should have known better when I read the comparisons to the Velvet Underground (they sucked too)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome Album; cracked CD case","review":"The album is great. The product from Amazon came with a crack in the case - not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to like it but............","review":"Maybe Im being unfair. This cd just doesnt do anything for me. Ive had it about six months now, and it just wont grab me enough to stay in my 5 disc player. Is it cause all the songs sound the same? I dont know. I got into the Vines cd more than this. (The Strokes are often compared to them). Maybe in a year or so Ill get what I seem to be missing now, but as for now, this one is on the back burner."},{"rating":"1","title":"with any luck","review":"Man, is this a poor showing by some snotty poseurs from the bowels of the Upper East Side. Is this what rock has sunk to? The singer's lousy, and the playing reminds me of the kind of stuff that was slapped together for battle of the bands night back in high school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whaaaat?!","review":"This album is bad, kids. Rich kids from New York who dress snappy put out a mediocre collection of songs that sound nothing like the Velvet Underground or Television, despite what some critics would like to have you believe, and the whole world flips out. Yeah, the Strokes have a good song or two (Last Nite, despite the purposeful misspelling, isn't bad) but all in all, it [stinks]. Plus, that whole \\"return of rock\\" thing is SO annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it","review":"I don't understand all the hype. Is This It might be the most overrated album in the last decade. I mean really- the music has been done before. It's unoriginal,bland, and the lyrics are meaningless. Come on- The Strokes aren't going to save rock n roll. While bans like The White Stripes and maybe even The Hives might be considered \\"overrated\\" and \\"all hype\\", at least I can say that their music is more original than this junk. One listening to this CD (or maybe even their singles!) will get you fast asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this it?","review":"That's what I wondered after listening to this album. Is this IT? ...the Strokes? The band that's being compared to Velvet Undergroud??? This is the most oversimplistic, underproduced garbage I've ever heard. I can't believe what [junk] it is. So \\"Last Nite\\" is a good single and a so is \\"Is This It\\" And maybe perhaps down the road, Julian Casablancas has some talent in the songwriting department, but the lack of musicianship kills this album. There is no sound to the album. The vocals aren't muddy and unclear. The drums aren't well-mic-ed not to mention played with little skill or variation in style. The guitar playing is mediocre and all the riffs sound exactly the same. Honestly, I find it difficult to distinguish between the songs because they all sound very similar. This group focused a ton on their look and not enough on their music. I'm still shaking my head at this horrible, horrible album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired (but I was suckered by the hype)","review":"I don't usually read Spin Magazine, but I found a copy in the laundromat and gave it a gander as my clothes were drying. There was a short piece about \\"The future of rock and roll,\\" as embodied in this band from New York. I was intrigued, since the writer described them as something orginal and great.... But I should have known better (instead, I bought the CD). This music is completely recycled and devoid of anything creative, daring, original or even pleasurable to listen to. After just a day of listening to it, disgusted with my purchase, my girlfriend suggested I give it a few more listens. Problem was, I had a headache all next day because these extremely annoying Strokes songs kept rattling around in my head (like a bad commercial jingle).If this is the future of rock and roll then God help us, we're in for a truly boring and superficial tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazing...","review":"isn't it amazing how 11 songs can all sound the very same. if this band is going to save r&r we're in real trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece","review":"is this it is one of best recent rock album along with the albums from jet and the darkness which are certainly anydays better than the awful nu metal albums which are being released.my rating five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breath of fresh air for rock","review":"With an old school and garage band sound to them, the Strokes created a perfect sound: rock that's simple and back to the basics, but is catchy and absolutely brilliant, all without trying too hard. When I first listened to Is This It, the whole time I kept expecting some sudden drumroll and then have the song fall into crazy guitars and drums, the way some bands start off a song plain and simple then turn it around into overdrive, but it never came with the Strokes, and that's the beauty of it: simplicity that you get absolutely hooked to. My personal favorites on here are The Modern Age, Last Nite, and Hard to Explain, but the disc as a whole is fabulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can i say?","review":"What can i say? This is one of the best albums i've ever heard. The first time i heard it i couldn't stop for months. Over and over again. What does that mean? It means it's a excellent album. You can listen to it in the morning, during the day, at night, and to go to sleep to. This music has something that most other music doesn't have. Substance. And it's really catchy too! But i'm fed up of haters who critisise the band just because they were rich when they were kids. What these people don't know is that the strokes worked very hard to get where they are now. And they deserve it. I hope the next album is as good as this, maybe even better. BUY THIS ALBUM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the saviors of rock - but not bad either.","review":"The Strokes certainly do bring back memories of late 70's rock/punk. The riffs are catchy and melodic. The songs are very simliar to one another. Almost too similar as they flow into one another...it's like you've heard one long song after listening to the album. Last Nite is a good song with an equally good 70's-esque video.If you want to listen to something better - but somewhat akin to the Strokes - check out Marquee Moon by Television."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pay Extra for the Import","review":"I admit that I jumped on the Stroke-wagon a little late but I'm glad I climbed aboard. I really appreciate albums without filler. \\"Is This It\\" is just that, strong all that way through. The walking basslines of the title track mesh perfectly with Julian's vocals. The beginning of \\"Last Night\\" will remind you immediatley of \\"American Girl\\" by Tom Petty but comes into it's own after the first few bars. Throwing down a few more ducats gets you the original album artwork which was banned in the US (the whole situation is very reminiscent of Spinal Tap's \\"Smell the Glove\\", STRANGE), and the song \\"NYC Cops\\", which was left off the US release after the WTC 9/11. This song is the most \\"punk\\" on the CD. Aside from the multitude of 70s band comparisons (Television), if you like good, bar band rock this IS it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cut the guys some slack","review":"I have this feeling that the people who are so mercilessly bashing these guys are more outraged by all the hype that surrounds this young band.Having picked up on The Strokes \\"post-hype\\", I was able to listen with an un-biased ear and take the music for what it really was.Sure, there isn't anything ground-breaking here-but the music is fresh, its fun, energetic, and very enjoyable. \\"The Strokes\\" aren't musical gods, but they write sweet tunes, and the instrumentation is tight. They don't sound like every other band out there, and their popularity is easily credible to the fact that their music is genuinely fun without sacrificing the band's artistic integrity.Is This It is a VERY fun and upbeat album. There isn't a single downer-if you don't get the urge to nod your head somewhere in the middle of the album, something is seriously wrong with you. So, chill out, ignore the hype, turn the music up, and sing along to this fresh, fun, and zesty band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Save Music","review":"This is a great 'new' album. Yes, it has a very stong influence from the Velvet Underground, the Stooges, and many of the great bands that made music great in the 60's/70's. Stop complaining about these strong ties! What made music great then can still spawn great music now! It can't replace the classics that will always be fantastic to listen to, but what it can replace is all that terrible teen pop, N'Sync Backstreet Boys Britany Spears! They can't even play instruments!If imitation is what it takes to save us from the terrible force of teen pop then please, imitate!The Strokes have created a beautiful album, and i highly recommend it, evey track is great and i can't seem to get tired of the catchy riffs and intriguing lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Can Something So Terrible Be So Terribly Good?","review":"Musicianship of The Strokes: 1/5Lyrics: 2/5Production: 2/5Pop Melodies: PRICELESSLet's face it The Strokes are not terribly talented with their instruments. No innovation here. Every song sounds virtually the same. It seems as though their guitar players knows 3 and a half or four chords. The lyrics are typical pop drivel. And I hate how the lead singer's voice is distorted on the entire album (to make him sound older?).So why can I not stop listening to it?The melodies are catchy . . . I often underestimate how catchy. I bought the album for \\"Last Night,\\" and just assumed the rest of the album was filler material. I listened to it anyway and vowed never to listen to it again. I did that daily for a couple weeks before finally grudgingly admitting to myself that it must be good. There is something highly addictive in this music that can not be analyzed, it can only be enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Strokes","review":"How long has it been since you bought a CD where every song was good on it? This is the CD that lives up to that, and keeps it going. I bought this CD in December 2001, and it's stood it's ground in my 5 CD Changer for over a year now. This is a Great Album from a Great Band, which should have a Great Future."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"This is it\\" ain't it","review":"It's ludicrus for anyone to compare The Strokes to Radiohead. They're completely different sounds. Radiohead is made up of major league musicians and Thom Yorke is a brilliant vocalist and writer, while The Strokes sound like every other wannabe Velvet Underground band I see every weekend in NYC. I'd rather listen to Television's Marquee Moon, it's the same sound but with better guitarists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been There","review":"While I don't find this album to be terrible, I do find it terribly unremarkable. All hype aside, this band is O.K. I've been told to just to listen to it and take it in. Whatever happened to freewill or having and opinion? I don't have to accept it if I don't want to.Being that their single sounds like a ripoff of Tom Petty's \\"American Girl\\" ..., I am even more disappointed in the uneven sound of the record. They do sound \\"homegrown\\" and it has been a while since NYC had a band to boast about. And yes, many bands sound like the Velvet Underground and Tom Petty ripped his sound off of the Byrds. But, at my jaded age, it's hard to get past the contrived look and sound here. This is nothing new and not very interesting. No, this is NOT it, at least for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've never heard Lou Reed before, you might buy it.","review":"But I don't. It kind of reminds me when Lenny Kravitz came out with Let Love Rule. If you'd never heard John Lennon or the Beatles before, you might think it was a good record. Well, perhaps enough time has passed that a new generation, unfamiliar with Velvet Underground and what they meant to modern rock'n'roll, will hear this record for the first time and think \\"how innovative!\\" Though their impression of V.U. is quite good, I nevertheless would like to hear what the Strokes themselves actually sound like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"This is a great example of style over substance. The Strokes can pose, sneer and act snotty. They have hip clothes and great rock-n-roll hair. The have a sack full of great reviews. The one thing missing is.....TALENT. They just can't play. Their songs aren't particularly interesting in structure, theme or melody. Their chops are terrible. Yet, some influential music spin-doctor has labled this \\"minimalist\\" in an attempt to justify their lack of proficiency in playing and songwriting. The only reason they SEEM interesting is the background of boy-band garbage and bubble-gum pop against which they are juxtaposed. As a guitar player for the last 20 years, I love all types of guitar driven music-rock, pop, metal, punk, jazz- whatever. For me, however, the Strokes come up lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't over analyze!","review":"I read some of the other reviews.....those people must think that they are some kind of authority on music, fortunately I'm not under that illusion. Forget the hype, and overanalzed reviews. I like this cd because it puts me in a relaxed, chilled mood at work, and that's not easy to do. Buy this cd and enjoy it for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite yet...","review":"Really, these guys are still only getting their feet wet. It is far too early to claim The Strokes to be very much of anything, at least until they release their next full-length album and then see where it goes. I can't really say I like this band per say, because we all know that it has been done before with far better results. One of the major problems I have with this band is that their is no real creative edge to what they do, and their music by no means packs a punch. So is this some sort of new variation of Rock 'N' Roll music that actually doesn't rock??? It also amazes me that groups like The White Stripes and The Strokes have gotten so much media hype within the last year or so, and yet the great freak-out rockin' music of the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion has yet to receive its due. Anyhow, as far as The Strokes go...there's just gotta be someone pulling the strings behind the scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strokes, but whose?","review":"Okay this is such an exciting group it's like Lou Reed 30 years ago shamelessly ripping off songs of the 70's. Soma, is that the disco song from the movie slap shot? I keep humming \\"Last night I said, lets rip off Tom Petty's American Girl.\\" This why no one respects critics. Some bands get nailed for being knock offs and some are just ignored. Why the critics love the Strokes is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Strokes make irresistible New York rock","review":"The Strokes are just plain fun, and British Press Releases that claim them to be a great band are wrong. The Strokes are way better than that, and their authenticity hydroplanes through dark alleys of sellouts, posers, and \\"seemingly fresh music.\\" But the Strokes may be some of the only fresh alternative of 2001. Despite Weezer's geek-rock triumph, Tool's clatter and clang rock-opus, and Pete Yorn's telling soliliquy festival, The Strokes hearty brand of New York rock is a reaper to its competition. If the first single \\"Last Nite\\" doesn't have you in an all-out tap session, then stellar trip-hops like \\"Barely Legal\\" will. The Strokes are unavoidable, irresistible, New York rockers with a sound sure to get the party started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deception","review":"I heard a lot of good things about this album. Honestly, I'm very disappointed: it's bland, boring, lacks energy.I wouldn't recommend this album if you want to hear \\"something different\\" in the current rock'n'roll production. Go check White Stripes instead: garage sound, tons of tunes, amazing stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is the future of rock and roll... it's over.","review":"This CD is nothing more than the whiny ramblings of a spoiled little...rich boy turned \\"rocker\\". None of the songs on this album capture any sort of passion or groove. And what is their feigned anger about- the high price of CD's? They have nothing to say! The lead singer is mediocre, can't play any instruments, the songwritng mundane, predictable... Kate Moss and her starving model buddies might have been stupid enough to fall for all of the hype around this band but noone serious about good music will. Everytime a band is declared the savior of rock and roll they soon die. It's the same as trying to compare a lame band to The Beatles (i.e. New Kids On the Block, Oasis, Hanson- they all [stink] and have no longevity). This album is garbage. You're better off buying Gary Glitter's Greatest Hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing New but Still Good","review":"They seem to be trying to sound like Velvet Underground, MC5 and The Stooges combined. Not the most original sound BUT... It's still better than the typical garbage out there in rock today. I got so tired of the grunge formula (quiet verse, and surprise loud chorus) that I had to resort to trying (and liking) jazz!! All in all if you're looking for a new sound -move along- but if you're looking for something that stands apart from garbage like - Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, Blink 182, Nickelback, Puddle of Mud, Creed, Everclear(OH!! DO THEY BITE OR WHAT), and all those other pretentious, I'm more introspective and serious than you are type bands, then try this. It doesn't bite, and with today's rock music that's a start.P.S. White Stripes don't bite at all - try them too"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is This It","review":"Who cares if The Strokes dress like \\"bums off the streets\\"? Who cares if The Hives, The White Stripes and The Strokes are all the same? Just listen to the album without caring what they dress like, or with the idea that they \\"saved rock'n'roll\\". It's honestly one hell of an album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Smokin","review":"When I first heard this I didn't think much of it. I thought too much Lou Reed, too much Velvet Underground too much Iggy, too much of what came before. Then I saw them a few times on the tube and my impression changed a hundred and eighty degrees. These guys really dig what they're into and after a FEW listens to the cd I can say this stuff has a killer groove. Casablanca has an awesome voice and the band is totally spot on in their delivery. The best part is they aren't ruling the air waves (yet) and the hope they keep this crazy hybrid of whatever the heck it is flyin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Debut Album from NY rockers","review":"What can you say about a debut album, as convincing as this. You have already read about them in all the music papers, and rightly so, because when you first hear The Strokes debut album 'Is This It' you don't know what to do with yourself. Jump, scream, hop about the room or run to your next door neighbour and tell them all about it. It starts off slowly with title track 'Is This It', but when the crunching intro to 'The Modern Age' hits you, you just want to get down and boogie. Track after track, your feet and hands get sorer with all the tapping being done. Make sure when you buy this album you get plenty of sleep the night before because I can guarantee that when you hear 'Is This It' your stereo will keep on playing all night long."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointing","review":"I must admit that I found this album a little disappointing. It isn't bad, but it lacks that certain something, that sets great bands apart from the rest. There are two good songs on the album, but it is let down by the quality of the vocalist, who reminds me of Iggy Pop. Their guitar-orientated sound also sounds a bit derivative. I guess if I were top recommend some alternatives they would be: Travis, Radiohead and The White Stripes. All of whom have that spark, which the Strokes don't seem to have. For the saviors of Rock and Roll I would look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"i wish i was this cool","review":"Wow! the way these guys dress is so cool! Thats what the strokes would like to hear isn't it? Because thats all they seem to care about, take real rock stars like Keith Richards and Jimmy Page, they only cared about the music but they still looked cool! I suppose though that because rock 'n roll is now fashionable again there may be some bands that have worked hard actually make it and are not important rock stars because their rich daddies have bought them the breaks. Last Nite, is a good track but it sounds very similar to the rest of the album, they all seem to be the same chords being strummed and the same beat.One day you guys WILL discover good music, just believe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"What do you get when you take a style of music that's been played for years by NY bands, and put it in the hands of a bunch of heavily connected European-boarding-school-bred Manhattan elitist snobs?

Make the rich richer sheep!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking passion and emotion.","review":"The Strokes are all hype and style with no substance. It certainly helps when each of the members of the group have the advantage of an instant cash machine to feed the public relations machine thereby building the hype. The critical acclaim heaped on the this group is not warranted. The songs are weak and limp. None of the songs exude any passion, emotion or feeling. Don't buy into the hype. Do not buy this disc until you have heard it in its entirety first. Do not buy it based on its critical reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bands like this-why rock is boring","review":"I know why this band is so overrated. 14 year old wanna be rock stars in their basements, listening to a rock radio station, all of a sudden hear something that isn't nu-metal. \\"Wow,\\" they think, \\"I've never heard anything like this before.\\" They watch MTV 2 and see the video with Family Feud in it, and think \\"I like this band.\\" Then they become fans. What they don't realize is that this \\"new music\\" has been done MANY years ago, and much better in fact.Is This It is an album that bores me to death. I hear \\"Sometimes\\" and I bite my nails. That's how much I dislike The Strokes. People think they're a real rock band because of their ripped jeans. Yeah, that'll definitely make you \\"The Saviour of Rock n Roll! Kind of sad.

Very few, even so, this album fell short of my expectations. I like the gritty performances, but the songs themselves are no good. They are probably a good band to see live, but this album does not reflect that. The more I listened to it, the more I realized that it is a bit \\"fruitcake\\".

I just can't for the life of me understand why everyone thinks this record is so good, yeah so it's better than Limp Bizkit, but so are alot of things. It doesn't sound at ALL like the Stooges, there's no Television guitar work on here, yeah, so the singer sounds a little like Lou Reed, big deal.

Not much good music is played to the masses, but every once in a while something great comes along, and The Strokes are even better.The songs are simple yet well thought out in their composition. Nothing is overplayed and there's always something fresh beaten into your ear drum. They're great song writers, incredibly catchy, and definitely put a unique spin on their influences which sound like the Velvet Underground, Ramones, The Doors, maybe Stereolab, The Clash, and early Talking Heads.Buy this album for it's mastery of the music...not for the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"the strokes - is this it","review":"absolutely amazing- nothing like it- completely original, and an ingenious masterpeice- BUY IT NOW! you wont be disappointed.You cant really classify it as one type of music- but you can try- Here we go- its like old skool punk (note the k), but not so raw, some chilled tracks which are tre catchy and fun to listen too!

They are just not original at all. If this record had been released twenty five years ago, then it probably would have been great, but this has all been done before and usually much better. The songs when viewed strictly on there own merits aren't bad, but there is a certain monotony to this album that really wears on my nerves after a while. The singer's voice never variates from the same tone, and he seems to show absoluteley no emotion in any of the songs. It also seems like the guitarist plays the same riffs on every song.

Just about every star winds up rich, and I don't think this discredits their music any more than the personal wealth of the Strokes' members does. The fact is that the Strokes' album IS one of the best rock albums released last year, and is hands-down the best MAINSTREAM rock album put out in a long time. The reason the Strokes will save rock is because their label will push them out from the deep crevices where other so-called \\"genuine\\" rock acts crawl to tan or burn under your capricious gaze (and honestly, some of these guys could use a tan). So to all those wearing rock t-shirts from unknown bands to \\"prove you were there and heard of them first\\", just admit that the music on Is This It is fantastic and you just don't like anything that plays on non-college radio. If you want a great album, click and buy the Strokes. If you want to pose about musical knowledge, go buy some vinyl and just shut up."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is supposed to save rock and roll???","review":"The music is simple basic pop that has been done a million times.

I would rather buy material from the bands that wrote this music 20 years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limp and Lacking Substance","review":"Surely one of the biggest disappointments in recent years after hearing such critical praise. The Strokes play sort of amalgam of late 70's and early 80's punk and downtown rock but with little grasp of wit, melodic sense, or dynamics. Sure, it sounds rough and tough on the surface, but there just isn't enough musicianship here to provide any ongoing interest. They will have a few big singles and then fade into ... ruin. The best thing these guys could do would be to take five years off, hone their chops, and see if they could write better songs. Without the lead singer's family name, they would be a mere footnote on the NYC club scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Message to the Brainwashed Masses: This is NOT music","review":"\\"Album of the Year 2001?\\" And Amazon reviewers are still claiming this album \\"saved rock\\" 4 years later??

After reading so many glowing reviews of this disc and being buried in the media onslaught declaring The Strokes the next great rock n roll band, I was expecting something darned impressive when I slapped this on. What I got was warmed over Stooges, Velvet Underground and Television, played with precision and absolutely no heart. This isn't a rock band--it's a cruise ship act, suitable for cabarets and weddings. These boys should be playing VU covers for happy seniors. The only thing less impressive and more transparently calculated than this disc is The Strokes' stage presence. Man, they must love watching themselves on video--\\"Did you see that?

Television-type guitars), a little Devo and the Cars; Pavement, Sebadoh, and the whole lo-fi thing; I think, though, my number one perceived Strokes influence has to be the Feelies - I thought they were all over this record.And, by the way, I loved it. Best rock record of the year, if not for the White Stripes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Strokes really stroke one.","review":"After all the hype I expected to hear something amazing and magical. Unfortunately, this one fell a tad short. Quite possibly because of it's hype and the unfair label that has been put on them as \\"The saviors of rock and roll\\". Not even close, but if it had been just another album put out without so much expectations then it would've been a great consistent rocker. Although the lo-fi sound gets a little annoying. \\"Last night\\" is the best song on the album. A catchy tune with a classic rock and roll sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Step back but definately the way forward","review":"When I first played the Strokes my first thought was the same as the albums title. On the second listen the real energy began to surface and by listen three I was well and truly hooked.

Maybe when I hear that this band plays rock-n-roll, I'm thinking the Stones, Ramones, Replacements, Zeppelin, Social D.,etc. The Strokes have the energy and enthusiasm of a stroke victim. The only song I can even remember is track seven, which rips off the beginning of \\"American Girl\\". The whining muffed vocals and the mundane guitar playing blur without distinction from song to song, in a vain attempt to hide the lack of talent.

The strokes is a very progressive band and for that reason i'm very excited to see their next few albums then to judge. The song \\"someday\\" and \\"is this it\\" raised many questions about ourselves, through those songs you can tell that their lyrics actully aimed towards our life style and question it... is this it? after school, after college, after getting a house in a middle-class town, after everything still not getting the satifaction, is this it? The band promise very intellectual and artistic abilities, their next few albums should be very cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battles Hype, Emerging Victorious","review":"As is my way, I'll keep this short. I purchased this album with trepidation. I was very wary about all the hype I'd heard surrounding the band. Sure, I really liked the 'Modern Age' EP, but I wasn't sure the Strokes could pull off a whole LP worth of killer material. They do.The songs are short, punchy, and on the whole, rather tense. The guitars seem more interested in serving as rhythmic instruments rather than spewing out tired riffs.Anyway, I'm keeping this short, so... If you're an old Velvets or Stooges fan, give this set a try. Sure, it may not be 'as good as they used to make it,' but it's pretty (...) close."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHOA!","review":"These guys are incredible. Forget hype, precedents by other bands, and everything else you know about them. Buy the record and just listen. Let the music flow and immerse yourself in every single song.

It's time to bring in \\"garage-rock-revival!\\" Now, I can't claim to have paid attention to the music scene during the original reign of garage rock, but the Strokes' \\"Is This It\\" is an album truly deserving of the genre \\"Pop/Rock\\" because it sounds to catchy to be rock, but too hard to be pop. No, they're not \\"saviors\\". They're just as good as the Hives or the White Stripes. But what the Strokes have going for them is a talented singer/songwriter and a band that look as if they've been pulled from the 70s. Unfortunately, \\"Is This It\\" came out a couple of years ago, so I can't put it on my Best of 2002 list. Still, it's a great album and I recommend it to anyone who's tired of anything on the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"phhhhhhhhh","review":"this album is pretty bad. i think the strokes succeed on marketing more on their actual music, which, even ignoring the bands they rip off, is pretty lame and repetitive. the singer uses the same distorted effect on his voice in every song, which doesn't help at all. it's actually painful to hear this getting so popular when new bands such as The Shins, Trail of Dead, and the White Stripes are doing similar things much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight to the Point","review":"History has shown that you can always count on a group of New York art fags to breathe new life into the music scene.

It's really just business to create a straight 'rock' band to maximize profits, since it's an area of music that hasn't been concentrated on lately. It's simple business, and simple music. At the very least the Rolling Stones had some groove and feeling to their ambitions. This band is just too lifeless and dead to really take seriously. You can see the passion they feel for their music in their live preformances - a bunch of bodies collecting dust while they roll out whatever notes they were told to play.

I can confidently say that in my opinion they're the most promising rock band to come out of America in the last 15 years or so. Those people that say that they're overrated don't get it at all or haven't listened to them carefully enough. The Strokes are more original than any band out there today. Some people mention Television and The Stooges when discussing the Strokes - to me these people are missing what they're all about. They were more influenced by bands like The Velvet Underground and Bob Marley. But mentioning bands won't make you understand what they really sound like.

There is very little intrumental talent to be found among any of these poseurs as the majority of the songs have not only the same boring, repetitive structure, but also the same simplistic riffs. There is no variation or complexity here; it's all simple strumming interjected by an occasional guitar solo.

I picked it up and I was definately not disappointed at all. It gave me a newfound excitement for new music.All of the eleven songs are really great. I made my friend listen to it and she didn't adjust well to the low-fi quality that is on some of the songs. But I like this album because its fast with some really great guitar solos and melodies. The drums are fast with precision. I like how the lyrics tell a little bit of a story and its great to find a cd to listen to from start to finish.Buy this cd, try it. If you don't like it you can probably find someone to pass it on to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let the bad reviews start pouring.","review":"don't let an over-excited, viagra-deprived British press fool you. this band is not revolutionary and will not bang open new doors in your life. this is a very good album that's only weakness is a diversity in tricks. one of the few albums that you can say 'if you like one song, you'll like them all'.this band has been around for quite a while... toiling underground. i only wish that the press could pick up on other (re: better) band like the White Stripes or the Cosmic Rough Riders - bands that actually deserve this type of praise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple rock, beautifully executed","review":"To say that The Strokes are the second coming of rock is a drastic overstatement. However, \\"Is This It\\" is certainly a breath of fresh air in the pop market.\\"Is This It\\" is not earth-shattering in any way, nor is it incredibly revolutionary or thought-provoking. But, unlike many acts today, The Strokes provide easy, fun rock. This record isn't ambitious, but it does exactly what it sets out to do.The title track sets the pace for the entire album--a rolling, simple drum beat, an easy as pie (and just as enjoyable) guitar riff, and a dancing, almost goofy bass line. Top that off with a lead singer who sounds like he's on the phone because he was too lazy to come to practice, and you have The Strokes.You won't find the meaning of life in this album. You will, however, enjoy yourself. All I can say is that The Strokes have \\"it.\\" What more do you need?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Overhype!","review":"Don't get me wrong, their sound is very original and comes fresh compared to the overproduced bands nowadays. But there is WAY too much hype about these guys, I'm sure even the band itself will agree with me on that! I do like the back-to-the-roots snotty Rock attitude but what really bothers me is the overuse of the \\"distorted voice\\" effect. It's cool on Last Night but they use it on every single song on the album. It gets old, man!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This It? Yes, I'm Afraid So","review":"The Strokes \\"Is This It\\" is vastly overrated. They are entirely derivative, but offer nothing even slightly new or interesting. To compare them to the Velvet Underground is an insult to that great band. The Strokes lack the kind of gritty edge and fantastic musicianship that defined the V.U., not to mention range of songwriting (the V.U. could also write beautifully melodic songs like \\"I'll Be Your Mirror,\\" \\"Sunday Morning,\\" etc.) \\"Is This It\\" is really monotonous."},{"rating":"1","title":"is this it?","review":"i cant say i didnt try...the reviews are great all over, but really man, wheres the talent? i cant tell one song apart from another; the fuzzy chords are the same in each track. the songs are whiny and annoying. this is it, and it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Stars !!!!","review":"Yeah this is a 5 star album by a cover band. But since this is not VH1's \\"Coverwars\\" they get the real world: 1 star. Why? No real ground is broken, the songs are sung in a whiny spoiled brat way about what they experienced while \\"slumming\\" that weekend. Boring!!!Do yourself a favor and pick up Television's \\"Marquee Moon\\" and you will see what a real band can do without distortion and you will also realize why The Strokes should be named The Hoax."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing new","review":"Is this it? Is the appropriately named debut Album from the strokes. Appropriate, because after all the hype you would have expected something a bit more invigorating really.Look up television, Iggy pop, gang of four, Richard Hell and the velevet underground because the strokes rip off all of the afore mentioned bands while adding a bit more production to make it more accessible to today's music consumer.How can any self respecting punk rock band form after meeting at boarding school in Switzerland? Punk rock and wealth just don't make sense and the bands mentioned earlier thrived on being outsiders and creating music that came from the pain and suffering experienced as a result. No, the strokes are punk rock for the new millennium. A well packaged, well produced group that will sell millions but will never be as good as the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break!","review":"Y'know, no matter how often rock critics mention The Strokes in the same breath as the MC5, The Stooges, The Kinks, or Television, I just can't get over how unbelievably wimpy this band is. Honestly, they have much more in common with Phil Collins or Bread. This is sleepy time college rock for those who want something just slightly heavier than Belle and Sebastian.Those who bought this album also shopped for NyQuil."},{"rating":"1","title":"if this is NY rock, they can keep it","review":"Enormous hype succeeded in getting me to buy this CD, but not in getting me to like it.

The Strokes make rock and roll you don't have to think about, just like it, because it is good and simple, like late 60's Stones, Weezer, The Ramones, The Cars pre-80's, or any band that just plain rocks and no one can deny it. \\"Is This It\\" gives me hope for a better future of music, meaning no more of Fred Durst ranting about nookie, no more blonde virginite bimbos with electronically altered vocals, no more middle of the road grunge-hangers-on like Nickelback and Creed and Three Doors Down and, last but not least, no more Mariah Carey shenanigans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let the hype scare you away !","review":"Don't let their failure to match the hype scare you away... If you listen to this album to enjoy some light rock with a catchy beat you will be pleasantly surprised. Tunes like Modern Age, Someday and Last Night, complete with Tom Petty's American Girl riffs, are songs you'll have a tough time getting out of your head. Don't set the bar too high and you'll be glad you bought this CD.

Based off the sound of the one single i have heard, I cant even remember the name of it, its so forgettable, the strokes are pure NYC retro garbage. it ust goes to show you the age of most music critics when this record showed up on like every top 10 list for album of the year. If you want to hear this type of music, buy a stooges record or the velvet underground, two truly great bands. The strokes unfortunately are about 30 years behind the times. The strokes are truly the great rock n roll swindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"extremly derivative and immesensly enjoyable","review":"The Strokes are basically the Velvet Underground as a punk-pop band. Yes they aren't original at all, but that doesn't make their songs any less catchy. This music isn't going to change the world, or even the future of rock music. But it's fun to listen to and it's alot better than all those other garage bands with Roman Coppola videos and the White Stripes; because it's not annoyingly amateurish like all those bands are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this It","review":"I was shocked by how amazingly good this album was and is. It is very interesting, my favorite track on the album has to be \\"Take it or Leave it\\" the only con about this album is that all the tracks are very similiar in rythym, beat length and tone. Other than that I think this is one of the few albums in 2001 that deserves a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the hype, and the critics. But just listen","review":"It has been more than 3 years since I last bought any American band cd. I lost interest in today American mainstream bands because of the current music scence. But things are getting better since I discovered THE STROKES. It is such a thrill to listen them. I love their melody, classic rock sound and their driven rythmic guitars and drum beats. The singer may not have the best voice, but his voice is fitting for the feel of the music. Forget what people write about The Stroke as being a \\"hype\\" band. Some pretentious snob would make an unorginal comment that The strokes got a record deal because of their social backgrounds. Those people got those comments from some SPIN magazine anyway. Those people dont have anything new to say about The strokes.

That was enough of the Strokes that I will ever care to hear. Look, if I wanted 80s music, I would play 80s music. If I wanted to hear Jim Morrison sing, I would buy a Doors album. These rich boys have no talent and you should have zero respect for those who write shining reviews about this album. If you want good new music, look to Radiohead, Squarepusher, Autechre, and Aphex Twin. If you want to lie to yourself about this band... go ahead.

Pass on this ridiculously hyped band and proceed to the source, namely the Velvets, who in their own way are also still riding the crest of a wave not so high or grand as reported. The strumming is all Lou. The Wedding Present, pushed along by a far more compelling singer, filtered this style with more charge, more urgency.

I listened to the CD, and saw them in concert. They're talented enough guys. They know how to play their instruments well enough, but my problem is that I'm not really hearing anything original here. I've head all this before, and I've heard it done better. What's the point of buying a CD by a bunch of posers, when I can go out and get the better music by the artists that they are copying.Pick up some Stooges, Ramones, and Birthday Party rather than this cute but not groundbreaking CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"Let's start off by saying that this has all been done before. the Strokes look, music and style is way overplayed. The music is at best mediocre and they are by no means the saviors of rock and roll. if you can, download this album so as not to waste money on it because there are plenty of other great bands that you could give your money to. in a city like NY these guys are a dime a dozen."},{"rating":"1","title":"What I feared, and expected","review":"Always trying to find something new and interesting, and with all the accolades this band receives, I decided to give The Strokes a chance. And like so many before, I was left unimpressed.Unlike other reviewers, I fail to see how this band can be considered revolutionary. Uninspired, repetitive, and whiney 3-chord rock was pioneered well before The Strokes came around.High praises demand high performance, and unfortunately, the search for the next great rock band will continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, boring, boring","review":"I don't read many reviews so I cannot say that the hype ruined this recording for me. Actually, I think it's the truly boring nature of it. Or maybe I'm too old, because I think that I've heard every song before. When I listen to it, I hear The Jam, The Smiths, and Frank Black. Who knows? Maybe blues purists listened to Cream and Led Zeppelin and cringed.Definitely nothing new. Rock'n'roll RIP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really It.","review":"Very much overhyped. They wrote 1, maybe two songs. Very good songs. Every other track is a slight variation. Same tempo, same vocal treatment, same reptitive guitar work. After a couple of tracks, you'll find yourself checking the track sequence and asking yourself....\\"What the...didn't I just hear that song?\\" To their credit, a lot of other bands now sound just like them...Franz Ferdinand, The Killers, etc. Except those groups can play their instruments. 2nd album is a little better. Instead of buying this, just download any song off the CD and listen to it about 12 times in a row. Same listening experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"this must be a joke","review":"I cannot believe how people are falling over themselves to praise this lame band. After hearing all the comparisons to such greats as the Velvet Underground, the Stooges and Television I was practically salivating to hear the Strokes. Then I had the misfortune of actually buying and listening to them. I can deal with bands that are derivative of their idols but this piece of crap is derivative and BORING. Please don't buy into the hype and waste your money. This is most definitely not \\"it\\" although there is a rhyming word that is more appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could say I liked it","review":"With all the hype that was surrounding the strokes, and all the excellent reviews they recieved, I really wanted to like this album. It got my hopes up really high, but let me down in big way. I'm not saying that other people won't like it, I just could not stand listening to Julian's voice for more then one song. Although the guitar playing is good, I can't recommend this album. I would suggest downloading some of the songs that aren't singles, because if you want a whole album of \\"Someday\\", your not going to get it. In my opinion, the Strokes are seriously overrated. But that's just me talkin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strokes Good, Frisbee Better","review":"If you like this CD, check out Frisbee, a Chicago band that actually is musical, sings with harmonies, garage band +!

The Strokes CD is almost as good as the lastest Mick Jagger and better than the 2nd Hootie CD and a bit better than the 1st Toad the wet sproket CD.

Maybe closer to Lennie Kravat."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"I don't believe much in this album. I find it overrated - but time might prove me wrong.

After hearing the first catchy single on MTV2, I bought the album, only to realize what it was to me...a boring album with a catchy single on it. Anyway, these kids must have had a lot of money and the right connections, because I can bet that there is a garage band down the road that can beat the snot out of The Strokes' talent and songwriting ability. Some of these songs sound like a fourteen year old with a guitar and a drum machine. If you are stuck in the 70's, you might find some sort of value in this album, otherwise I would stay away from this totally mediocre and mundane cd and save the fifteen bucks on a cd that actually took some sort of creativity and thought to put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's be realistic","review":"This is a gritty little album. All of the tunes are bouncy numbers, leaning more towards Ramones, than Pistols. The lead singer is an Iggy/Jim hybrid, leaning more towards Iggy. Last-nite is a catchy tune, and could be a big hit for them if it gets airplay. The rest of the album gets repetitive. A band such as this, is much better served by EP's, since they wouldn't have to multiply the same garage tune X12. I think they should also cut the length of some of their songs, 4:37 is toooo long for Barely Legal. On another note, not to take away from the music, but I noticed the downplaying by the music press, and the band, of the song NYC cops. The EP was released stateside Sept. 4th , and we all know by now what happened just 7 days later. I wonder how this band feels about their song, after the fact? I don't see them pushing it, do they feel bad? Or do they just lack the balls to take the heat?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why stroke the stokes?","review":"I first head them before they got all hyped up... and I hatedthem.

Just because rock seems to be in a great lull with allthe boring rap core doesn't mean that the first stripped downband with a chic Gap look doesn't mean that it's the greatestthing since sliced bread.

This New York City quintet are direct descendants of bands like The New York Dolls, Television, The Velvet Underground, T. Rex and The Stooges. They plow through the eleven songs on the album in just over a half-hour with a cocksure swagger. Take your pick from tracks like \\"Barely Legal\\", \\"The Modern Age\\", \\"Alone, Together\\", \\"Take It Or Leave It\\" and \\"Someday\\" and you can not go wrong. An impressive debut that will hopefully lead to greater things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"If you don't like the basic sound of this band, you're not going to like the album. Every song sounds pretty much the same. But I like that basic sound, so I like the album. I don't know why, though, the fuzz effect is on the vocal on every song. It's obviously to sound \\"garage,\\" but I would have preferred more clarity on the vocal sound. And I tend to like bands with variety, so I really hope the Strokes evolve into having different type sounds on one album (the shining example of such variety is, of course, the Beatles). And I really think some background vocals and harmonies in spots would really add to the music. If memory serves, all the songs have just Casablancas singing lead, with no other vocals blending in. Endless comparisons have been made to the Velvet Underground, but for a reason. If you like the VU (especially their song \\"I'm Waiting for the Man\\") you'll likely like the Strokes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing complicated, just rock and roll","review":"While I am ashamed to admit it, the first time I saw The Strokes was on MTV; the 60s ish video caught my attention and the song backing up the video was awesome. I downloaded a few songs and noticed that those songs dominated my WinAmp playlist; it was at that point when I decided to buy this amazing album. There are no antics or special tricks to make this band \\"special\\", what makes this band \\"special\\" is their deep understanding of rock and roll and how it is supposed to be played.

Do yourself a favor and buy Funhouse instead (im sure the strokes themselves have listened to it alot). Its much more innovative and well basiclly their whole sound and look. Hey even the video is reminiscent of the early 70's. With Iggy Pop, i mean the strokes lead singer doing his best Iggy Pop impersination.When anything is copied it can never match the original.

Oblivious to \\"the hype,\\" I just listen to the music and see if I connect. \\"Barely Legal\\" is a good rocker with standard Stroke fuzz distortion on the vocals and an 80's Cars retro sound that appeals to me. \\"Alone Together\\" also moves joyfully with some blistering guitar and is probably my favorite track. I'd be interested to read the lyrics if they were printed like Alkaline Trio's great \\"Mourning\\" CD. \\"Last Nite\\" has some bite to it and a bit of vocal snarl, \\"Last nite she said, 'Baby don't feel so down, it turns me off.'\\" \\"This Is It\\" is a consistent set of tunes that has a strong appeal. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If this is it, then \\"it\\" has a nice sound.","review":"While it may be said that perhaps the music of the Strokes does not seem as heavily focused on so much as the image they portray to the media and in their publicity, they are a band that delivers. From having heard both \\"Room on Fire,\\" and \\"First Impressions of Earth,\\" I would have to argue that by and large this is my favorite album of theirs. From the catchy lyrics to the up beat drums and guitars on all of the tracks, this album has a bit of edge despite Julian's writing on his relationships which typically you might think would have a slower take on things, doesn't with this. \\"The Modern Age,\\" \\"Soma,\\" \\"Barely Legal,\\" \\"Someday,\\" and \\"last Nite,\\" are some of the more memorable tracks on the album, so make sure you get to them. Weather your into the Stokes or not, or you came about them by recommendation, this is an excellent album to begin with, so give it a chance, and you'll find your foot tapping to the beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"IS this it?","review":"another example of posturing music 'editors' who cream themselves over anything that sounds remotely like Velvet Underground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes a few weeks to appricate 4.5 Stars","review":"This is a GREAT album but at first I thought all the tunes sounded the same like many other reviewers.GOOD ALBUMS GROW ON YOU! It's not too often you realized excellent music initially (Kid A is a prime example) Each song has very different arrangements and the \\"pop - punk\\" guitar riffs work well. Casablancas sounds like old-school Iggy Pop, which [is good].This is one of the best rock albums in a few years and their live performance shows how great of a band they are and what all the hype is about"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not going to hear naything like this on the radio","review":"Ok whether you pay attention to the media hype or not, this a great album. I have yet to meet anyone that can really discribe the sound, all I know is that this whole album is a good listen. THey sound out of the 60's at some times, and straight out of the mid 90's at others. But you have to love this album even if it simply is something different. In an era of Nickelback's and Creed's this band is actually ariginal (gasp!). So for all the music snobs who don't think this is original, go away, cause the pool of music you choose from is limited. So for people with open tastes and who are tired of the stuff on the radio, I urge you to get this ablum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Icing","review":"This frosting is great, especially if you want to use black but don't want it to taste bitter.

We had a 2 1/2 hour flight and needed new entertainment. I ordered one for each of them and they loved playing with Thomas on the lap trays on the airplane. My 4 year old requests to bring Thomas out to dinner to play while she waits for her food and my 2 year old plays with Thomas while we wait for the 4 year old to finish dance class. It is a kid magnet where ever we go and all enjoy it tremendously. I gave it 4 stars because it is difficult for the little ones to wind Thomas without help and our train station has already lost part of its peg that holds it to the board, but the kids push Thomas instead of winding it up and the station stays OK even with just one peg, instead of 2. I highly recommend this toy for every Thomas fan out there. Inside the case there is even room to add a couple more small toys. My daughter has added a couple small dinosaurs that she insists also live on Sodor with Thomas."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT TAKE ALONG TOY!","review":"We got this for his 3rd birthday. He is just now getting into THOMAS. HE LOVES IT! It is great to take with you to doctor's appointments, grocery store etc. The piece fir together nicely in the case.

This toy is a total lifesaver for long trips and even the short trips....keeps him entertained for hours!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay.","review":"We got this toy as a gift. It's okay. On car trips and long waiting periods, it holds the attention for a very brief period. I think it's better for a shorter wait period, like the doctor's office.My main issue with it is that it just misses the boat on just about every front. The little Thomas needs pretty good fine motor skills to wind it independantly for a child, and by the time they have these, the kids are really too old for the toy. While it's pretty sturdy, there are smallish parts that can easily get lost that will make the toy unusable. If you are using something for travel, you don't want losable small parts.For the age group this is for, you are better off getting them a new train for the cost and giving them a pad of paper to draw a line on (a track) and let them do that for awhile for travel. It will give you more independance and work much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this even though the winder broke the first day","review":"I would have given this 5 stars if the winder on the Thomas hadn't broken two hours after we opened it. It must have been a faulty train because I am the only one who was winding it. My son was 2 1/2 and it was too hard for him to do himself. I'm glad he didn't break it as it would have frustrated him. Despite the train breaking my son has spent hours playing with it and even now comes back to it (we've had this 7 months now). It is easy to put away and set up. This is a good take along train to bring with you without a lot to keep track of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Wind Up Toy","review":"I had purchased one for my son's 2nd b-day, and it broke after just 2 hours of winding it, and I as the one one who was winding it. This upset my son who cried and cried \\"Turn it, please.\\" Thinking it was just defective I bought another one(at another store), and the same thing happened.... Then my mother-in-law bought him another one (At yet another store) and we had the same issue. We still have the last one that was purchased, but our son still asks us to \\"turn it, please\\".. the next chance I get - this toy is going to the trash...

However the longer his career has progressed, the production standards of his period with A&M; records have disappeared. 'Music is life,' is the first Osborne album that I have turned off mid-track. The reason was quite simple. Although there is no match to his voice, the orchestrations are cheap and tacky. 'Stranger,' was one of his strongest L.T.D. tracks, but the vocals could not disguise the instruments, that frankly could have been reproduced on one of those Casio hand-held organs that were around in the early 1980's.To kill off my disappointment, I pulled out an L.T.D. cd and went back to better days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Best but still good","review":"Not his best but still worthy of the cash.

For someone who loves both business biographies as well as strategy, I found this book as entertaining as I did informative and useful. It is no wonder to me why Scott was able to navigate two distinct brands to a lasting impression in America. As someone who is building my own brand (TotallySoccer), I found that Scott is right on: you must have the vision and the imagination as well as the ability to execute. A great and entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bedbury's experience at Nike & Starbucks proves valuable","review":"The many things we should do for our brands (and the ones we have to avoid at all costs) are clearly presented in Bedbury's eight brand principles. Instead of using financial models and correlations, Bedbury tells stories of how each one of these things makes the difference on the company's bottom line. His experience at Nike and Starbucks thoughout the entire positioning process before and after these companies became power brands gives him the credibility and the parenthood needed to teach decision-makers about branding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading for Brand marketers","review":"This is a good book and since many books in this subject are not worth reading at all.

Jeph Loeb does an excellent job of reintroducing Kara to the DCU. This series follows Supergirl as she tries to find her place in a supergroup. Through her travels she visits the Justice Society, Teen Titans, The Outsiders, and JLA. This story is great, because Kara feels appropriately lost in her new world, and has to face many challenges, (including herself) on her journey to fit in. The book also doesn't wrap things up in a nice bow. In fact, it leaves many questions unanswered, which leaves the reader eager to continue collecting the series.And for the lame-os ragging on Supergirl's sexiness, she's never been without a tight and/or revealing costume; even in the '50s she donned the mini skirt, so no crap she's gonna be hot! Get over it! I love this series. Thanks DC for bringing back Kara Zor-El!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Here's a potential good character given nothing to do in a horrible story. It makes no sense, has no supporting cast, nor any story arch. Supergirl has no personality. DC should have stuck with Peter David's Supergirl or at least come up with an idea of what to do with the \\"new\\" (or is it original?) Supergirl. This collection shows a complete lack of direction. The arts alright, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all","review":"If you take this supergirl as the NEW supergirl, the storyline would be fine. I think it is normal to be confused and uncertain. This book is not as bad as what some people commented.I like the art and the plot, it is unexpected and my favorite part of it was the fight with wonder girl and the part where she found out the truth to all her problems. It is enjoyable and are one of my favorites. I recommend this book to people who are interested in supergirl. Some may find it bad, but I enjoyed it a lot.in conclusion, I think it depends on the person's impression and point of view on supergirl. If you like it, enjoy. Plus, I recommend it more for teenagers."},{"rating":"2","title":"here she is","review":"This incarnation of Supergirl was introduced in the Batman/Superman series.

However, when I received them, I was disapointed. The Tiger Hawk has a tail section that rotates when you push a button. This is susposed to make the plane do a \\"barrel roll\\". Instead of just making the toy with out this feature, Hasbro instead (in my opinion) ruined the toy. I have collected GI JOE toys since they first came out. I love the real looking vehicles and planes. But these \\"extra\\" features ruin an other wise excellent toy. Hopefully Hasbro in the future will do away with these \\"triggers\\" and \\"handles\\" and allow the collector to enjoy the toy.

Nicolas' sound is just what you'd want from a recorderist, and its worth hearing the warm tone of the voice-recorder. The theorbist, Yasunori Imamura adds delighful colour to the basso continuo part, although I wondered at his reluctance to ever use the bass diapasons, even in final chords or cadences.Overall well worth the low price if you enjoy Corelli and the gorgeous sound of the baroque flute/recorder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"It came on time.

The book is aimed at people starting a company or organisation. I was hoping it would be more about motivational techniques for people trying to start other projects - the title suggested that to me.

The book holds out a lot of hope while grounding you in reality with strategies to help you succeed if your business and product is meant to do so.

There might be some good tidbits in here if that's actually you. And if you're planning something else, it's certainly worth thinking hard about whether the \\"lean startup\\" approach (as presented here by Kawasaki and elsewhere by many others) can be helpful. Much of the content is highly superficial, and it gets pretty tiresome to read over and over again about the example of the Macintosh launch -- especially given that Kawasaki doesn't even explain what exactly was his role in that effort, and given that the Mac launch seems, based on what he describes in the book, to be the only real, big success of his career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever!","review":"If I shall have one book only to be successful and achieve anything, it would be this one.It's not a purchase, it's an investment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"Read this book if you like to imagine yourself starting a company.

Though attracted by the author's reputation, I was afraid to find this book yet another shallow collection of information for dummies. I was wrong. The author wastes no time on pontification but rather noninvasively shows what's important and why. Whether to use the technique is then up to the reader.

Both Trump and Kawasaki have attempted with some success to create personality cults based on exaggerated accounts of their real world business success, and then to make money selling their banal wisdom to legions of wannabes. Both have profited from sleazy seminar businesses. In reality, Kawasaki has only had very limited success as a startup founder, and even less as a venture capitalist.

A great and refreshing read - highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Read; Easy to Use","review":"I'm almost finished reading this book, but have found myself using information from it already at work. The chapter on business plans adds a perspective that is valuable and useful. The advice on recruiting employees seems right on and I have used some of Kawasaki's insights in a search that we have in progress at this moment.

They are setting up their feeding territories, looking for mates, etc. They are HARD AT WORK DOING THEIR JOB TO SURVIVE. Why any self-respecting person would want to disrupt the short time they have to accomplish all that just for their own amusement is beyond me.Devices like this should be made illegal, worldwide. Birds have a tough enough time with man destroying all their habitat, and man's invasive-species cats destroying any birds they can find. Now you want to disrupt the only way they can find each other to survive too? By playing fake calls so they have to come and defend their territory against a non-bird?

Humor, melody, rhythm that sticks and lovely disonances that charm have me entranced. Johansen's description of Barry While meeting Nirvana in his tune \\"Down with my Baby\\" delivers a song with a hook that works. Like one of the other reviewers, I currently count \\"hindue blues\\" as my favorite, (that could change tomorrow) as I'm struck by the sense I'm hearing Harrison and Lennon playing with their melodies after meeting Ravi Shankar.

McNeely brings colour, vitality and an unbridled power to these recordings. James Horner's score for APOLLO 13 seems to have gone totally unnoticed. It is moving and contains that pioneering spirit he brought to so many films around that time in his career. And what more can be said about his music for BRAVEHEART?

I found the anthropology believeable and the mysticism--though slightly unique--enhanced the humanity of this novel about a barely human protagonist. Liking and relating Amber is easy, and understanding her genetic make-up follows logic. Soon I forgot about the science though, and got lost in a story as sweet and gripping as any I have read.

For those of us who worked at Manac Systems in the mid-eighties there is some grim sense of satisfaction with respect to the destiny of Lynne Verchere. The author avoids the darker side of Vercheres personality, but for those of us who knew her, any sense of pity that the story elicits is mitigated by the reality of having dealt with her on a day to day basis. Lynne Verchere was not a victim. The final tragedy of Bruce Verchere is a metaphor for the gaping hole in her own psyche. Notwithstanding the mess he had made of his life, Bruce Vercheres last desperate act was undoubtedly triggered by her final \\"victory\\" over him."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLIMSY","review":"Just received this flash.

I have used the 28 CS-2 about four times. It really makes a difference in my photos. I use it with a small point and shoot Fuji F20 camera which takes real good pictures in low light. The CS-2 flash makes all the difference though as fill flash or as a flash from a different angle it removes alot of shaddow. It also throws light far beyond the limits of the built in flash, of the F20, which is by comparison quite weak. I was in the habit of just turning off the built in flash and forcing the camera to select a slow shutter speed and lower f-stop. It is easy to set up and the learning function is super. The unit is great because it gives you alot of control over the flash. There is a function to control the level of light output and manual settings are provided. It is compact and the bracket, which is collapsable, screws into the tripod mount and is adjustable for length."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good as a Slave Flash","review":"Ordered this Metz unit as a slave flash but the fold down base is more ideal for an on camera flash than it is for setting up an off unit slave.

The Bible clearly says in the old testament that the The lord says that the day will come that He will make a New Covenant with his people and It will not be like the One that He has made with their fathers.The Bible also says the the Lord make the former covenant obsolute so He can establish the other.\\"The Lord's Table \\" by Andrew Murray was much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but...","review":"A thought provoking look at the Book of Revelation.

Rich"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest Catholic books of our time","review":"Dr. Scott Hahn is one of the very best minds in the Catholic Church today, and a very fine writer and speaker. \\"The Lamb's Supper\\" is superb; indeed, it is one of the greatest Catholic books of our time. He is a truly great teacher. At the Christendom College summer program in 2000 he gave what was literally the finest lecture I have ever heard in my life -- and I have heard some great ones. Everyone should get every book and tape of his that they can afford."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grace Revealed...","review":"This book is an answer to prayer for any person who has asked God to grant him/her a deeper understanding and appreciation of the mystery of the Catholic Mass. Any cradle Catholic who has fallen away from the Church because 'I'm not being fed at my local parish,' read this book and open your eyes to the utter glory of the privilege that you have abdicated--to receive the actual presence of our Lord Jesus Christ in the Eucharist, our Marriage Supper with the Lamb. Dr. Hahn's passion, intelligence, and faithfulness shine through in his insightful and lucid delineation of the relevance of the Book of Revelation to the Mass. It's not new information, but his style and approach are perhaps a bit more compelling to the average lay-person than that of the Catholic Catechism."},{"rating":"2","title":"An emotional supper!","review":"As someone coming to the Catholic church, this book answered many core questions about mass that I have felt in the years I have attended with my \\"cradle Catholic\\" wife, but never was sure of. The beauty and awe of what occurs in what some feel is a mundane hour or so on Sunday is poured out in the mass that Dr. Hahn calls \\"heaven on earth\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book on the Mass Ever!","review":"This book is quite possibly the best book ever written about the Holy Mass! It goes through and thoroughly explains how the Mass is present in the Book of Revelation, also known as the Apocalypse. Scott Hahn is an excellent Catholic author and this book of his is quite possibly the best one he has ever written. You will be amazed at just how thoroughly Biblical the Catholic Mass is. I definitely recommend this book to anyone and everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glorious Interpretation","review":"Dr. Scott Hahn is a blessing both for Roman Catholics and Protestants alike. His skill for demonstrating a Catholic belief structure in a way that will not scare off the Evangelical brethern is a talent that few have. In this volume, he demonstrates this talent perfectly by explaining the most misunderstood practice of the Catholic faith, the Mass, while explaining the most misunderstood book of the Bible, the Apocalypse, in the light of the mass. It is an eye-opener to say the least. This book should be required reading for both Catholics and Protestants alike -- for Catholics, it reinforces the ritual we go through every week; for Protestants, it will shed light on all those \\"bizarre\\" and \\"confusing\\" practices that Catholics perform. Either way, the reader will only come out strengthed and better for reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Although I have not finished this book, I am into it far enough to share that it is very easy reading, anda very interesting book.

When a protestant friend began a dialog with me on his interpretive meaning of the book of \\"Revelations\\", I simply handed him Scotts' book and asked him to read it. Since I have not heard from him for some time, I assume he is a little disturbed by what he found. I pray he is reevaluating his former interpretation. As always, Scotts' work has deepened my faith.

Protestants as well as Catholics should read this book. It can provide all not only with a better understanding of the Mass, but of what God has foreshadowed throughout the Bible. My 9 year old will probably be reading this when I finish. It is easy to understand but yet still deep enough to not be elementary. I highly recommend this book to everyone. Scott Hahn will bring you right into this book with his sense of humor (strange as it is) and you will enjoy every minute of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake Up in Those Pews!","review":"Every Catholic should read this book to better understand the Mass and its significance in our faith. With clarity, scholarly authority and humor, Scott Hahn explains the ancient Church traditions that created the Mass and how it is tied to the Book of Revelation. As an inspirational author myself (NEW PSALMS FOR NEW MOMS: A KEEPSAKE JOURNAL)I applaud Hahn's efforts to teach us more about ourselves! Instead of empty ritual, we now see all of the majesty and significance of the Mass. It challenges those of us in the pews to fully participate in this magnificent mystery each and every time we go to Mass. Heaven opens its doors to us -- Hallelujah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry, but I have to . . .","review":"I can't resist responding to the above review that called the Eucharist a pagan ritual. I hate to break it to you, but if the fact that some other religions have had rituals and traditions similar to that of the Eucharist disproves Catholicism, then the fact that a number of pagan religions believe in the son of their god(s) being born to a virgin disproves Christianity as a whole.I found this book to be quite excellent. I take off one star for the cheesy chapter subtitles."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderous new insights!","review":"I am a cradle Catholic who has just finished 7 years of Bible study.

Scott Hahn explains the Mass in layman's terms. It is totally amazing to me how the Mass is explained in the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lamb's Supper","review":"The book offers new insights into the liturgy of the Mass. It also shows that the Book of Revelation (the last book of the New Testament) is not as ominous as many have interpreted it. It intergrates the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass with parts of the Book of Revelations. It is truly inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"life changing","review":"I can point back to this book as one that completely changed my outlook on the Mass. As a cradle Catholic who grew up among mainly evangelicals, I recognized there were Scritural references in the liturgy, but I couldn't tell you what they meant in a Catholic context. This book opened my eyes to the beauty and fullness of the Catholic faith and I continue to recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes, it takes \\"new eyes\\" to look at something.","review":"As is usual with Scott Hahn, we \\"cradle Catholics\\" benefit from his \\"new eyes\\" when taking a closeer look at who we are as Catholics and why we do what we have been doing for, well, 2,000 years. This book was very enjoyable. It made many things \\"click\\" and I recommend it to any Catholic looking for ways to enrich their communion in Christ and the Church."},{"rating":"2","title":"I get it now...","review":"Wow. I thought I understood all the parts of the Mass, but Dr. Hahn gives you the foundation to truly understand and experience the entire Mass as an active participation in the eternal celebration in Heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lamb's Supper","review":"Scott Hahn's main point in this book is to say that the Catholic mass is a picture of heaven on earth. He repeats this point in many different ways thoroughout the book. He describes the basis for his idea on the book of Revelation. I did not understand all of his assertions, but felt that the book was original and encouraging. I felt spiritually unlifted to know that I could see a little piece of heaven when I go to mass each Sunday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful insights","review":"I enjoyed Dr. Hahn's insights as he related the Lambs supper to so much of the book of Revelation. Silent Witnesses in the Gosples by Allan F. Wright is also recommended for those interested in Scripture insights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book even for an Anglican","review":"I am not Roman Catholic, but Anglican. Therefore I too have a high view of the Eucharist. I found this book very helpful in gaining an even better appreciation of the Divine Liturgy and how in the Liturgy we partake of the worship of heaven itself. The original Reformers had a much higher view of the Lord's Supper than todays evangelicals, and we need to rediscover that high view if we are going to truly worship as God intended. I will remember the next time I particiapte in the Eucharist that I am actually in heaven and worshipping Jesus and partaking of His Body and Blood.

I was too curious to resist the purchase and the album has been playing constantly since. The Curtis Mayfield track is a fantastic song and I wish had been more of a hit, the sexy crooning that is not afraid to be fancy is such a nice change of pace from all the soundalike gutteral voice rock bands howling around. Also it sets a nice tone that the rest of the album holds up except for one or two tracks (I am thinking \\"The answer\\" and \\"loaded\\" specifically) Overall this album is not a simple rehash of glee material, there are certainly more real songs here, and some stunning moments in \\"More Shopping\\" & \\"montreal\\" which ends in a chant that loops back again later in the album.

My Escort quit working after 10 years, so I got one of these to tide me over until I decided what detector I wanted. I realized it would not outperform my Escort by a longshot, but its detection range is pitiful whether in highway, city, city 1 or city 2 mode.It does have some neat features like the voice warning and different sound warnings and the ability to go completely dark, but if you are a chronic speeder like me, don't expect it to save you from much.

Had I been speeding, I would have collected a number of speeding tickets. Within the city limits, the unit almost constantly beeps with false alarms. It provides no reliable laser performance, as with a police laser unit almost within a 10 degrees of the line of sight of my car, this detector showed no activity.Its periscope is annoying and along with the poor detection performance gives you Xmas lighting only.I'd avoid this unit - it is a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money: Doesn't Detect Radar Guns","review":"As another reviewer stated, the Whistler XTR-140 does not work for radar guns.

Two days ago while driving down the road with it on H for all radar detector signals it beeped once with not one car in front of me and the cop was maybe ten feet in front of me.

At night it lights up the inside of my vehicles cab. Extremely noticeable from behind when the alert goes off. I almost wish that I had paid the extra $10.00 for a model with a dimmer switch. I felt that was too much extra to pay for that simple feature. The exclusive twi-alert periscopes. Not necessary, one would suffice. The unit comes with a suction cup mounting bracket that will only stick to your windshield, unless you have a dashboard that's as smooth as glass. Will not stick to textured surface.

I put this in a second car after having a more high priced detector by another mftr in my car for the last 2 or 3 years. So I got used to good performance and always had plenty of warning - long before I could see the cop I heard him. But now with the Whistler XTR-140 I am hugely disapointed. The only thing that seems to set it off are the signals generated by stop lights and roadside DOT signs.

I'm going to hang this puppy on my Christmas tree and enjoy the lights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the average driver","review":"Ok heres the real deal. It is not an excellent 100% awesome detector, no detector is. People need to understand that about half the time, police drive around without there radars on.

Go to Whistler's website at whistlergroup(dot)com and check the specs on this radar detector.All the xtr-140 does is detect VG-2(a very outdated band that very few police officers use) and Safety Warning System - SWS(Aka emergency vehicles - a band that theoretically does not exist). So in other words you are paying for a rock. I do not even have to buy it to know how lousy this Radar Detector is because I am educated.Before you go out and buy a Radar Detector educate yourself. Don't buy it because it looks good or it flashes lights at you. The main reason you buy a Radar Detector is to have it detect radar guns. Educate yourself.

Sadly, this was a step backward from the earlier version. The annoyance comes from the fact that this model (140) does not default to whatever settings you had entered prior to shutdown. Instead, it always defaults to the factory settings on power-up (highway mode), making you re-enter the mode you want. So, if you regularly drive in the city and wish to have one of the 3 city modes, you must re-enter this every time you turn on the ignition.This is a dumb, stupid design choice on Whistler's part. It would have cost them nothing to lock the mode each time at power-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke after 5 months","review":"Had the radar detector for 5 months, worked great until the cord connecting the radar detector to the car broke.

I read the manual and it said it canBeep due to bumps and acceleration or something.Even when there are no bumps, it beeps for nothing, thereforeit can never give an accurate reading- It dosn't even detect a lot of troopers or city cops, I have passed numerousofficers on highway and streets and have only beeped 2/50 times, seriously.- when it beeps, it flashes blue lights also. In the day time it is okay but during night timethe flash is soo bright that I have to unplug it because you can obviously tell that someone hassome flashy thing in their car.- Passed a trooper on the higher and didn't even let me know, luckily there were other cars that was going the speedas I was.

But, the Whistler features a quiet button. Tracks X band (which most police departments don't use anymore), k band, and laser. The downside with the laser is that the Whistler will detect it, but there is not that much time to slow down--I had to mash my foot on the break pedal when I passed the State Trooper to reduce my speed within the limit.

I have tried many standard & power mics and this one seems to work real well when running on 10-11 meter radio's. This mic requires a 9V battery and can be wired for just about any radio with instructions you can find online. I currently own three of these! If your looking for a new microphone, you might want to give this one a serious look. Only one downside, this is not a noise cancelling mic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with my Cobra CB","review":"I bought this mic based on the reviews I read online. Unfortunately I threw away the package before I had occasion to use it. When I keyed the mic it showed that it was transmitting, but it did not transmit my voice. My friends only heard a click. We tried switching it with a midland radio and it did the same thing. I don't know if I got a bad one or if they're all junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"not all there","review":"bought this to replace my stock mic and when i got it it was missing the screws to hold it together.so i took my stock mic screws and put in it and it didnt work out that good the mic cord kept pulling out making a echo sound when keyed up..i took it and had a new 10ft cord put on it by a cb tech and now the button is messing up..i am very unsatisfied with this d-104.and the company that sell it i sent many messages to them over it and never heard back..would i recomend it?? !!NO WAY!! the old ones were made alot better.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Astatic performance","review":"I've always admired the sound of the old D104 mics on base stations. This is basically the same thing in your hand. Very clear and punchy modulation.It provides more than sufficient voice audio especially in a modded radio, in fact, you will likely be running your mic at mid level or less.I'd like to thank Lake Distributing Inc for making such a fine mic available at such a low price! It even came wired for a 4 pin Cobra for this price. Awesome!I did the mods on a Cobra HG M75 and it will indeed BLAST your radio with modulation but even then, the sound quality and clarity of the D104M6B is very evident in comparison. Bright and clear.For referemce, I am running a new Cobra 29 LX fully modded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Not Worth the Money","review":"I purchased this with an ignorant idea that more power meant better modulation and boy was I wrong.......Giving that I also purchased a Astatic 636L ...I am by no means a CB wizard....The sound (modulation) produced is dry, and generic compared to the 636L...I hooked this mic up to a Galaxy 959 with mods and with the mike gain up and the variable power down it seemed lame .I tried adapting different setting and still did not sound better than the 636L.....If you want to waste money buy this mic....if you want to sound clear try the 636L .....Keep in mind with my Galaxy 959 with mods I didn't need the power mic....hence the ignorance"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok i guess","review":"Arrived in time and in good condition.Small issues i had and still have with mic.1-the ptt switch was dirty when it arrived.I had to clean it to get rid of the sticking that was happenning.2-After putting battery in it,i noticed that the volume switch in back would not seat above the casing.Left it as is.Reports are the mic sounds good.Not the quality astatic once made.Look for a better quality mic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astatic D104M6B Review","review":"The best Mic ever.

For me, I'm prefer Utada that Ayu, because :- Utada has a better voice to heard, I felt dizzy if heard Ayu's voice for a half hour.- Utada is not a \\"Queen of JPop\\", because she start her carier as a R&B; singer, not Pop !! so \\"Dont Get Wrong\\"- Ayu's style is too western, but Utada still kept her eastern style as well.., especially with her \\"original\\" long black hair, not \\"fake\\" blond hair..!!Utada.., Love U soo !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok I guess?","review":"This album is okay.

But this Exodus album is absolutely terrible in terms of the lyrics. They're dumb, that's all that can be said, and the overall songwriting is lame. This album is a severe regression for a very talented singer and songwriter and it's a shame because of all J-Pop artists bi-lengual Utada Hikaru had the best chance for making J-Pop known all over the world, but what they've given us is garbage compared to her Japanese releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exodus.....the American sell-out debut","review":"I deeply admire Hikki's talents,but they do not show in this particular release. Her vocals are strained and the lyrics are weak. There are great club sounds in this,but her poor singing stands out too much in this. She emotes so much better in Japanese;she's not natural when singing in English. She's capable of singing well in English. Listen to her rendition of \\"With Or Without You\\" on MTV Japan's Unplugged. She sounds fantastic there. She's an amazing talent,so I hope she'll do well. First,she needs to put together music that genuine and true to her,not crap to appeal to an American audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"UTADA' IS A HOTTIE!!!!","review":"I HAVE NEVER MET SUCH A HOTTIE IN MY WHOLE LIFE!!!

I thought her songs were awesome and fresh. Her lyrics really meant something to me. I was excited about her US debut and it just....stinks. It's not that she doesn't speak good English, it's the sound and the lyrics. Please, Utada, stick wtih Japanese!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great way to kill a career","review":"This album made me cringe. I was a big fan of Utada's in Japan - she helped break the norm of the traditional Minnie-mouse JPop songs that were dominating the music industry over there and really helped usher in R&B; into the mainstreem. This album is a departure from her sanity.\\"You're easybreezy, I'm Japanesey\\"....no matter how you look at it, that is just a horrible set of lyrics. I don't understand how anyone could possibly agree to sing that.I saw someone on here laud Utada for trying something avant garde and singing about what's important to her. Fine, I'll accept that maybe this is an experiement for her. That doesn't mean it's any good, though.Stay away from this album. You've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Like It at All!","review":"This album is completely disappointing. The lyrics alone are enough to make you wonder what was Utada thinking about when she made this album. Hooks such as \\"You're easy breezy, and I'm Japaneesy\\" made me eject the CD and put it in storage hoping that it will some day become a collector's item. Until then, I don't forsee it moving from its present location anytime soon. You have to be a die-hard Utada fan to like this CD. My friends and I couldn't find one single on the CD that we liked! Her attempt to span different music genres only placed her music square in J-Pop. I guess that could sum up this CD; just another J-Pop artist's failure trying to cross over. I do not recommend this CD at anyone not familiar with Utada."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best Work....","review":"To sum it up, some beats were good but lyrics were nonsense. She tried appealing to a wider audience; I like her for her voice and her lyrics (\\"Can you Keep A Secret?\\" \\"Traveling\\" \\"Simple and clean/Hikari(Light)\\" and her recent single \\"Passion\\") She sings really well in both English and Japanese (\\"Fly me to the moon\\") the only song I liked was \\"Devil Inside\\". I strongly encourage you to buy her new single its ALOT better, you know for the ones who care about the beautiful harmonies and lyrics that are much deeper than stuff like \\"You Make Me Want To Be A Man\\"... the one i disliked most was \\"the workout\\" I get enough of that kinda crap in the rap that people blast outta their cars. I am very disapponted..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Japanese pop queen gives us our Exodus '04~!","review":"WOW! The extremely popular Japanese singer Hikaru Utada has really surprised me. He English debut album \\"Exodus\\" is a feast for the ears.\\"Exodus\\" was entirely written by Utada, and partially produced by Timbaland, who also worked with Missy Elliot and Justin Timberlake. The singing is like an extra instrument to the catchy beats, with have a techno-poppish kind of feel. Remixes of the single \\"Devil Inside\\" are already high on the dance charts.Although her main single \\"Easy Breezy\\", has strange and \\"iffy\\" lyrics, the music is very catchy. Other excellent tracks include \\"Exodus '04\\", \\"Wonder 'Bout\\", \\"The Workout\\", \\"Kremlin Dusk\\", \\"Devil Inside\\" (which features a rather traditional Asian sound) and \\"Let Me Give You My Love\\".Now all there is to do is hope she releases a follow-up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"International Pop Sensation","review":"This is a great album. You don't have to be a fan of her Japanese work to realize how great it is. With its mix of R&B;, dance, and ballads, you can't help but see what makes Utada such a bright star. You're bound to find a number of songs to be your favorites as I know I have. Pick this album up. You won't regret it. :)<a href=\\"http://www2.fanscape.com/utada/redirects/banner.asp\\" target=\\"_blank\\"></a>"},{"rating":"2","title":"At long last...","review":"I have been an avid Utada Hikaru fan from the moment I first heard \\"First Love,\\" and from then on, she has never ceased to amaze me with her music.EXODUS is absolutely no exception.With witty lyrics set to incredibly catchy tunes, EXODUS properly reveals to an US audience the undeniably talented force that is Utada Hikaru. Listening to the songs like \\"The Workout,\\" \\"Devil Inside,\\" \\"Easy Breezy,\\" and \\"Let Me Give You My Love\\" you really get a sense of her growth not only as an adult, but as a musical artist as well. It's an addictive album and no fan collection will be complete without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Both Worlds","review":"If you didnt know her name you would never know she was a j pop singer.When confronted with numerous different J Pop albums and artists you will probably notice that many of the highest selling have use at least a few lines if not whole songs in english and Utada is definately one such artist.So if you are a newcomer to the world music scene ,not quite ready to sink your teeth into compleately non english music,just know that there are many many different artists out there whose albums cater to your needs.Utada Hikaru who was raised between Japan and New York is one of the most talented artists of all time and has conquered the language barrier so efficently that I have no doubt of seeing her on the American charts someday.Her first crossover was by way of the video game Kingdom Hearts where she sang the intro song Simple and Clean which is one of her best songs found on the single Colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"An average Japanese artist debuting her album in English","review":"Yet not a fan of Utada, I did come across this album. I think of it as an average pop album. And while I do not like the lyrics whatsoever, I did throughly enjoy the album. I do not recommend you buying this CD, yet check out her \\"Devil Inside\\" single ... its very enjoyble for those into dance and electronica. I frankly I like her style, yet I didn't find anything I was looking for. If your just in for the tuning and don't care for lyrics ... gor right ahead, yet please listen to the music samples Amazon offers; and along with that listen to the \\"terrible\\" lyrics. While Amazon does not offer \\"half\\" ratings I actually would give this a 2.5.AND PLEASE ALSO CHECK OUT MY REVIEW FOR HER SINGLE \\"DEVIL INSIDE\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and bad","review":"Hikaru needs to return to her R&B/hip-hop roots. Exodus is unbearably disappointing compared to how good First Love and Distance were. This album is so over-synthesized, it's like listening to a soundtrack from the Disneyland Mainstreet Electrical Parade. I don't know if some idiot producer told her that Asians can't do R&B but that they can do synth-pop; that person needs to be fired. I've purchased Ultra Blue, keeping my fingers crossed that it will be better than this nightmare of an album. For everyone who insists that this album is brilliant, well, there is a reason that it bombed in the U.S. (other than an apparent lack of promotion by her record company)-- it is really bad. I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because parts of it are at least listen-able."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful","review":"There was not single track on this album that I want to hear again. Absolutely awful and an absolute disappointment. I felt like I waited forever for Utada's next album to come out and this was not worth the wait. Could this be the end for her??

Now she has joined the ranks of American bland with the hope of scoring it big in the hip-hop world. God, what terrible decision on her part. This genera of music is so glutted with wannabe's desperate to hit it big, that it's professional suicide to even approach it. There is absolutely nothing unique about this offering. Save your money and move to the next CD on your wish list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utada's most varied release yet!!","review":"Utada (or Utada Hikaru in Japan) is one of Japan's biggest pop stars, releasing 4 albums (including her indie American album called 'Precious' under the name Cubic U) in Japan. Utada is fluent in both Japanese and English, so an American contract with an American label never seemed out of reach. So after countless delays, due to marriage and and serious disease, here is her debut English language album, EXODUS. The album features many genres, such as dance, alternative and funk, so there is bound to be something for everyone.

Too bad this new album doesn't live up to her old stuff. Hikki's new music is just weird. I am open to a wide range of music (from R&B to Nu Rock to Gothic to Industrial to Techno to Jazz)... But Hikki's (as her American alias \\"Utada\\") new album just does not grab my attention. In fact, I was disappointed when I heard the samples. Most Americans are just now getting exposure to Utada and they are going to wonder how in the world she made it to the top of the charts in Japan. She could have elaborated more on her style in the Deep River and Distance albums. Too bad. Too bad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"short and blunt review..","review":"Fusion of techno and pop, its hard to go wrong with this album. The beats keep coming and keeps you moving, with the exception of a few slower tracks.This album actually surprised me. Taking you in a different direction than her earlier works. Which left me with mix feelings, Exodus has its strong and weak points.Disappointed in her choice of lyrics for certain tracks. Also to note some over used rhyming grows old.What makes this album worth getting is that beautiful voice. Tracks are arranged well and catchy, songs will stay in your head for days. And its her! Have to love Hikki!For fans new and old, it slowly sinks in and feels like home.If your a new fan and like this album, I suggest looking into some of her earlier works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her best, but still great.","review":"I've only been listening to Utada for a few years, but I've heard a lot of her music. Even though Exodus is not her best, it's very good. I feel like through this album, I've seen another side of Utada."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should come back to Japan.","review":"As you know, the language features between Japanese and English such as syllables are very different.Utada's previous works have brought a kind of revolution to Japan so far because she not only sings very well with her inaudible sounds but also sings as an English singer with her unique techniques of changing and taking apart the delimitors of syllables and/or sentences in her song's lyrics. That has been obviously her art and competence.In this album, first I thought that she stole a kind of Kate Bush's voicing in a first few songs, however, that seems to be different...Only fifth song in this album 'Easy Breezy' keeps her originality though she is not good at the voicing method in English.She should've lived in N.Y. or somewhere in U.S... Totally I was so disappointed. She should return back to the Japanese market or challenge with her natural competency in Japanese to the world though you cannot understand Japanese lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I heard Hikaru Utada on a soundtrack and liked the smooth voice. It was a more soulish song. After that, I bought this album. It was a big disappointment. She dwells very much on being Japanese in the lyrics, the voice is very high pitched, and the songs/production sounds like she is a wanna-be Kate Bush. I won't buy any further album ofhers."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXODUS is great if you want to EXIT your music career!","review":"OH MY GOD IS THIS ALBUM TERRIBLE! In no way or form is this considered good \\"ART\\". I must completely disagree with some of the comments written by others. I know what to expect from a talented person like Utada and I have no idea why she would ruin her career in this manner. I can see how people like to experiment with new things, but there's no need to PUBLISH it as mainstream music.Exodus is childish, unpolished, and frankly it sounds like she doesn't know how to sing.If you want something to cringe to and a disc to use as a drink coaster by all means spend you 15 bucks here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"go back to japanese, utada","review":"I've heard a couple tracks from her new album and they are nothing compared to her Japanese albums. Just like Shakira, she sounds better in her native language. In \\"Easy Breezy\\" she sounds so much worst than before. Personally, I recommend one of her first 2 CDs in Japanese. Even if you don't speak Japanese (I surely don't) it's worth a try, I have one of them myself.Also, why only Utada now? Why not Utada Hikaru anymore? What's up with this?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOOOOOOOOOOO WHYY???? Just Horrible.","review":"OMG. If these lyrics are the same as what I've been listening to in japanese... I think I need to delete my ipod. \\"You're Easy Breasy and I'm Japanesey\\"????? HOW CAN ANYONE DEFEND THIS GARBAGE?OK, so the lyrics suck, how's the music? First Love & Distance had some pretty goot beats and melodies... well that was then, this is now. This is just bad. Some of the \\"songs\\" aren't even songs, they're just experimental nothings. There is not a groove on this disc to get into. This disc is strictly for fanboys with anime fantasies running through their heads. Stick with her Japanese language albums. At least the music is good, and if the lyrics are this lame... you probably won't know anyway. Why didn't she just translate one of those and release it here?

While it is rather innovative, she just wasn't as on point lyrically as she normally is. Still, its a very good album, and I recommend that people get out there and see what Utada has to offer. They should also check out her last 3 albums, which were amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not like Hikki's usual.","review":"When I heard that this CD was coming out, you can't believe how excited I was. I love her Japanese music, and I needed to buy this CD at all costs.This CD made me incredibly disappointed. The music was completely out of her style, and the lyrics were horrid. Hikaru Utada has a nack for music, and deep lyrics, and I know this. I just don't know what went wrong in this CD.Most songs are incredibly boring, almost tuneless with bad background music. The only thing that is still good, at least, is her singing voice, though it did sound very different in English (deeper).If she wants success overseas, I think she should stick to the kind of music she already has. Instead of trying to adapt to us, maybe we can adapt to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely her best.","review":"Trust me, I am NOT an Utada fan. I have never particularly liked her music; the genre, the lyrics, and her voice is pretty average. The first song I heard from this album was \\"Kremlin Dusk,\\" and I immediately fell in love with it, which was totally surprising. I figured it was the only song of hers I would ever like, but upon hearing more of them I decided that she just put out a really good album for once.People who dislike Utada typically criticize her lyrics, and whatever they say, IT'S TRUE. Her lyrics totally suck! But I guess I'm not one of those \\"true music fans\\" because I never really cared about lyrics all that much. I listen to music for how it sounds. And these songs sound very, very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD - but in the American market? Hmm...I don't know...","review":"I thought this was an awesome CD - but the only problem I had with it was..would this work in the U.S?

I hope she makes it big - with her new style"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exodus Overseas","review":"Utada, the all-famous Japanese-American pop singer has finally crossed over from the Far East to the land of opportunity called America. The question is, will America accept UTADA's controversial Exodus? For fans who have been following her career in Japan, they will listen to a whole new and different genre by UTADA, with newer beats and racier lyrics that her Japanese albums couldn't ever reach. However, Exodus has reached beyond higher limits, giving listeners and fans everywhere something new and ultimately fresh to listen to. Unlike her Japanese material, UTADA sings about having a good time, to sex, to her \\"Japaneesy\\" roots, but nonetheless, this album really does expand towards many new lengths. Unlike the standard American pop that we endure everyday, UTADA's music clearly stands out and deems itself as its own genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"I know most of you guys will hate me...","review":"... and so what? Utada Hikaru had more catchy songs in her 3 albums(not including the misc. and singles) which is First Love, Distance, and Deep River. This album IS such a big disappointment for me... I liked her songs in those other 3 album but this one...I only like Easy Breesy and Exodus 04 and thats it! But Easy Breezy and Exodus 04 AINT as great as First Love or Moving on Without You or Automatic from the album First Love, Can you keep a secret,Distance, Eternally in the Album Distance, Sakura Drops, Traveling, Deep River, ASAP, Final Distance, Hikari in the album Deep River. there are also some other songs but they are printed in japanese so...Anyways I conclude this is not the Best album for Utada...all English songs yet it is such a disappoinment..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent cd.","review":"I got this album 2 days ago. After hearing the hit song 'Devil Inside' a year ago on the tv, I decided to get the whole album. The songs were okay. Its just that 'Devil Inside'is the main reson I got the album. I don't know much about Utada, but I think she is a great artist. I plan on getting some more of her albums, including the recently released 'Ultra Blue', which seems to be her best album to date, according to viewers.

Not that I have a problem with layered songs, it's the sounds that she'll use.The songs that I do not like are:\\"Tippy Toe,\\" personally, there are two reasons for not liking this song. First off, the chorus is much to high and annoying. Second, the song is about an affair and she is the other woman. The whole song is about sneaking behind one's back.\\"Wonder 'Bout,\\" I just find it boring. No real surprises in the song.\\"About Me,\\" This song has such potential but is completely ruined. It seems as if it's going to build up to this amazing chorus, then it drops and is very...boring.But all in all, the CD is worth the purchase. I listen to it over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's still the Greastest!!!!","review":"I loved All Utads's Music from Japan, but i gotta say that she's done it again. This time in English.

The beats aren't very creative and the songs just aren't very original. I really wish that she had tried harder to make a better album for her stateside debut.I think the reason Utada even bothered making an English-language album is because record producers thought Americans couldn't handle a Japanese-language release. A \\"greatest hits\\" album or stateside release of her previous (and excellent) Japanese albums would have been much better than what we got with \\"Exodus.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":":-(","review":"This cd was a dissapointment. I tried to give it a chance but comparing this cd to her past music (such as the very much talked about \\"Simple & Clean\\") it definitely does not stand up to it. At all.

I give it a star for one song that is I think was most appealing of the entire album, \\"Devil Inside\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be a painful experience","review":"Listen very carfully to the free examples here on this side.

I was really excited when Exodus came out and bought it without hesitation. However, after listening to the songs and lyrics, I couldn't believe that this was the same Utada that I'd heard before. The different beats in the songs were catchy and melodic, but the lyrics were odd and distasteful. Exodus '04 and Animato are the only two songs that were \\"clean\\" all the way through, but songs like The Workout strongly repelled me. Then you have to look at the titles. \\"You make me want to be a man\\"? I believe this is one of her \\"image-changing\\" cds, to show her fans that she can be versitile. But to those like me, who actually care about the lyrics to the songs they're singing and liked the image that she had before, I would hope that you don't make the same mistake that I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just because I don't like it doesn't mean I'm ignorant","review":"Come on Sam Goody. Could you please stop labeling people as prejudiced and ignorant just because they hate this album? Tell you what, I am Asian, born and raised in Asia, and am exposed to the Asian music scene probably more frequently than you, but I just don't see how this album is anything other than Asian lollipop junk.

She is one of the most talented artists in the world.Yes this cd has several great tracks like &quot;work out&quot; and &quot;easy breezy&quot; However, that is it. The beats are different. They sound too &quot;modern&quot; If you were a fan of Hikki's Deep River or First Love albums, DO NOT buy this. I spent $30 on the Japanese release because I thought it would be great but burst in tears when I heard this album. No stretch of truth there. Her voice is still great, but the beats do not match with the songs. Don't believe the hype. Buy a used copy or download it. Don't waste your money no matter how much you love hikki. This album may make it in the US mainstream, however for the japanese fans, you may end up in tears too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid.","review":"Trash, garbage.

Some of the song can get slightly monotonous at times, but otherwise, the CD is in no way a letdown.I have to say, that her voice is AMAZING. Beautiful, soft at times, but she also demonstrates that she can belt it out when needs be, like on the end of \\"Kremlin Dusk\\". The way the song changes wows me everytime. It goes from being totally soft and beautiful, to a rather hard emotion-filled song.Most of the other tracks are poppy/dancy in my opinion. All of them are good, but not quite my cup of tea, if you know what I mean.Great job, Hikaru!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This does the job","review":"I looked every where for a cleaner of my Sony camcorder and the prices stopped me from buying so as usuall I came to Amazon.com and there was this JVC lens cleaner for a fraction of the price any where else.

Kordon claims on the label that the polymer coating absorbs methylene blue, malachite green, nitrofurozone and antibiotics like tetracycline and acts as a carrier for the medications. My own experience in treating velvet is that without this stuff I lost a veil tale to stunningly rapid bacterial fin erosion down to the roots, and with this stuff, fin erosion halted and I did not lose any of my other fish. And with an early enough application in another tank, there was no fin erosion at all when that horrible gold dust had to be treated there.

Of course I'm so glad that I came across this novel. I was immediately absorbed, right from the first page. Emotionally charged, full of twists and nostalgia, van Loon succeeds in telling the story of a man and his \\" son\\" without being the least bit ordinary. His style and manner of telling the story through the protagonist is all his own. There is a touch of dry humor, which coupled with the interwoven present time/flashback sequences, makes this a very compelling and unique novel. This is not a classic, but it was a good read and I'd recommend it to anyone.

The quality is good and the information is interesting but the world map is broken into very unusual shapes. Not typical of a jig saw puzzle. Additionally the pieces of the puzzle don't really lock into each other. Most of the pieces just lay next to each other. It is difficult for a kid to be able to maintain it while he works on other pieces.

As I read through it, though, I kept waiting for the author to start putting his rambling, meandering musings together into something reasonably coherent and practical, but he never does. In fact, the more I read, the less coherent the book became, sounding more and more like a psychologist pacing in his office, dictating his random thoughts, before moving on to some other, more lucrative task. The ideas are very elementary, and tend to be repeated and illustrated with overly obvious stories, suggesting that the author was trying to stretch already thin material into a book. I'm not familiar with the author's other books; perhaps he has some interesting ideas but has expressed them already elsewhere. I'm not motivated to find out now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Class Act!","review":"From the opening number, Steve Allen's \\"This Could Be the Start of Something Big\\", and each subsequent number, this CD captures the magnificent talent of the Ray Charles Singers and the incredible sound they produced when on the Command record label in the 60's.

This CD contains new brilliant written songs as well as a few classics. Like 'You and Me Against the World','Just An Old Fashioned Love Song', and 'Rainbow Connection' There is also a song called 'You're Gone' It has become a recent hit with the country group Diamond Rio. Paul is back and he hasn't lost his touch. This CD is worth the price, and you won't regret it. Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great songs, arrangment; weak performance","review":"Like Burt Bacharach, Williams has always insisted on doing vocals on his albums, despite the fact he can barely sing. Williams does give a credible performance here, much improved since the early days, but the album could have been vastly better as an instrumental or a collection with guest vocalists -- known or unknown. Indeed, it's a missed opportunity to turn what is basically a vanity album into a collection of hit tracks. For example, the wildly underrated \\"Rainbow Connection\\" (from 1979's \\"Muppet Movie\\") offers the best musical arrangement to date here. But it needs a break-out performance by an A-list vocalist (Lea Salonga, Peabo Bryson, etc.) to make it an adult contemporary hit. Five stars for the music and lyrics. Five stars for the arrangements. One star for the vocal performance. Overall, a 2 star experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paul Williams trys to imitate the \\"big boys\\"","review":"This is not my Paul Williams.

The way the author wrote it made me feel comfortable reading it, even when there was something bad happening in the book.

Personally, I spend a lot of time in the area described here and was surprised to find out that I passed so many sites that either housed or were the burial site of Wright's family. It has also made me plan a stop into Richland Center next time I'm in the area to look at the A.D. German warehouse. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stoplight Review","review":"This album is great. It's the type of cd that i would rock out to in my car. And when I hit a stoplight, put down my window and pass one to the kid in the car beside me. Everyone who thinks they know indie rock should own this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"CORPORATE GREED - this is not music by Jewel.","review":"This album...has to be the most boring and unpleasant pieces of music that I've heard in a while. Only reason I gave it two stars is because some of the lyrics are heartfelt, but it seems that the executives at her recording company tried to make this album \\"poppy\\" instead of the folky gal that she is. It really is horrible when corporate greed gets into music, but whatever floats her boat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I have always loved Jewel, but not anymore. For one thing, the song \\"Jesus Loves You\\" is reason enough not to get this CD. It's the sickest song I have ever heard. Jewel seems like she is trying to say something throughout the CD but comes off saying nothing! And if you can understand her confused mind then good for you. Her voice is whiney and hard to listen to. When I bought it I played it at work and people asked me to turn it off half way through. Very disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"If your expecting this album to be anything like Jewel's first album your going to be dissappointed. I should have known things were going south when she released that Christmas album. Artists only go for that type of thing when they are nearly washed up. This album sounds modern country...real upbeat with a lot of bad effect and bad lyrics, not to mention very repedative. I think Jewel has made it too big...and has sold out. The quality of her music has gone down hill."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"This Way\\" Makes People wonder, Which Way?","review":"Jewel seems undecided about which \\"way\\" she wanted this CD to go. From the popsy radio-hit \\"Standing Still,\\" Jewel strays to a wont, needy \\"Everybody Needs...,\\" to a nostalgic \\"Do You Want to Play\\" to an almost-country \\"Cleveland.\\" She even dabbles a little in jazz in \\"I Won't Walk Away.\\" Her strong, rich voice has always struck people as assertive and confident, yet the lyrics of these songs generate a sense of the instability of youth. The songs on this album change erradically in styles and emphases. THE VERDICT: Jewel must now decide which way she wants to take her career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewel?","review":"Did Jewel hit her head or something between the last album and this new release? Where are those soulful, thoughtful tunes that many of us enjoy from Miss Kilcher? Could it be that she's trying to appeal to a younger audience? Jewel, drop the Britney Speers act! You're far too intelligent and talented. Peace y'all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wisely Preachy","review":"i always considered myself a big fan of her. now, no longer.you know, she released 'this way' on November 13, 2001. it took 2 months to be released in Indonesia, where I live. i was so upset when i listened to her new cd. it sounds experimental and a bit weird. her voice doesn't match country music. and i hate the lyrics. she sounds so wise...and preachy, and cynic, too. as if she KNEW everything in the world. i think she wanted people to agree with her, raising her new standards...but that doesn't come easily!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Coaster! Bad CD!","review":"Lacking Totaly lacking! I love Jewels previous Cds they were great they were mellow and uplifting and dare I even say almost christian! Jewel's new CD [is poor]! her songs are stupid shallow and slow. Her vainity is desplayed in track 8 and she seems prone to wanting fame and not caring what any of her songs are about. I bought the CD when it first came out and I'm so dissapointed! I hate the Mockery of a song Jesus loves you. It is simply pro-abortion and against the church and very human life! Don't get this cd unless you need a coster! wait Even that would be a waste of money too. fine Just don't Get the cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewel Falls to Pieces and loses her Spirit..","review":"Jewel's first two albums are wonderful. The lyrics on the previous have been written with soul, passion, and pain. This album lacks everything that Jewel is. The only good songs on this album are \\"Standing Still\\" and \\"Break Me\\". Other then that Jewel has lost her folklore touch and sounds like a manufactured pop product. I am very disappointed and hope her next release is better then this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album!","review":"This was the first Jewel album I ever purchased. Her music is beautiful and relaxing. She's a very talented artist and her choice of songs for this album is excellent. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in this genre of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody Needs Someone","review":"I'm glad she finally released another album. Its a little stretch from her older CDs but it is still a nice one. She is very goofy and playful in this album. A little unserious but still a nice CD to have to pick ya up when your bummed or just to goof off with."},{"rating":"1","title":"The day Jewel sold out.....","review":"Somewhere between Jewel's first great albums and this one, she decided to sell out, and what's sad is that she sold all of her fans.....all of us......out with her....this supposedly creative and long-awaited CD represents one of the more astounding sell-outs of all time, given Jewel's potential..."},{"rating":"1","title":"very Middle of the Road","review":"I've Heard all of Jewel's Music&nothing really moves me on a whole.I find Her Material fairly Ordinary.Her Vocals never go anywhere&the Arrangements stay Fairly Basic.I Don't Find Her Songwriting that challenging &She plays very Close to the Formula here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely Disapointing","review":"I happily anticipated the arrival of this CD in stores, especially after hearing the first single off of it. However, upon purchasing and listening to this album, I was horrified by its simplicity, lack of originality, and utter boring-factor. Within owning it two weeks I had already sold it back to the Wherehouse. NOT recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conceded, Cliched, ...","review":"Why does our local radio station subject our listeners to \\"Standing Still\\" 5 or 6 times a day? One day, it's going to be played one to many times and make someone drive into oncoming freeway traffic. \\"Burning Bush\\", \\"Do You, Need Me, Like I Needed You\\"? The lyrics are the epidemy of weakness and cliche. I watched her interview on Muchmusic last month. WOW! Can you be any more conceded and full of yourself. I still can't figure out why anyone would think she has talent. ... Jewel is by far the most overrated musician on the scene today..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewel Expands Her Horizons","review":"Jewel has surprised me again. She has matured into new genres of music from rock, blues, and folk. I am so glad to see her grow into the beautiful lyricists and musician she is today. There is no repeated style on any of the songs. Kudos to Jewel and her individuality."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like Jewel \\"This Way\\"","review":"I am really enjoying this entire CD. I appreciate Jewel's style; fresh, unique, uninhibited, sexy, and emotional. I sense goodness, thoughtfulness, and energy to change the world in Jewel's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This CD","review":"I just love this CD. Jewel is truly such a talented artist.What a pleasure to buy a CD and like every song on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This album was a sore disappointment. Key gripes, 1) completely over-produced sound, 2) terrible instrumentals that overshadow Jewel, and 3) the worst... lyrics I've heard, which is the worst disappointment considering I usually like Jewel's songwriting."},{"rating":"2","title":"enchanting","review":"I just love Jewel's way with words, and her voice is mesmerizing. There is a nice variety of songs - her spiritual quest seeps through each track. I had kind of thought of her as a way-out new-ager or something, but this collection reveals a much lighter, fun, yet questioning side of Jewel. She has an uncanny ability for pointing out the ridiculous, the sad and the absurd in life - without being angry or preachy. The melodies are lilting and smooth; very enjoyable. I really recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A talented Artist","review":"I love this CD! I have all of Jewel's work, from music to poetry, and this is definately her best yet. It's a little edgier than her previous albums, and has a little more rock to it. She has a perfect blend of beautiful melodies and down to earth beats. My favorite songs are \\"Do you want to Play?\\" and \\"Serve the Ego.\\" The lyrics are so cool and creative, it makes me want to get up and dance. A highly recommended CD for Jewel lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish Jewel would have kept the same flow but this is okay!","review":"I actually want to give this cd 41/2 stars but I can't, so 4 will have to do. Um, when I heard Jewel was coming out with a new cd, I did not think it would sound like this. It is leaning more towards \\"straight\\" rock versus \\"folk\\" rock. I still really love her voice, I miss her playing solo with just an acoustic guitar. The music well... I really wasn't feeling it in a few songs. Hey, I like what I like. The songs that I thought were good were: grey matter, break me, standing still, the way, and sometimes it be that way. Well, that is all I have to say. I know I am rushing things, but I can't wait til her next album because she truly has one of the BEST voices in the industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewel's Best Yet!!","review":"I was a little apprehensive in buying this CD afer listening to her first CD, which had some good songs on it, but did not stand up overall, and then her second effort Spirit, but this CD is a pleasent surprise. Jewel sounds better than ever on this CD. She's seems to be growing as an artist, expanding her sound into different realms like country and hard rock, but still keeping some of her trademark love songs. Standing Still is a great pop song and Break Me is a great love song. Jewel continues to be an honest artist who stands head and shoulders above current one-dimensional pop singers who look good in spandex, but can't write their own songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewel's Best Album Yet","review":"No hyperbole: this is Jewel Kilcher's best album yet, even better in my opinion than her first, \\"Pieces of You.\\" While perhaps not quite as intensely contemplative as parts of \\"PoY\\" and most of \\"Spirit,\\" this album is a lot more fun -- not bubblegum pop malarkey mind you, but the energetic rock gaiety that's been a hallmark of Jewel's live performances for years, and I'm excited for the fans who will be experiencing this energy for the first time.The album reflects a good range of Jewel's short but prolific career. Though most of the songs are new (\\"Standing Still,\\" \\"Break Me,\\" and the future-facing \\"New Wild West\\" are my faves) some of her earlier, previously unreleased gems (no tacky Jewel pun intended) get prime real estate on this album, including fan favorite \\"Sometimes It Be That Way.\\" \\"This Way\\" belongs in every Jewel fan's CD rack, and in the collection of anyone appreciative of great rock, folk, or even a little bit o' country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"I enjoy this CD. I think I like Jewel because she has a great voice and a talent for creating nice-sound melodies. I can take only so much of her lighter sounding songs (Indigo Girls-like), though; I prefer her to be a bit more rocking which she does on a couple tracks...reminding me somewhat of the songs on Joan Osborne's rocking Righteous Love CD (the best album of last year, by the way). This album impresses - I like the harder rocking moments the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"This album was a big disappointment for me. It lacks the raw sound of that Alaskan girl who played in coffee houses with just her acoustic guitar. Popular music is not bad, but I always expected something more from Jewel's earthy tones. The sound is so manufactured compared to her first two albums. This album many appeal to pop culture much more than her previous works, but it may disappoint many of Jewel's fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"the more it changes........","review":"I loved Pieces of You. I loved Spirit. I love This Way.This way is very different from her previous two cds in a way very similar to how different \\"Spirit\\" was from \\"Pieces of You\\" The connecting points of the 3 cds are Jewel's beautiful, angelic voice; and her deep artistic lyricism. Jewels' thoughts are so beautifully revealed in every song like a flower opening to the light of day. I must respond to the other reviews that state that this CD is a little \\"country\\". It is. a little. I do not care for country music,and I love this one. so don't worry about it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New style, still awesome","review":"Jewel's album, This Way, is a lot different from Spirit, and Pieces if You. Any Jewel fan will fall in love with this new album. The style is much more country, but it's still amazing. I'm personally not a country fan at all, but I love this CD. If the thought of country turns you off, give it a listen anyway. I think Jewel will gain many more fans who weren't as fond of her last two albums, and those Jewel fans who have been listening from day one will also love it! The two live bonus tracks are similar in style to songs from Spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewel \\"This Way\\" What happened?","review":"Awsome CD, But it's not the Jewel music I fell in Love with. The reason I fell in Love with Jewel's music was for the Spiritual overtones and the lyrics that speak so clearly to the state of mankind and human relationships and spirituality. Very little of that here. However, Jewels' beutiful voice and personality are still apparent. Looking forward to the next project, and hope it will not be so surfacey like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Jewel CD!","review":"I have all of Jewel's CDs, even the Christmas one and this is my favorite! Some of the songs are typical Jewel, but many of them are very different from her usual style. It's like a combination of Rock, Pop and Country. It's obvious that a lot of effort was put into this album. The song \\"Standing Still\\" is especially beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This has an oh-so-slightly poppier and more radio-friendly sound than her first two albums-and that's an improvement in my book! Unlike her first two albums, which, though they showed promise, were painfully slow and raw-sounding, This Way and 0304, her most recent album, are easily Jewel at her best-and with better music backing her up. I dont know if this is the best album for non-Jewel fans to enjoy, though-0304 is what will likely convert different kinds of people to her music. This isn't quite as good as 0304, but still a must-have for any Jewel fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"this cd is so so so so so sooooo good!! i like and recommend EVERY song...which is something i NEVER do!! i already have the 2 previous jewel albums...she is the REAL deal! she sings, plays acoustic guitar (although i think she only does on the last 2 tracks on this album) and writes her muzik! its awesome!! she's sooo talented (and hot!) i wish she didn't release 0304... the single from it says all probly, its probly all poppy which i dont like! she woulda done better and got further if she stayed with this kinda muzik!! cuz if she goes main-stream than she wont be as noticed anymore and she'll start getting more enemies.but ANYWAYS. this cds good go get it and Spirit and Pieces of You. theyre all good! l8er!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the ART of music?!","review":"I've listened to her from before she was famous to this album. Somewhere along the way she decided selling albums was more important than the music, because now I can't tell her music from all the other wanna be country pop singers out there. Who is she trying to be? Faith Hill? Michelle Branch? I can't tell her apart from the rest of them? She's becomse so poppy mainstream, she's completely lost her identity. It's said, really, to see her sell herself out like that. I heard \\"Standing Still\\" on the radio, and I almost couldn't tell who was singing! It's that bad. If you want originality and TRUE art, don't buy this album. If you want bubblegum country pop, then give this a try. Otherwise don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who really listens to Jewel?","review":"Corporate music! Jewel is blonde and pretty but very boring music to listen to. The new adult contemporary wave is really boring and sounds rather conservative to \\"real\\" music lovers. I know the AC format and Jewel is just fill-in music you're on hold with a customer service agent or in a bank lobby. She's folk music, not AC. Want to go to sleep? Listen to Jewel! Zzzzzzzzzz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was expecting more","review":"I've never bought a Jewel CD before. Although I have followed her career since she was 14 and have enjoyed most of her mainstream releases, until they were played to death by insensitive top-40 DJs.I bought this album for two reasons: I thought it would be like her pop releases, and I really LOVE that \\"Standing Still\\" song. Unfortunately, that seems to be the only song that I like. As with Shania Twain, once I get past the released singles, I find it to be just too much for my old Rock-n-Roll soul.As a classically trained musician, I have trouble appreciating country music (and rap for that matter too) as a valid form of the art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin-voiced Jewel reveals her limitations.","review":"On Jewel's third album Jewel does not stray from her painfullyannoying little-girl voice, even when it is clear that her voice can be pure and earthy. Most of the songs are forgettable except for rockers such as \\"Serve the Ego\\" and \\"Love Me, Just Leave Me Alone.\\" A surprisingly disappointing album from a singer who professes herself to be artistic but only provides a bland aftertaste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk this way to buy the album","review":"I have all three of Jewel's CDs and this is my favorite. Her previous albums have a sad melancholy feel to them, but this album has energy. \\"Cleveland,\\" \\"Do you want to play\\" and \\"This Way\\" (not to mention her newest single \\"Standing Still\\") have an upbeat feel to them. She is a tremendous singer whose voice is amazing. The only reason it's four stars and not five is because the last couple of songs, though they might be thought-provoking, have the tone of her old sad style. I would recommend this album to anyone who likes \\"Standing Still.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"most impressive","review":"I'll be honest, I like everything Jewel does. There are some genuine gems on there, things Jewel never did before. Like 'The New Wild West' where the dramatic music flows over into a computery sound. There's also the regular Jewel/guitar combos but not as many as in earlier years. It's very clear that she keeps on stretching her musical abilities. The songs are just earbleedin' beautiful or are so beautifully sung that you just can't help loving this album. It's a very consistent, listenable whole.And it has a booklet in which she explains why she wrote certain songs (and some beautiful pics of cource :)). A word for the fans etc. It's a really personal piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just an overall beautiful person","review":"Not only is Jewel drop-dead gorgeous, but she also possesses musical talent beyond belief. How lucky can one person get in life? It's fun to watch Jewel on VH1 or MTV as she gives a tour of her lavish house, shows us her horse, and talks sincerely to her boyfriend on her cell phone. She is at once a modern woman and a throwback to the age when women had a sense of innocence - and were proud to display it.But I digress severely. This record is the best of Jewel's career. She's taken on a more rockin' path, and the results are unbelievable, almost on par with someone like Bonnie Raitt (another female musical genius).I'm outta' here. Enjoy Jewel's latest.PEACE OUT!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is awesome!!!!!","review":"I love this cd!! There is a little bit of everything on here: pop, country, slow, and fast. All of the songs are great! Standing Still has an excellant rythem and great lyrics. Also, \\"This Way\\" has a great tune. All the songs are awesome, and great to sing out loud to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"What you have here is a classic example of a GREAT artist who has found their niche and created their masterpiece. You could relate this (indirectly) to Nevermind from Nirvana, or even Master of Puppets from Metallica in terms of quality. As you can probably tell, this isn't the type of music I normally listen to; but nonetheless, this is a great album from top to bottom, deserving of any praise it recieves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Though this album greatly from her past releases, I feel it also surpasses them. Each album had it's own strength, but I feel almost an emotional connection to this one. By far it's probably one of the best CD's I own and has not left the CD player since I brought it home!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Jewel has come a long WAY, from her first album, Pieces of You. This Way contains tracks that will capture a wide range of audiences. Ranging from folk, country, to an electronic feel, this a great buy for Jewel fans, or even the inexperienced listener!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More brilliance","review":"This album is pure Jewel brilliance.She has a knack of being able to change the sound of her voice to suit the dynamics of the lyrics.Soulfull, sweet, hard rock and easy going are ways to desribe the feeling that stands out when jewel is singing her songs.Not an easy thing to do.There are not many artista who can achieve such an amazing thing one one album.The songs are new and interesting, some are pure jewel but the style has changed for the better.Jewel has taken on an almost country sound in a couple of her songs which I actually quite like.Very easy to listen to and the songs always have great lyrics not the run of the mill \\"he loves her, she loves him\\" type of stuff.Jewel has an interesting mind and the way she sees life is sung about in well sung songs with music to keep you entertained.Put it on while relaxing or great for driving to.Thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed by my favorite artist!","review":"I have all of Jewel's cd's, including the Christmas one, and bought this one without hearing even a single cut. What a mistake! I can honestly say there's not one song on it that I like. I've listened to it all the way through about 4 times and still can't find anything to redeem it. This is upsetting since I've about worn out her other cd's. Maybe it was the influence of the cowboy boyfriend. Will the real Jewel please come back?"},{"rating":"1","title":"is she for real?","review":"I am a HUGE Jewel fan. I couldn't of imagened she would have an album I wouldn't like...SURPRISE! Not only do I not like this album (not one stupid song, and trust me they are stupid), I almost wish I could get my money back. Huge disappointment. On one song she rattles off lyrics about a guy being a 'turtleneck' and someone else being a carwreck. Even the music sucks. save yourself the time and money...I listened to this cd four times, wanting so much to like it, now it sits in the bottom of my garbage pail, where it belongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"More albums should be done \\"This Way\\"","review":"Although I just got this recently, I already notice a lot of the songs to be different than her older work, on a country note, on a romantic note, on a lighter note. She sounds like the Jewel never heard before, and I like it! It might take a while, though, as seen in the rating. So far I have only listened to this once, but I look forward to hearing from it again; I mean, why else would I get it?! My favorite song on here has to be \\"Till We Run Out of Road\\" because it reminds of those days when I had to make those transitions in life and just decided to ride one path for the longest time. Oh, it is my latest Jewel CD and I don't think I have made a bad choice at all. I may have fallen for it as much as my older ones and don'y even know it yet. This leaves a decent aftertaste in my mind after the nice food for thought I have been given, and on this album she just may have it right. Keep up the good work Jewel; I am right behind you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love her","review":"Don't hate a girl for taking a chance. Jewel may have seemed to be \\"selling out\\" due to an increase in more Top 40-oriented folk/rock tunes, such as this disc's incredible first single \\"Standing Still,\\" but don't worry; this self-proclaimed folky isn't going to stray too far. Jewel has always been one of the most influential and promising singer/songwriters since her debut in 1995, and with every album she has only grown and matured more. Sadly, some have accused her, especially since her last release in 2003, that she had entirely sold out due to a decline in record sales, but her last CD was only just an experiment, as most true \\"artists\\" do occasionally. This is by far one of her most listenable of CDs--the aforementioned \\"Standing Still\\" is one of the most poetic and introspective songs in years, and its chorus is one of the most catchy in a long time. Sure, the album has its low moments, but Jewel's talent outshines it all, proving her status as one of the industry's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a chance!!!!","review":"I have to admit i've become a Jewel fan a little late in the game! I recently went to see Jewel at the Symphony hall in Birmingham, and seriously thought she was fantastic!! A little rocky at first due to technical problems i think but as soon as she got going, well \\"The New Wild West\\" Rocks! I've now bought about four of her albums.[P]eople have said that Jewel is trying to express to much in her music that she gloss' over the serious parts of life! Do we really wanna hear about all the bad things we just wanna sit down and listen to some good music right. Yeh, ok some of her songs can sound a bit similar to each other; but i think the benefit of the doubt is in order! People like Britney and Kylie are ok; but how ofen do you find someone other than Alanis Morrisette, that can write songs, play them amazingly on the guitar and belt out some bloody good vocal cords at the same time!She plays the guitar like a dream and anyone who can strum like that is good in my books!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring singer - Love this album","review":"Jewel has been one of my all-time favorite singers and this was one of the few albums that was missing from my collection. Her albums have always been inspiring to me, especially because I am a hands-down, helpless romantic. Some of her music even helped me through some rough times in my life: particularly Barcelona and Life Uncommon from her Spirit Album when I was trying to break free from an abusive relationship. This album is no different, and I especially loved The New Wild West whose lyrics are both poignant and revealing about modern city life."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHOA! Indescribable!","review":"I've never heard Jewel before this. My dad heard her on the radio and recommended her. My teenage dangersense told me that it would be [bad] but boy was I wrong! \\"This Way\\" is something else, and I've never heard anything like it before (I usually listen to anything between Britney-pop to Creed to Vivaldi). I LOVE, I LOVE, I LOVE this album! Jewel sings with feeling. The majority of the songs are sentimental, but in a light way that makes you more contemplative than sad. 'Do You Want To Play' stands out because it sounds happier and louder than the rest, and is also one of my favourites. Other favourites are Standing Still, This Way, Serve the Ego...ah, to heck with it! The only song I don't like is Track 3! BUY THIS ALBUM NOW! BUY! BUY! It doesn't matter if you're starving on the streets, as long as you can bring a discman and this album with you! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"She Did It Again!!","review":"I have been looking forword to this cd release for a very long time now, When I Heard the Cd; It wasn't anything like the first, and not very much like the second either, but STILL! her passion for her music has shone through in her lyrics, and her music is still inspiring, Her TRUE Fans will love this cd,her diversity and her boldness for being able to take a new direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!!!!","review":"What's there really to say? I absolutly love this album. I love all of Jewel's albums, but this one is constantly spinning. Her voice is amazing, and it shows with these very catchy songs. It's hard to put it into a certan genre, it's very eclectic...Some of my favoties would be, The New Wild West, Love Me Just Leave Me Alone, Serve the Ego, ohhh why don't I just name them all? I recomend this album to anyone who has taste at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Way is The Wrong Way","review":"I've been a fan of Jewel ever since I've heard \\"Foolish Games\\" in her first CD, \\"Pieces of You\\". I liked most of the songs in that CD, and ALL of the songs in her second CD, \\"Spirit\\".\\"This Way\\", however, leaves a lot to be desired. While \\"Standing Still\\" definitely made me buy her CD the day it came out, the other songs seem to be lacking. She wants it to be more rock and roll and eclectic but in doing so, the lyrical content of her songs waned and lack any meaning and depth that her songs like \\"Innocence Maintained\\" and \\"Absence of Fear\\" had.If you liked her previous two CDs, this is not the CD for you. However, if you're new to Jewel, maybe you'd like this CD. After all, that's the reason she changed her style and content in her songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious Musicians Will Despise Jewel's Selling Out!","review":"I have been a fan of Jewel's from the beginning. I have performed some of her music. I deeply appreciated her first two albums, and, particularly, \\"Spirit.\\" The albums were filled with her sweet voice, intricate acoustic guitar, and social, spiritual, and psychological themes. It was good folk music. Now, she's sold out. This is a watered-down album, meant to appeal to the masses, mainly CD-buying teens. I can hear this on any pop station. It lacks substance. Where I do hear acoustic guitar, it doesn't sound like her playing it. There are boring, repetitive riffs. It hurt to listen to it. I couldn't make it past Track 6. I want to line my trash with it. I know this won't be a popular opinion, but I think that musicians who appreciated her first works will be sorely disappointed. Anyone want to buy this off of me?"},{"rating":"2","title":"don't slip mr. mailman watch out for my dog","review":"their first albulm was amazing and this one is even better...this albulm portrays more of what you will hear livecrazy overtones and infathamable style..love this band"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some rough spots, but a great album overall","review":"Despite the couple of songs I don't like (yet?), this disc has several outstanding songs, especially beautiful boys and noah's ark, but also KHole, and bear hides and buffalos. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I Missing Something?","review":"I don't know, I guess its possible that because I don't experiment with chemical drugs I don't get this album, but it just does not win me over. I found their first album 'La Masion de Mon Reve' to be even less aurally satisfying than this one. By all means, I give them credit for doing their own thing and using random samples as accompaniement, but I just find it all comes out very cheap sounding; that and to me, one of the two singers sounds like a witch; or demonically possessed. For creativity this album isn't bad but for the overall product I was disappointed. For the songs that didn't sound like a bad Bjork impression like 'Tekno Love Song' and 'Noah's Ark' I would consider listening to again. If you're thinking of getting this album, please be sure to give it a careful listen before you make any sort of financial commitment. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"this band is much better live!","review":"Let me start by saying, i respect these girls immensly. Cocorosie are in a class all their own, they are 100% experiemental. But sometimes as a musician, that either pays off or not so much. In this case, not so much. Although some of the songs are pretty, most of it just sounds like a bad acid trip at a circus. Which makes them really fun to see live. Throughout the whole concert i was mezmerised by their theatrics, their voices, and their stage prescence. Will i put their cd in my player and listen to it alone? No, not in less i want the scary clowns to come out and attack me. Yikes."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"This is a terrible album. Cocorosie is one of those bands that are fun to throw in with a bunch of other bands in a music related conversation to make your taste and knowledge of hip and independent music sound that much bigger than it really is.

Halberstam does an excellent job covering the hundreds of people that made up the game during that time period. After reading this book, I had to go out and buy several biographies of some players that seemed so very interesting to me. Since I am a baseball fan that was born in 83 I wasn't around to experience those players, I just have to read about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfulfilled promise","review":"October 1964 is an interesting, if somewhat rambling series of vignettes about famous baseball players and not-so-famous coaches and scouts. The book is held together only loosely by the fact that it focuses just on Yankees or Cardinals of a general time period. If you are looking for a larger story line or point to any of it, then look to either the editorial reviews or the back flap; the author provides none. The most mystifying piece is that coverage of the actual World Series begins on page 316 of a 360 page book. Even then it is only as the next topic the author stumbles upon, rather than as the culmination of any of the stories which preceeded it. As a baseball fan, I liked some of the insight into the players. I unfortunately also felt that the topic was worth much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Baseball Book I Have Ever Read!","review":"I thought I was a knowledgeable baseball fan until I read this book. The depth and insight that the author provides is beyond comprehension. We find out why the National League was the superior league for many years. We also learn that the Yankees could have been far greater than they actually were (they could have signed Willie Mays and Hank Aaron to name a few greats) if not for their own predjudice.We get a great insight to the personalities of baseball legends (Bob Gibson and Lou Brock were fascinating). On top of everything one of the most exciting World Series unfolds. The author's depictions are so vivid, I felt I was the catcher for Whitey Ford or Bob Gibson instead of just a reader of a book. On top of that, even knowing the outcome I felt the tension of a real game as the story was being told.If you only read one baseball book, this one should be it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Halberstam home run...","review":"Yes, this is another lovely baseball book from David Halberstam. While not as sweeping and poetic as 'Summer of 49', it is more...oh I don't know...\\"hard-boiled\\"?Maybe baseball was different too...and he's reflecting that in his book. Baseball was more serious.Take players like Maris and Mantle, or Gibson and Brock. These aging superstars and noble black ballplayers...their stories aren't so much whimsical (like in 1949) as seriocomic. The hardships Gibson and Brock went through can only be imagined by today's players. Mantle's brittle knees almost have their own personality here.Yet the power of a Gibson pitch or a Mantle home run comes across perfectly in Halberstam's prose.Also, he proves the theory that there is no other sport contest more inherently dramatic (in a literary sense) than a classic pennant race.This is a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maverick AK-01 BBQ Tools","review":"I purchased this as a gift for my father and he loved it as it was part of another Maverick grill set.

This album will bring back many good memories. They are in the top three of the guy-groups of the era. When Reprise released their GH on cd,they deleated one song which was present on the vinyl version. \\"See That Girl\\" was done by the Righteous Brothers on their Just Once In My Life album. T'was a beautifully written piece reduced to a dirge. Not so the Vogues rendition. They produced one of the most beautiful lost love anthems ever done.

The Vogues were a top act when we were much younger and if you like their music this album is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Debut","review":"Lorraine Stanchich's first volume of poetry is small in dimension, almost pocket-sized, but that belies the largeness of the poems inside. Her work is infused with a strong sense of cultural heritage, personal faith, and emotional candor. Whether portraying her immigrant parents and her growing up American, her own relationships, her pregnancy, or her humanist sociopolitical views, Stanchich speaks with a strong, clear, honest voice, rendered with potent imagery. Emotion runs deeply through these poems, which are all the more powerful in their restraint.

There are three expansion packs out now. This book only covers the first one (Rise of the Zilart) and does not cover Chains of Promathia or Treasures of Aht Urghan at all. It is useful to newbs who are trying to find their way around the game, but there is nothing in this book that cannot be found on the internet if you just search for it. There are numerous sites that contain much more useful information (Such as allakhazam) but the problem with them is that the way this game is written, you cannot Alt-tab out of it to view another web page. Once you are in the game, you have to exit it to access any other programs on your pc (I play pc version exclusively....this doesn't apply to PS2 or X-Box players)."},{"rating":"2","title":"there is an updated verison","review":"because online games such as these change on a regular basis, this particular book is out of date as a newer version has been issued. also since there is another expansion for teh final fantasy 11 game called Chains of Permathia, another version, probably called fall 2004 will probably be released soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Shipped With The Game. . .","review":"This guide is nothing more than a decent instruction manual for FFXI.

Don't get this guide unless you have a time machine so you can go back to when it would have been useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"What guide?","review":"First off I don't want to sound unreasonable....that being said...this guide pretty much sux. In truth, the come-with documentation for the game sucked even more but this is supposed to be a guide. I know there is a TON of information to deal with in this game and to put all of it together would leave you with something resembling War & Peace but this guide is all but useless, especially at higher levels.If you're looking for a cursory overview of the game and its concepts AND you have some cash to burn than pick it up. If you are looking for anything approaching an in depth catalog of creatures or items or quests than this will leave YOU feeling burned. The maps are helpful for sure and for a newb this guide may help for a while but in the end you will find yourself frantically flipping thru pages looking for info that's just not there. My question is \\"Will anyone be doing a proper FF XI guide\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good...","review":"If it was possible, I'd recommend tearing the book in half: throw the first half away and keep the last half. The last half of the book is very informative and contains information about the different areas in the game, weapons, quests, and missions.However, the first part of the book is laid out horribly. The section about your first day really has very little to do with what you will actually do in the game on your first day. The various sections about the player jobs are poorly written, lack detail, and are obviously padded. You're better off just reading the game manual.If you're looking for a guide that will offer some insight into the game, this isn't it. However, if you're looking for a resource or reference book on armor, weapons, quests, and missions, then you might not mind the cover price... just ignore the first half of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fee is a rip off, bad game","review":"This game would actually be good if it didnt have the $13 dollar fee per month.

I grew up with this kind of music, the original LP was the signature Hi-Fi Album of that era. Terry Snyder and the All Stars' (Command All Stars) performance is second to none and the producer Enoch Light had created a unique sound for this series. If you want music to reminisce the old days, this is the one to have. This CD incorporated the whole LP of Vol.1 and 3/4 of Vol.2 of the \\"Persuasive Percussion\\" as a single CD which make this a great bargain. Enoch Light who originated and produced this album also has another album which is equally great, titled \\"Far Away Places starring Enoch Light and His Orchestra\\", I hope that it will be available in the coming years.

This collection should be required reading in every contemporary lit. class. It's got everything: all the themes of struggle, frustration and defeat, responsibility, ambition, all the thoughts that men have thought in every age, and captures its era so perfectly and completely I am in awe. Even though the stories are, in some ways similar (especially \\"In Dreams,\\" \\"The Commencement Address,\\" and \\"The Track Meet\\"), they are utterly original, beautiful, hallucinatory, profound, funny and heartbreaking. Schwartz -- that great voice speaking out against the crowd -- deserves to be heard at last."},{"rating":"2","title":"The minor masterpiece","review":"This collection of stories is a minor masterpiece. As other Amazon reviewers have pointed out Schwartz is not much attended to these days, not much read. At one time he seemed to be the great promise of American writing. The sad tale of how he lost it and died young is now a part of his legend. In these stories he shows originality and invention. The unforgettable movie scene in ' In Dreams Begin Responsibilities' where the child watching the courtship of his parents, hearing his father propose yells out at the screen ' Don't do it. Don't do it' is funny and deeply sad at once. Schwarz's Brooklyn world was one in which family frustrations and tensions seem to put reality itself on edge. It is Schwartz after all who is really responsible for the famous ' Paranoids too have real enemies'. Whether the persecutor was himself or not , they got him young. Before this he wrote these wonderful stories which hopefully will have a larger place in the American canon in the years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great bio of an intriguing man","review":"Joseph Pulitzer was a fascinating man.

Beside the Weston pictures there are quite no nudes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Model Wife - an outmoded concept","review":"\\"The Model Wife\\" strikes this reviewer as a publication to avoid. The title itself has two major implications, neither of them positive. One suggests wife as passive object for the husband/creator's pleasure. The second, that there is such a thing as a perfect wife, defined of course by male expectations.Ollman in fact admits that \\"the power over the images...rests with the husbands and explicitly not with their wives.\\" He claims he cannot find similar work by women taken of their spouses. They are out there, of course, in talent and in abundance, but he cannot \\"see\\" them and does not give them credence.Other biases in the book are objectionable as well. Do we really need to know which artists are Jewish or half-Jewish? Are Baptists so designated? Paternity is called \\"siring\\" - are we talking here of horses or humans?Given these inherent stumbling blocks, it is difficult to see this book as anything more than a male hierarchy extending its grip on history."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would give this product 6 stars if I could","review":"First, processing and shipping were incredibly fast....I received the case in 1 day even though I paid for 2 day.

It features songs from the two albums he recorded during his \\"teen idol\\" days onWelcome Back, Kotter. The songs are '70s pop shlock. Most of the songs are pretty terrible, but there are a few decent moments. There were actually three hit songs from the two albums.

A Dirty Shame has some clever ideas and made watch-able thanks to the brilliant Tracy Ulman but its qualities end there. The timing is off, the acting is not hammy or amateur enough for the campy dialogue the results are a flat dull movie that looks for humor in characters that consider themselves addicts. Sex addicts, drug addicts are either that funny. Water's has always had a way of lifting the low-life to a heroic status here they are just boasting outcast wallowing in their addictions."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Shame","review":"This movie is the worst movie ever,i cant beleive how they worked on it!!!!didn't they notice while filming it that it's really really bad???it's just a collection of dumb ideas,put together to make a non-story movie talking about a lady who had an accident that turned her into a sex addict.and they are probably living on another planet that has its own laws and rules where any head injury turns the man into a sex addict!!!!????"},{"rating":"1","title":"It sure was a dirty shame.........","review":"Everyone in this film could have found something better to do.

We expected this to be riotous, knowing Tracy Ullman's humor. We got into the movie about 30 minutes, that we remember, and the next thing we knew, we were waking up! What a snooze-fest! A Dirty Shame was the stupidest, most boring, not-funny, movie I'd seen in a long time. It's not shocking, doesn't really make a social commentary on sex or prudes other than what you can expect (older people don't want to see it and hear about it in public vs. younger people want to do it anywhere they can). Wanted to ask Blockbuster for our money back. Yyyeeesh! What were they thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cult does not = clever","review":"For some reason the appellation of \\"cult\\" is meant to be synonymous with intelligence, insight or distinction. Certain reviewers have been convinced that this film is something of value. Look, I'm not claiming to be a seer, but judged on ALL criteria, there are no redeeming features in this film. It is horrible, base, juvenile and tedious. For some reason, cretin reviewers believe that objections are based on the sexual content of the film. NOT SO! Full-on porn would redeem this film, seriously. It is one of the low points for anyone with an \\"artistic\\" expectation or one in which they hope to be entertained. Vile and hideous. Dumb and several rungs lower than any other of Knoxville's efforts. And that's saying something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak even for Waters","review":"I love a lot of John Waters' movies, but this was a major disappointment. A lot of this is over the top, but it doesn't really work like \\"over the top\\" did in his earlier films. It has one hilarious scene, and the rest is just sub-par material. It mostly comes off as corny, even when you \\"get\\" the John Waters style of overacting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best John Waters film in a while","review":"'A Dirty Shame' is a movie that fans of the old style John Waters will enjoy. It is by no means a 'Pink Flamingos' or 'Desperate Living', but it is most certainly NOT 'Hairspray'. It is full of great charecters and the writing is sharp. Also it is good to see Mink Stole have a good size role and the new cast (Johnny Knoxville ect.) all are great. Tracy Ulman was meant to be in a John Waters film. It is good to know that John Waters can still put some unique things on film."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun when watched in the correct context","review":"Cult director John Waters gets back to his anarchic roots in this outrageous sexploitation comedy.Tracey Ullman plays bored Baltimore housewife Sylvia Stickles, whose sexual urges are re-awakened in a big way after she suffers a concussion and is revived by \\"sex healer\\" Ray-Ray (\\"Jackass\\" star Johnny Knoxville). Sylvia then leads the whole population of Baltimore forward to find the \\"ultimate\\" in sexual pleasures. Suzanne Shepherd is Sylvia's mother Big Ethel, who counter-attacks her daughter's new-found liberation with her own protest group, The Neuters!This comedy is definitely an acquired taste; it's meant to shock (after all, John Waters is the director), but it's also vastly entertaining and a whole heap of fun when you approach it from the right angle. Selma Blair and Chris Isaak co-star, with Waters favourites Mink Stole, Patty Hearst and Jean Hill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious (don't believe the others!!!)","review":"OK, it ain't Gone with the Wind, but I got a lot of laughs out of this. Tracey Ullman is really funny, but I give a lot of credit to all the unknown supporting characters who I thought had some funny lines. It's just a really silly fun film that only John Waters could make. What else do people expect? To enjoy this film, please remove rod from backside before viewing and you should be just fine. I gave it an extra star simply because so many cranks were dumping on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"...Just the newest the latest & greatest by the King of Trash!","review":"This movie embodies all that is typical of a John Waters' film. It's campy, kitschy, tacky, and just darn downright funny--AWESOME! Naturally, as any fan would know, it takes place in the teamin' metropolis known as Baltimore--as virtually all his films do. Fans can expect appearances from some of the old Waters' crew including Mink Stole (my personal favorite) and a cameo by Patricia Hearst. The highly entertaining movie is backed up by a line of stars including the outrageously insane Johnny Knoxville, Tracey Ullman, Selma Blair and Chris Isaak. Suzanne Shepherd's character \\"Big Ethel\\" is also noteworthy. This has been the funniest John Waters movie in a while. I am a huge fan, and this movie just reiterates how great John Waters is! Rent or Buy it today for non-stop laughs! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DESTROY ALL NEUTERS","review":"Pure disappoointment. I do not know how John Waters has allowed this \\"Neuter Version\\" to be made available to the viewing public.This is a \\"Clean Version\\", almost to the point of many scenes being completely overdubbed with \\"Neuter\\" dialogue, and some scenes even deleted. This defeats the purpose of John Waters movies. If you don't like crude and obscene, DON'T watch a John Waters movie.

Avoid this \\"Neuter Version\\" at ALL costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I ordered the wrong one...","review":"I'm a John Waters fan.

BAD VERSIONS of DVD SOLD to CUSTOMERS!!!!!!!","review":"Ok...So I purchased this DVD( USED )from a seller on Amazon. When I played the movie I noticed the Director's voice commentary through out as the movie played. Immediately I stopped the movie and checked every last setting icon on the DVD menu. So after 20mins of frustration without any luck of removing the Director's Commentary...I then realized this unfortunately is how the DVD was manufactured. After much disappointment, I'm left wondering \\"Why would the Seller think a customer would want to purchase a movie with an annoying voice speaking through the entire movie?\\" So unfortunately I can't return the DVD. I would now just like to purchase a NEW copy from Amazon, but I'm scared of ending up with the same BAD VERSION. Can anyone help me in choosing the right copy?

I really went into it not knowing what to expect other than Waters is known for pretty eccentric and absurd movies. That would be fine if it was any good.The movie looked like it was shot with a Flip Video Camera instead of professional equipment. The dialogue was worse than some of my 10th grade students put into their short stories. And the idiotic plant, animal, tree, etc. animations were pathetic.I want to know if the actors and all those involved really thought this was good stuff.

Mr. Waters has not lost his sense of humor or his ability to make the absurd seem normal and the normal absurd.The casting was perfect, Tracey Ullman and Johnny Knoxville were born to star in a John Waters film. Ms. Ullman can change characters in the blink of an eye and put that to good use here. Johnny Knoxville as Ray-Ray is perfect in his role as the cult leader.As with his other movies, those who are unprepared will be a bit taken aback, to say the least. We, on the other hand, laughed through the entire movie.The \\"extras\\" on the DVD were as funny as the movie.

This movie was silly, definitely not entertaining in any way and I threw it in the same bucket I put my dog's crap in when I clean up the yard. I am a Chris Isaak fan, have all his CDs and went to his concert on December 9.

It has everything to do with his inability to write a script and to direct a movie with any coherence whatsover. The only funny moments in this film, or any of his other films, is when an actor of Tracy Ulman's abilities brings something inspired to his tired collections of idiotic potty jokes and strained attempts at outrageous sexual humor. These moments make up about 1 percent of his films, if that. Awful.

It has been edited mercilessly. ALL profanity had been dubbed over, they completely cut out the highlight of the \\"Hokey Pokey\\" scene (Those of you who have seen the theatrical release know what I'm talking about), and they even pixelated the hand of a character flipping the bird.I can't believe John Waters would let one of his films be butchered to such an extent.

One of my 3 has allergies to fish so I have had somewhat of a challenge finding food without any type of fish protein. She can also have lamb, which does help as far as alternating and giving her variety. This one is just wonderful in that it doesn't contain any synthetic vitamins. A great approach and well received in my home. One of my other cats has a longer allergy list and is currently on rabbit, which is even harder to find. She is on the top 3 brands that offer rabbit, including this one. She loves it, so I thought I would try the chicken flavor for my little fish-less one and it turned out to be a rewarding venture. I find the price competitive with this type of food and will keep it in their rotations. It is drier than other brands, but I just cut it up and add about a tablespoon of water on top.

Fact is, it is more than a hair dryer though it does an incredible job with hair. Because it uses Far Infrared technology, the hair is dryed from the inside out without the usual blasting heat you are used to with regular dryers. FIR penetrates the skin (and hair) to put it's unique energy to work at the cellular level. These penetrating rays work to help with joints and other aches and pains too.

Your first clue is the book's adoption of the anti-Christian \\"B.C.E./C.E.\\" affectation, denying the undeniable, that Jesus Christ is the pivot point of World History. What one reviewer terms \\"politically correct\\" is simply a polite euphemism for this book's pervasive anti-Christian treatment of World History, denying, denigrating, and/or marginalizing 1,500 years of Christendom. Christendom financed and otherwise supported the development of universities, agriculture, exploration, law, medicine, and -- notwithstanding the Black Legends about \\"Dark Ages\\" -- science.

Thanks to Brigham Young University, John King and working musicians of high talent we have this music from an era in history that so shaped us today.I prefer the greater variety of this CDs companion piece from the Republic Serials, but both are great. The sad part is that so many will ignore this music without ever giving it a critical hearing. We forget how much music of the masters was written as incidental programme music, or that Wagner was unconsciously striving for something that did not exist, i.e. the MOVIES! And with wide screen high phonics. This music is great music for no more reason than that it succeeds in what it is doing. What more can we ask of talent?

Then this book came along and the author has done an outstanding job in organizing and presenting the materials that would surely keep the junior to senior level network guys interested and best of all the author clearly knows how to explain the BGP concepts in an easier to understand manner.

The fish section says \\"a dozen recipes\\" - there are only ten. And on and on.

It shows clips of old horror movies, from Bela Lugosi to the movies The Exorcist, Poltergeist, and other films of that era. It had Elke Sommer giving the most interesting narrative about her haunted house. They talked to a few psychics, took way too much time on the Amityville Horror, which has already been proven a hoax for many years now. For this day and age, this DVD is sort of a waste of time.

THAT SAID, when you plug it into the wall the battery falls out of the cradle! The mannufacture made no provision for the fact that once it is in the wall the unit with battery is now VERTICAL.

However, as a result, the album sounds more like the Queens than it does the Masters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and Educational","review":"This book is perfect for anyone wanting to make Christmas a little more exciting and varied. Recipes from all over the world are included. Some are traditional and well known favorites while others are truly unique.

I know its an old book and there's tons more cards out but i thought it would be fun anyway. The thing is that it only actually covers the first 151 Pokemon and the rest are like a sneak peak at what would have came out at the time. Pokemon 152-251 are in Japanese (i.e. totodile is waninoko), with only the Japanese card and some don't even have one. The art is like a kid drew it and the colors aren't even right. You cant even match your card to the one in the picture, some don't even show the card its pricing. Theres another book called \\"Pokemon Collector's Value Guide: Secondary Market Price Guide and Collector Handbook\\" that is much better than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thicker hair","review":"This product seems to be good.

Hell Baby is without speech for the entire book, though this is one of the better devices this story uses. Throughout the shriek!'s you come to feel for this character of circumstance -- this HELL BABY -- and Hino's sympathetic side appears between a mad picture of grotesque imagery and sharp allegory.Some may be turned off from this story for its blood and gore, but underneath this Graveyard of Horror is a quirky and fine-tuned story of redemption and even forgiveness. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hi-Fi, Steverino!","review":"This CD was released to capitalize on the \\"bachelor pad music\\" revival of the 1990s. It features recordings from Steve Allen's music albums, not his comedy albums. Steve Allen was a prolific songwriter, and was at one point listed in theGuiness Book of World Recordsas the person who had written the most songs. Steve wrote 6 of the 16 songs on this CD. The music here is all piano instrumentals, and they are actually a lot of fun to listen to. The tracks are well selected, and the result is a swinging good time. This CD is a worthy addition to anyone's bachelor pad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brite is a genius","review":"Poppy Z Brite is a true genius, a master of the short story form.

Tennessee also wrote short stories and she is his natural successor.I must disagree with the last person who wrote a review.

The book is cheesy, elementary and slightly pandering, but in small doses, it has useful information. When your wife becomes pregnant, things are going to change, but not really for nine months. That's why reading this book for about five to ten minutes a day has been useful for thinking about things I might not otherwise think about without the previous experience to know (i.e having a baby). Things in the book include what to expect when you get to the hospital, best times to tell the boss, and advice that drinking & doing drugs is bad for you. Real insightful (yeah, right)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read","review":"Debra A. Warren brings forth poems that are very creative adn inspirational.

Based on the other reviews, I was expecting beautiful, practical arrangements for every occasion and season. The book is too impractical, though--most of the arrangements are too weird and 'artsy' and would not work for normal special occasions, like weddings and showers.

It has by far the most typographical errors that I have ever seen in one book. At times it became a guessing game as to what a word was really supposed to be. This book is part of a series, but one has to investigate other works of Dumas to discern what the other books are. Professional publishers would have them listed in the book for the reader. I am a huge Dumas fan, but this work is tedious to get through especially in the early chapters.

My only regret is that I didn't buy more than one copy, as my friends and the the friends of my friends are now waiting eagerly to read the book which (as yet) doesn't have a UK relese date!Tom's self disciplined, determined quest to fulfil his dream, is the keystone of the book. However, it is the obstacles he encountered and his responses to them that provide the comedy, the tragedy and ultimately a love story about golf and a girl.I'd recommend this book to anyone who has ever tried to play golf; the husbands, wives, boyfriends and girlfriends of anyone who plays golf; and to anyone who had a dream and motivated themselves to do something about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good golf read","review":"A good book for golf junkies. Very funny and yet with some real insights into why those of us who love the game keep playing despite the frustrations. It also makes we \\"amateurs\\" realize how good the really good players are and how many good players there are who are not quite good enough to \\"make it\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"About Paper Tiger","review":"This book was not only very instructive and held my attention, but it was also quite funny. I read it over a weekend and really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-climactic and disappointing","review":"Finally a book about an average guy dropping everything to see if he could make the tour. But that's what professional golfers are not: Average. Even the lowest professional golfer can shoot even par in his sleep, yet the author really struggles to break 80. This is more a funny anecdotal story that any golfer could aspire to but it would have been better if he could actually play. The second half of the book, skips around injuries and yawn...became a kind of mumbling and boring marriage proposal. Overall this book builds up a great story, but becomes anti-climatic and boring. What it is, a delusional tale. What it is not, reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Singer and Actress with Understated style","review":"My favorite singers are Cleo Laine, Betty Buckley (when she is NOT belting like in Heart to Heart), and Christine Andreas. I first acquired her New Ways to Dream and immediately liked her. She has a very quiet but intimate approach in interpreting a song. In particular, The March of the Siamese Twins is worth listening. If you could acquire her other record DO SO. Her interpretations of As If We Never Said Goodbye and As Long as He Needs Me are definitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Convoluted Reality","review":"Kaniuk's The Last Jew is a big, hulking novel that may only be readable for fans of his other work. Kaniuk has shown himself to be the master of the \\"standard\\" form of the novel in early works like Himmo King of Jerusalem, The Acrophile, and Adam the Dog. But even those works were marked by great leaps into the bizarre and fantastic.Well, The Last Jew is one long excursion into fantasy and experimentation. Most traditional markers of storytelling are eliminated. There are a host of characters; they arrive and disappear; their motives are odd and disjointed. Long fantastic passages are followed by relatively standard sections of narrative. But Kaniuk never lets us really rest. The novel is long and demanding.And it is about The Last Jew, and about the fate of the Jews. Apparently Kaniuk felt the need to tell the story of the fate of the Jews in a convoluted fashion to mirror the reality of Jewish fate. Whether a reader will want to tackle this ambitious program is doubtful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bolshoi Ballerina Shows OFf Her Varied Talent","review":"Prima Ballerina Ludmila Semenyaka exults in eight of her famous roles partnered in each of them by a different leading male dancer. Four of these roles are seldom seen in the West: A SOLAR DUET, LEGEND OF LOVE, SPARTACUS and THE TALISMAN. The remaining four are familier: the ROSE ADAGIO from THE SlEEPing BEAUTY, the mad scene from the first act of GISELLE as well as the pas de deux from the Second Act, The BLACK SWAn pas de deux from SWAN LAKE and a pas de deux from THE NUTCRACKER choreographed by Yuri Gregorovich."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid album","review":"ok, for those who aren't familiar with Akhenaton lead of the french rap group IAM. This is his second solo album. The beats, the sounds are researched and well selected. But of course with Akhenaton everything lays in the lyrics. If you don't understand French (it would help) get the lyrics and translate them. Nothing in America comes close to his structured, culturally and politically composed rhymes. Akhenaton is one of the best lyricists alive. But he doesn't sing in english or trust me we would all have heard from him. Don't just take my word for it research it and listen to this gold solid album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book and a must Read","review":"The story was phenomenal and I salute to Greg's dedication and committment to the cause of educating girls in Pakistan, sepcially in remote areas in north. Narration was excellent as well as content was well picked. Highly recommend everyone to read it and help with Greg's noble cause."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Cups of Tea is a true mission from the heart","review":"What Greg Mortenson has done to promote what a true heart gives is so motivating. When I think about the missions in the United States, Australia and other parts of the world, and how the missions were set up to teach, it makes me very sad to know how much culture was lost. Dr. Greg is doing the work the right way, empowering the people in their own ways. This book teaches so much more than just one man's vision and mission; it really teaches us to look beyond our walls and see how it is we can make a difference in our world, close to home to far away. It excites me to know that our military is reading and learning from Dr. Greg. May we all."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Must Read!","review":"A friend spoke of this book and peaked my curiosity. I purchased it for myself and also as Christmas gifts for my adult children. We have each said the same thing- we couldn't put it down after we started reading it AND that everyone needs to read it. Greg Mortenson is truly an amazing person. All I can say is- God bless him, those working with him, and the work they do. I now intend to purchase his next book and can't wait to read about his new adventures. The world would definitely be a better place if there were more people like him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"This book was recommended to me by my sister in law..who got it from her dad... It was a little slow to start with, but in short time had me hooked. It is a book that you read a bit, think a bit and are drawn back to again and again... thought provoking and inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it's a lie.........","review":"I am saddened that such a good story could be ruined by yet another author's distortion of facts. Why in the world didn't he just make the story fiction???? We all know that much fiction is based on actual facts. The author has destroyed his own book. I wouldn't buy it. There are many other good books in the same genre. Please don't support author's that lie! Google the title if you want more info. 60 minutes did a story on him...it's hard to dispute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming and inspiring","review":"This book was a great read and one I would recommend. Greg and his family are a true inspiration to the reader. I was disappointed to see the bias for education as the sole answer to radical Islam throughout the book. While education is the mid to long term answer, it certainly won't stop the terrorists operating across the world today. Greg shares one account after another when he was in grave danger and always got through and does to this day to continue his awesome mission. I would like to thank God for his and his family's safety and ask that God continue to be with them throughout their days."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great tale, well told","review":"I picked up this book almost by accident - it was the only thing even vaguely appealing at an airport shop. Almost twelve hours later, I realized that it was one of the most engrossing tales that I've ever read.Its well written, funny, and certainly makes points that you wont find anywhere else.For those who mock \\"Dr. Greg\\" (the book makes clear that he tries hard, and fails to explain that he's a nurse, not a doctor), well, there's never any shortage of pygmies trying to tear down genuine giants.If you want to read it either as a good story, or to understand a part of the world Americans have very little understanding off, I recommend it highly. If you want Rah Rah Brainless Propaganda, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Cups of Tea","review":"I thought this was going to be the children's book version, not the adult version. My mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book shattered my enthusiasm","review":"I looked forward to getting this book. I read studiously and with great hope that I would get into the \\"peacemaking\\" theme. I struggled to 'get it' and tried to enjoy it. It was so poorly organized that I wanted to skip the descriptions and names of people and places that didn't mean a thing to me. Finally, somewhere after the 'centerfold pictures', I gave up. This didn't give me any idea where his real money came from. How could he afford all this travel while tring to find 'backers' and resources? This was a great vocation but didn't share any of the real feelings the man experienced. I think he would have done better if he wrote his own story. This book didn't motivate me at all; and that's what I was looking for. I returned the book to the library gratefully; and I am not sorry I didn't finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Read","review":"This was such a terrible book to get through due to the fact that it not only read horribly, but Mortenson's behaviors were often naive and self absorbed. It makes no sense to me why he is going this alone (at least that is how it plays out in the book) and why there isn't an effort to build a greater coalition rather than a one-man show."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"Given all the hype, I was really hoping to be blown away by this non-fiction read. It just didn't live up to my expectations and I was rather bored by it. I was hoping to learn more about other nations and how education differed there, but somehow the book just didn't live up to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Very moving book. It makes you see people in a whole different way. I was never bored reading this. Great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring, reads like a thriller","review":"Suffering physically and psychologically from his failed K2 climb, Greg Mortenson literally stumbles into a small village in the remote mountains of Pakistan, and into a life worth living. Humbled and inspired by the hospitality of the villagers, Greg promises to build them a school. That promise altered his entire life and has resulted in more than 50 schools and other projects in the forgotten corners of Pakistan and Afghanistan. This inspiring biographical story reads like a thriller, and I stand in awe at what this man has achieved. More than all the bombs and words thrown about in that region of the world, Greg's promise to build a school has transformed communities, lifted the veil of ignorance and opened doors to opportunity for countless children (especially girls). I highly recommend this to anyone interested in development, education, Central Asia, the true causes of terrorism and / or lasting peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Dr. Greg","review":"Many a book touches one but the selflesness of Greg Mortensen, his family and the innumerable people he involved in his noble cause drove me to tears, he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, the world needs more like him. Thank you Dr.Greg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Cups of Tea: one man's mission to promote peace...","review":"This is one of the most thought provoking, hard-to-put-down books I have ever read. As a christian, it has changed my entire thinking about Islam and how we should go about stemming terrorism . A must read for every American. Greg Mortenson is a true World Hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did they have an editor?","review":"I thought this would be a good book to bring on my first true vacation in years, but then found myself working so hard at reading it that I simply could not wait to get to the end. Though I'm not an editor, I would have taken a red pen to this best seller if there had been one in my rented condominium. Bad simile followed bad simile, and I kept referring back to the description of the author, who has won multiple awards, and has taught at what is perhaps the finest writing institution in this country. Greg Mortenson sounds like he is a kind man, with a true gift for outreach, but David Relin did a disservice to Greg's mission when writing this distracting book. Perhaps Mr. Relin's brilliance lies in his works of fiction, but if so, that is what he should stick to writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"This is the most self-indulgent book I've ever read. I absolutely suffered through it. Please don't waste your time or money on this book. Mortenson, one of the co-authors, refers to himself in the third person through-out the book. He gives himself high praise and accolades for what he has done (which is indeed wonderful). At one point he even quotes someone else as saying he will get the Nobel Peace Prize! This guy is beyond full of himself. He uses the word \\"peace\\" in the title as a hook. In a nutshell: the guy fails to make it to the summit of K2, gets lost, stumbles upon a poor village, starts a foundation, builds schools in Pakistan. Done. Now go find yourself a truly good book to read by someone who isn't so full of himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patronizing Narrator","review":"Am I the only reader who got just beyond 50%--Kindle readers go by percentages, not pages--and had had enough of Greg Mortenson writing in third person. I saw Mr. Mortenson on Bill Moyer's Journal and was so impressed with him. But this book is so patronizing and so self-grandizing. It is as bloated as apparently his body became. It led me to three glasses of booze!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Accomplishment=fabulous Book=boring","review":"While Greg Mortensen's accomplishment's are to be highly praised, his personal life is just not that interesting. The book is infused with details of Mortensen's life in the states and these details read like a romance novel. Too little is told of life in Afganistan, of the children who attend the schools, of the impact on the local villages.The writing is stilted, and the book enhances too many details with inept and akward descriptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move on to the next book on your list! SKIP THIS BOOK!","review":"I do like to read the book reviews, but have never written one. This is one the worst books I have read in a long time. I feel compelled to write a review for this book in the hopes that I can spare someone their time and energy on reading this book! This book was truly like trudging through mud for me! I am so disappointed at the writing and the lack of flow in the book. Mortenson is so narcissistic it is nauseating! Is he kidding me! I understand that this is a worthy cause BUT he never really speaks to the people to see what they want, he just goes on this self fulfilling mission. My biggest grip is the fact that he is NEVER with his family! He is always away and when he is home he is in his basement of the home that was bought for him (because he does not provide for his family) or he is in his MILs basement! He only speaks of \`the children he is helping' how about helping out his own kids by being home!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Story!","review":"This book really opened my eyes to another world.

This book will make you laugh, cry, be enrarged, horrified, humbled, shocked and mostly fall in love with people. The book is so well written, straight forward and mind opening that you too will be infected to help where you can whether it is rural Virginia or Pakistan. The best thing I can say to sum up what you may feel when you read this book is \\"Tradgedy at Christmas.\\" Why, after all the turmoil, struggle, loneliness, desolation you come to understand what the meaning of Chirstmas is all about; \\"Peace on Earth, goodwill to men(and women.\\")I now find myself running through the house yelling \\"Allah Akbhar\\" and insha'Allah (Grandpa's version of 'God willing and the creek don't rise.'But don't listen to my ramblings, read and believe the truth of experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once it came out that Greg Mortenson is a fraud... no thank you to anything he claims","review":"How can you tell what's true and what isn't?

I recommend this book highly and have purchased it for many friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Story but Difficult Read","review":"Four stars for the inspiring story, but I wish that Greg Mortenson had written this book himself. While an inspiring and touching story, I think that David Relin just made it difficult to get through. The use of Greg's full name throughout the book makes you want to run for your word processor and do a global search and replace. You find yourself thinking, \\"We know what his name is by now\\". I caught myself looking ahead a few times to see how many more pages I needed to get through, just because of the writing style.The parts of the story where Greg relates something firsthand are great, it's a shame that the entire book wasn't written that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Cups of Tea BOOK","review":"After much procrastination, I finally sat down and read this book for my book club.

The ability of a single, ordinary man to change the world never ceases to amaze. Also, the book touches on Islam and Muslim culture and teachings without really providing much of an explanation of these topics.

Yes, this is a great story and worth reading. The only problem with this book is the main source for my discontent: it is very poorly written.

Would've worked as a magazine article, but whew! this book is about 200 pages too long. Glad to know Mr. Mortenson did the things he did, very admirable work (except for the part about leaving his own family for months at a time, and his exceedingly poor organizational and time-management skills), happy I read the book if for nothing more than an increased understanding of the region. Read it for a book group and we all agreed (those who finished it, anyway) that we had to force ourselves through to the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but poorly written and tedious","review":"I agree with all of the one and two star reviews. The writing is tedious and sophomoric. Mortenson, while undeniably doing some great things in Pakistan and Afganistan, is irresponsible, undisciplined, and self-absorbed. I couldn't figure out why he wasn't able to save some money for his cause while he was living out of his car and virtually had no expenses - I guess that was because he only worked part-time?!

He can't leave, but he must, so he treks in an old jeep to . . .That's the story, detailing what he drank, what he wore, the grit and dirt on the road, but we never get inside the man.

It's choppy, disjointed and poorly written. I regretted taking this book on my vacation and felt that after I read it, I didn't learn that much more about his story (I had already read a number of reviews, etc). I can't understand why more than 1,600 people on Amazon rated this book 4+ stars. I would rarely take the time to write a review but in this case, I felt that I must!

Does the author really believe the public will buy the baloney that he is privy to presidential phone call information? Anyone who is thinking of reading this book should wait until one is passed along to them as there certainly are a lot of gifts floating around.PS -- To anyone reading this review, don't be surprised to find an inordinate amount of \\"no help\\" ratings.

It's a classic ... out of bad things, amazing things can happen ... not just for the person directly involved, but for thousands of others. Our author is a climber. In an unsuccessful attempt to climb K2, the world's second tallest mountain, he falls quite ill. For several weeks, he is nursed by to health by the people in a small Pakistani village. He promises to return and build the village's first school. Returning to Montana, he begins a campaign to solicit funds--striking out with 99% of the people he asked. Tom Brokaw sent him a check. Selling all his stuff, he returns to Korphe and begins to fulfill his promise--the details, the obstacles, the surprises are wonderful--even the Taliban won't destroy his schools. From that illness, the Central Asia Institute was created.Can there be collaboration in the world? ...

I see it all the time, but we also see so many things through our own eyes. This book shows us Pakistan and Afghanistan people through Greg's eyes - which are so much clearer than our own for obvious reasons.

Greg Mortenson is a confidence man, not on the scale of Bernie Madoff but perhaps worse, because he used social enterprise and the NGO he founded as a personal ATM machine milking many good-intentioned people. Perhaps his heart problem is that he has no heart. Before wasting money on this book, instead read Joh Krakauer's account of the fraud, in Three Cups of Deceit. Krakauer himself was conned out of thousands of dollars and for a long time supported Mortenson. Just sad these con men create distrust of good-faring social entrepreneurs. Btw, 100% of Krakauer's proceeds from Three Cups of Deceit go to the \\"Stop Girl Trafficking\\" project of the American Himalayan Foundation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good American, Bad American?","review":"It would have been easier to judge this book and Greg's characters if Greg was more forthcoming and honest about what he did and did not do.

It truly gives the unintiated a look into the \\"real\\" world of Pakistan and Aphganistan. Greg Mortenson is truly one orf the world's great people- his dedication to the education of children is totally awe-inspiring. It seems that America has forgotten the real casualties, who have had NOTHING to do with this war- the children. I do hope that enough politicians read this wonderful book and get some of the very much needed help to these brave and simple people. (P.S. This is the first time I've ever wrote a review and probably won't again.

I'd pick it up and read a few pages after finishing yet another (good) book, then go on to a more captivating or entertaining read. It just wasn't interesting enough to keep me reading it. Now I find that it's a work of fiction. That's even worse. The truth is not always thrilling and exciting but fiction should never be so boring.

People who are working for the betterment of women in this world? I think not.And I swear, one time the author used the word turd, to describe human waste left on the mountain.

Reading it makes me feel like I'm stuck in the seat behind someone very tall in the movie theater. I have trouble, first, getting past the writer and his perceptions of Greg and second, getting to know Greg himself. Like a speaker introducing the guest - I just want to hear Greg tell the story but he only speaks every once in awhile. Like most male authors, the motivations, feelings, emotions etc. are ignored. For example, there's no reaction of Greg's after he gets a garbage can dumped on his head in high school? Wouldn't this have been a good time to have Greg say he missed Africa and vowed to go back someday or something? It feels like there are two people in this book you are asked to get involved with and there should only be one: Greg."},{"rating":"1","title":"T for Tedious","review":"This book is a hagiography of an admittedly saint-like fellow, Greg Mortensen, who -- like most saints -- is a pain in the butt. He is tenacious and uncompromising, clever, curious (learning a great deal about the peoples and languages in Pakistan and Afghanistan), dedicated, and has no sense of humor or irony. A mountain climber who sleeps in his car and works part-time, Mortensen -- after getting lost in the Himalayas -- vows to return to the Pakistani villagers who saved his life and build them a school. Doing this all by himself, as opposed to, for example, working thru UNICEF or Habitat for Humanity, Mortensen runs into predictable snafus. His biographer never met an adjective he didn't like, and gives backstory on every character who wanders across the screen. I finally started reading only the first sentence of each paragraph, and found the book much more coherent that way. It's a long shapeless story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book with a great end. Very empowering","review":"The only down side I can say it's that the ending was dragging a little bit. Everything else is outstanding. The descriptions to educate the majority of us so ignorant about that side of the world, Greg's perseverance and how truly easy it is to take action and make a big difference. Important book to read in these times of conflict every where."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perspective altering and life changing","review":"This book was given to me by someone who knew that I will read anything, and I did not expect the story to affect me the way it did. I have a very new fresh and altered perspective on life and living and giving after reading this book. I have always known that there is more good in the world than not but it isn't something we see, read, or hear about often enough. I wish I could give this book to every person I know, but I can't. I am however going to purchase ten copies to give out to family and friends with the insistence that they read it within six weeks and pass it on to someone else. I am also purchasing two copies for my local library which does not have the book but has people waiting to read it.If you are someone questioning weather or not to buy this book, DO IT!!! and when you do make sure you go to[...]and follow the amazon link as this generates proceeds to benefit Mortenson's foundation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never underestimate the ability of one person to make a difference","review":"I resisted reading this book for months because I thought it sounded boring and I don't like biographies. However, friend after friend kept recommending it, so I picked it up in Audio Book format. It was terrific! Never boring, always intriguing. You laugh, you cry, you learn. Listening to the news every night, it is easy to get jaded and assume the world is hopelessly screwed up. Greg proved that even in the most trying circumstances, one person can make an incredible difference for good. There are too many evil people who spend all day every day looking for ways to be destructive and spread hate. We need more people like Greg who spends every day looking for ways to spread hope and love.

Let's hope that the intent transcends the man and the effects of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgot I was reading a non-fiction book!","review":"This book was so engrossing that I forgot that I was reading a true story and not a cleverly crafted drama. To say this story is inspiring would be to leave too much unsaid. It is an opportunity to view \\"normal\\" life in the midst of times of tremendous change and challenge in central Asia. The reader can absolutely smell the dust and feel the cold in this well written and riveting account of one man's efforts to bring schools to the otherwise forgotten regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Perhaps equally important is that it is absent any political agenda which keeps the narration true. It also provides splendid insight into the customs and traditions deeply rooted in this region reminding the reader the importance of respect - especially when a foreigner in a foreign country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take the time for these 3 cups of tea","review":"Just finished it.

I am now reading the book and amazed at how an apparent failure can turn into something so positive, how someone can be so inpsired to change the fortune of an entire region! I have always believed that one person can indeed make a difference if he/she believes in himself/herself. The thought of fighting terrorism with enlightenment and love is not new, it just takes more effort and commitment than so called diplomacy!Mortensen's work and book are an absolute inspiration for the people of this world, particularly Pakistan.

Having lived in Central Asia I found the discussion about the Muslim culture very interesting.

During these times of xenophobia and mis-guided fear, we need more books about Central Asia and Islam."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different perspective","review":"Greg Mortenson is an extraordinary man, I believe, who was called to help the Pakistani people.

It is an engaging journey of an American who most people would take as a bum, who, due to his unique background and creativity, finds himself able to move mountains to achieve his goals.

But I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to the Wind","review":"Thank you Greg and Tara for you unselfish devotion to the children of Central Asia.

No one, of course wants to hear about a book someone else is reading, but sometimes a book has that kind of effect on you that you need to talk about it. This is one of those books. It took me outside the cozy, secure life I have and made me truly think about how other cultures are, while at the same time weaving a mesmerizing tale of families and love. Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Cups of Tea","review":"This was a fascinating book that is very inspirational about a region and people(especially girls) who get schools and education.

Also a revealing look at Pakistani and Afghan societies through a different lense than the politico military one we normally see through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you yearn for peace?","review":"Read Three Cups of Tea and learn how you can work for peace. This story showcases what a single person with a dream can accomplish. Yes, Mortenson knows that when you give, you also receive. The desire to lessen suffering in the world motivates him so strongly that he does what military intervention has failed to do. He shows Muslim children another, kinder Western face. And he procedes one step at a time, often working blindly, unsure of the next step or where support will come from, but always rooted in determination and confidence that the dream of schools for children is possible. This is the way Mother Theresa worked. Mortenson's book educates us in a way that news reports don't. It makes the people behind the news real. Everyone wondering about what our nation should do to promote peace should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Promote Peace . . . One School at a Time","review":"While the book was a slow start, it more than made up for the slow pace once it got beyond the mountain climbing introduction. Greg Mortenson's mission of building schools for girls in these war-torn areas of the world went far to bring education and some enlightenment to these people -- old and young alike, as well as to help them better understand that the average US citizen did not wish them harm as was voiced by their religious extremist neighbors, and acted on by the G. W. Bush administration. The book also showed what the US might do to rebuild a reputation of generosity as opposed to a war monger. The book did much to provide back-stories on the little-known US role during the Russian occupancy of the area; as well as the earlier stages of the Bush wars in that same area. Finally, the model of Mortenson's work should be replicated by the US State Department world-wide. Wonderful book; great story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Man's Battle Against Terrorsim","review":"If Greg Mortenson is not nominated for the Nobel Prize, I would be greatly disappointed.

I'm teaching as a volunteer in a school for low caste children and when given the opportunity, they are brilliant, just as the Pakistani children.This is a must-read.

Well written, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Cups of Tea","review":"Three Cups of Tea was one of the most moving books I've ever read. The need is so great, and we hope to help, as education IS an excellent way to let these children know we DO care about them. In this book, Mortenson briefly mentioned that the people he was visiting told a story of saving a United States soldier. That was a reference, I believe, to Marcus Luttrell. Luttrell wrote Lone Survivor, the story of the Navy Seals's mission; Luttrell was rescued by these wonderful people. Both books offer extended examples of the heroics these men went to in order to safely escort/save Mortenson and Luttrell."},{"rating":"2","title":"an inspiring story","review":"This book touches me in a lot of ways, the indescribable beautiful scenery of the area, the admirable strong spirit of mountaineers and the joy they reached beyond the ordinary people's imagination, the peaceful, humble people in Kophe, and most of all, it is the story of Greg, his big and soft heart and compassion toward to his little sister Christa and the people he considered as his brothers and sisters in Pakistan, the powerful story how he and his wife found each other, I couldn't help my tears streaming down several times already on the half way of finishing the book.

My friend up the street said I wouldn't be able to put it down, but I did.The first three pages were excellent and I had great hope of a great read, but alas Mortenson grows long winded and wearisome. His details are not interesting, though they could have been given the fascinating place he was in, but instead he is boring and pedantic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I read it but ...","review":"I found it a little strange that Mortenson co-wrote a book that depicted him so heroically. I guess modesty isn't one of his virtues. Plus the book was poorly edited and could have been cut down by at least 100 pages.Having said that, I think this is an important, eye-opening book. Anyone who thinks they understand what's going on in Pakistan today should take a look at Mortenson's experiences. They're truly inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for everyone","review":"This book is a must read for everyone. Not only does it highlight the need for education in all communities, but it provides insight into the current area conflicts thereby adding another dimension to our understanding of current events.

Only my opinion, but if you have any interest in building a better world this is the book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring read!","review":"I'd highly recommend this book!

It challenges the way you think about your life, what you can do to help others, and what we are doing wrong as a country. It is incredibly enlightening. This man is absolutely deserving of the nobel Peace prize.Let it be known that I normally do not like reading about history at all. I have absolutely no interest in history, but I found myself looking up maps of the areas, peeling over the pages. I feel like my understanding of the Taliban, Afghanistan...that whole area...is so much deeper. I feel like I know things the PRESIDENT doesn't even know.Read this book...it will change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Content is outstanding -- reading requires some concentration","review":"I loved this book, but it was not a \\"quick read\\". Stay with it though, because it is rich with a new viewpoint and perspective on our friends in the Middle East.

Regardless, this is an engrossing book. Greg Mortensen is, in many respects, Everyman.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book - and was inspired enough to contribute to his foundation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review by Brandon Jones","review":"The story is very good.

I learned about an area of the world (mainly Pakistan) that I discovered I knew very little about. This is what's happening now over there; it's all true. Greg Mortonson, the author and principal character, is a very brave man with a very sane, intelligent, way of helping to bring peace to the world by building schools. His theory is to educate the women in these far-flung places, and thus you educate the whole village. This is about politics happening NOW. I think everyone should read this book to understand what the Taliban and Al Queda and other religious fanatics are doing in places like Pakistan and Afghanistan. It should be required reading in schools."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a man's book!","review":"The cover and title make it sound like a chick book. This is a book for everyone. There is high adventure throughout. The story is amazing and will touch your heart as well as your need for speed and your need to identify with various tough guy heroes. The tone stays mostly neutral on the pros and cons of the Islam/US strife, just sicking to telling the story. You will not want to put this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Cups of Tea: One man's mission to promote peace","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this account of Greg Mortenson's journey through Pakistan to establish schools for girls who otherwise would not receive an education. I feel so much compassion for these innocent children who are victims of their existence. I would recommend this book to anyone living in the U.S. where we have education readily available. I also would recommend this book to those children in the U.S. who choose not to attend school. The Pakistan children are so eager to learn anything and read any books available to them. Greg's family should be extremely proud of his lifetime accomplishments to better the lives of children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary human being","review":"This is an exceptional book about an extraordinary, selfless man. I thought I was well versed in the current events of the geographic areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan depicted in the book. But the book taught me so much more than any news reports have.

This is a great book for high school and college students to be exposed to how one person can indeed change the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Plan for Peace in the Middle East","review":"Three Cups of Tea is the story of one person's struggles to finance and build elementary schools in locations under the influence of the Taliban, Al Qaeda, and Sunni extremists. What makes this endeavor so exceptional is that he built them at low costs in the almost inaccessable mountainous regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan.Aside from fulfilling the dreams of young girls who longed to be educated, the schools are serving an international benefit: their graduates have begun counteracting the influence of graduates from extremist run schools - schools that teach hate and generate the manpower needed to sustain the ranks of the insurgents.The book supports the theory that one man can make a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"So inspiring!","review":"I just finished Three Cups of Tea over coffee this morning at 7:27 a.m. I was so inspired by the story that I immediately sat down to make a donation to CAI in honor of the friend who recommended the book to me. Out of curiosity, I read some of the \\"bad\\" reviews on here and was appalled that some of the people never even finished the book before writing reviews. So here is my suggestion if you are reading reviews before considering this purchase: If you like a quick, easy, mindless read---this book is not for you. But if you are someone who likes to be inspired and enjoy detailed descriptions that make you feel as if you were actually there, buy this book!

I chose to read it because I am trying to learn about Afghanistan and ultimately, our (the United States of America's) war on terror. I learned a lot about daily life and struggles in Pakistan and Afghanistan both pre and post-9/11. I also learned about the torment the Taliban puts civilians in those countries through. I was of the mindset like the bumper sticker quoted in the book said, \\"Nuke 'em all - let Allah sort them out\\" before reading this book. Now I understand that the civilians there had little or nothing to do with 9/11 and other terrorist attacks.Relin's descriptions are flowery and drawn out so the reader must get beyond them. There was also a bit of negative attitude towards America from Mortenson and Relin.I am only rating this book 5 stars because I think everyone should read it for the educational value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop wasting time readng reviews and just buy the book!

How the the powerful effect of doing the right thing can come full circle and manifest greatness in one's life.I am hoping that it will soon be translated into many languages as it will be a book I will continue to gift and share with others in the future.I only have one gripe about the book and that gripe is for Amazon, not the book itself. Why is the Kindle download price higher than the actual book price? Come on Amazon, if the additional profits from the additional eBooks pricing were going to Greg Mortenson's CAI to help promote reading and education (Satellite downloads into Schools), then I would be forgiving about this discrepancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saturated with Tea in Pakistan","review":"Greg Mortenson and David Oliver Relin have combined to write a challenging book. It is about Mortenson and his love for the people, particularly the children, of Pakistan. Mortenson gained much of his early reputation as a skilled mountain climber, but when he was desperate for help it was a group of tribal people who rescued and nurtured him back to health. In return, Mortenson promised to build the people a school and eventually he formed his own charity and built many schools. The book should challenge and encourage Americans to not see all Muslims as terrorists, nor all humanitarians as Christians. Mortenson is a self-described 'infidel' who pursues his vision of bringing education to girls (emphasized in the book) and boys in very rural areas of Pakistan. The book is rich in cultural detail and intrigue and should be read by all American NGO and military personnel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly fighting the war on terrorism through peace.","review":"Three Cups of Tea has been on my radar for over four years know.

It really answered a lot of questions for me regarding some societal issues in Pakistan and Afghanistan. It became clear that all the Grandparents and Parents of the children in these areas really want is for their children to grow healthy and informed about the world around them. Greg's view is I suspect much more real in regards to the simple people's of these areas.I recommend this wonderful book to anyone. The story shares how nothing is impossible. Parents should read it to their children and teachers should require it in schools. I am very fussy and could not put this book down for a minute.

It's been a very, very long time since I have read such a badly written book. Normally I'm not compelled to share my views through written reviews, but this book has driven me to do so because I simply can't understand why it has sold so many copies. The writing style is florid and forced, and the unmitigated fawning of Mortenson's mission (whose accomplishments are admirable, which probably explains the high sales) becomes almost nauseating before the reader finally reaches the end. An ending that could have come several hundred pages sooner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harder to read than climbing a mountain!","review":"Skip the book, just donate to the causes! www.ikat.org and www.penniesforpeace.org. It's easier than reading this book!This book took me over a month to read! I felt like I was trudging up a mountain as I was reading! Greg Mortenson's story is great and inspiring, and he seems to have done wonderful work. As mentioned by other reviewers, Greg's story could have been told much better. There was just too much information, too many people to remember, just too much! Too much jumping around from here to there.I only read this book for my book club, and for no other reason. I admire Greg Mortenson for all of his work and stugggles to educate the poor children of Pakistan and Afghanistan. And if you read this book, you will too.Also, jeers to David Relin for the \\"dig\\" to Fox News in his acknowledgements! Oh come on! Cheap shot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing and a story drawn out for too long!","review":"I am in a bookclub, so when it was my turn choose a book, I asked some friends for recommendataions, and they told me that Three Cups of Tea was next on their list of books to read. None of them had actually read it, but they all indicated that wanted to read it. When I looked it up on Amazon, it sparked my interest. I have lived in the Middle East, I have climbed Kimimanjaro, and I am a teacher--it seemed to me that there would be no book that could better suit my interests and experiences. However, I was very disappointed. This book is poorly written and a story that could be inspiring is told with a painful about of detail. Although I am hosting the book club discussion this month, I couldn't finish the book. What more can I say? I do not recommend this book. Needless to say, I will tell my friends to save their time and money and read something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Read","review":"Greg Mortensen is so efficient with every single dollar that he should be running FEMA. Seriously, the main take away here than has not already been mentioned is that large government agencies, be they Pakistani or US (eg FEMA), pale in comparison to people like Greg when it comes to effcient use of charity dollars. He has the compassion, work ethic, and understanding of the culture in which he is operating to get the job done. No institution will ever match him on that. Which is why my charity dollars go to Mercy Corp and Heiffer Int'l, Seva, etc., and not quasi gov't agencies like the Salvation Army and Red Cross (do you know what they pay their regional directors!!$$) Keep up the great work Greg. You are on my list now."},{"rating":"1","title":"great story, pitiful writing","review":"I wish Greg Mortenson had come to me to write this book. I could have saved him thousands of superfluous adjectives. He is built up to be a hero for our times....perhaps he is, but David Oliver Relin's prose is so sickening and (to a fellow aspiring writer) embarrassing that the reader wishes to be done with the story ASAP. Save the money from buying the book and instead send it to Greg's charity, the Central Asia Institute, or Pennies for Peace. You can get the book free at your local public library."},{"rating":"2","title":"I concur, a Nobel Peace Prize for Mortenson","review":"I just finished the book and I have been electrified by the passion for his Purpose that Mortenson lives.

But for those of us still wandering around the mountain in the fog wondering just what we are supposed to do with this life, he is an inspiration and a vivid demonstration of what just one person can do in this world.And Kudos to him and Relin for writing the story so well.

I don't have much to write as others have already done great reviews. I want to say that part of the book's intent is to convey that education for remote areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan is essential in reducing/preventing extremist sects. However, I think is it also essential for the rest of the world to read this book as education on the importance of these values and as a great look into an insider's view of the culture in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

It was more an overview of the process of acquiring money and resources to build schools for girls in the mountainous northern part of Pakistan. It emphasized the dangers of the Madrassas Schools in this part of the world as an agents for terrorist. I wished there had been more about his relationship with the students for whom the schools were developed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing story, badly in need of an editor","review":"I don't seem to have enjoyed this book as much as most other people, the writing just seemed to get more tedious as the book went on. It would have been an absolute gem at 240 pages. But at 350+ it was badly in need of an editor. That said, it was still good enough to make my top 3 books of 2006, and my top 20 of the decade. Greg Mortenson is an inspiration, and his story and the plight of the Balti people should be known to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Night stand coaster","review":"This book sat on my night stand for several months, Thank goodness I never got around to reading any of it now that it has been shown to be a work of mostly fiction motivated by greed.

Read Jon Krakauer's book, \\"3 Cups of Deceit\\" to find out the truth. Don't spend money on Mortenson's book-he just pockets the proceeds (according to Krakauer) with none of it going to help build schools."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathological liar","review":"I always thought Mortenson's kidnapping story was far fetched, and now feel validated that my gut reaction to that part of the book was spot on. Reality is indeed stranger than fiction -- the reality being that Mortensen can and did conjure up a magnificient lie and nearly got away with it. Not only does he do a disservice to the children he supposedly wanted to enlighten, he may have thwarted the success of other current and future international foundations that help the most underserved in this world by casting doubt on what foundations actually do, thereby turning donors away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book About Being Good","review":"Greg Mortenson has devoted his life to building schools in small villages in Pakistan and Afghanistan. In Three Cups of Tea, Mortenson tells his incredible story in a simple, direct and matter-of fact way. Mortenson does not preach, nor does he brag about his accomplishments. He does not claim to have changed the world, nor does expound on important it is to bring education to the poorest among us, especially in the region where he works. Mortenson is the opposite of an ideologue. He is the agnostic son of Christian missionaries, working among Muslims, but none of that seems important to him. He seems driven to address concrete needs of specific people, without worrying about their religion or politics. He deals with the here and now, in the most concrete and honest way. His story is an important one, and well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"a story worth hearing, but...","review":"I just finished reading this book. I was energized and inspired by such an incredible story about such a remarkable man. Moreover, the book reveals a lot about the situation in Pakistan and Afghanistan and the US's involvement with it. I think it's important for Americans to read the book for this reason, so they can see this harsh reality through Greg's eyes. What he is doing for the children of this region is promote peace is truly laudable.That said, I found the book to be very poorly written. Verbose, confusing at times, and frankly a little arrogant in its tone, this book was almost painful to read. It's really a shame that Relin did Mortensen's tale such a disservice."},{"rating":"2","title":"How A normal guy has changed the course of not just his life but countries","review":"I started reading this book expecting to see some action as it mentioned about how a mountain climber would build schools in a hostile environment. But as I kept reading, I found an amazingly compassionate person who was one among us but a determination to do what he felt was right. No matter when or where. A must read for every person who has similar interests or would want to help people who are less privileged. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lesson in character","review":"This book is a recounting of an outsider that assimilates into a culture in which he does not, at first glance, fit by building relationships with people based upon trust, honesty and truthfulness. The people of Pakistan see him as a leader not because he is charismatic or an efficient planner. While he has those traits as well, the relationship Mr. Mortenson builds with the people of Pakistan is more so built up because the people can see that he exemplifies a man of integrity and an open character. The book sharply contrasts this to various unsavory characters that Mr. Mortenson meets a long the way.I am inspired by the type of person Mr. Mortenson is as much as by what he has accomplished. Men accomplish great things all of the time, but those that one remembers must have both accomplishment and character.This book is eloquent and beautifully told. I strongly suggest that others find the time to read it. Maybe we will all learn to slow down... one second at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars, only just","review":"I felt like giving this book only 3 stars, however, given the great story that it is, i thought it deserved 4. The books only downfall was the author. I struggled to keep reading it,even by 70 pages, i was struggling to find the motivation to continue because of the over done language and sentences the author would produce. Half the time i had no clue what he was even talking about, especially when many of the terms that were used in the book were never explained. This continued to bug me throughout the book. Also, the author seemed to carry on as if he was writing about a magical mythical story about a unicorn that danced around in a paddock full of daisys in some far far away place.All in all, great story, slighty ruined by the authors over dramatisations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogant and aloof","review":"Was given this book by a family member who raved over it. I just couldn't understand what he saw in it. Mortenson is portrayed as self-aggrandizing and aloof, and as a horrible provider for his family...married to his work and severely neglectful of his wife and children.As for the writing, much too florid and unbelievable...actually casts doubt that the story is even completely true.If this book was meant to be a fund raising element for the CAI (to get the story published, as stated in the book), I am not sold. If I were Greg Mortenson and if I were a truly good person, I would be embarrassed to have been portrayed in this manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is there totally no introduction and chapter 1 in my book?","review":"Im sure the book is fantastic, but when I open the book, there is no chapter 1, the first page is chapter 2 page 17, so I am wondering where did the first 16 pages go?"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a bore","review":"Although this book does have a good message-all 300 something pages are like reading a theasaures.

He faced both cultural and financial barriers and over came. A Persian poet says: Put step in the way, And the way will tell you how to go ahead. And Mortenson is a proof of how \\"the way\\" takes you ahead when you have a certain will but no clue how to proceed. It also shows how humanity stands far above all differences, be it cultural, lingual, religious ...The story telling is obviously not the best I have ever read. Thats why I rate it 4.

But when a book is labeled as non fiction the reader has a right to believe that the authors are presenting the best available version of the truth that they can.

Then I saw people saying the funds weren't used properly(something that was even hinted at in the book, because the main character does seem to have a hard time managing things...mostly alone).It got worse...I saw schools that were not in use and schools in dangerous enviroments.

Too bad the writing takes away so much from the incredible will & vision of this remarkable man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivates to want to help your cause","review":"I found this book more addictive the further I got into it. Going through the life of Mr. Mortenson's from the beginning of his search for his purpose in life (at the bottom), to his endless struggles with people trying to prevent the man from helping others, I found myself rooting him on. Throughout the whole book you cannot believe the problems that Mortenson goes through and he keeps coming back for more. I found that learning about the lives of the people in the small village in Northern Pakistan, that they had the environment that most people look for in a community. Even though they have no electricity, running water, or modern living places, they have family connections, human respect, and feeling of community that most look for. This book also show a good view of a Muslim community. The book made me want to pursue a life of helping the causes that I believe in."},{"rating":"2","title":"an inspirational title","review":"This book is quite an eye opener.You are fascinated by the sacrifices that the author is willing to endue to keep his promise and build a shool.

My problem with Mortenson was always that he seemed too good to be true. I wanted to believe in him but just couldn't buy into his simplistic solutions to problems that have plagued humanity for centuries. If 60 Minutes is correct, it looks like Mortenson is indeed \\"too good to be true\\" and the reality is that he is just another smooth talking con-man who told stories to get people to open up their wallets. So sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"understanding","review":"this is a book while true that sheds an enormous light--on the man and his quest and inner passions;on a country that defies the modern world; and a community that is profoundly traditional in its treatment of each other.well recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED purchase..","review":"Don't order from this source, I still have not received item in mail...will have to hope I can canel credit card purchase!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagine the world if we all had his drive","review":"I have bought four copies of this book and I share it with anyone that will read it. I may even buy a few more. I was awestruck when I read this book. It is countering fanatacism at every level and it shows the importance of understanding a personal relationships. The fact that his organization is educating children - boys and girls - in an area that is dominated by madrasses proves just how important those ties are. It is an incredible story of hope and strength that came out of what most would have considered total failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should read this book","review":"I believe this book should be read by everyone. Just as extremist \\"right-wing\\" Christians are often the most well-known and powerful Christians, so are the jihadists and extremists Muslims. I learned so much from this beautiful story--how one person can change the world, how not all Muslims are the ones we see in the news, how keeping our word as Americans is a stronger message than bombing a country and imposing our will (I mean, I already knew that, but the stories in this book showed HOW). I highly recommend this book to everyone!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Inspirational book","review":"I really loved this book and recommending it to all my family/friends. I keep thinking if I went through what he did I would quit out of lack of security in that part of the world.

I'm an international teacher who's done his 'very' little bit to improve some lives around the world through charity and action. Now I've read this and I hope that Greg Mortenson gets the Nobel Peace prize for what he has done and is doing. This is an uplifting book about peace and mutual understanding of cultures/religions leading to respect and things actually getting done - in this case schools being built in the most in hospitable parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan, to educate the many children, including girls, who have not had the chance to go to school. It brought tears at times, laughter at others, shock, awe and admiration.

I've been on the wait-list at the library for weeks and now I am wondering why. Although the story of Greg Mortenson is probably a wonderful adventure and most definitely from the heart, his chosen writer did not do him a favor. I completely lost it with the writing style or non-writing style making it sound more like prose than a non-fictional account of this man's journey. If one wants a great read about another incredible man, read \\"Mountains Beyond Mountains\\" by Tracy Kidderer/ the story of Dr. Paul Farmer. It's a great story as well as extremely well-written by a true journalist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book from beginning to end. I learned so much about the country of Palestine and was so impressed with the outstanding descriptions of the countrysides.

I tend to shy away from non-fiction, so reading this was a big change for me. The book was slow at times, & I wanted to give up more than once. I'm so glad that I didn't. It amazes me what Greg Mortenson has done to promote education in Pakistan & Afghanistan, especially for the girls who have not been allowed this luxury. A big change came for me after readingA Thousand Splendid Sunsby Khaled Hosseini & feeling that emotional connection with the women in Afghanistan & learning about the horribly demeaning way they were treated by many of the men & the Taliban. After finishing that book, my interest in Three Cups of Tea & the message it shared sky-rocketed, & I finished the book with a feeling of amazement & a longing to do something to help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Cups of Tea","review":"I Enjoy reading true stories, telling of people who do good things for people in need.

It is a true story of a man, Greg Mortenson, and the work he is doing building schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan. If you want to know what you can personally do to fight terrorism and also help educate children, read this book! Education is the answer!I have bought and given away 12 books - it is cheaper on Amazon than anywhere - and plan to continue to give this book to important people in my life. If you buy them through the Threecupsoftea website (which will send you to Amazon), part of the cost will go to scholarships for girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is just a book of lies...","review":"Like many of you I feel taken advantage of emotionally by Greg Mortenson.I wrote to his publisher and explained why they should pull the book and review his contract with them.Someone has to stand up and do the right thing.What I find so appalling stole money from those people who needed it most, the girls in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Yes, he built some schools, but he took credit for other schools he did not build and he left others just as out houses with no infrastructure - Books and Teachers. He did not do what he said he was going to do, and it appears that he lied on his taxes.He not only took advantage of our emotions, but he took advantage of the children of these extremely poor countries.Shame on you Greg Mortenson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring, Educational, Heartwarming!","review":"I was on the edge of my seat reading this book and could barely put it down.

This presented a far broader view of Muslims than what is portrayed in the media. A few right or left wing extremists in any religion, or political view can give a very unbalanced view (consider the Branch Davidians). It was refreshing to see the wisdom of the tribal leaders. It was also refreshing to see how some of them loved their daughters. As a woman, it is horrifying to see reports of men killing their daughters because of their refusal to submit to what can only be described as torture. I found Greg Mortenson to be an interesting person. I read between the lines, and saw how he truly felt more at home in Pakistan, than in Weatern culture. I recommend this book, and this is my first review, although I read a lot, so it must have inspired me. I plan on giving a copy to my local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful, Elucidating, Inspirational","review":"I bought this book expecting a light read with a bit of exotic travel thrown in. Was I wrong! This book offers profound background and insight into conditions creating one of the tragedies of our day: the growth of terrorism. But this heaviness is lightened by the amazing tale of what this man has been able to achieve to improve thousands of lives--both children's and adults'--amidst such despair. Simply stunning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puts FEMA, World Bank, International Aid Agencies to shame","review":"Greg Mortensen is so efficient with every single dollar that he should be running FEMA. Seriously, the main take away here than has not already been mentioned is that large government agencies, be they Pakistani or US (eg FEMA), pale in comparison to people like Greg when it comes to effcient use of charity dollars. He has the compassion, work ethic, and understanding of the culture in which he is operating to get the job done. No institution will ever match him on that. Which is why my charity dollars go to Mercy Corp and Heiffer Int'l, Seva, etc., and not quasi gov't agencies like the Salvation Army and Red Cross (do you know what they pay their regional directors!!$$) Keep up the great work Greg. You are on my list now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational and Educational","review":"This book is now my all time favorite read. Thought provoking and compelling! One man can and is making a difference in a region of the world that many Americans have heard about daily, but truely know so very little about. This book is the most enlightening, compassionate and inspirational story about the real people of Pakistan and Afghanistan. I thank the wonderfully gracious Muslims of these regions in their remote villages for teaching me, a Christian, so very much. It is a must read for all of America and should be placed on the reading lists of our high schools and colleges, so that this era of ignorance will end. Education, as Mortenson so professes, is the key to peace. Pick up this book and be moved by the power one mans heart and the difference we, as one individual, can make in the world. It leaves me asking \\"Where should I begin?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"A great book that is a very worth while read. Inspiring and hard to put down.

Read this book and be inspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every American should read this book!","review":"I had heard about this book as well as a few others about Pakistani or other Middle Eastern cultures. I am ashamed to say I didn't think I would enjoy reading these, or that I would connect in any way with books about people so far away from me. Boy, was I wrong! Now, I'm a Greg Mortenson \\"convert\\" and I really believe every American should read Three Cups of Tea. We can learn so much from Greg, and especially in these times of increasing terrorism acts, we must look for other solutions besides war. Guess what--Greg has the solution! Read it and you'll be a believer, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading","review":"This book gives you understanding as to how politics and religion works in Afganistan and Packistan.

Greg Mortenson's story of perservence, vision and selflessness should be required reading in our schools. It renewed my faith in the notion that one person can, in fact, make a difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questions","review":"I admired and respected Greg Mortensen as a man who did good work throughout Afghanistan because it was worthy and necessary work that not everyone is willing to take on. That was before 60 Minutes and the assorted questions over how much money has actually made it to his charity, the accuracy of the details contained within this book and Mortensen's own less than graceful responses, I cannot in good conscience support this book. Am I supposed to sit here highlighter in hand and mark x is fact oh I think he made up y etc. Greg Mortensen has not just disgraced himself, but has left many college professors who beileved so strongly in his message that they assigned it for their classes with egg on their face. Worse than that, what about all the people who donated their hard earned money to the cause because it matters to them. Mortenson has some major questions to answer here."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give it a 10 if I could!","review":"I have a list of all-time favorite books....this one just made my list! Heartwarming, bittersweet, motivating....all words I can use to describe the story I read. Puts perspective on what REALLY is important, what REALLY matters. The appreciation for education is so different than it is here in America...here it means status, wealth, or for some an excuse not to grow up from high school. In Afghanistan and Pakistan it takes on a new role: mind expansion, realizing your dreams, a way out. This story truly touched me and I HIGHLY recommend it! I parallel it somewhat to \\"Reading Lolita in Tehran\\".....the resistance that women who want to get an education face is heartbreaking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read that is to be shared with family and friends","review":"The story of what a dedicated individual with sound ideas and beliefs can accomplish by staying free of government influence and funding, told to the reader in compelling prose.

It sounds cliche to say that one person can change the world, but Greg Mortenson's story is simply beautiful. In an age where materialism reigns, and religious zealots terrorize from all sides, this book is about inspiration, love, and creating a meaning in one's life. A thoroughly uplifting read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"60 Minutes report reveals a big scam going on.","review":"A 60 Minute report has revealed Greg Mortenson is running a scam of sorts and that he made up being stranded in the initial village and also was never held hostage by the Taliban as he claims. Most of the donations are going to promoting his book rather than to the schools/children in Afghanistan. And some of the schools he has built are either poorly built or sitting idle/empty. During the report it is made quite obvious that Greg has had ample opportunity to respond to the allegations, over a year that 60 Minutes has been trying to get his side of the story actually, and Greg is refusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing story, but amazingly poorly written","review":"This is an inspiring story, and the region and its people need to be understood by Americans. However, the writing was so horrific that it was hard to tease out the inspiration and meaning though the torturous prose. Somewhere near the middle of the book, it appears that the editor gave up with toning down the author, and my boredom and frustration increased with every page. It seemed that every page contained grammatically incorrect sentences. I think that if Mortenson himself would have told the story then we would have really grasped his humility without being told over and over how humble Greg was. It is too bad that the poor writing of this story prevented the reader from really getting to know the people central to the region."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have worked better as a magazine article","review":"I have tremendous respect for what Mortenson has accomplished, but this book just has way too many tedious details to make for an absorbing read. Would have worked much better as a magazine article - long enough to describe Mortenson's achievements, but short enough to still be an interesting read. (spoiler alert!!) And when he left his pregnant wife to go to such a dangerous environment, I wanted to scream!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it is a fraude!!!!","review":"I only began to read the introduction and as I don t know the names of the people there are described, i googled and only then I knew that this story is a total fraude! Amazon should not sell this book. The author made money with his lies. He lied to everybody also to President Obama that gave him the amount of $100,000 from his Nobel Prize for his ONG. don t buy this book. the writer john Krakauser wrote a book \\"Three cups of deceit\\". He and the TV show 60 minutes affirm that he used the money from fundraising that supposed to be to build schools for enrich himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ego-maniac","review":"The story of what Greg Mortensen did is honorable, but this book was painful to read. I actually couldn't even finish it because I was so sick of hearing about how wonderfully perfect Greg Mortensen is. The entire book went on and on about how everyone who ever met him thought he was some sort of demi-god. My husband tried to force himself to read it on a cross-country flight, but he couldn't even finish it. I am amazed that so many readers fell into the \\"praise Greg Mortensen\\" trap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing.","review":"This is a MUST read.

I could barely finish the book and I rarely fail to finish a book (I did eventually slog through it, but had to skim in parts). It is truly unfortunate that this story was written by someone who seemed to have taken his cues from bad mystery novels or Harlequin romance novels. The prose was clunky, repetitive and at times laughable (particularly in the \\"romance\\" scenes between Greg and his wife). There are so many good non-fictions writers writing today, both in books and magazines, that it should have been easy for the publisher to find someone whose skills were up to the scope of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational!","review":"Difficult to put down, this is a beautifully written, gripping and inspirational read against a backdrop of immediate global social and political relevance. So inspirational in fact, that I immediately ordered several copies to distribute to key friends, colleagues and acquaintances. Affording insight to the humanity that provides the backdrop for the theatre that is the 'war on terrorism' whilst showing there is a far better way forward, this should be compulsory reading for every man, woman and adolescent in the western world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Cups of Tea - Excellent!","review":"I love this book. It was not just an enjoyable read, it introduced me so well to individual Pakistanis that I admire and care about them greatly. I so want to know how they and their villages are doing as a result of the current floods. Greg Mortenson's understanding of, deep respect and love for those of such a different culture is communicated so beautifully that it is not surprising that this book is being read in many classrooms and by the military. It has opened my eyes and my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a day off","review":"Go read this book. No, really, put down the internets, and go read this. This book is layers of inspiring: first, on how much a single person can have a huge positive effect on the world; second, how amazing and complex this corner of the planet is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story, Great Message, Poor Writing, Worse Editing","review":"This really is an amazing story that needs to be told and a message that needs to be shared in the main-stream-media. The power of CAI's mission and Greg Mortenson's personal journey are enough to carry the poorly written and edited book through the end. The author turned a GREAT 200 page message into an often tedius 340 page history of Mr. Mortenson's personal life history and attempt at great literature while detracting from the main subject. Then to help things along, the editors flat missed several grammar, tense, and personal pronoun gaffs.I would recommend that anyone read this book, but I would also recommend that the author and publisher condense and re-edit for a second edition.By the way, the website for CAI where you can make donations is: http://www.ikat.org/. You can find it in the book if you look hard. I would sugest including this website on the front or back cover of the next edition too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspiring what one man can accomplish (in his own mind)","review":"Mortensen's is a hero and his story needs to be told. His dedication and determination that kept him commited to builing schools is Pakistan and Afganiston is admirable. He lives his life making great sacrifices; as do all those who love him and want him in their lives.While his life is an example of a life well lived I do not think it is a practical solution for solving issues in that region of the world. There needs to be a greater focus on leadership and co-operation to unite the world.UPDATE:I gave the book 5 stars initially when I thought the story was completely true.I did wonder at the time about the accuracy. Could one man accomplish so much where many others have failed? he did all this with any organizaion in his life. More amazing while living out of his car at the time! A one man UN?. We may yet find out that like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny the Mortensen described in this book does not really exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Book Every American should read!","review":"Read and be inspired by the story of Greg Mortenson's many accomplishments in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Occasionally it seems a little sappy with all the life lessons learned.

He gives good insight into the culture of Afghanistan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Cups of Tea","review":"This is the book to read if you are looking for a little inspiration for the new year. You will find yourself rooting for this most unlikely of heroes who finds inspiration in the oddest of circumstances and turns his own failure into a passion that endures for years. Be prepared to be moved. Be prepared to be inspired. Be prepared to want to do something about it. This is not a spectator novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a read! What a story! What an inspiration!","review":"Three Cups of Tea is an insightful and inspiring story about Greg Mortenson, a quirky Berkeleyite-Himilayan mountain climber, who finds his calling in Iraq, building schools to educate children, especially girls, with the premise that educated women will change the world. The foundation he initiates in America, the family he has, the fundraising, the interaction with village elders, the hospitality and generosity extented to him, the politics of progress, and the effect his ideals, commtment, and determination have on this struggling nation are nothing short of miraculous. This book is more than a memorable read, it leaves a triumphant, lasting impression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraud","review":"Search for the 60 minutes interview and other articles about Greg Mortenson. He is accused of \\"embellishing\\" this story and using funds from his Central Asia Institute to promote and purchase copies of his own book (sending royalties back into his pocket). It is sickening not just to make up lies in the name of supposedly helping desperate people, but it is also very damaging to legitimate authors who want to write about their lives. Like James Frey he has done serious damage to anyone working on or interested in memoirs."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite book","review":"This book should be required reading for every person who fancies himself/herself qualified to be President. With all the political rhetoric flying about, two days before the New Hampshire primary, I'd like to hear ANYBODY in either party, discuss the \\"war on terror\\" in terms of Greg Mortenson's mission to build schools and educate the children in Central Asia.Imagine for an instant, if 1/10 of the money the US has squandered waging war in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq had been spent, instead, to build schools, and provide teachers' salaries instead of destroying villages and civilian lives, what a different kind of world we would share...Not to mention, the astronomic national debt our childrens' childrens' children will be left to pay off.This book is a revelation. It is a tremendous, profound adventure and it should be read by every teenager and adult in the United States!I am proud to know that the co-author lives in my hometown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly exciting and very timely","review":"Loved this book.

It is a powerful lesson of how small, nearly invisible steps can lead to big changes and profound differences in peoples lives. It is worthy reading and may change the life of the reader as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Education for ALL!","review":"EVERYONE should read this book. As an American educator I was enthralled by Greg Mortenson's story and his heroic efforts to bring education to the children, especially girls, of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Mortenson is a true hero, bridging cultural gaps to educate children and adults about the values of respect and hard work. He proves that education truly can bring peace to our world. Tell everyone you know to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Cups of Tea","review":"Wow!

I could not wait to find out what would happen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"This is a page-turner of a story, completely compelling - I stayed up half the night reading it. If you are intrigued with this region of the world, and would enjoy reading about a person who has found his passion in life and is making a difference, this is the book for you. Mortenson serendipitously runs into and draws into his life fascinating and ultimately very recognizable characters, from conservative mullahs to tribal warriors, women and young children. I think the point is that we all have similar goals: to make life better for our children and communities, to leave something good behind, to serve others, etc.- and that perseverance gets results. Especially poignant in light of 9/11 and the current politics in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing...should have been a magazine article","review":"Wow. Now that's some bad writing. Seriously.

The book is the story of how a mountain climber was converted to a Good Samaritan because he learned to listen to the people whose lives he sought to make better. He learned that working through and with the village elders, he could accomplish far more than by trying to impose his external values upon them. Knowing that this gentle American giant was willing to follow their customs and give them respect and love, the Pakistani and later the Afghan leaders made him a part of their family. Mortenson's story of building schools for girls in both frontier Pakistan and Afghanistan is the story of well placed aid and the development of friendship ensuring a positive view of America. Greg is truly an ambassador of good will for our country"},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Cups of Tea","review":"Greg Mortenson's book should be required reading for everyone. He is so dedicated to the poeples of Pakistan and Afghanistan and wants to make life better for them through education.

The second sentence on the first page misspelled gauges and wrote \\"fuel gages\\" that should have been a sign of things to come. Secondly, after considering it unreadable, I skipped through it and saw the author thought very much of himself and was the hero of his own stories. Life has taught me that such people are normally not being honest and are full of B.S., thus I dismiss this book as either partial fiction or complete fiction, either way, it is very poorly written and not worth the paper is is printed on. Students must have been forced to read this and told to give it a review at Amazon, it is the only way 350 pages of poo could be given anything but 1-star.

Together, with his wife Tara, Greg shows the importance of courage, determination, and support that guides them through whatever life brings to them.

A working knowledge of their interaction and differences would help a lot in our attempts to combat terrorism around the world and contribute to peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational, educational and great reading!","review":"This book makes you want to become a better person. It shows that one person CAN make a difference. Greg Mortenson, and many of those around him, devote their lives in making education possible for the children, especially girls, in Pakistan and Afghanistan. By empowering the children with education, Greg and his people are able to promote peace and fight terrorism in the world in a more effective way than war and violence. David Oliver Relin did a great job in retelling the story in an organized way and from different people's perspectives. All in all, a phenomenal book, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will appeal to everyone","review":"Wow, I just finished the book and have already told 5 people to read it. It appeals to both men and women. It has the unexpected power to cause you to look at your own life differently. The trials and tribulations that Greg Mortensen experiences seem almost unbelievable but in fact they are true and yet they are so humbly told by the author. A truly great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Cups of Tea","review":"The book gets its name from the tradition of having 3 cups of tea: The first cup you share with someone you are a stranger, the second an honored guest and the third cup you share, you are a member of the family.If you want to know the truth about 9/11, read this book. It tells how the Taliban used commerical flights and binoculars to pinpoint Americans,when Talibans lost radar. This is a story of one mans personal goal to promote peace thru education. It showed how he made a difference . It tells how Mortenson knew what our government did not know about the people in Afghanistan, Pakistan (middle east). It explains how President Bush got the Muslim world to hate Americans for the next 200 years! Also an emotional mission of peace. Greg Mortenson is like a male Mother Teresa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Condition","review":"Product was listed as \\"good\\" condition. When it arrived its pages were stained with what looked like coffee and had a warped cover. I don't consider this as good condition. This was a poor cared for item and a bad purchase. Yes, it was a bargain, but the discription was deceiving. I couldn't return it as the price for return was more than the book price!! Very disappointed!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst writing I've read in a long time","review":"You decide for yourself what you think about Mortenson. I think the subtitle of the book should be \\"How One Man Became a Dhimmi.\\"What I will say is that the writing of the co-writer is nauseating. It is the most frantically hysterical hagiography you'll ever see. \\"The crystalline daggers of the mountain ranges scratched their way like deranged fingernails into the howling wind of the overarching midnight blue ocean of the sky--the same sky that hung over the head of the ancient, proud, morally superior, but so horribly vulnerable people that Mortenson had left the despicable excesses of the United States and crossed the earth pennilessly to save before it was too late.\\"I made that sentence up but it is better than a lot of the sentences in the book. Read at your own peril."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never arrived","review":"This book has never been delivered to me!!!! Yet, my credit card has been charged. Please credit my card with the $10.+ that it was charged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on your lies!","review":"Shame shame on you for the lies you put down in this book and then NOT ONLY telling people it was true, but ASKING for MONEY. More money is spent on book expenses than charity. The author keeps all the income from book signing and the foundation pays the expenses. He said he was kidnapped, but he PAID the men to \\"PROTECT HIM\\" 60 MINUTES did a 7 month investigation and he REFUSED to speak to them. Shame on you!! Return the money to the American children you stole from.Set the record straight and do what you are supposed to with the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing True Story- easy to read and VERY Inspiring","review":"I was so touched and inspired by this man's story. Very well written by David Oliver Relin as told by Greg Mortenson. The underlying theme that although Greg Mortenson failed at climbing one of the highest mountains on earth, yet accomplished one of perhaps the hardest fetes~ connecting cultures in an angry world~ shines a ray of hope in all of our lives. The writing is easy to read. I learned some vocabulary from another world/culture, and that is always a good thing.But that ONE man or ONE woman can make a difference in the world is the most important aspect of this work.I would rec'd to anyone. Never give up hope, you can make a difference in the world. He did and his story deserves to be told!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!!","review":"To sum it up, an amazing book that shows the power of peace.No matter what your political orientation is, you cannot help but believe in the work that Greg Mortenson is doing. He truly is a hero, working to make the world a better place in a manner that helps, not hurts, humanity. This book was definitely worth reading; it not only edifies but entertains as well...I read it on the beach on vacation and could not put it down!PLEASE read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put the book down","review":"In the middle of packing for a move, I was given this book. I could not put it down: such focus, courage, fearlessness,adaptability, persuasive ability and, above all, skillful thought, speech and action in incredibly difficult circumstances. Such virtue truly tugged at the heartstrings. I often was on the verge of tears. Read this incredible story and tell others about it. Jonathan"},{"rating":"2","title":"three cups of tea","review":"This is an excellent non-fiction book. It was recommended to our entire group that supports education for women (American Association of Women)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and inspiring story!","review":"I found this book to be spellbinding. It reads like fiction, but is much better! It shows that one person can really make a significant difference in this world. Greg Mortenson is an amazing individual with guts. He travels to some of the most remote and dangerous places in the world to promote peace through education. His idea of fighting terrorism by fighting ignorance is on point. If we educate young men women, we can begin to take out the underpinnings of terrorism in Islamic countries. Truly an inspiration. I would recommend this book to everyone and think that it should be required reading in high school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most encouraging true story I have ever read","review":"The story of Greg Mortenson's work to bring education to the tribal regions of Pakistan and Afganistan is the most encouraging story I have ever read. While the media relentlessly discourages us with news of all that is wrong in that part of the world, Mortenson gives us a view from personal experience on the ground with the regular people of the region. They turn out to be just like people all over the world, and just like us in America -- loyal to family and community, welcoming of people who treat them as equals, and dreaming of a better life for their children.You cannot read this book without feeling more hopeful for the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A read for everyone","review":"I really enjoyed this book & think that everyone should read it just to get another view of the conflicts that have been going on for many years. It opens ones eyes to realize what the inhabitants of the country must endure. The work & endurance of Greg Mortenson is most inspiring. Peace to all of these people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Cups of Tea","review":"This book is inspires us to struggle to be our best and gives us a chance to support someone who has already won his struggle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, dull","review":"I was shocked to see the ratings as well. I read more than half the book and it is VERY boring. I can't even finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 Cups of Tea...thoughtful and thought provoking","review":"To read this book is important for those that seek a better understanding of the peoples and their beliefs that are in headlines of our daily news. The cities and countries...Afganistan, Kabul, Pakistan, Baltistan all names so foreign to us become real on the pages of this book. The dedication of one man to change the world by educating one child at a time one school at a time. Really a remarkable story. I volunteer my time to a non-profit after school program called HEART proyouth that shares the same ideals that Mr. Mortenson supports. Our children are in our communities in the Central Valley of California. Our mission is the same to bring change through education. Keep children out of \\"gangs\\". Teach then that they have choices. Our children whether here or across the water are all of our future."},{"rating":"1","title":"three cups of greed","review":"apparently there is little that is true in this book. Its sad to read the many older, pre scandal reviews where people glow that their faith in humanity has been restored and that they now believe again that one man can make a difference. It doesnt get much lower than stealing lunch money from schoolchildren to pay for lear jet rides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regardless of the media, this guy is self-absorbed","review":"beyond any level I've ever known. First of all the book features a lengthy preface explaining how wonderful Greg is. Then when the book starts, you soon realize the author is writing about himself, but IN THIRD PERSON! that made me chuckle at first, but then really sad when I realized I'd spent $9 on a book written by a prude, self-centered and egotistical Western man. He ventures to remote Afghan-Pakistan border regions to engage with people on the most superficial way, very reminiscent of the whole pathetic \\"new age\\" condescending dilettantism in the way he seeks to \\"bring cultures together\\" through education. The saint comes to rescue Afghan children from eternal ignorance!This is a lousy attempt at very corny fiction, and a very pathetic attempt at non-fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this book still has so many stars","review":"I loved this book; I didn't want to believe that the stories in it were faked. But the evidence is too strong; the residents of that first village deny rescuing a lost and freezing Mortenson, he was never kidnapped, and nothing happened as he described it. My children's school raised money for Mortenson's foundation, and now we know that money didn't go for school supplies after all. Nor do profits from this book benefit Pakistani schools - money doesn't flow from this book to the foundation, it flows outward from the foundation to fund the PR for Mortenson's books and travel. We've all been had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Cups of Tea","review":"This story is incredible and inspiring. It should be required reading for all high school students and anyone in college majoring in political science! It should also be sent to any and all government officials who are making our foreign policies. Think how much better our world would be if we educated people rather than killed them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mortenson Should Be Prosecuted for Fraud","review":"It is so sad to see how Mortenson lied about the people helping him and used money meant for schools for himself. What is most disturbing is how many people are still trying to cover for him. The gig is up. Read \\"Three Cups of Deceit\\" by Jon Krakauer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"This is an outstanding and well-written account of one person's efforts to truly make the world a better place.Step by step we follow as Mortenson combats frustration and multiple roadblocks to fulfilla goal he has set for himself and a promise made to people in dire need of hope.During these days of 'endless war', Mortenson shows us a way in which we 'little' peoplecan dedicate ourselves to peace and friendship, to building understanding of others and ourselves.To people like Mortenson are due the recognition, prestige, and honor provided by the Nobel Peace Prize."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am lost for words!","review":"This book is a testament of the wonders genuine intent and determination can do for you. It is simply amazing how Greg is able to navigate his way through these regions making us realize that the APPARENTLY volatile regions are not only a mere media projection but also the most beautiful places to visit in the world!People who are debating whether to purchase this book or not...This book not only inspires us to want to make a meaningful difference in developing countries, but also teaches us important lessons of tolerance, compassion and justice. A truly amazing and nerve-gripping story indeed!I too, vouch for this man to win the nobel peace prize one day.For all those other silicon valley pioneers, investment bankers, oil tycoons, and most importantly the US govt, get a grips on your sanity and support Greg Mortenson's cause!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extreme Inspiration!!","review":"Often I spend my time thinking about how much I would love to have the courage to just sell all my personal belongings and head off to a place like Korphe where I know people are in desperate need of our help. Greg Mortenson has done it, and with complete dedication and sacrifice. I like to believe that all across America there are plenty of people just like me, yearning to get off their couches and help someone in need. This book is the page that's been missing to direct us to unite and do something about poverty and education. Greg Mortenson and David Oliver Relin have created an inspirational masterpiece. Three Cups of Tea is the most amazing story of a man who has given his all to change a part of the world for the better. If you want to be completely inspired then you need to read Three Cups of Tea today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake","review":"Sometimes one reads a book that is too good to be true...and more often than not, if not identified as \\"fiction\\" the book does turn out that way. Such is this...with the recent revelation, on many levels of falseness by the author(s) this book cannot be taken seriously. I am personally offended to learn that hired guides for an expedition are portrayed in the book AND in photographs as terrorists captors. I think it no coincidence that the title reminds us that con men use three tea cups for the old \\"shell game.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"For them - schools and opportunities; For us - starbursts of hope","review":"Compassion, determination, resilience, love - critics don't often rate a book for these attributes, but readers will carry these stories into their conversations and thoughts and lives. A book for times when it's so easy to see no causes for hope. A book for times when you need to see the faces of compassion and joy. Follow the recommendations for action at the end of this hope filled book. Donate, write a review, pass on to a friend or your library. I heard about this book on Saturday and finished it today. This afternoon I will pass on to a friend who I know will read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best non fiction read in a long time","review":"This story of Greg Mortenson and his dream to educate girls in Pakistan is nothing short of a miracle in action. Looking into Gregs childhood early on in the book you can see that he was destined to do something great. Follow in his fathers footsteps to a degree!The detail when Greg was in the thick of the American retaliation on the Taliban is most interesting.Other than Greg being a hero to so many needy people, I can not help but shower respect and admiration on the hero behind the scenes, Tara his wife. From what I can tell, if it wasnt for Tara and her understanding of Gregs quest there may have been times when any lesser man would have given up. Greg Mortenson is a hero to all mankind and one day it will show across the world just how important his work is.\\"Three cups of tea\\" is a must read,if not to be inspired, to see that a gesture to the needy no matter how big or small goes a long way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think outside the \\"Cup\\"","review":"If you have ever wondered if you can do anything to change the world, this book is for you. This is a story of a man, who against all odds, has softened the hearts of those who would not want his mission of education in the war torn areas of the middle east to succeed. I read the book in one evening/night and enjoyed the joy, heartbreak, and sadness that is mentioned. I look forward to updates as the years progress."},{"rating":"2","title":"My best Christmas present","review":"This has given me a whole new perspective on what I have been led to believe about what is going on in that part of the world. This is a story of an amazing man and how kindness, passion for a cause and perseverance can change lives and the way we view those who are different from us. If everyone who reads this book contributes $100 to the CAI's efforts, wouldn't we all be better for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Cups of Tea","review":"I bought this book but wished I hadn't. The writing is just awful! It is so badly written that it was hard to bother reading the book all the way through. It feels like it was written by people trying to blow their own trumpets but with a severe lack of writing skills. It gets the thumbs down - don't waste your money, folks. Other people have built schools and written better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"This was a book club book and of the 7 members not one person liked this book. Over half the group didn't even finish it. We couldn't figure out what all the hype was over this book as we have all heard rave reviews. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Perhaps much of my disappointment was due to the fact that this book had excellent reviews on Amazon. Typically I find these reviews accurate and almost always enjoy books listed in the What Other Books Customer Bought section. I was so excited to read this book only to be majorly disappointed about 1/3rd of the way into it. It is a \\"played out\\" genre, slow and overly detailled about unimportant things. I was hoping one person in our book club liked it so I could see the magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the few books I couldn't finish..","review":"I was so excited to begin reading this book. After all, it was rated so highly by so many sources. I read half of the book and stopped. I found it to be boring and the writing was dull and unimaginative. What a disappointment. I think this story could have been told in a much more readable way. As a librarian, I make it a point to finish all books, no matter how difficult it may be. With this one, I couldn't keep going. I just became disinterested and could not make myself read until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much information","review":"The basic story of the goal to educate so many children is inspiring.BUT the author is in love with WORDS - he describes every rock in Afganistan! Too much detail in describing the journeys made bringing supplies into region.

This book is entertaining, educational and inspiring and I encourage everyone to read it. It's an easy read, but I had a lump in my throat the entire way through from the sadness I felt for the hardships of the people he helped and from the amazing way one man was able to make such a huge difference. This book is a must-read for so many reasons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helping the Poor","review":"Usually I avoid best sellers like the plague. However, I had a number of people recommend Three Cups of Tea to me because of volunteer work that I do with Heifer International. I found Three Cups of Tea to be very inspiring. There are other non-profits out there that do great work using holistic, culture-sensitive methods, much like the CAI. However, few have leaders like Mortenson - a man who is completely (date I say neurotically?) immersed in his work. I would hold his work up as a great example of how one person can truly make a difference in this world. The book is a quick and easy read, yet it is very moving. I highly recpmmend this book and will pass it on to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"hopefulness","review":"3 Cups of Tea, offers hope for humanity.

Every time I would sit down to read it I would find myself dozing off to sleep! Not only was this book something people would read if they had sleeping problems, because once you opened the book you would already be asleep, but many things in this book turned out to not be true.

I recommend this book to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a life changing book","review":"I have recommended (and given) this book to many of my friends and all three of my book clubs. Some people found the beginning a little tedious but I did not. I enjoyed the background material and have decided that, when I grow up (I'm already 52), I want to be Greg Mortenson. I admire him and think his wife must be a saint. I learned a lot, and more importantly, felt a lot while reading this book. It is very inspiring. As Americans, we have so much to learn before we offer to help."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Education I've Ever Recieved About Our Muslim Friends","review":"If you want to understand what the real peace and character is of our Muslim friends, read this book.

All their cds are higly enjoyable, fresh sparkling, very original strings arrangements, a unique sound you cant miss to love.This cd is a sampler but all they did is worth.This Beatles covering is a must, I was lucky to buy everything when prices were affordable, now they are simply absurd.

The arrangements are fantastic, and I can say the same for this CD.Though there are some other really good songs that it has omitted, there are enough good tracks to satisfy any Beatles fan and even satisfy anyone who does not like the Beatles.In short, this album will make you want to hear more of the Hollyridge Strings. Hopefully, more will be released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"I have found that the Hollyridge Strings produced some of the most beautiful reditions of popular selections.

If you are looking for a soft pillow this is not for you. I found it to be quite supportive in the office chair I use when I work at home. The chair is large and has a high back. The elastic strap just barely fits around the back of this chair. Perhaps an adjustable elastic strap would be a better choice for the manufacturer of this cushion. I needed something that would actually provide more support in this chair and push me forward and straighter. It does that. It is made with a white urethane dense foam and has a backer board inside also, so its firm. The cover zips off. For some reason mine came with the gray cover looking like it had been squashed into a bag (very wrinkled) prior to placing it on the cushion. Someone else mentioned an odor. Mine had a mild odor that was not bothersome. After 2 days it is already quickly fading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"I did not like this product. It was uncomfortable to use.

It does fit on a couple of small chairs, but even if I wanted to use it on them, it won't stay \\"up' but slides down to rest on the seat. I need it to be 4 or 5 inches above the seat.

It has you sitting an easy 6 inches closer to the wheel or, right in another persons back if you are in the back of the car. Also there is a wood stabilizer in the back (removable where the zipper is) that floats around in there and is not secured. The piece of wood or particle board, hardens one sidde or the other making the cushion awkward and uncomfortable. I find myself adjusting it compulsively. Also the strap is not long enough to stretch around my car seat. Feels good when watching a movie, if you like to have perfect posture in the living room. I do like how the wings are long on each side. This feels like a hug, and in the car it keeps my torso from swaying with every turn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seat size may make it unsafe to drive","review":"The placement of the Bac prevents the safe operation of the vehicle by the operator.

I have purchased it to fix my posture due to heavy PC usage. We do have ergonomic chairs in the office maybe that is the reason why this didnt really fit well. First of all it requires the back part of the chair to be one piece all the way down to the seat. My chair has a small open area between the seat and the back part of the chair so the straps do not hold well. Second this is too thick and when i put this ,i do not have enough room for my legs on the seat. I feel like i am sitting half way in the chair.

The one that worked for me is found on Amazon as well: AutoLogix 5834 Ortho Lumbar Wedge Seat Cushion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wings","review":"The cushion is pretty hard. The elastic band doesn't fit well around a large office chair. Also, the cushion has wings on the sides of the pillow that makes it hard to sit in a chair that has some contour of it's own. It doesn't work well for larger people since it is not as wide in the center (between the winged edges). I'm going to return it and get one without the angles of winged edges."},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF CRAP!","review":"How this back \\"cushion\\" has such high ratings is a mystery to me, it really is a poor product that is nothing as advertised. Rather than support my back, it gave me pain. I didn't even open the packaging and I could feel the cardboard as soon as I rested my back into it. You can also totally feel that piece of cardboard by just touching the back of it and the cardboard wasn't even set in place. Brought it to my car to give it a try and it totally didn't fit since the sides of the driver's seat is curved. Definitely not meant for the driver's or shotgun seat, maybe the back passenger seats. Either way, it is not a cushion in any way and absolutely does not provide any back support. You'll probably get more back pain than prevent it.

I thought the story was unconvincing, in particular the story of Luke. With the exception of Father Ralph's character (and the new Meggie's character) the acting is dull and uninteresting. Fee's character is most disappointing! Her intrepretation of the character leaves much to be desired. Whoever wishes to learn about the \\"missing years\\" should simply refer to the novel,The Thorn Birds, by Colleen McCullough.You will not be harmed by viewing this DVD, of course - and might be delighted, as I was, to see the gifted and handsome Richard Chamberlain on the screen once more, but I would recommend sticking to the original series, your own imagination, and the novel. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years","review":"I am speaking only of the TV movie. It was awful!! Without Rachel Ward, it rated a big ZERO. Father Ralph died in the 4th video, so having him appear again was absurd. Whoever played Meggie could not even begin to hold a candle to Rachael Ward, so the entire movie was, to me, a big flop. The original was just wonderful & you are right. They should have left the movie & the music alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent attempt, should have left it.","review":"Sad how the original composer Henry Mancini had passed on earlier before this film was made. Unfortunately they should have left both the movie, and the music alone. Not only was the music tampered with due to the fact that a new composer was needed, but they shouldn't have tampered with the original scores, and as for the movie it was just completely off track from the actual storyline and original miniseries.An interesting movie to watch for pure amusement to how they altered it, but the cd just isn't the same with original scores altered."},{"rating":"2","title":"delightful in it's own way","review":"The Missing Years is unforunately considered an unwanted ba$tard child among most Thornbird fans. That's really too bad IMHO. I happen to be one of Thornbird fans who found likes the Missing Years a great deal. It's not up to par with the original (few sequels ever are), but I honestly believe that it deserves more credit than it gets. I've enjoyed The Missing Years numerous times on VHS and I'm very happy it is on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Circular File","review":"I'm not going to get verbose like some, I'll just say that this should have never been done. I'm surprised that Richard Chamberlain would have stooped to acting out such bad writing! Father Ralph beating up Luke O'Neill in a fist fight? Come on!The writing was bad, the acting was worse. If I could have given it negative stars I would have. I debated watching it until the end; but I endured every painful minute and it's in my circular file now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace!","review":"This is a disgrace to the original and thank God Rachel Ward & CO had the sense and taste to stay away from this crap!

In the \\"Missing Years\\" disaster, most of her lines are about God. Did that bother anyone else?Also, I'm sure they went through hundreds of boys to portray young Dane. A red head???? He looked nothing like the Dane in the original. Luke at least tried to express himself as Bryan Brown did but Meggie??? She just did her own thing.Rachel Ward has a very distinctive voice. It's called acting. If you can't portray someone who was so vividly remembered, then you didnt succeed in making the audience feel they were really watching the missing years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorn Birds 2 (Missing Years)","review":"Awesome show loved it!!!

Yes...you can make parrallels to early 90s indie bands, but does it really matter? The Beatings do there own thing, which is completely distinct from anything anyone else is doing at the moment.This album is a complete \\"tour de force\\" (AS THEY CALL IT IN THE OLD COUNTRY). From the very \\"minimalistic\\" opening tacks (notice the excess of quotation marks around that completely overused term, which really means nothing anymore) to the final swirl of feedback, the album is a winner.

It was even more of a privilege to read about and experience the person himself. The book is beautifully written, and a moving journey to share. I will continue to look forward to seeing his stage work, and hope that there will be another book sometime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tricky part of The Tricky Part","review":"By the grace of God we end up closer to God through trials, tradgedy, even sexual abuse. This premise of the book is true. Being a Catholic myself, I find Moran's treatment of his Catholic past humorous, insightful, and respectful. The tricky part of The Tricky Part for me is Moran's homosexuality.Bob, the man that abused Moran, said he made his peace with God.So by the grace of God, even this perpetrator draws closer to God through his sin. What many fail to see, and the writer is unable to convey, is that by the grace of God, in particular through Jesus Christ, one can turn from same sex relationships and begin a new life. Homosexuals have a tremendous opportunity for an abundance of God's grace. The trickiest part may be making this next leap of faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exhaustively naive","review":"Davis just plain misses the point. Let's be clear: I didn't say Davis didn't throughly examine the subject as a historian; I said he missed the point -- right over the head, so-to-speak. Just as the Bible says that God is revealed and understood through faith, not scientific or historical evidence Davis has evidently attempted to examine the \\"intent\\" of the founders through \\"secular eyes.\\" Since the Bible also says we humans have only two choices available (regardless of opinion on the matter).

I waited years to find a good deal on it rather than pay for a very expensive import. I am surprised this one is not more widely known or available through MP3 downloads. In my humble opinion this is one of Barbieri's best. It is a brilliant, soulful, uptempo jazz statement that easily bridges the gap between BeBop and Latin Jazz. It evokes memories of Coltrane's 'A Love Supreme', and is also grittier than Barbieri's own 'Caliente'. I wish I had a better music vocabulary and greater knowledge of 20th Century jazz so I could more aptly fit this album into its proper place. I hope you get a chance to purchase it or at least give it a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"No details on NATIVE XML DBs???","review":"Interesting that you basically ignore native XML DBs.

It was all about finding your true self. The end was very well done and left real no questions about how the Rhapsody would spend the rest of her life doing. Great character development even at the end of the book lead me to believe that Haydon knew what she was doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know why I bothered","review":"The only reason I finsihed this trilogy is that I'd allready bought the book and hate to leave things unfinished. The ending to the symphony of ages can be predicted if you read the first book. All good things come to Rhapsody (and i do mean all good things-its stupid that she become queen of that many people so fast) and Ashe. This book is predictable, boring, and written like an outline despite its eminse length. This is not a good epic fantasy, its a bad, long winded, mary sue-ish fanfiction type story. You get the feeling this story was the authors fantsay for years and she had to write it down and publish it. I'm not going to even bother with the next trilogy by this author.If you like the general tone of these books, try Dawn Cook's Truth series for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I finally finished it!","review":"After more than TWO weeks of tedious reading, I was finallly able to finish this most boring book of a not-that-good series. The caracters are over-devolep (if such a thing is possible), the story has so many gasp you can't really make any sense out of it and the story telling is so un-compelling that I don't really understand why anyone should really like this book. If you want great fantasy reading, try George, RR Martin, or the new novels of those great author: Weis and Hickman, or even Robbin Hobb, but don't bother with these series.I just wanted to state my opinion, given the absurd number of stars people were granting these books. (Specially this last one, the worst by far)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turner","review":"The first of a vibrant series of page turners- you'll want to read the whole series as the next adventure starts when the book you're reading is just coming to a close. colorful characters, plenty of adventure, a dash of magic and mystery, and prophecy to keep you guessing. A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Dumb","review":"I kept putting the book down because the story was so boring and stupid! I finally finished it, though, after getting stuck in an airport.This started out as a good series, but this book is terrible. Everthing is so staged. The author tries to create suspense but the plot is boring, shaky and incredibly predictable.This book might be good for young teens, girls especially. This doesn't come close in any way to the great George Martin books. I'd leave Rhapsody on the shelf if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing finale","review":"Despite the quality and ingenuity of the two novels that preceded this one, Destiny: Child of Sky definitely did not fulfill the promise of the trilogy. Too often, the progress of this book was impeded by irrelevant and unnecessary attention to the romance between Ashe and Rhapsody to the point where the reader was left wondering if in fact he had picked up a romance novel and not a book of the fantasy genre. In addition, the writer seems to go out of her way to create a mythic figure of Rhapsody, rhapsodizing (no pun intended) on and on about her multitude of virtues. For her to be the most beautiful creature in the world, the crowned queen of the Lirin and the Lady Cymrian seems to be pushing even the limits of fantasy. In my opinion, it would have helped if she had been written as a more realistic character. I agree that Miss Haydon does have much promise but this novel definitely does not evidence it."},{"rating":"1","title":"good... if you're looking for a romance novel.","review":"I orginally picked up this series because I thought it was fantasy, with a little bit of a love story thrown in. Turns out, it's a romance novel with a fantasy setting. I despise the 'perfection' of the main character, as well as Ashe's (and everyone else's) obsession for her. I find Rhapsody's perfection only to be evident in that the author tells us it is so, rather than Rhapsody's actions. She is quick tempered and judgemental, and feels she is always justified in her opinions and actions.It's a shame that the series ended up like this. I enjoyed the first book enough to buy the next two books at the same time. I didn't expect the plot to be overshadowed by Rhapsody's rather obnoxious relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"In Destiny, Elizabeth Haydon brilliantly concludes the trilogy begun with Rhapsody and Prophecy. She creates a fascinating world with compelling characters, magic, puzzles, plot twists, humor, and marvelous writing. If Rhapsody in places was a trifle slow, then Destiny more than makes up for it with almost non-stop action. The ending is immensely satisfying: All loose ends are tied up, all prophecies explained, and yet there is the veriest hint of what future books could contain, which in no way detracts from the conclusion.A suggestion: Reread (or read) the first two installments before you read the third. Immersing oneself completely in this world for a few days adds immeasureably to the pleasure Destiny provides.Bravo, Elizabeth! Give us more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying loyalty","review":"The heroine's loyalty to a family that she knew cared nothing for her and gave her beatings if she didn't fall in line with their plotting was a source of constant irritation for me. Hard to sympathize with a character who is so spineless --- however realistic such a character would be given the times. I'd rather read about the one in ten thousand that wasn't a brainwashed wimp and took crazy chances to rebel. Synopsis from back of the book:It was a time of unrest and dissension. A Protestant queen sat on the English throne, facing the threat of King Philip of Spain, who plotted an invasion of English shores. In the midst of all this strife was Maria Elena, an innocent Spanish girl torn between allegiance to her family and love for a British sea captain.

We have a dozen of these and only use them for 2 or 3 meals at Christmas each year. The glasses are only handwashed, and never go in the dishwasher. After 2 seasons, almost all have the red paint flaking off. After the first Christmas (only 3 washings) a few were flaking already. Thinking these were defective, we bought an additional set of 4. Now, after another Christmas and 2 more washings, even those are flaking.

The first time we used the glasses the little red berries started sliding around the outside of one of the glasses from the condensation on the glass during use. After the first use, I was careful not to let the glass soak in the dish water and the paint still just fell right off the bottom when my husband rinsed the glass. I would think that they could have found a paint that would stay on better than this. I've done painting on glasses with glass paint from the craft store and it will even hold up in a dishwasher.

You can quickly begin to learn which chakra you might be blocked at and actually physically do something about it.

For anyone going through a time of transformation, test or is stuck in an emotional past this will support you noon else could.More than words I recommend to experience these exercise for those who a curious (even though I would first recommend one of the other DVD's of Ravi&Ana;).

The zombies aren't particularly scary, just rather annoying.I also hate having other people following me around. They get in my way, and I am responsible for their well-being. I'd rather just look after myself.The biggest downside for me was the length of time between scenes loading. It takes a ridiculously long time just to load a single room. Once you leave that room, the previous area has to be loaded again as well.Overall, this game just wasn't worth it.

But this is where the game pulls apart from others games in its genere. With the ability to become a zombie and use eveyday thing in to peolong your life span really brings in the noton of teamwork and the ability to cooridate and exploits each others skills and abilities in order to achieve the ability to complete ebey scerino.

Each page has a photograph of the named/signed animal and a drawing showing how to do the sign. I'd give it 5 full stars if they had a photo of a child doing the sign. On the other hand, the books that do that use two pages for each word, so I guess this way you get more words. The words:cat, kitten, dog, puppy, mouse, bunny, bird, turtle, fish, frog, duck, cow, horse, pony, lamb, pig, squirrel, bear, elephant, monkey, lion, tiger, camel, alligator, spider, snakeSince we have chickens, I wish they'd done that sign.

The first section does such a great job of providing an overview of the basic features, and then the rest of the book serves as a great drill down into each feature area. Throughout the book Chris lets his fun personality shine through, making the book very enjoyable to read.I highly recommend this for anyone that wants to learn about Windows Forms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource...Great Read","review":"I have a lot of technical books that are purely \\"shelfware\\" and few that I've read cover to cover. I've read this book cover to cover and am starting over again to make sure I didn't miss anything. Even though I've developed in .NET and C# for over 2 years, this book has brought numerous time savings and good coding practices to my attention. I've recommended this to others in my development teams and they are equally impressed.There are definitely elements for programmers new to .NET as well as seasoned pros. Topics are short and to the point with well written example code."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reasons to sell more Sells","review":"I run a very small software development business and transitions in development paradigms are a serious matter for us. I have been working with MFC for many years and I am just starting to re-implement some of our software stock. I decided to take the C# route rather than fudging the MFC version. I have purchased about $1500 of books for my library in the last year. Each transition, I find that there are lots of books that provide endless detail and very little by way of explanation, and if you are lucky there is one that stands out as providing the bridge. In moving to MFC, it was Mike Blaszczak's MFC VC++4 that provided nearly all the rational explanations. During this current move to C#, I have found that it's Chris Sells book that has fulfilled that role. Many thanks Chris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very engaging and thorough text","review":"This book is excellent in leading the reader through new concepts in a conversational direction, including the missteps that you are likely to make while learning this technology.It does have a C# focus and is assuming that the reader is coming from a C++ background, but even if you are coming from other technologies (such as VB), you will find much wealth of information.I was most impressed with the walkthroughs on resource localization, and if you are interested in low-level graphics, you will find much to study.Highly recommended book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over Petzold, Sells is here.","review":"This book rocks! Its just under 700 pages and I haven't touched my Petzold (1200+ pages) after laying my hands on this. As clear and consise as it can get."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is out of date","review":"No where in the title, cover or product description does it explain that this covers a very old version of Windows Forms programming that is no longer relevant today. I had not looked for the publication date when choosing this book (silly me). The author put the manuscript to bed in April 2003 and the book was published in September of 2003.If you are completely new to Windows Forms, realize that this book was written to about Visual Studio 2003 .NET standards. Huge changes have been made to Visual Studio and .NET since then (major revision being Visual Studio 2005 and 2008).When you read the assorted reviews here on Amazon, you'll note that most reviews are dated around 2004 or so.This book should be fully updated to a new edition or taken off the market. Being six years old, and with .NET and Visual Studio both having undergone several revisions since then, this book has limited relevancy in 2009. I regret that I purchased this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have written my own review, but...","review":"\\"...I had hoped it would be a convenient and quick reference to such questions as \\"how do I use FolderBrowserDialog and/or OpenFileDialog to open a file in my C# program?\\" but although these standard components are indexed in the book the discussion of them in the book is shorter than this review I am writing. What I would want is some kind of sample code, maybe a step-by-step description of how to add the components to my program...\\"There's no way I could have said it better. The book seems to want to cover \\"everything\\" but actually manages to say \\"nothing\\".The only part in which I would have to disagree with the previous reviewer is his rating.

In other words, much of what is written will make no sense whatsoever unless you already know the material, which makes much of the book useless. For example, the author states in the section covering Data Binding (Current Data Row): \\"The Position property is fine when it comes to navigating the rows currently shown, but it's not good for finding the current row in the data table\\". What does \\"currently shown\\" mean? What does \\"current row\\" mean in the context of DataSets, which have no concept of a current row? Is he referring to a Data Table object somewhere? In short, this sentence is useless. The rest of the treatment on this subject is the same. Useless. If one were to actually READ this book, they would find that there are many such examples throughout. That is unless, of course, one already knows the material, in which case the book is a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, in depth coverage","review":"As you would expect from Chris, all the important topics are covered in good depth (though sensibly he defers to the equally good \\"Essential .NET: Volume 1\\" in certain areas). Even advanced topics, such as data binding and design-time integration (which are nevertheless very relevant in \\"real world\\" scenarios), are made extremely approachable by the clear descriptions and useful advice given."},{"rating":"1","title":"No organization","review":"Very rarely do I read a programming book and feel this confused. In the opening chapters, the author, jumps through every major topic without a decent explanation. I found the book's organization and explanations poor and lacking. Ultimately, I just decided to buy a different book instead of trying and to figure out what this guy doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of staff and a little of substance","review":"This book covers a lot of topics from how to create a rectangle to custom controls to XML and resources. I primarily bought this book to understand how to manipulate windows user interface on the control level. Unfortunately book doesn't provide enough information about exposed methods of controls and doesn't tell you how to override their behavior. The examples given in the book are very short and do not allow you to see the full workings of the class or method being described.This book has a lot of 5 star reviews. This was the reason why I bought it, so may be there is something there for you, but I'm talking it back to amazon and hope to get something better for my purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wished I had this book a year ago!","review":"I really enjoyed the book and found it quite useful. Wish I would have had it a year ago when I started working with C# forms. Did not take long to realize even my \\"OK\\", \\"Cancel\\" forms could stand a *bit* of improvement. I liked the humor - helps with otherwise dry reading. Section on multi-threading was great. This should be your first book on programming Windows forms in C#."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"Windows Forms Programming in C# is a well written Windows Forms tutorial. Chris thoroughly and exhaustively examines different facets of Windows Forms programming. I picked up this book after programming Windows Forms for 3 years, and I did have a lot to learn from Mr. Sells. This book has been adopted for a UCLA Extension Windows Forms course. To learn more about the book and the author, read an interview with the author at csharpcomputing.com/Interviews/sells.htm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Network Internals Review","review":"In \\"The Audience for This Book\\" section it says that \\"..newcomers will be able to get up to speed quickly, too\\".

I may, after considerable further study, find this book useful. For the time being this book is a functional door stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular Spaghetti!

Any historical information about the composers lives was barely touched upon. The sampling of music was very limited and any discussion of the actual music, music theory or the musical inspiration seemed pretty much non-existant.The DVD could have been better described as an attempt by the production team to present a view of the many composers through interpretive dance and mood setting cinematography. I am sure that someone out there will enjoy this attempt but it is definately not my cup of tea . I expected something completely different...guess I've been spoiled by Ken Burns.It was difficult to know what this series was about because of lack of accurate descriptions or reviews. I pretty much ordered the product with my fingers crossed. Hope this review helps you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable","review":"These biographees are not what I expected. There not very acurate. There basicly a series of Choreograph dances which try to tell the composer's story. Much of the true biographee of each composers is lost. I would not recomend the purchase of these DVDs to anyone who is serious about learning about these great composers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for the classroom","review":"I got this set as a gift, and I was excited to use it in my classroom since I'm a music teacher. The videos are not appropriate for a young audience. There is a lot of sexual inuendo, and inappropriate content. The actual information is sparse and instead we are made to watch multiple ballets set to the composter's music, that while artistic, are not informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Provide Any Evidence","review":"The author picked on false evidence against Christianity.

It's instructional value is close to nil- the only well done sections in the book are the problem sets. The \\"teaching\\" material is hopelessly confusing.

I searched for this thinking to get scratchy punkfunk with dub flourishes. Instead I get a band that starts songs with good hooks then leaves them. And dont get me started on Mark Stewart's voice. The only two songs I liked were Theif Of Fire and We Are Time however I will not recommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excessively edgy","review":"Avant-garde neo-punk group, akin to Television meets The Ex meets bad acid, are the type that pushes the weird side at the expense of the writing. With their deconstructionist slant and production schizophrenia we are left with little substance and an overriding desperation at sounding different, which is a shame because it seems that with a little more focus this band could have really meant something, hinted at with rare bursts of effectively unnerving, anti-melodic chemistry amidst so much narcissistic clutter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody Awful","review":"I have no doubt that this is an album that will appeal to a lot of different people for a lot of different reasons (just read all the other reviews). But for me, personally, I was irritated with \\"Y\\".

I couldn't agree more that they should have used Tommy Roe's Sweet Pea instead, though the lyrics in Jack and Jill are amusing. I was a kid and my babysitters used to listen to Bubblegum when I grew up in Manhattan Beach, CA and MAN this music brings it back! I am thrilled with the comp and the Bubblegum classics series. Now I don't have to cringe every time my 45s, which are all drawn on in crayon, skip! I was thrilled that they included The Sweet on this comp. If you like Little Willy (which is slightly \\"harder\\" than the rest) you might enjoy their LP Desolation Blvd which is more early glam, but still features great Teen lyrics and fabulous glam screams. Rock on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Home!","review":"This CD describes itself as \\"the ultimate collection of pure pop music\\". That description is more accurate than the title \\"Bubblegum Classics\\". The compilers of this collection seem to have catagorized any lightweight pop song as \\"bubblegum\\". To me, \\"bubblegum\\" specifically refers to the productions of Jerry Kasenetz & Jeff Katz, plus a few other songs that imitate their signature sound. Having said that, this is a good collection of lightweight pop songs. There are some big hits and some real rarities. Some of the songs are great and some of the songs stink. It's a mixed bag, but it's my bag, baby. Recommended for fans of pure pop music."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your professor uses this book - get a second text!","review":"This book is riddled with typographical errors, very sloppy. In at least one place, the formal pronoun is not capitalized - it's supposed to be capitalized, so this can mislead you! This book is also poorly laid out - tables are difficult to study because oftem they are spread out over two pages and use no shading or boxes to help guide you.I picked up a general Italian textbook at a library sale and it is miles better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulling the Pieces Together","review":"This book is one of my favorites. Lee outlines the learning process of Kenpo Karate. Each chapter teaches the needs and benefits of learning the priciples of this Art as well as some of the concepts. After he takes you through this learning process, Lee pulls all the pieces back together. I've applied a great deal of this book to all my techniques and find it a necessity to all series Kenpo students. Being a 5th Degree Black Belt in Kenpo I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Confused","review":"Now, I have always practiced Kenpo with the idea \\"Keep it Simple Stupid\\" in mind. The idea of self-defense is to get away. The idea of teaching a technique is as last resort and is to get away from an attacker. The idea of this book seemed to throw me for a loop. It wants to complicate things when learning a martial art is already complicated enough. You can ramble on for ten pages about a motion when I can say it in a few words: Kick 'em in the groin, chop 'em in the neck.\\" Yes, if I want to important, I will go into the detail, but only for the benefit that I like the way I sound. I figure only someone with a background in physics would really care to know mathematical formulas. Yes, I know the motion principles, but I don't want to calculate my velocity before striking."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"Theater of the Stars is very different from Whale Season but is characterized by the same fluid writing style and engaging character development.
