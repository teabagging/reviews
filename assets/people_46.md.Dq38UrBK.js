The mixing is perfection and every track is like candy to the ear. When listening to this, all I want to do is dance. Each and every track just makes you feel good which is what house music is all about. Having been a fan of Bad Boy Bill for years, I consider this to be my favorite from him. From front to end, every song is infectious and will leave you wanting to listen more. The bonus dvd is another awesome addition to the cd. It is really neat watching all the behind the scenes stuff, as well as the music videos. BAD BOY BILL IS DEFINITELY IN THE MIX!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the usual Bill","review":"I don't know what it is, but this mix just sucks. Although the song selection seems a lot like BTB vol. 5, they just aren't the same. Something is missing but I can't explain it. I was waiting for this CD forever now, and the day I got it I listened to it for a few mins, skimmed through the songs more, but never liked a single part. His BTB series were MUCH better, especially volumes 1, 3, and 5. Something else I noticed is the fact that this isn't really hard house, it's funky house. Hopefully BBB will stick to something harder on his next CD. Perhaps House Connection 3?"},{"rating":"1","title":"too many vocals!","review":"I love house music, but this CD is just way too over the top for me. The first few minutes is good, then the vocal barrage begins, a continuous onslaught of mediocre, and in most cases grating vocals. I know that Bad Boy Bill is more of a commercial radio DJ and not really a DJ who has roots in the rave scene, but this is even too much vocal lameness for your local power hour workout radio DJ. Kind of like Planet Soul times 100, if you can imagine that. If you love freestyle music, then you might like this CD, but if you are looking for something with more of an underground sound, I would recommend picking up something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shirt for brother-in-law!","review":"If You Can Read This, The Bitch Fell Off, T-shirtMy brother-in-law has always wanted one of these shirts.

She still had some fire left in her, as evidenced on the hip-hoppish but respectable hit \\"You're Makin' Me High\\" and the emotional ballad \\"Unbreak My Heart\\". Also good are the ballad \\"Let It Flow\\" and the sultry, teasing ditty \\"Talking In His Sleep.\\" Unfortunately, before she had a chance to make a third album, the bankruptcy set in, and since then she has been just a shell of her former self on every album she's made after this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"More sad love songs","review":"I don't know about anyone else but I simply love these songs.

I know most of the words to most songs as you would ANY good CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING Flat Beats May Kill","review":"In fact its not just the beats that kill you it can be her voice. Don't get me wrong she can sing but she doesn't. I only like 2 songs \\"Your Making Me High\\" and \\"Talking In His Sleep\\". Even though she talks mostly on \\"Talking In HIs Sleep\\" she really sings on it too, and I like her voice. This CD can put you to sleep cause there are no party songs that make you want to dance. \\"Your Making Me High\\" is a nice song but its not really dancy. Everything doesn't have to be dancy but her SINGING on a dance track would be awsome."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad. period.","review":"i have nuthin against toni or her fans, just all that sappy mush. for example, unbreak my heart...what on earth does unbreak mean? it isnt even in the dictionary! see what i mean?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repugnant","review":"Actually, I really liked Braxton's first album. I was really looking forward to this release and went out to purchase it right away. Half way through this CD, I was bored to tears. Braxton is a tired, wanna-be R&B diva with limited vocal ability. The songs on this CD are whack! And her vocal performance is even worse. No matter how hard she tries, she will never be in the same category as legends like Aretha, Chaka, Tina and Patti. I can't even put her in the same category as Whitney, Mariah or even Sade. Toni mainly gets by on her looks, because she certainly possess very little talent, which she clearly goes out of her way to prove on this dissappointing CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated!","review":"To me, Toni Braxton is one of the most overrated singers of the 90s, and this album is far worse than it's reputation. Nice voice but sterility in sound and expression, having left me with an uncomfortable aftertaste of too much sugar. Soul is music that moves your heart, and this collection of songs is definitely not soul! Better listen to real soul divas like Regina Belle, Phyllis Hyman, Candi Staton, Angela Bofill and the likes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good songwriting but no versatility what-so-ever","review":"With a voice like hers, it's very smart of her producers to keep her singing this style of music. They certainly know what they're doing. But admist all the talent of the producers and technical ability, that hauting voice (which one can obtain by loosing theirs and easily duplicated) and slurred speech left me longing for earplugs. No clarity in her voice what-so-ever. How can one go wrong with producers like Babyface and LA Reid? Their writing style and meloncholy beats does the CD justice. I give it two stars for that alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"I PURCHASED THIS CD FOR JUST 1 SONG, BUT FOUND AFTER LISTENING TO THE WHOLE CD, THAT THERE QUITE A FEW GREAT SONGS ON IT.

The opening track Come On Over Here is just a little taster for what is about to unfold.

As stated by an earlier reviewer, the old formula would turn into nice balls and was a finer grain. My cats loved the stuff as did I. The new formulation makes giant clumps that now stick to the floor of the litter box and are almost impossible to properly clean out. You have to scrape, scrape, and scrape some more just to get the muddy residue off the bottom of the box and then you've got all these fine scrapings of urine that won't/can't be picked up by the scooper within the leftover litter.It used to be the blue and red caps were different but now they are pretty much the same. Tidy Cats has turned into Scoop Away.Now the new search begins. Purina...take the hint. Bring back the old formula."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst, smells really bad and barely clumps","review":"Bought this by mistake. I like fresh step multi cat-no smell ,great clumps. The Tidy cats instant action had my whole apartment stinking like crazy. And there were barely any clumps-just a wet mud and grainy mixture. I bought this in the past and hated it then. I hope to never confuse my brands again. I was afraid the landlord would come by and kick my out. It smelled like the cats had peed everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually Puked From Cleaning the Box","review":"I have been using this for less than a week, and I am going to dump what's left. The litter itself smells weird, and after my cat goes, it does nothing to cover up the smell. She might as well have gone on the floor. I picked this litter because of the price, and I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not sure how you call this \\"Clumpable\\"","review":"I have to keep one litter box in a spare bedroom due to one cat being picked on by another. I LOVED Fresh Step, but I noticed in that room there was a recurring film of dust all over everything that smelled like the litter. I decided to try Tidy Cats to see if I had the same issue.There was less dust, but stuff does NOT clump well at all!It was all but impossible to scoop out the \\"clumps\\" without it breaking and falling into the clean litter. Who is giving this 4 stars is beyond me.BTW-I tried their \\"Small Spaces\\" brand. It does the same thing.I'm amazed anyone buys this.I'm now using \\"Scoop Away\\", and it scoops very well, but the dust is back.Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't clump as well anymore","review":"I had gone with this brand because after trying several others, it was the only one my cat would use. It worked fairly well for a while. The clumping action was decent, and it was not the most expensive litter out there. So both the feline and me were content. More recently though, I've noticed the clumping is not as good as it used to be. It tends to break up very easily, and sticks to the sides and floor of the box which is pretty disgusting. If you don't get the scooping action exactly right, the clump tends to to break up into smaller pieces, making scooping a nightmare.I'm disappointed with what this product has become, and have the unenviable task of finding another brand that can control odors, not track too much, and clump!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks","review":"I am quite disappointed. This litter is \\"perfumed\\" with a nasty chemical smell that stinks up the entire house. The stench is obviously most concentrated inside the litter box where the poor cats have to endure it (I am surprised they don't pass out from this crap). I had to spread this stuff out in a thin layer on a piece of cardboard and let it sit outside for about 9 hours just to get some of the chemical \\"scent\\" to diminish. I doubt this litter actually \\"controls\\" odor; instead, I think it just masks odors with its noxious chemical scent.It is sad how our culture has been duped into believing that the simulacrum an offensive odd chemical smell equates to a \\"fresh\\" scent.Also, the urine clumps are completely mushy. On the first day, I noticed my cat limping, apparently trying to get something off its paw. I found that the wet clumps stick aggressively to the bottoms of my cat's paws which I have to clean off by hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again!","review":"I'm not sure what product the happy reviewers were using, but I tried this Tidy Step litter and I will NEVER buy it again! Not only does it not \\"instantly\\" neutralize odor, but it doesn't neutralize it at all! Even after completely changing out and cleaning the litter box, I re-filled it with (thankfully!) the last of this tub of litter, and a short time later walked by and noticed it stinking badly. I checked to see if the cat had failed to cover, but nope, he'd done a perfect job, it's just that the smell still gets through this litter!The even bigger issue for me is that is doesn't clump around urine at ALL! What is the point of buying litter then, I might as well go to the home improvement store and buy bags of cheap-o sandbox sand, if I wanted something that doesn't neutralize odors and doesn't clump! My kitty and I will be a Fresh Step household once again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't clump at all - what happend?","review":"I have used Tidy cat for years. Over the past few months it just hasn't been clumping at all. It makes the urine a sludgy mass that sticks to the litter box. It's nearly impossible to scrape off of the box and I am tired of having to work so hard to clean it up.Between the clumping issues and the ridiculous amount of packaging, I am done with this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's gone wrong","review":"This used to be a good product. In the last year, something has changed with the way it clumps...it doesn't anymore. I am switching to a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"whoa, what happened?","review":"This stuff used to be great, the best value for clumping litter on the market, especially if you bought it in the huge tubs. But in the last few months it seems like they've changed the formula and it doesn't clump anymore! The clumps fall apart if you touch them with the scoop.

Also the track uses the standard Mattel/Tyco connectors so you could expand the system if you want (with black track). You could also use the standard Mattel/Tyco power supply, but be advised that it's a higher voltage so the cars may go shooting off such a small track.One of the nice features of the controller is the ability to limit the travel of the trigger (3 settings), so that young kids don't go full throttle and run the cars off the track constantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Piece of junk. The track doesn't stay together well enough to maintain physical or electrical connectivity. There are little ridges where the sections meet that the cars get hung up on. At top speed the car on the inner track won't stay on its track. The cars come apart. Lasted about an hour before my kids and I concluded that it was totally irredeemable and returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Maintenance Track","review":"My two sons really liked this track at first.

In fairness I haven't contacted the manufacturer for assistance, but I shouldn't have to. The directions insist that it not be used on carpet and all of the pieces must line up perfectly. What I've found is that if you bend pieces of the track in just the right way you might be able to energize that part of the track only. I've never been able to get more than one piece of the track energized at a time, but that's partly my fault as I've only got two hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Work","review":"My two boys (6 & 2) love this toy.

It eats up batteries so fast that the kids do not get more than 10 to 15 minutes of play time with the darn thing! Expensive to keep buying batteries, but on the upside the boys got frustrated and disappointed with the small amount of play time they got with it that they shoved it under the bed and ignored it.

I literally had to measure each screw with a ruler to understand which screws go where and the assembly is only described with one uninformative picture. So, if you aren't handy with tools don't expect to have an easy time with this mount.

What I didn't count on was the metal being so flimsy that it would start to bend and go crooked after a month, thanks to nothing but the 5lbs of the projector and gravity. Now we have a perpetually wonky display, a counterclockwise rotation that's just about 2 degrees...but is enough to drive most of us crazy.Do yourself a favor, spend an extra fifty bucks and get a mount that's sturdier and will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer be aware: It is not universal mount at all","review":"The product is cheap, so does the quality and overall design. The product is quite deceptive with a \\"UNIVERSAL\\" title. It is not.

I found a YouTube video describing how to add in extra hardware to make it work for my model. While the mount did in fact support the projector it was not strong enough to hold the projector level. I found that every couple days the projector image would drift a few inches down toward the left. After continually straightening the projector and re-tightening I noticed that the cheap quality metal was actually bending the projector mount.For a smaller projector this mount just might do the trick but for the Epson 8350 or any projector of similar size I would invest in a higher quality mount. I switched mine out for a chief mount and was amazed in the difference in quality and design. While I do recommend chief as an alternative I would not have been willing to pay up for the chief brand had I not spent 10 hours mounting and re- adjusting my projector with this mount."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Universal\\" mount bracket doesn't fit Epson 8350","review":"The thin is too small even when extended all arms to max.Nothing mentioned about dimensions in description.

Well, it does. Like other reviews, there are no instructions to help you. Plus, in order to make it work, you have to remove one of the legs, move one leg to the front center screw hole, change around the \\"lower legs\\" to the smaller inserts, and then use a drill to place a needed hole in the leg to allow the proper length.The good is that the mount is rock solid, holds the projector well, and was easy to put up once I got it attached to the projector. A special note, use the middle wood screw to hold the projector on the wall before you sink the other two after positioning. It does look a little un sightly, but they all do.For the price, if you are willing to play the positional and drill game, great mount."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hold projector nicely","review":"Holds projector nicely.For me even after tightening everything down it still moves up and down as well as some rotation if you bump it.

This one came in and worked great. I have an oversized projector and had to fabricate two longer brackets to replace the stock ones so it would fit my projector. I would not have had to modify anything on a normal projector. Once that was done, the thing worked great. I actually mounted it in one room and needed the drop down adjustment to hang lower. The mount worked beautifully. The wife then decided we needed to move everything into another room with a lower ceiling and it worked great without the drop down bar. For this, I needed to add spacers to get the upper bracket to work better. I think these should have been included in the package but they weren't. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.

This series does not translate well. It lacks focus in its directing, tension in its writing and the picture quality is rather poor. Too bad, as it is from 1959. Fonda must have indeed needed the money and it was, as was written, \\"an easy gig\\" for him. Nice performance by Allen Case, who sadly never did much more on screen, but did have his moments on(off?) Broadway and unfortunately died in his fifties of a heart-attack. And Robert Redford has a nice guest spot in one episode, but still it is not worth the asking price. Incidentally, I bought my set for $19.99 from a local retailer.

This is a family story that takes place in Buffalo,NY. There are four adult sisters and one adult brother. The head of the family is a recently widowed father. It starts with the disappearance of one sister. The story then introduces the rest of the family, and their reaction to the disappearance. I felt the characters never reached a fullness so that I could care about them. There were a lot of words to the story and sometimes they made no sense. The one character that I enjoyed and could almost root for was the father's girlfriend. She was a woman with a jaded past but she was flesh and blood and I cared how things would work out for her. Nobody else in the family liked her. Family stories are one of my favorite story lines but this one did not satisfy my appetite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy, boring, lacking unity, & no plot","review":"This book is a string of characters thoughts with nothing of interest to hold it together.

Unfortunately, I did not find it to be particularly clever or funny. On some level, it seems like the PC craze has subsided since the mid-90's when the book was written, and it just doesn't read as the brilliant critique that I expected. We've now heard so many silly descriptions followed by the suffix \\"challenged\\" that it just isn't funny anymore. I suppose that this book worked much better when it was written, but it hasn't aged well over the ten years since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea in Theory....","review":"It's hard for me to start tearing this book apart and pointing out all the little things I don't like, so I'll take the lazy route and condemn the entire book. Every story is written in such a trite fashion that I couldn't even finish it.

In a world where it's becoming increasingly important to maintain a high level of political correctness, sometimes it's fun to sit back and laugh at the whole thing. Let's face it...who's never heard a phrase so politically correct that you had no idea what the person was talking about? Garner manages to maximize his PC'ness to an outlandish degree and still maintain the level of understanding and hilarity. After reading this book you will never think of Cinderella, The Three Little Pigs, Rapunzel, and a host of others quite the same way again. I'm off to order the other two books in the series, because this one is such a delightful little gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitting out at PC","review":"I have been avoiding this title for years under the mistaken assumption, and fear of sorts, that this would be yet another PC rehash of the traditional fairy tales that I loved so much as a kid, and today find interesting for the light they throw on folklore and pre-modern society. Imagine my delight when I eventually did get round to reading it! Make no mistake, this book is a satire on excessive PC, which has sunk its teeth into every aspect of our lives, even into classics and fairy tales. Judging and rewriting the past by today's standards is stupid and futile, and this book shows that clearly. I'm giving this one star less simply because there could have been more, and if you're on a tight budget, it may pinch a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used Book Purchase","review":"The book was just as described and came right on time.

As one reviewer said, \\"trite\\" is the best way to describe this book. It's one for the bargain dumpster.Political correctness is in the eye of the beholder but I guess the right-wing has hijacked it to attack any humane idea relating to feminism, the environment, etc. It's no surprise that no-one on the right criticised Attorney-General John Ashcroft for spending taxpayer's money to cover up the breast of the lady justice statue because he found it offensive. I bet if the Attorney was a Democrat, Rush Limbaugh and his cohorts would have howled \\"politically correct\\"!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Either stupid or ignorant, I'm not sure which.","review":"This is either a horrible attempt to be satirical or a morons attempt to be serious. Sadly, the forward to the book makes it seem like the latter is the more likely case. From the fool's spelling of women with a 'y', to the fumbling, awkward attempts to make characters gender-neutral, this tome only serves to illustrate the stupidity of the author. A much-less forced attempt at PC terminology could have promoted the book to satire or parody, but as published, it fails to be either funny or enlightening.I hope some capable author will someday take on the task of showing the insanity of political correctness with an actually funny revision of the classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"46 Defense","review":"Best defensive coaching film i've ever seen...accompying game video in the film left a lot to be desire.

The first book is a comprehensive comparison of how the cognitive abilities of humans, apes, and monkeys develop. Like others of Professor Parker's books, it will be a reference for years to come. A particular strong point is the numerous easily-understood tables that present a large mass of important information in a readily-understood manner. These compare not just the development of the species, but the different theories that have been proposed about how development occurs. The second book proposes a theory about how the differences among primates evolved, then applies it from monkeys through apes and Homo erectus to ourselves. The theory is the opposite of that proposed by Stephen Jay Gould. Instead of being laid to neoteny, or progressive juvenilzation, the authors argue that the cause is progressive adultification.

But with No Substance, the band has proven that Mr. Brett was the man. Graffin's strong song writing seems wasted on the pop-ish tracks, and the tracks are too slow and methodical to be a BR album. Cliche, boring guitar riffs, and soapbox preaching make one long for the poignant Against the Grain tracks or the individualist Stranger than Fiction songs.

There's nothing with the same energy, the same intelligence. On the first verse of All Fantastic Images, they complain about England (hmm...o..kay..), the Mediocre Mind chorus is awful and most of all, the worst Bad Religion song ever, Raise Your Voice! is on this album. A few good points tho: the 2 Killers songs are nice, Hear It is kinda good....but really, that's it. For more recent and listenable Bad Religion stuff, go check for The Process of Belief.

Now, for me it's not that the band has slowed down their songs that makes this album less than a treat, but it's the lack of those ultra-catchy choruses and solo guitar riffs we've come to expect from Bad Religion. The entire album is absent from any catchy, emotive, and memorable lines. It kind of just trudges along, like they were going through the motions.There are a few decent songs (Hear it, Shades of Truth, Greatest Killer...), but nothing even resembling spectacular like on their other albums. I only recommend No Substance if you must have everything Bad Religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quirky gift, but short on information","review":"To fill a book with 365 unique tidbits of why someone should be a vegetarian is a difficult task to undertake. The author does their best to make the reasons interesting, however, it becomes apparent that there is little substance to this book. There are numerous quotes from \\"famous\\" persons which were quite interesting.Overall, this book is an easy read, but I found it to be quite repetitive. It makes a quirky gift for a vegetarian, but no serious information about the vegetarian lifestyle can be gained from reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong music","review":"As of March 26, 2008, the music that's posted here for sampling is that of Wildildlife's \\"Six\\" album.

A mixture of Chatechism, (romantic) handbook, and U.S. history with some Forest Gump thrown in. I kept trying to figure out how a kid could graduate from High School, serve time in the Army at the end of WW2 and get a college degree by the time he was 22. It took him a couple of more years to win a Pullitzer. If you like REALLY light reading you MAY enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be a called a \\"Halloween Wedding\\"","review":"It is frighting that any one would find anything real about the family in this book. Rosie the witch, Chuckie the night of the living dead. I found the whole thing so boring. Just because it took place in the 50's does it have read like a book from the 50's. This is 2001. Who talks that way? Pease, more life like chacters. Could have been great....I come from a Irish, Catholic family with many of the problems faced in this book. But, I just thought the book was insulting."},{"rating":"2","title":"6.5 x 12 Patriotic American Flag Sticker","review":"Product arrived promptly and was exactly as described online.It is a large sticker.

The book's quality is junk, do not buy this book. Spend a little more and get one that is put together correctly. The paragraphs and chapter titles are all mixed up. Unfortunately it costs more to return from Alaska than just deal with. Buyer beware.

It is almost all just badly recorded backstage toke sessions and conversations on the tour bus that you can hardly make out due to poor quality sound and background noise.

Their sound is unique, their passion is evident, and their talent is unquestionable. \\"Last Night\\" introduced us to Az Yet and captivated us through their album until \\"Time To End The Story\\". This album chronicles all of the ups and downs of relationships. You feel all the pain, ecstasy, and bittersweetness due to their passionate vocals. \\"Inseparable Lovers\\" is so unique in its concept and delivery while the Brian McKnight authored \\"Through My Heart (The Arrow)\\" takes you back to the days of Cupid. There isn't a bad song on this album. Their subsequent albums should be just as timeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to dance to.","review":"I originally brought this CD for the single \\"Last Night,\\" which I still like.

You cannot deny the fact that this album can rest your soul. I have listened to ATLiens many times, and every time I do, i find something new to enjoy about this \\"Thought provoking album\\" as quoted by Andre Benjamin. The intro is very soothing and prepares you for the lyrical journey ahead. Two dope boyz, Title track, Wheelz of steel, and Elevators are all hits that everyone has heard before, but the tracks that are forgotten are the ones that make the album. Mainstream, easily the best collaboration between Outkast and Goodie Mob is increadable.

It also was lacking in the beats. \\"ATLiens\\" is where we begin to see a change in my favorite artist of all time, Andre 3000 (dre) he begins to get his creative juices flowing, and some influences from former girl friend Eryka Badu, influences the way he dresses and the way he spits his lyrics. This is the stepping stone to the hip hop hall of fame, with the funk lyrics and tight beats that come in the future, you know it all started with this pivitol album.

The lyrics are on-point, the beats are catchy. Outkast are one of the rare rap artist that can have amazing beats and hooks, with LYRICS to back them up.When you listen to ATLiens, you notice that this album isn't really music to get hyper or \\"crunk\\" too. It's music to chill too, to cruise too, to just sit back and be taken away. One of my favorite things to do is just listen to a track and have the lyrics right in front of me and follow along. This is one of the best albums to do that too, because it really enhances the expierence.This is some of Outkast best work. Don't just get this CD, get every outkast CD.Outkast has achieved an amazing feat and has never, put out a bad album.

Hoped that the cd would be great but its too slow and it sounds like a ufo. Not to mention the front of the cd, now I cant even sneak it in the school( I have The Chronic and The Chronic 2001, but this is much worse).

There first album was hot too, but this album takes the cake, it helped me get through the hard times in life. there music is so insperational and deep that if you don't listen to any of there music your not a true hip hop fan. ATLiens is the best of the three albums but also the start of there career, thats just my opinion. But I know true hip hoppers listen to this quadriple platnum group. One luv to all the Outkast fans and the laface productions for the support of my favorite group in this hip hop game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expand your mind!","review":"OutKast are the Jimi Hendrix of hip hop - they use a variety of cool sounds, combine them with dope beats, and then drop awesome, thought provoking vocals making for a propulsive, intelligent rap album.

The angles he pursues, the countless tiny, satisfying details he includes, even the ways and means of the people are worked out flawlessly and presented smartly.It's not all setting either, the story in Ocean is more absorbing than you could ever hope for, except for the ending.

Again, because I had never bought a subscription outside of the USA, I was concerned that the magazine would be loose without a plastic shrinkwrap, but it arrived nicely shrinkwrapped without the magazine name listed to deter someone opening it and reading it prior to it being delivered (I KNOW they read my USA ones!).

Madeleine Kahn was stuck in an elevator. Robert Klein was walking some dogs. The beautiful Juliette Lewis simulated a pregnant women.

BUYER BEWARE"},{"rating":"2","title":"smart people love this movie!","review":"There is no middle ground for this movie -- viewers either love it or hate it, and I LOVE it. (In fact, it's a Christmas tradition for me and my friends.) The characters are neurotic, absurd, silly, combustible, and the brisk comic timing is reminiscent of a theater piece. It's a classic farce dissolving into a sentimentality that seems appropriate for the holiday season (no worse than \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\", for those who are jaded of such emotional manipulation). Light-hearted and fluffy, Mixed Nuts is not intellectual...but it's eminently entertaining. Its exoteric appeal allows intellectual people to have just as much fun as their non-intellectual friends and family as they watch it together. Perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Christmas without Mixed Nuts","review":"I purchased the DVD of Mixed Nuts to replace our long standing VHS copy. This is the best Christmas movie. A little goofy but absolutely the best. Could not stand Christmas without it. We love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The next \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\"","review":"Twenty years from now, this movie will be as much a holiday classic as Caprs's \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\". This screwball comedy, set in Santa Monica at Christmas features some of the brightest comedians of their time. Madeline Kahn is outrageuos as usual and Steve Martin and Rita Wilson make a perfect couple. The soundtrack is supperb. This movie will become a holiday must. It already is at my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is HILARIOUS!","review":"If you're a Steve Martin or Adam Sandler fan, you'll love this movie! It's a great Christmas movie but funny enough that I watch it any time of the year! With a funny story line and great cast, I highly recommend getting this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Felix is in the hos-pit-al!","review":"...I don't wait for Christmas to watch this movie, I get it out whenever I need a laugh.Does anyone else find it frightening how exceptional Liev Schreiber is at acting like a woman? I mean, he's fantastic-much better than some other drag queens I've seen. And he dances so well with those stelletto's.And let's not forget Madeline Kahn as Mrs. Munchnick. I love it when Steve Martin asks \\"Chris\\", \\"have you seen a lady in a really bad mood?\\"And Rita Wilson as the ever innocent yet seductive Katherine (or is it Catherine?)If you have ever had to answer the phone in the name of customer service, you will love this movie. If you find death funny, you will love this movie. If you love anything by Mel Brooks, you will love this movie. Get it for the holidays, enjoy it. Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just...lays there.","review":"This film had potential. Steve Martin was hilarious in THE JERK and was excellent in a more conventional comedic role in L.A. STORY.But MIXED NUTS just lays there. Script is banal, unfunny, and unoriginal. I've repeatedly seen the same \\"jokes\\" and setups in a UCLA Extension comedy writing class I've taken a few times.Parker Posey is wasted. She's got two lines in the beginning of the film, and two at the end. Two minutes screen time total.The setup of a suicide clinic on Chistmas Eve is ignored. Instead we get listless subplots concerning \\"wacky\\" characters. Steve Martin's mousy co-worker secretly loves him. Julliette Lewis provides the co-worker with a red dress, so then Steve notices her. There's also a fruitcake that nobody wants. People keep passing it on throughout the film.Ha, ha. Gotta love a film with a running fruitcake joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"More embarassing than funny","review":"Nora Ephron usually writes entertaining movies (she wrote this one with her sister Delia) and Steve Martin usually picks good movies to star in. With this in mind, \\"Mixed Nuts\\" is surprisingly bad. It's a farce without any good jokes, filled with characters that are annoying rather than funny. The Ephrones apparently find it hilarious when people sing with funny voices, and both Madeline Kahn and Adam Sandler embarrass themselves doing it in several scenes that completely fails to be funny. It's a shame a good cast was wasted on a script that should never have been greenlighted. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School Good","review":"An older film with a small budget, \\"Mixed Nuts\\" still has a lot to offer. Madeline Kahn, Juliet Lewis, Adam Sandler, and \\"Joe\\" from \\"Empire Records\\" all do an excellent job in supporting roles. This is a must see for all Steve Martin fans. The story takes place over the coarse of one day with several intertwining stories all ending as one. A different kind of funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful movie","review":"I found this movie to be unbearably bad -- there were parts that just made wince because they were so unfunny -- which surprised me given the cast of the movie. I would not recommend it to anyone. In fact, I really wish I could get the money back that I paid for the ticket to see it in the theater.In short, do not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful, but...","review":"I loved the ring.

Would have liked it a bit bigger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming movie","review":"I very much like this movie with the exception of the ridiculous witches, which I could've done without. It doesn't concern itself very much with reality, which I sometimes like. It doesn't take itself too seriously and is just plain good fun. I'm quite surprised that the profile of actress Susie Benton, who plays Rachel, hasn't risen higher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive and essential","review":"I haven't seen any other book that approaches this one's broad coverage of the topic. There is an excellent presentation of basic principles of earthquakes and of the relevant geology of the Northwest. The NW's earthquake history is reviewed in detail. Our current risks are evaluated, and prevention is discussed. There is even a chapter on insurance and policy issues. Throughout, the wording is precise yet breezy, like a good college lecturer (the book grew out of a college course taught by the author)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"The book itself, was very interesting. It really applies to Oregon. I am going to Oregon State Uni & taking geo 380 don't really use the book if you go to class. Don't need this book for class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filter Kit","review":"Installed this & it worked fine for two weeks then started leaking around the large black screw on top. This leak started on it's own without any interference or vibration/movement. Tried tightening & took apart & retightened. Gasket still appears new with no flaws. Cannot stop the leak. I stopped using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Started Leaking","review":"I had actually purchased this a few months ago to use as a washing machine sediment filter, and it worked great at first. However it started leaking, and we didn't notice it until we found a puddle on the floor. It was leaking around where the clear bowl screwed on. I tried to tighten it up to stop the leak, but as I was tightening it broke. I won't buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine with extra washer","review":"I have found this to be a great particle filter. There has been a fair number of complaints about the product leaking. This is simply because the manufacturer ships the product without a second washer for the hose connection. You should use the hose that came with the product to attach to one end. If you are going to attach a second hose to the other end, simply add an extra washer to that hose and you will not have leaking problems. I use one for my washing machine and have purchased a second for my power washer, and both are working very well. The 4 star review comes from the fact that the filter is very difficult to put back together after cleaning. Take the filter out of line, use a wrench on every connection, and you will be able to reinstall it it without leaks. Buy this filter with confidence, as long as you have wrenches and extra garden hose washers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks like crazy...","review":"The clear plastic threaded end leaks badly and no amount of fooling with it would make it stop leaking. Nice looking unit but is faulty in design, at least it was for me. Returning it and getting something else with all metal connections on each end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks","review":"Works fine if you don't mind 5% of the water leaking out. Also no accompanying instructions and it cracks easily if you tighten hard trying to stop the leaking. Mine cracked and I had to shave and sand the clear male end to reduce the leaking. Just to clarify, it leaked before it cracked. Other than that, it filters effectively, cleans easily and probably deserves 2 1/2 stars. I would have returned it but couldn't find another similar product on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is One Album I Don't Miss","review":"I had \\"CrazySexyCool\\" when I was in high school and after listening to it a few times, I sold it to one of my classmates. The only songs I liked on the album were the ones released as singles. Everything else was just whatever. After \\"Waterfalls,\\" TLC turned pop so quick that it made my head spin. And for as long as TLC has been out, I never cared much about T-Boz's singing. But after hearing a TLC song on the radio the other day, I realized that T-Boz sings like a croaking frog. RIBBIT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not badd","review":"This is probably \\"TLC's\\" worst ablum. There are good songs like \\"Water Falls\\", \\"Creep\\", \\"Diggin' on you\\" and \\"Kick some game\\". Basically it's the songs that were released as singles, that were good. With an exception to \\"Red Light Special\\".The rest of the songs haven't been produced enough. They are way too flacid, and frankley unecessary. Especially \\"Girlfriend\\", which is a \\"Prince\\" remake. It'll grown on you for a while.But the feeling isn't lasting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cd from one of the best female groups of all time","review":"The reason I gave this cd 5 stars is that I can listen to it from start to finish without skipping a single track. It's a very cohesive album, flowing very smoothly. Standout tracks to me are : Creep, If I was your Girlfriend, Waterfalls, Red Light Special, Something Wicked This Way and Switch. The raps by Lisa Lopes are just plain great, specially in the Switch and Waterfalls. Outkast make a great appearance also."},{"rating":"2","title":"LEFT EYE WE LUV U","review":"REST IN PEACE LISA \\"LEFT EYE\\" LOPES OF TLC WHO SADLY DIED IN A CAR CRASH THURSDAY APRIL 25TH, 2002.

The singles on the album are fantastic: \\"Creep,\\" \\"Diggin' On You,\\" and \\"Red Light Special\\" groove along to infectious melodies and simmer with sexiness. \\"Waterfalls\\" is TLC's best-ever stab at social commentary and is both lyrically clever and musically innovative. However, the album is cluttered with too many interludes and does contain a fair amount of filler. Even so, CrazySexyCool is far superior to most of the bland hip-hop/R&B being released today. TLC may have mellowed their sound a bit, but their empowered female message still comes across loud and clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's nothing better","review":"This CD is absolutely amazing. I am an avid music fan andthis is without a doubt the most well-crafted CD I've ever heard.These girls are really talented and create music well together.Every song is absolutely delicious. Too bad there won't be anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think that TLC bring up messages that are meaningful","review":"I think that TLC brings out good, important messages in this cd, as well as in Fanmail. And thank goodness, not all their songs are about meaningless love songs where someone is always playing hard to get(For ex: Britney Spears). They've been gone for about four years, and yet they still have the power to attract a new generation of listeners, produce a quadruple platinum cd, and do not go near to degrading themselves with beats that start to sound the same and are cliche-ish. These ladies have returned to their rightful places as reigning queens in the R&B world."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I think of is Lisa","review":"I really didnt get the album but I seen thr concert. It was very cool I loved the metallic voice.

In its genre it shares the mountain top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot!! A classic album for Tlc!","review":"This album from tlc is one of their best.

I heard \\"Creep\\" on an MTV compilation so I bought the CD at a used CD store. WOW! EVERY track is solid! My favorite has to be whichever one I am listening to at the moment you ask me. The first ten tracks are especially s-o-l-i-d! Having the J-Dupri et al do cameos makes the CD even more exciting.(especially on Kick a little game) As I listened to \\"Red Light Special\\", I felt it reminded me of \\"Whip Appeal\\" by Babyface. Sure enough, I checked the credits and lo and behold, he wrote the song and produced it. This CD is a masterpiece. Though I bought it used, it would be a bargain at $20, no bulls**t!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty decent techno...","review":"You may have heard one or two of these songs on the radio or in the dance clubs, particularly \\"The World.\\" But trust me - the other songs are much better.About half of these songs are mediocre, predictable, and relatively uninteresting techno-dance mixes like any other you'd hear in a teenie-bopper club (\\"The World\\" is a great example). But the other half are imaginative, interesting, and very creative. Karma Jam, Guilty Passion, Flip your Mind, Things I See, and So it Begins/Ends are great examples of new sounds, smooth beats, and fun songs.I would definately recommend the album based on the strength of six or seven great tracks on it. And if you're into this style of techno/dance/experimental music, I would also recommend anything from the Cafe del Mar series, the Luka Bop album by David Byrne, Peter Gabriel's Afro-Celt album, and certain selections by Moby."},{"rating":"2","title":"good hook","review":"It works well on a suspended ceiling track but would be better if thehook had a larger opening and space for hanging an object."},{"rating":"2","title":"The One That Started it All...","review":"This is the debut from Toni Braxton, a daughter of a fundamentalist preacher. Truth be told, Braxton's rise to fame happened by accident. Producers LA Reid and Babyface gave her the song that was rejected by Anita Baker but would later appear on the soundtrack to \\"Boomerang\\": \\"Love Shoulda Brought You Home.\\" This smoothed-out ballad put Braxton on the map, and soon after her debut album surfaced. It's a fine collection of mid-tempo numbers and sap-free ballads. \\"Breathe Again\\" is one of Babyface's most inspired songs, and Braxton's gusty voice gives it the urgency it demands. She succeeds similarly in \\"You Mean the World to Me\\" and \\"Seven Whole Days.\\" But my two songs of choice are the perky love ditty \\"I Belong to You\\" and the very popular mid-tempo \\"Another Sad Love Song.\\" This album went on to sell millions and established Braxton as a multiplatinum r&b singer. A promising debut that will make a nice addition to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of 1990s R&B's greatest CDs.","review":"Toni Braxton's self-titled debut CD was undoubtedly the best album ever released by LaFace Records. Unlike most of her contemporaries, Toni Braxton is a truly soulful singer whose emotive and soul-stirring vocals breathe life and give meaning to even the most mundane material. Sultry, sensuous, romantic and classy ballads like \\"Breathe Again\\", \\"Best Friend\\", \\"You Mean The World To Me\\", \\"Candlelight\\" and \\"Love Srought You Home\\" were all major hits that deservedly propelled this CD to multi-platinum status and made Ms. Braxton an international superstar.

It is lengthy and detailed, but depicts Louis XIII and Richelieu not as real people but caricatures. About its subject, Queen Anne, it is curiously ambivalent. On the one hand it constantly asks for pity for her unhappy life (apparently because she was blonde and blue eyed and cried a lot - at least that's the impression I was left with). On the other hand, it is quite harsh about her degree of involvement in the Chalais conspiracy and others, not hesitating to label her activities as treasonous. In its hurry to get to Buckingham it condenses the years 1617-25 into one chapter and thus obliterates the three years in which Anne and Louis were very much in love. I don't know whether this is unwitting or done because it doesn't fit the unremittingly bleak picture being painted. In short: interesting for anecdotes but not very useful for interpretation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST of the BEST","review":"IF YOU ARE IN THE MOOD FOR A SCARE...BUY THIS VIDEO!

It's like there are two different types of Sailor Moon the ones for kids like the first four seasons and the dream hole movie and the adult ones like the fifth season Sailor Moon Stars, The rose movie, the ice queen movie, and Sailor and the 7 ballz part one and two (which i do not recommend the ballz one since there is kinky sex, lesbianism, and other raunchy stuff) The reason this movie is not for kids is because the little rose creature is a nude woman and Fiore one of Darien,s friends is in love with him.

(those of you who don't like subtitles, it sounds a lot better to hear the japanese voices, and after about watching it 5 times you don't really have to read them.) BUY THIS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"this movie is a must have it's funny,romantic and has action! A MUST HAVE!And has a beatiful song called moon revenge which ties the movie at the end! not to expensive either!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Video!","review":"I'm HUGE on Sailor Moon, so I knew I'd like it no matter what it was about, but I didn't expect it to be this good! I can honestly say, even non-Sailor Moon fans will enjoy it! If you loved this movie half as much as I did, e-mail me! I wanna know about your ideas!

I advise anyone who wants one of the sailor moon movies, get this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Ridiculous Price.","review":"^^^ Like I said.Look, I love the movie as much as anybody else. But when I first bought the movie years ago, it didn't cost nearly as much as these punks are trying to sell it for.Don't buy it (that was both a metaphor and a serious request)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this!","review":"The current VHS Dupped version is the cut version, 3 and up. The DVD is the uncut version. Support Sailor Moon by buying the cut version anyway if possible. Hopefully they will release the dubbed uncut on VHS soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Movie Ever!","review":"People, don't be scared of the dub, it's not the worst thing in the world. It was pretty nice of Pioneer to even agree to dub Sailor Moon. I think the dubbed VHS was OK., the only flaw was that they used \\"Power of Love\\" again after using it in battle against Wiseman. The rest of the dub itself was interesting, the plot did not change very much. The DVD version of this movie was very good, with original music and everything. Plus Pioneer did not cut off anything on either version of the dub! I was really pleased by that. But what's up with the 3 Yr. + rating? Anyway, get all 3 versions (dub, sub, & DVD), it's fun to compare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Voice Acting","review":"I am used to the DIC voices. I was very happy when I found out Teri Hawkes was coming back as Sailor Moon. That is until I seen Pioneers new Dubbed movie. Its obvious that Teri and all the other voices in the show have not done this for awhile. They were terrible. I think Amy and Luna were pretty good, but everyone else, I\\"m sorry but they need to practice some more. I know Teri can do WAY better on Sailor Moon than in this movie. Sailor Moon sounded to proud, not enough emotion put into it. Also in this movie, there was way too much chessy lines. Especially when Chibi Usa says Moon Mama. Come on pioneer you can do better than this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED this movie!","review":"I am a total diehard Serena+Darien / Usagi+Mamoru / Sailor Moon + Tuxedo Mask / Serenity + Endymion (or whatever you want to call them! ) fan! If you love the strong friendship and love of the Sailor Scouts and Tuxedo Mask, then you will LOVE this movie! Trust me on this one! If you've only seen the DiC version, then you've gotta check this out. It's got the same DiC voices, but much much more storyline and character depth than the TV show. A MUST see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmm, it's OK...","review":"Let's see...I probably would like this movie more if I hadn't seen the subbed version first. Oh yeah, I like it well enough, but it IS a little edited. I mean, the subbed was rated PG13, but this said \\"for ages over 3\\". Come on! This show was meant for older viewers! If you are a die-hard fan of the subbed version of Sailormoon, I wouldn't buy this video. But if your parents won't let you buy a video that costs so much money and is in a language you don't understand (that was MY prediciment ^_^;), go ahead and buy it. You never know, you might like the English version better. But I do have to say it was a relief not to keep switching from reading the captions and looking at what was really happening on the screen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this movie!","review":"I loved this movie! It was defenitly the best of the Sailor Moon movies. I haven't seen the this one dubbed, and I don't think I will. This was the first of any Sailor Moon I've seen subtitled and I loved it! You probably here over the internet about how the japanese version is so much better than the english version. Well this is your chance to see it! You won't have to put up with \\"Serena's\\" voice, instead you can here Usagi's voice. (In my world, there two different people.) You'll fianally get to see what your missing! You have to see the japanese version to agree it's better. Trust me, this is way better than the english version. I recomend this movie subtitled."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE best","review":"This movie is totally great. I have seen the subtitled version and I was astounded at the amount that they left in the dubbed version. Really great. The graphics were really cool and the plot was extremely easy to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I think that every true Sailor Moon fan needs to have this, and all of the Sailor Moon movies, in subtitles. It was so wonderful, it made me cry so much in a few parts. I loved it. It is a movie that I intend to show my children later on in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"This movie is absolutely fabulous. If you have ever been unsure about Sailor Moon or anime in general, then this will surely change your mind to the right direction. It's a wonderful love story about Mamoru and Usagi. You actually get to see when Mamoru and Usagi FIRST MEET! The music for this movie is wonderful especially Moon Revenge the storyline is perfect. A must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be better, but for keeps.","review":"Sailor Moon and her friends are in an other pickle. An old friend of Mamaru has returned to Earth to fulfill a childhood promise. Yet this will cause all of Earth to be distoried. Now, Sailor Moon must defeat the thret and free her beloved! Can she do it? A well done movie. But don't get the dubbed version, it was badly dubbed. Although there could have been a bit more of a twist in the plot, all and all it's one for keeps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sailor Moon R The Promise of the Rose Review","review":"I would give it 1 and a half if I could. I know a lot of people like this movie best of the three but I couldn't stand it! It was just plain old CORNY! The end was the worst part. And when they teleport into space, how the heck are they breathing? The story of this movie stunk. I gave it two stars because I didn't waste my money on nothing. and I gave it that ONE extra star just because it is Sailor Moon."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Butchering of R","review":"This dub was absolutely terrible. The voice actors that Pioneer found were terrible, only one of the four they found fit with the character. They changed the plot: making Fiore a willing accomplice to the Kisinean flower instead of a pawn of her, a lot of the friendship aspects of it were removed, and the mildest of violence and nudity was cut. They butchered a beautiful story, my favorite of the movies, and made me detest it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Surprising!!!!!! =^D","review":"I liked this movie a lot. If you're used to the dubbed NA version, like myself, you will be shocked w/ the original voices. For those of you who don't know:Usagi=Serena. Rei=Raye. Ami=Amy. Makoto=Lita. Minako=Mina. Mamoru=Darian. All in all, i love the lot, Chibi-Usa (Rini) is adorable, and the ending theme, MOON REVENGE is the coolest song Luna and Artemis are very guardian-like. A comment Ami makes about Mamoru is hysterical -- watch out for it!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailor Soldiers are back in town!!!","review":"I am more than ecstatic about all three of the SM movies! I can't wait until the dubbed ones come out so I can buy them all! lets see, that's 3... 6... 9 tapes!

You'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb, Outstanding, Magnificent, Absolutely Wonderful!!!!","review":"This is the best animated movie of all time, it is worth every penny.

My sister hates anime and she even liked it! I watched it 5x the first time I got it. It is definately the coolest!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If your really desperate...","review":"Don't buy it, unless you are really bored. Voices are not any good, especially since they kept most of the original ones. Sailor Moon is just as annoying as ever, her cry baby ways gets on my nerves. Although, I will say this. They didn't do to bad with the vilian. Please, don't waste your money on this, if you can borrow it. And especially don't waste your money on the VHS tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailor Moon--Really a great anime for all ages","review":"I just started watching sailormoon on the cartoon network and every since I love it. I watch all the movies and read all the books. This movie to me deserve more stars that is how much I enjoyed it and I recommend this for everyone to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointed","review":"Pioneer did a very poor job at keeping the Dubbed version like the original. DiC could have done a better job. Some of the attacks are changed and the plot is very confusing. Dictation was horrible. Words were poorly choosen. Unless you are a SM-fanatic, don't buy this movie. It will be interesting what Pioneer will do with S and SS movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! Sailor Moon done right!","review":"Sailor Moon R has always been my favorite Sailor Moon movie. I was extremely pleased with the DVD release of the movie. The sub was done wonderfully.WARNING:The dub on the otherhand, was a totally different script. It left a lot of the \\"DIC\\" feel, aimed towards the kids. A must have for any Sailor Moon fanatic, but just make sure you watch the sub version first."},{"rating":"1","title":"PARENTS BEWARE","review":"I got this movie hoping that it wouldn't be as crude as the japanese version. PARENTS BEWARE! THERE IS NUDITY IN THIS MOVIE! I would not recommend this movie for children under 13! The movie was pretty good, except for the nudity! I'm very dissapointed, and I'M NOT A CHILD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOOOO!","review":"I own the subbed version and it was soooooo good, I was so excited when the dubbed version came out and i was the first person at the video store to get it when i got home i almost started crying! I hated it i sat there trying to figure out what was up with ami's voice and whats up with fiore he sounds like bill gates. Pioneer also adds needless talk we can see they're flowers, we can see fiore is disappearing. and the seedlings talk when in the japanese they don't. plus they put power of love for the endding song didn't they already use that? Compose a new song! Can you tell I don't like the dubbing job, there are a lot of other things i disliked but I leave that to you to find because I may excede my 1000 words. If you are getting this for your little 4 year old child then i would recommend it but as i have found many Sailormoon fans are above the age of 12. By the way don't call her serenity pleassse call her serena or something not serenity or princess serenity."},{"rating":"1","title":"My poor, poor ears!","review":"I recently viewed the English dubbed version of the Sailor Moon R movie - and I regret that I did. It wasn't the storyline and it wasn't the animation. Both of those were first rate. It was those terrible voice actors! Gracious, but when I first heard the intro, Terri Hawkes (as the voice of Sailor Moon/Serena) practically deafened me. Also, all of the voices sounded particularly strained as though they were trying really hard not to screw up since they obviously haven't worked in a while. Of course, many of the lines were corny and unnecessary. One scene had Rini calling Serena \\"Moon Momma\\". If that doesn't induce nausea, nothing will! Another scene replaces Usagi's \\"Tuxedo Kamen-sama!\\" with \\"The man can wear a cape! Woo!\\" The movie also put too much emphasis on friendship and not enough on love. My advice is to buy the subtitled version if you really want to see it done right. If you're a person who prefers dubbed, still buy it. Pioneer's dubbing faired much better than DiC's."},{"rating":"2","title":"SM strikes again!","review":"The Sailor Moon R movie is great, it tells a moonie more about the past of Mamo-Chan, and Usagi. Still has the same fights between Chibi-USA, Rei, and Usagi over Darrien, and has the same great battles. Only thing I found wrong was how it was the same old same old and needed just alittle more info in the Story Line. Over-All I thought it was great and think its a Must have for a true Moonie."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEST MOVIE EVER!","review":"I really thought this movie was the best anime movie of all time, the greatest. I'm like the only person to put 1 star, and the reason why is because I wanted to see if I'd get any hate mail from people for giving it one star. In real life though, it deserves 20 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just as bad as the dub.","review":"I rented this movie recently and I regreted the waste of my money. The voices do not fit the characters at all! The original opening was left out and replaced with the stupid She is the one thing. In my opinion the original opening was a important part of the movie because it explains how every one got to the gardens! Also the Moonmama thing was just pathetic. WAY to much corny dialog changes ! I recommend taking your hard earned $ and go by the subed version. Oh ok their is one good thing about this movie, The changed Mars Fireballs Charge to Evil Spirits Disperse. A MUCH better translation of the origanal."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate reading subtitle","review":"I hate reading subtiltle too. Most of everyone like to listen to the English not reading the subtitle. How can you read while watching it? If you read you will miss the action."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTMENT!","review":"The first thing I want to say is that this version of dubbed was barnified. It was a major disappointment. Almost every translation was wrong. The title of the movie is good. The music didn't go with the movie. Sailor Moon's voice acting was bad. They even put in extra conversations which wasn't necessary. The story-line was mostly wrong. The sub-titiled is so much better. If anyone who wants to see a Sailor Moon movie or the series, don't start off with this version of Sailor Moon or else you'll end up hating it. Sailor Moon is really good, but not the dubbed movie. I really hope they do better on the next two movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailor Moon ! NUMBER 1","review":"I luved it! It was the greatest! I totally loved all of it! The nudity is no biggy nothing a kid over the age of 10 would be like eeeewww mommy! THERE ARE NAKIE GIRLS! Or anything like that! That graphics are the bomb! And they even show Serena when she was a kid! This dvd ruled!And the vilonace and the romance. Are mild, the realtionship between Serena and Darien do grow as well as the realtionship between the scouts but thats it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't soil us with your Dub!","review":"The dub may satisfy those only familier with the TV dub by DiC, but it is not worth buying by itself. Pioneer used the original cast and Dub names only for continuity, we all wish they didn't have to... but oh well. I bought the DVD so I could have the crystal clear picture and original language, but I got stuck with the awful dub as well. The changes they made in the dialogue in the dub were terrible, I couldn't listen to it for more than a few minutes. Do yourself a favor, buy the subtitle or the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailor Moon R movie Review","review":"A comet is heading towards earth, but like always, Usagi isn't tuned in to the news. Instead, she's worried about an old childhood friend of Mamorou's named Fiore returning from who knows where. Who is he and what does he want? Things get werid when flowers rain from the sky and a new enemy, in a plant-type form, shows up on Earth. Who is this new enemy? Is it conected with Fiore and the comet? Find out in this action packed movie! This movie was really good and had a great ending. I wouldn't reccommend it for children under 11 because it has a lot of violence, some nudity (not too bad), and some cursing (Sailor Jupiter says \\"Dammit\\" three times). Otherwise it's a great movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Don't Buy!","review":"I have seen the full English dub of Sailor Moon R. IT IS AWFUL! The lines are way different, the msic is all messed up and edited in the wrong places. I found no interest in this video. I own all 4 movies (Sailor Moon R Dub, Sailor Moon R, Sailor Moon S, and Sailor Moon SuperS) and the dub was the worst.

I cant get enough of it! I have the japanese collection as well as the english. I also have the movies, which this one is probably the best. Honestly i cannot even tell. They are all great. The animation, the writing, the charactors, everything is just perfect. Ive been a fan for some time now, and i will continue to be a fan just because of the quality of the work. Sailor Moon makes you laugh, cry, and cheer the entire time.Just perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailor Moon R: Promise of the Rose","review":"This movie was wonderfully animated and beautifully written. Although the Japanese original was better, this was one of the best DVDs I've seen yet. The VHS is not nearly as good. With all of the added extras and Japanese lyrics, you can't help but fall in love with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST FILM EVER!!!","review":"I live in London and in England it is very hard to get hold of Sailor Moon stuff. I had wanted this movie for soooo long. I was not dissapointed when I finally watched it.This movie had me gripping my legs tightly against my chest, every twist and turn was amazing. Its not just for Sailor Moon or anime fans either, the raw emotion, beautiful animation and suberb voice acting will touch the heart of anybody who has a heart to touch.Its not just soppy either, for people who dont like that stuff, there are some very cool battle scenes (did anybody else cringe when Jupiter hit that phone booth?) and a very cool song ^^Its a film for everyone (even for those friends of yours who keep telling you to stop going on about this \\"Sailor Moon\\" thing... or is that just me? ^^)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Great Movie","review":"I think this movie is super!The only eception is that it has a lot more violence then the other two movies,even though they edited it.I would probably recommend this to kids 7 and up.If you don't have this one,or the other two,don't just sit there!Go out and look for the dubbed versions[for kids],and the subtitled versions[for much older kids]. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good - not much like the NA Series","review":"My family recently purchased the movie from a different company, and we liked it so much, we're buying the other two! This is an excellent lovestory, and the English translation of \\"Moon Revenge!\\" is beautiful - I'm glad I got it subbed, not dubbed. There -are- a couple of questionable parts, but the movie is very humorous and sweet. All in all, a definite keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST ROMANCE MOVIE I'VE SEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I was so excited when I saw this movie. I bought it today at the mall.

However, I was drstically wrong. I loved the effects in this vidoe, and it was a culture shock to see how the translations differ. Although, I would not recommend this vidoe for small children because of the language and the content of the main song. If you still want a great version of the orginal japanese Sailor Moon in all of here battle fight glory then get this vidoe. It make a cool addition to your collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst dub i have ever seen","review":"The original subtitled movie was excellent. The dub was horrible. The voices were awful, the dialog was chopped up and americanized, and the music was from DIC. I hated this dub. It was a mutilation of a wonderful movie. I suggest that if anyone wants to purchase the SMR movie, to head on over to the subtitled one. It's so beautiful, sad, and just plain excellent. Do not waste your time or money on this dub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy This DVD To Show DiC A Thing Or Two.","review":"Okay everyone, lets get something straght: Pionear dubbed this, NOT DiC. But if we don't act soon DiC will get the rights to the \\"Sailor Moon S\\" series. We don't want this to happen or else we may never see a subtitled Sailor Moon anything again.

Suddenly it's all about friend ship? It wasn't like that in the sub. The sub was much better. Whats with using the power of love again? Moon Revenge is a lot better. They kept talking about friend ship wich made me want to smash my TV! And they kept saying my love which was also annoying. Too much was cut. Sailor Moon R was turned into a hideous pointless movie. I don't know why pioneer even tried. I would get the sub."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did you do?","review":"Here's my second review. Well I just looked back on my dub, after you've seen the uncut, I couldn't stand it! It was like was watching a DiC movie. I couldn't believe they even cut out the 18 seconds that Serena was unconcius for! What was wrong with that? Here's my advice for Pioneer, Sailormoon was for the teenage and adult audiences and just keep it that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dub! =)","review":"I think Pioneer did a good job with this movie. The only thing I wish they would've kept is the intro when they are riding a bus to the greenhouse and Moon Revenge at the end instead of Power of Love. But overall, it was great. Very few things were cut compared to the job Dic would've done. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well...it stay trues to the DiC dubs","review":"I know that the DiC dubs are bad. Horrible actually. But something about them always brings a smile to my face. Maybe it's their innocence, or possibly the fact that their just funny to listen to. Anyhoo Pioneer does a pretty good job conveying the spirit of the DiC original. Occasionally they did go overboard. \\"Do your thing moon mama!\\" Gag me. The options for subtitles and japanese dialogue is nice too. Though I did miss the transformation and battle music. \\"Power of love\\" was a nice extra. Must buy for any moonie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it Pioneer or Dic? You can't tell.","review":"I'll start off by saying I love Sailormoon R. This movie, however, is not Sailormoon R. It is a horribly destoyed dub that ranks up there with the work of Dic and Funimation. There are numerous unnecessary changes, a virtually rewritten script, and almost none of the real music. Whatever you do, get the subtitled video or the DVD. Just do not get the dubbed video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeewww...","review":"If you are one of those people who think DiC is a good company because they brought Sailormoon to America and so what if they edited out practically everything, it was for little kids blah blah blah... then you will LOVE this movie. Songs repeating because they aren't long enough to fit in the original's place, Dialogue dumbed down to a three year old's level with such things as \\"moon mama\\" and \\"wicked weed indeed\\", gotta LOVE that bad voice acting, too. God, I hate to think what the S movie will be like... If your a fan of the Japanese version (like me) STAY AWAY! this movie is scary. Terri Hawkes has the most ANNOYING voice on the planet. All she can do is scream like a wounded animal and say \\"wicked cool\\". Suprisingly, they didn't actually cut much. Only one or two scenes. Please, don't pay for this movie. Go buy the subtitled version, then maybe watch this on cartoon network."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome in both versions!","review":"I got the dubbed version of the movie & traded with my friend to see if the original was better. I really loved both versions. It's cool to here the original songs and words & I like that they added more words in the new version( though some were out of place) I can't wait till the other movies come out dubbed."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"Even if you DO have to endure some REALLY cheesy plant puns, this movie is still the greatest movie ever. I've never seen anything SM except for Dic's butchering of the series, but this movie is a zillion times better. Snaps to Pioneer...they could've done better but it was still so great. The end was so touching. The love between Princess Serenity and Darien was so beautifully portrayed and the anguish of the Scouts during the battle. I almost cried. I totally recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"this video whys","review":"okay, i hope you understand that i haven't seen this before, i just know that sailor moon is a good show and that this movie must be good. i love sailor moon and that is why i am righting this. buy this movie okay?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic! Dramatic, magical, humorous AND sentimental.","review":"This movie has all the things a good movie should have, and a killer finale!! If you get this movie you will not be sorry. It is good for fans of the tv show but also for those who have never seen a Sailor Moon episode before, and it stands alone quite nicely. The characters are well portrayed, dealing with questions on the meaning of friendship and loneliness amidst engaging action battle scenes. This is how a movie should be done, folks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't know what people see in it","review":"I've been told by several of my friends that this is an excellent movie, well i saw 2 seasons and hated them,but i was told that this was different. It wasn't, it was the same old washed up storylines and poor writing. Sailor Moon isn't a quality anime, it has neither the interesting charachters and interactions that have kept Inuyasha from falling into the 2 or 3 star range, nor the brilliant writing that make Fullmetal Alchemist and Cowboy Bebop some of the best examples of modern anime. skip this, theres nothing remarkable here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailor Moon Rules","review":"I thought the Sailor Moon R movie was great! I bought the dubbed version and I thought that it was great. It was great to see that the voice actors returned for this. Usually it nevers happens. I haven't had a lot of movies with subtitles but, I thought that the dubbed version did it's job! I can't wait until they put out Sailor Moon S and Sailor Moon Super S in English! Also, I would have to say that the movie should be more for teens and not for kids because it does tend to get a little too violent. Another thing I would like to add, is that it had a lot of history that I caught from the cartoon, which always makes me happy! I highly recommend this movie for every single Sailor Moon fan. It is worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Death to all Dubs!","review":"Don't think I'm just a dub hater, but this has to be the absolute worst rendition they could have possibly made of the Sailor Moon R movie. I must have seen the Japanese version a thousand times before I purchased this video, and it ruined me. Rini's overabundant use of the word \\"Mama\\" was absolutely annoying. Not only did the makers change most of the content from a Japanese to an English oriented format, but they weren't consistent with uses of the attacks, nicknames for people, etc. For instance, what was \\"Moon Princess Halation\\" in Japanese and \\"Moon Sceptor Activation\\" in English (during the series) now has become \\"Moon Princess Elimination.\\" Good grief! If you want a quality video, just check out the Japanese version. You'll be much more satisfied..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the dub - turn on subtitles and go native!","review":"Don't even bother listening to the default English dubbed version. It'll ruin things for you, especially the way the ending is slaughtered (as compared to the original Japanese ending). Go straight to the options menu, set the language to Japanese, and turn on English subtitles. Do this, then sit back and enjoy what is in essence an extended episode of Sailor Moon R. It's a good movie overall, but a bit more story would have been nice. Still, it's got moments of greatness - Chibiusa's method of \\"reviving\\" Usagi will have you wondering whether or not your DVD player is stuck on pause. ;-) As for DVD quality, it's top notch. Grab a copy - maybe your purchase will help Pioneer realize that they need to get the rights to the series (once DiC loses them). It'd be nice to see all 200 episodes plus the specials get the same DVD treatment that the R movie has received!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailor Moon Fan you must see this Movie!!!","review":"This movie is for kids and family!Yo Parent this a great movie no cusing,no voilence,no s..e...double crossed hockey sticks!

I give no info about the characters in the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning","review":"I had to say I was quite disappointed with the English Sailor Moon R movie. I've seen both the english version and the japanese one and I believe the japanese is better. For one thing there were way to many puns in the american one. Also Fiore, a villain, has the same voice as Chad(that should say something). in the japanese one he has one that suits his character. Also the chibi serena sounds like a Care Bear. In the japanese one she has the most adorable voice. But they also trashed the most tender scene at the end when Sailor Moon said \\"Mamoru (darien), Minna (Everyone) I told you i wouldn't let anyone be alone (well something like that I don't have the exact words, but it was sweet.) So I reccomend you either see this before the japanese one. Or just buy the japanese one with subtitles, your not missing much"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailor Moon R is da best movie ever made right now!","review":"I luv da movie. It was great!

I haven't seen the other movies yet, but I hope they are better than this one. The story has barely any plot at all, and one of the \\"bad guys\\" looks familiar... Can you guess who it looks like?

YOU HAVE TO WATCH ALL 3 OF THE SAILORMOON MOVIES...SERIOUSLY, I KID YOU NOT! OK, I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THEM DUBBED IN ENGLISH YET, BUT I WILL, SO I HOPE THAT THEY ARE GOOD. BUT THE SUBTITLED ONES ARE AWESOME! THE MUSIC AND DIALOGUE (ALTHOUGH I CANNOT UNDERSTAND EITHER WITHOUT THEM SUBS) HAS GOT ME SINGING IN JAPANESE! SO ALL OF YOU ANIME FANS, DON'T THINK SAILORMOON IS JUST FOR KIDS, IT HAS ACTION AND ROMANCE ALL ROLLED INTO ONE! SAILORMOON ROCKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick","review":"Alright, I see that if you have only seen the dub before, you might enjoy this movie. But if you're like me, and have already seen the three movies in Japanese or the series to that matter this movie will suck eggs. There is dialogue that should not be there, unnecessary dialogue (one of the most stupid is when Mamoru stops Fiore with his cane, Usagi or dubbed Serena says \\"Be careful my masked man\\" in this horrible sugar-sweet voice).It's expected that the homo-sexual references would be edited, it is dubbed for a 4-12 audience, but well, it wasn't as good as it could have been, which could have been much, much better. The only good thing about this is that the USA has made Sailormoon more available to Americans that are not able to see the original series, which might open up for future dubbing for other anime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I really like the first Sailor moon movie. If you're a Darien fan you might REALLY want to see this one. It explains all about his past! All the extras are good. The only problem is if you're watching the english version the Japanese movie songs are playing not the english songs for some reason. What's really good about these tapes are you get to see both versions of the show. I must say the Japanese version is much better than the english version...."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Sailor Moon movie was the best!","review":"I have seen all three Sailor Moon movies and I must say that out of all three, this one is definately the best. It has a great storyline, cool characters with awesome powers, and is an overall fun movie. I give it five stars because thats what it deserves! I highly recommend this movie to any Sailor Moon fan. And if you don't like Sailor Moon, don't worry. This movie will get you addicted. Believe me because this movie is the reason that I love Sailor Moon today."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Version Definitely The Way To Go!!!","review":"If you really like Sailor Moon, I strongly recommend you to get the DVD version(s). In the long run, DVD's are cheaper if you want both the English Subbed and the English Dubbed versions. Great Movie, probably the best of the three, although Sailor Moon S Movie comes in a close second. I can't wait until the S and SuperS Seasons come out on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the dvd version!!!!!!","review":"Ok this movie is bad. . If you like uncut sailor moon like me get the dvd version. Do not get this tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"You've gotta get it.","review":"The Sailor Moon R Movie is easily the best of the three movies, and far better than anything in the series - at least in the American dub. The art work is of the highest quality and the humor is great (picture Usagi kissing a slug.) But this movie's greatest strength is it's intriguing plotline. The villain has motivation! *GASP*There's only one drawback... it's not for little kids. It's in the original Japanese form, so it's not watered down. First of all, the villain is gay. To quote Ami, \\"It seems Mamoru is popular even with the boys.\\" (Hehe.) Also, there's really minor nudity. The transformations show a little more of the body lines, plus the bad guy yanks Sailor Moon's Crystal, which makes her un-transform. Fortunately, streaming ribbons cover the important places. The last thing is that it's a tad more violent... as in there's blood. But none of these things should bother people over ten. Soooo... go out there and buy it! You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailor Moon R Rocked!!!","review":"I am a supper fan of Sailor Moon, and have seen every show, own all the manga, and have watched all three movies. Out of them all, my favorite has been Sailor Moon R. I have only seen the English version, and though I don't know what people are talking about when they say how horrible it is, I do understand that parents in America may not approve of some of the things they show in Japan. I thought that the storyline was good even though it suggested slight homosexuality. At first I did not even realise that was what they were talking about, I just thought that Feorie(sorry if I spelled it wrong)was a lonly person and that his only friend had been Darian(Mamaru). The ending was spectacular, I watched that part so many times that I have the song in it memorised. If you are thinking of buying it, do so! I recomend that you don't show it to younger kids, some parts are for mature kids only!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sailor Moon in trouble.......","review":"I watched the japanese version of this video before I watched this one, and thought that DIC did a very bad job with the voices. There were lines left out and when they translated it, there were some stupid lines that they put in that movie. The uncut japanese movie was way better! Should watch that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"My thoughts on the dubbed Sailor Moon R","review":"This movie has got to be my favorite of the three but the dubbed version does absolutely no justice to the original Japanese version. The dubbed version of this movie is what got me hooked on Japanese animation but since I've seen the subtitled version I think dubbing it made it incredibly, excuse me for lack of a better word, dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"GET THE SUB NOT THE DUB","review":"Ok I bought this just to see how well they could do the dub. I was disapointed if you have not seen the sub then the plot of the dub doesnot make much sence. and whats up with Chibiusa calling Usagi Moon Momma. Its A great movie if you buy the sub but a bad movie if you by the dub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do I have to give it one star? I'd give a 5, a NEGATIVE 5","review":"The simplest way to put it is PRETTY DAM AWFUL! This dubbing stuff suxs. DiC or Pioneer, either way u lose! I rented this movie (thank god I don't have to keep it!) and I was so dissapointed I mean what is up w/ \\"Moon Mama\\" ?and when Chibi-Usa(Rini) is sitting on the roof (what the heck is she doing on the roof anywayz?)and she says \\"don't worry, we're protected by moon power\\" and don;t even get me started on poor voice acting. Terri Hawkes YOu can do better! Fiore and Darien. ugh cover your ears cover your ears! WEll I just to say to all those scary people who thought this movie was GREAT.

In my opinion, they compleatly ruined the two most important, heart felt parts of the whole entire movie! It was so bad, it frusterated me to tears! I couldn't even stand to have it in my house, I gave it away. If you grew up on the american dubbed Sailor Moon shows, and have not yet had the pleasure of seeing the actual Japanese Sailor Moon shows, then this probobly won't bother you so badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY MUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT!","review":"I first want to say that this dubbed movie was barney-fied. Most of the translation was wrong. The story plot was a little bit changed. A lot of parts was cut, but I can understand that part because this movie was for little kids. I hope they will do better on the next movie. If you have never seen Sailor Moon before, do not start with this movie, or see the sub-titiled version first. If you begin with this verion of the movie, you will not like Sailor Moon, and Sailor Moon is one of the most awesome Japanese Animation. That's all I have to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Word: HORRID","review":"The dubbed version of this movie was horrid.. what was Pioneer thinking? I've seen both versions, the dubbed and the subtitled, the subtitled is great, but the translation could've been done A LOT better. The entire meaning of the movie and message was lost with all the corny lines and cliche sayings. This made this movie one of the worst dubbed movies that I have seen. If you want to see a great movie, buy the subtitled version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Problems","review":"I thought this movie was pretty good, especially since they used some of the japanese names, but my favorite part was the opening scene wich had Super Sailor Moon and the Super Sailor Scouts. I think that all viewers should be aware that this movie SHOULD NOT BE RATED 3 AND UP! It should be rated 13 AND UP! There is too much nudity for it to be rated 3 and up! I think that you should give it a second thought, unless you don't mind the nudity. Overall, I thought it was pretty good (at least you don't have to read the subtitles:) But I do not recommend this movie for small children. They really didn't cut anything out. It's quite a bit different from the Dic episodes. I think the song \\"The Power Of Love\\" is pretty good:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"I liked Bishoujo Senshi Seraamuun R the Movie, but Sailor Moon R the movie was...horrible. The dubbing was bad, the English V.A.'s were bad..At least some of the original music was kept it.

Any other senshi fans who want to e-mail me, go ahead I'love to network.And thanks to ever one assosiated with sailor moon *peace sign*:P"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent Video, Everyone Should Own It","review":"It was a great video. When I first got it I thought reading the subtitles was going to be miserable and make it difficult to watch the movie as well. But it was easy. You get in the habit of reading it that you almost forget you are reading it. The graphics were great as well. It was neat to be able to watch Sailor Moon without the English touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie Was The Best!!!","review":"The animation was incredible. Moon Revenge was a great song! Everything about this movie rocked. It was my favorite. I really don't like Rini( Chibi-Usa) and she wasn't a main part of the movie and that's another reason why I liked it. It focused on my favorite Scout. Sailor Moon not to mention Darien. I can't wait till it's dubbed!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Shojo anime movie!!!!","review":"This has got to be one of the best shojo animes out there. I was a huge fan of Sailor Moon, and I got this because it was subbed and the original Japanese version. I loved it!! The music kicks some serious, uh, butt. The storyline is great, as is the determination and courage of the Sailor Senshi (\\"Scouts\\" sounds SO stupid!!) The end almost made me cry. The attacks and transformations are incredible. This is such a great, awesome film!! You'll LOVE the music! Even if you aren't a Sailor Moon or anime freak (like me) you'll still love this! Get it now! It rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Sailormoon movie!","review":"Unoriginal title, I know, but it's very true... Of all the 3 Sailormoon movies, this one actually moved me. I'm not gonna tell ya that I actually... well... It was a very emotional movie, I'll tell you that. It shows the importance of friendship in a way that is undoubtedly \\"Sailormoon\\". It's better to buy this than any dubbed version because the voice actors' voices do a great job with representing the characters' personalities, and dubbing usually tampers with this. It also gives you the feel of the original Sailormoon. Plus, the ending song, Moon Revenge, is really great! Even if you don't understand Japanese, you have to hear it. If you're new to watching original Japanese movies, I guarantee you that you'll appreciate them more after watching this. Even if you're new to Sailormoon in general, this is something you HAVE to see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally the Sailor Moon series will get its justice!","review":"I am happy that the 3 Sailor Moon movies are finally coming out and will be uncut. Unfortunatley DiC practically ruined the first 2 Sailor Moon series and given it a bad name, so if you think uncut Sailor Moon is the same way, it's not! I have most of all the series subtitled and its a lot better then the dubbed version. Anyways this movie is cool, even though it's not my favorite out of the three, but I recommend it for anyone who has seen the Japanese Sailor Moon or Americanized version and likes it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I did not think I was going to like it, but after watching it once I could not keep from watching again and again. . . It is a must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this version, buy the Subtitled version!","review":"The sailor moon R movie is the the greatest sailor moon animated thing in existence, but the dubbed version is a travesty. the people responsible cut important/good scenes, changed the dialouge to cover up the slightly homosexual relationship between mamoru and fiore, and overall made the movie very juvenile. This is the greatest movie ever (almost) but do yourself a favor and get the subtitled original!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what!","review":"This movie........ arrghh! i absolutly loved the Subtitledversion....... The new dubs spit on naoko's genius, and give shame tosailormoon. it is just right for people who just like sailormoon a little, but if you are a passionate SM lover, go with the Japanese version. The dubs were wrong and frankly im very afraid of what they will do about chibimoon. true SM lovers beware.............

It's Moooooon Reveeenge, woo - ooo...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Domo Arigato Pioneer!!","review":"It's about time that North America gets access to what I think is the 2nd best of the 3 Sailor Moon movies (of course, when they're all great, picking a favorite is tough)! It has a very involving plot, the animation is incredible, as usual, and you get a lot of background information about Mamoru (AKA Darien).The reason I don't give it five stars is that the story does seem to drag on at some points. Also, the story is more of a \\"Gung-ho, let's save the universe\\" instead of the upbeat comedy, although there is some humor laced in.The best part about this movie is that it has the song \\"Moon Revenge,\\" my personal favorite from all the Sailor Moon soundtracks. We can only hope that DiC doesn't screw around with it in the dubbed version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scouts vs. Senshi","review":"Wow! I have almost always been a huge fan of Sailor Moon, but there was that iffy time when it came out. I was into Power Rangers and Barney. ^_^;; I was five! Anyway, in the dub, Luna sounds around 50, but in this version, she sounds eighteen. Moon Revenge, the fight and end song, is FANTASTIC, and Moonlight Densutsu is extremely awesome. I loved the comedy in it, and the heart. Firoe is *ahem* somewhat blatant with his feelings towards Mamoru (This is not for little kids, mind you.), and he annoyed me immensely. ^_^ Ah, young love. I've barely taken it out of my VCR. It's a good buy, and so are the other movies. Usagi, Mamoru, Makoto, Rei, Ami, ChibiUsa, Artimus, and Luna: The majority of the Senshi, and the sum of the \\"R\\" season. Watch this, and appreciate the art in this movie. Especially the end. BEAUTIFUL! Thank you for your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"First, let me tell you about the movie. Its about the Sailor scouts and a child hood friend of Dariens(fiore)Darien is taken from earth and its up to serena and the others to save him.I bought the video and when i got home i watched it then again. It just never gets old. Its typical imaginative genius and if u dont buy the movie from here buy it somewhere!!My reveiw doesnt do it justice!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Groovy baby!","review":"This movie is great! If you have seen the (gag!) English dubbed and edited version, you'll understand this and love it! You find out a lot about Tuxedo Mask's past. I also heard this movie is coming out dubbed and un-edited, and I think most people should get that version. The sales of that version might persuade the producers of the English version to Dub the rest of the series---UNedited! I mean, come on. To all the parents who believe this, I HIGHLY doubt your kids will turn gay from seeing homosexuals on TV. Anyway...I encourage you to buy the dubbed/unedited version, but if want ORIGINAL Sailormoon, buy this sub!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and neato! But.. Dubbed in Japanese?

In this movie, an alien named Fiore, who was possessed by an evil flower, tried to take over Earth. The subtitled version of this movie was great. The dubbed DVD version is also great, with original music. The dubbed VHS, however, is kind of lousy because it did not use original music, AND Pioneer was lazy enough to reuse \\"Power of Love\\" from the series and not make new music. But alltogether, this was a great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Promise of the Rose","review":"One thing is that DiC dubbed this and did a horrible job on the voices! Pioneer just put the clips together from DiC's dubbing. So get one this straight, DiC dubbed and Pioneer edited the movie! The information is from the actual SOS site! It also is at official Sailor Moon sites. All you have to think about is...Fiore (Fiole) says he's come back to take Mamoru(Darien) away from the humans who have hurt him. He intends to destroy all other humans, starting with Usagi(Serena)! How do Mamoru(Darien) and Fiole know each other? Why does Tuxedo Mask use roses? How does Usagi's(Serena's) friendship bring together five girls who are all so different? When did Usagi(Serena) and Mamoru(Darien) really meet for the first time, and how much will Usagi have to sacrifice in order to save everyone?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this DVD!","review":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon R is a spectacular DVD with selectable English/Japanese audio track (stick with the Japanese, trust me) and subtitles. The main music numbers are subtitled both in Romaji and English. The ending is spectacular and a real tear jerker. Supplemental character bios, picture gallery, and alternate musical pieces round out a well composed offering from Pioneer. The English dub track is mildly interesting as a laughable cultural artifact; nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's okay, but they took out some good parts!","review":"It was a great movie, but I think DIC did a much better job dubbing.

After watching it for about 10 minutes, I had to leave the store in disgust. The dubbed version of Sailor Moon was AWFUL! Dic removed most of the superb Japanese music, leaving awkward dead air in some spots. The rewritten dialogue was even worse. They just added in stupid one-liners that would appeal more to 5-year-olds. When Rini said \\"Do your thing, Moon Mama!\\" that was about when I left the store, grimacing. If you can get the original Japanese uncut version, you MUST see it! The music is beautiful and, most importantly, it's UNCUT! It's 100 times better that anything Dic could ever dub."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailor Moon R","review":"The best moive that I have seen. The whole movie was worth watch.

I thought the voice actors did very well and plus--BIG SHOCKER--they didn't dub out Serena's nudity! ^.^ I've read the original Japanese document on this movie and the dub seems to be pretty close to the original. I've never seen the original but the document is proof enough. I would've loved Toby Proctor's voice for Tux but that's the way things go sometimes...

Terrible voice acting, and who the heck decided to let them say such bull?? But the subtitled version....WOW!! Okay, I don't really understand Japanese, but after comparing the German, English and the subtitled versions with the information I got from the movie book, I think the subtitles are extremely close to the original. Basically, I've watched three different movies.I've been a fan for almost six years, and I've wanted this DVD for a long time. And as I had to buy an import in Germany, I had to shell out 36 euros (that's more than 30 dollars!!). But it is worth it!! And hey, now I even know the song lyrics!!

I read some reviews before I ordered it, all I can say is I'm glad I didn't believe any of the negative reviews! The entire Fiore/Darien/Serena triangle made for an intense storyline. (the animation wasn't too bad either!) Anything that gives us loyal SM fans insight into Serena and Darien's past I'm for it! Even though it still left you with some questions, like why did Fiore look just like Alan, from Ann & Alan of the Doom Tree series? If he was one of them why didn't the scouts or Darien inform him that he had family out in space with the doom tree. I'm sure he would have felt more at ease before he went spinning off into space alone, after saving Sailor Moon's life.

The subtitled is better but just like S the dub isn't that bad. In fact, i only saw a few changes. And they're understandable. Power of Love replaces Moon revenge but it fits somehow. However, I will say the one thing that really irritated me is that they altered the ending quotes. In the subtitled Sailor Moon says: \\"I told you I would protect you all.\\" and in the dub she says: \\"So from now on when i say it'll be alright, you'll believe me?\\" But like the s, if you're a big fan, worth it.

If you've only watched the dub vhs, you are missing out. Not only on the vhs are parts cut, but you don't have the original music. At least with the dvd, you get the original movie opening, ALL the japanese background songs, AND AND Moon Revenge to be playing at the end instead of Power of Love. The great features includes: The vhs opening scenes w/ the american sailor moon opening song, the cut Power of Love Ending, pictures from the movie, clips from the movie with little bios, AND AND the option to revert to japanese w/ subtitles for you purists. In the subbed version, not only do you get the translation to Moon Revenge but when the credits role, you'll get both translation and japanese romaji. ^_^ The image quality on the DVD is 1000x better than the vhs(or my fansubbed one) A must for any sailor moon fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain disappointment","review":"I just do not know where to start. I love Sailormoon it's practicaully my infatuation! After I saw this movie I was just so disappointed. I mean the story plot was so how do I put it... hmm... (...) I mean what's up with Darian and Forie's friendship! More like relationship.. I mean they are just (...)!!!!! I cannot believe the story plot! It was just extremely lame... The song was good and everything, I just wish that it wasn't so corny! Plus this moive took out way too many scenes and the dubs were good and everything but (...)... I give it two starts because the plot was way too corny for me to handle... I hope the other moives aren't like this.."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Sailor Moon but I think this would be better if ?","review":"They would produce a dubbed and editted version of Sailor Moon R on DVD.

It is bad enough that DiC had to RUIN Sailormoon by dubbing the first two seasons(which they did very poorly, in my honest opinion), but did Pioneer have to ruin the Sailormoon R movie, too? Why must they distroy a wonderful anime by 'censoring' it for little 8-year-old kids? Why not just put a 'For 13 and Up' sticker on the box like they did for the subtitled version? I can only pray that they do not dub the other movies and/or seasons. Sure, it would be nice to see the Sailormoon S, Sailormoon SuperS, and Sailormoon Stars seasons get subtitled. But, watching the dubbed versions? Sorry, not happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiore vs. Sailor Moon","review":"in R Movie no one at all does love Sailor Moon to Fiore but he very evil to destroy her,in R Fiore Kindap and capture her to the final in the movie but he hug her, maybe he does like to fell in love and kiss to Sailor Moon. if Fiore want to Destroy Sailor Moon in Japanese or America, I like Japanese the one Fiore grad her to been Capture or Kindap to Sailor Moon,and I like the America than as Japanese, but Fiore want to Capture or Kindap to Sailor Moon, but Fiore Does love and kiss her after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video","review":"Well, lets see...

Nevertheless, this is the movie any Sailor Moon fan should get.On another note, the soundtrack is in MONO for reasons I can't understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"To me this is probably the best sailormoon movie. It has action and a grest plot. The fighting scenes are great (but maybe too violent for little kids). The Enemies are cool but not as cool as the snow dancers on the S movie.... though the S movie has a weak plot. If you want to see the outer senshi you should get the S movie. I reccomend (is that spelled right) this movie out of the three. It is by far the best.... unless your one of those outers or chibi moon fans......... ok sorry that was short...... that pretty much sums it up (without giving away spoilers)........ ok i bet i had a lot of spelling errors............nevermind...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality not worth ANYONE'S time!","review":"This was a great TV show but the transfer is just about as bad as can be.

The first disc is definitely easier to listen to because oof the mic skills of Rob O and Grap Luva. Standout tracks: The Life I live, Square One, Fakin' Jax,and Mind Over Matter. Definite treasure. If you want that ol' '94 flava type Pete Rock, this is the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Hip Hop from one of the Innovators","review":"Those who are educated in the hip hop arena all know the Pete Rock embodies the spirit of hip hop. Classic albums such Main Ingredient and Mecca Soul Brother have made Pete Rock the essence of mid 90's hip hop: excellent smooth lyrics without the rash of rhymes about guns, money or 'hoes', excellent production, chill beats with interesting samples. This album, Lost and Found, is no exception. This album has all these things listed above. It easily makes the top portion of my favorite hip hop list near Common's 'Resurrection', Black Star, Talib Kweli and Hi Tek's 'Eternal Reflection, and People Under the Stairs' 'O.S.T' If you're looking for other awesome hip hop, check out these albums as well.

It is moving, compelling, and poignant. She is truly a courageous woman. Her story is a must read for other women who are being abused or stalked. It talks about her faith and how she survived a terrible ordeal. One more thing: the two negative reviews are absurd, attacking Faulkner for being self-absorbed because she writes about herself in her own autobiography. In an autobiography, you are supposed to write about yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self absorbed ego trip","review":"It is painfully obvious that the only thing Harris Faulkner wants to do is talk about Harris Faulkner. This so called autobiographical account is really a cry for help from an insecure person who desperately wants everyone to think she's courageous. As a victim of stalking myself it is obvious to me that she is making stuff up and warping the truth to make everything about her. This is pure fiction. Don't waste your time buying or reading this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get it","review":"This book is very preachy. The woman is self absorbed and only looking to make a name for herself.Boring"},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Cuisine","review":"This recipe collection is organized by astrological sign using different elements,seasonings, and colors linked to attributes. Each section begins with a brief discussion of the particular sign and its tendencies as both a cook and guest, followed by suggested menu organization. The recipes are always prefaced by an entertaining description of the significance of the ingredients, such as \\"Semolina is milled from wheat, a cereal that belongs to the Earth Mother and Roman goddess Ceres, who represents Virgo...a sign concerned with the work necessary to produce the fruits of the earth.\\" Ingredients and preparation steps are organized for ease and simplicity. This book is fun to read and the recipes are unusual consistently good. I looked for this author hoping she had written another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get a clue...GET A PANDA!!!!!","review":"This show is one of the greatest shows ever aired. It is rude, often out of control, but most of all it is just so painfully funny in its own way. Besides doing things with pupets that has never been done (sometimes for good reason) with an obviously small budget, the songs are amazing. The musical satires on Sifl and Olly blow Wierd Al out of the water with ease. Spanning any genre you can think of any many that don't yet exist, the songs are crafted so well that you can't help admiring Liam and Matt.It baffles me that this show has not been released on DVD yet. I missed getting Season 3 in the short time it must have been available. One of the great and unappriciated shows ever deserves to get some more attention, not to mention DVD releases and cool merchandise.I hope that MTV comes to its senses and decides to share the joy of Sifl and Olly with the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Precious Roy","review":"Back when MTV had the audacity to show music videos, they aired a show that featured sock puppets posing as con-men, TV show hosts, the devil, wimpy side-kicks, shifty used car salesmen...nothing on this show made sense. It was ridiculous. Its sock puppets for crying out loud. I've rarely laughed so hard in my entire life. If the Universe is truly a good place, soon all of these episodes will be available on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tell a friend","review":"The only song that received any real play from this CD was Tony Rich's achingly introspective and sorrowful 'Nobody Knows' (It was also reasonably covered by country artist Kevin Sharp). That's a shame because this is an excellent CD that deserves a greater audience than it has received to date. Mr. Rich is an amazing talent who was responsible for just about every creative element in the creation of this piece of work. The CD starts with the haunting song 'Hey Blue' that sets a high bar that is easily maintain throughout. Some CDs need to be given to friends to be \\"discovered\\". Do yourself a favor, by this CD twice - once for yourself and once for a friend.

The woman , as we all know has the voice of an angel, and as she herself says in the accompanying booklet,\\"The music is there for the individual to paint their own picture\\". The gift of being able to express trough music ones own experiences of life, and do it in an accesable way that others can relate to, is a truly wonderful thing.I have had the pleasure of attending three Stevie Nicks performances, - the first at Wembley arena inLondon with Fleetwood Mac, then at the Wembley stadium again with Fleetwood Mac , and most recently a solo performance at Jones beach, Long Island, New York.Boy, can she knock out a tune.Well done Stevie, keep up the good work, and lets hope you manage to tour Britain in the not too distant future! Excellent c.d package,well put together and not thrown together.Superb value for anyones money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Box Set","review":"This set is a great collection from one of Rock's most enchanting singer/songwriters. I have been a Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks fan since the '70's, so I was very pleased when this release came out. It does a great job of covering Stevie's great solo career. I heard that there even more songs that she wanted to put on this set but was forced to settle for 3 discs only. I definately would have bought it with another disc on it. I just hope that they will re-release Buckingham/Nicks on cd soon. Both her and Lindsey said they would like to do it, so hopefully they will surprise us some day. It was great to have songs like Long Distance Winner, Gold, It's Late, Whenever I Call You Friend, Gold and Braid and Reconsider Me on this set. I'm also eagerly awaiting her new cd. She hasn't had one since 1994, so hurry up already Stevie. If you are a big Stevie fan, you must get this set. Let us know what you think of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"A very good overview of Stevie's solo work-certainly more comprehensive than Timespace. There are a lot of unknown gems to be found here. I'm not sure why she included \\"Gold\\" and \\"Whenever I call You Friend\\" on this album-even though she sang on them they aren't her songs. I would've rather heard another rarity or another song off of Buckingham/Nicks. Overall, a very strong collection, indicating that even without Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie can make great music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT","review":"I am thrilled that Stevie Nicks is finally being appreciated. It seems that she has been derided as an airhead and that her success in Fleetwood Mac was a fluke. This boxed set proves otherwise. My favorite track is \\"Reconsider Me,\\" an outtake from the Rock a Little sessions, which ranks with her best material. I love the way she concludes the song atop the guitar chorus. I would have given 5 stars except for the omission of \\"Ghosts\\" and \\"Maybe Love.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomonally Passionate with a hard groove of the past.","review":"Stevie Nicks has once again out done herself. She some how knows exactly what her fans wants and needs are, and is able to deliver in double doses. She has come a long way from her days as Lindsey Buckingham's side kick in Fleetwood Mac. She has proven that women still rule rock 'n roll. She goes from campy songs such as \\"Whenever I call you friend\\" to hard edged hits like \\"Edge of Seventeen.\\" She helps us relive her days in Mac with a new rendition of \\"Rhiannon\\" yet leaves us knowing exactly who she is, why's she here, and why she'll never leave. Good job Stevie, and congrats!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stevie Nicks-Enchanting","review":"I bought this in January 08' and I love it. There are three very well documented cds of Ms.Nicks' career. This week, I have especially enjoyed cd 3 and the cover of Free Fallin'. I think that I like Stevie's version better than Tom Pettys. So many hits on all 3 cds! I wish that I had seen the Enchanted tour now that I own the box set. Great listening!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"enchanted","review":"This box-set goes beyond the traditional \\"best of\\" albums. From the unheard flip side of 45's to her sound track cuts, Stevie shares more of herself through songs you would have missed if you never had a turn table. Of course, the ultimate collection is to have all of the albums Stevie has put out. There were several songs from her Rock a Little and Street Angel albums that I found moving, that were not included. I also feel one of her better duets, Smiling Islands, should have been included. I cant find that song anywhere. With her enchanted voice and style, Stevie takes you through her life and touches your soul. She shares the best and gives written insight in what is behind many of the songs. Her story is well worth listening too."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Enchanted\\" music for enchanted fans...","review":"This is absolutely a must have collection for any Stevie Nicks fan! Having been a fan of her's since the Buckingham/Nicks days, I have collected nearly everything she's done. This set includes many tracks you just can't find anywhere else. \\"Thousand Days\\" absolutely rocks, as does every other track. None of this is filler or padding. Every one of these songs could easily stand on its own as a single, and many of them have. This version of \\"Rhiannon\\" simply chills me to the bone, and \\"Gold and Braid\\" is vintage Stevie. This set is ample proof that Stevie is still the Queen of Rock, and I'm happy to see her back where she belongs.....on top! Can't wait for the concert!"},{"rating":"2","title":"3 CDs OF HITS. IT JUST ENCHANTS YOU AND ME!","review":"A 3 disc box set that includes Nicks' best and all of the rest. This 1998 released box set is all about what Stevie was going through at the time.

Nicks' work is best whenever and wherever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"If you are a Stevie fan like I am this is a must have for everyone. She really makes the music her own with this set, and really weaves a musical spell with this set. My favorite is \\"Twisted\\" from the hit movie \\"Twister\\".

Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this product. Not only was the production quality extremely poor (it was worse than a home video - just one big blownout light from the front) but it appeared to me that this tape was thrown together in an hour. It was also a very short tape in which the entire instructional portion was performed WITHOUT MUSIC?! (Perhaps her boom box \\"play\\" key was stuck?) I do not understand how you can teach someone to \\"dance\\" without music. Especially ME dance as an understanding of the rhythms is key to the movement. I found this video of extremely poor quality, which was immediately evidenced upon glancing at the out-of-focus photographs on the video box. (Not in a \\"special effect\\" way, either). Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality grill pan for home use","review":"It's not a commercial grade pan but it's heavy like one. It has a padded handle which is comfortable and avoids heating up. It's very deep to avoid splattering and the grill marks are raised quite high. The coating on the pan is thick; this pan will last. We use it probably four times a week and it cleans up great. It's my favorite grill pan so far because of its depth; holds a lot and stovetop doesn't get splattered on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent pan!","review":"We love ournew grill pan! This pan is very versitle. We use it all of the time. It is deep enough to guard against splattering, heats evenly and is large enough to cook a complete meal in it.

It's laid out like a true encyclopedia -- just look up \\"tomatoes\\" or \\"goats\\" or whatever interests you, and learn everything there is to know about growing, keeping, and using them in the home/farm.

It is anectdotal and random and very HUMAN and I love it. Some have complained that it isn't concise...that it is hard to find only the hard info in all the stories and observations and shared information from readers over the years...and for those people I am thankful that they are able to find some of the more focused works to serve their needs. This is a life's work for Carla Emery...and a continually evolving thing. She has been through a lot and shared much of it with her readers...like a helpful neighbor with some vital chicken info or soap making advice to relay over the backyard fence...and I have appreciated this book for years. It's not perfect...but it's very good and fun to read and worthwhile.

The knowledge in this book is extremely thorough and the slow presentation of information makes it more likely to be remembered when needed than from such books as Back to Basics or Storey's Basic Country Skills. I find that this retention is a great thing so that you do not always have to keep referenceing the book or kicking yourself when you go to buy your first sheep and cannot remember what you are supposed to look for.I also love the recipes. They are concise, easy to follow, and several are presented on any given page."},{"rating":"1","title":"good gift","review":"I bought this for myself, but would not do again. A much to large tome, very confusing at times and boring. Maybe for a serious farmer it MIGHT be interesting, but for the average consumer it is to dry and boring.

Might be donated to the local public book source soon, not worth the shelf space in my opinion. Spend your precious cash elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religious Jargon","review":"If you want to be preach at, Read this book!!

Then Ben spends nearly 300 pages trying to convince his friends of who he really is. Now you lost me, Mr. Brooks.Your characters can't possibly be THIS stupid. As a reader, it's frustrating seeing the story take so long to get to the point. For another, I didn't know or care what the black unicorn was or why everyone wanted it. I stopped reading at page 250-something (out of 309 pages). If it takes longer than that to reveal such an important plot point, you just didn't tell the story correctly.

What you do find is kobolds, fairies and unicorns (of course).3) Main character Ben Holiday is a likeable human in a magical world.4) Meeks the \\"evil\\" wizard seemed too much a stereotypical bad guy. He was a bit boring in my opinion.5) The rest of the cast (defunked wizard, \\"dog\\" man, and the offspring of fairies and wood nymphs) was an interesting change to the standard fighter, caster, theif combo."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Book!","review":"An exciting book filled with twists and turns that leaves the audience on the edge of their seats.

Very nice and original plot. A five star book in my opinion. The best part being that it was a book by itself, no sequels, everything was perfectly finished, no open ending, the villain(s) were dead or beaten. Recently I found out that there were sequels to this book. I decided to buy the second book, and immediateley after I started reading it I got a little bit disappointed. The plot is so extremely obvious that while reading the book you are wondering on what page Ben will find the truth of the matter. The reader knows this from almost page one. Nightshade (supposed to be dead in the fairy world with the ending of book one) miraculously re-appears.

(They [Amazon] don't have a listing for this format). This is a tale of good v. evil, with Ben Holiday, and a host of odd creatures, seeking to find the Black Unicorn, and to destroy the books of magic. As part of the Kingdom of Landover series, by Terry Brooks, it creates a magical world; where the final battle between Ben, and Questor Thews, one of the two wizards, and half brothers, battle over the destruction of the magic books. Also, there are a talking dog, a fairy like creature, who Ben loves, and a talking cat. Mr. Brooks has created a whimsical, but fine story. The audio cassette, out of print, is well read by Mr. Dick Hill; whose ability to create various voices, and express a wide range of emotions, speaks to his credit as a reader.

The greater the experience you have with other languages, the shorter the warm-up period. Then, buy this book. The chapters on the language description and OOP are models of clarity and brevity, in any book/reference and any language. All the other chapters are extremely useful too. This book complements perfectly the official library and language references, and covers almost everything you will ever need.

Each section contains both reference material and text packed with core concepts, examples, rules-of-thumb, and practical advice.Rather than duplicate existing documentation, the author has been highly selective and guides you to the most important parts of CPython, Jython, and third-party extensions. Without this book, expert assistance would be needed to effectively select the best python toolsets.For people with older Python books, this one will best bring you up to speed with Python 2.2 and beyond.

If you like Wax Trax records, harder electronica like Front 242 then you'll be pleasantly surprised with Bucket's stuff. He defies being in a category and for someone like myself who generally abhors what they play on the radio his music is a welcome relief from the norm. He's got the talent, his music can be challenging, but when it comes down to it, he delivers in a big way.

I don't know what he was going for on this one, but you really only get a few trance-type songs and some odd noise songs? with very minimal guitar! I really love his Monsters and Robots, Giant Robot, most of Colma, COBRA STRIKE, PRAXIS-Transmutation...and Metatron, but I feel this CD is really lacking in what Buckethead is capable of doing. Very odd and disappointing (I already sold mine on e-bay). Sorry again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another suprise from the man in the white mask","review":"This Cd blends some of the strangest guitar/electronic music that I have ever heard. The songs that are featured here are selections from all over Bucket's career. I think that this CD is nice because you get a good balance of his hard rock/alternative style and also his melody and beat oriented emotional stuff. I don't think that if you really listen to this CD that you can say that it is a bad CD. A few of the tracks on the CD are annoying. They are just composed of sounds that he tries to blend together to make a song (it doesn't work to well) Also every song has a really long and usually bad introduction to the actual song, all you have to do is fast forward about 30-40 seconds into each song and you will get to the good parts.

It has a folksy tone which should be accessible to most people. It covers a range of topics, such as life after death, euthanasia reincarnation etc., none of which are dealt with at any depth. I found it a little facile in it's analysis and the style was marred by numerous lapses in grammar. It contains some interesting case studies, several of which are open to a variety of interpretations, although the author seems to accept unquestioningly the one which suits her particular purpose. There is no coherent view of life and death presented but rather a pastiche of various half developed \\"new age\\" type theories. It's not a book I would give to anyone facing death and it certainly added nothing new to my own thinking on life, the universe and everything, but some of the studies were mildly interesting in places"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than meets the Eye","review":"The book was very interesting!

I pulled it out the other day hoping it had ripened with age, but sadly it was rotten. It's my opinion that the quality of this recording was compromised to keep Mr. Plant on board -- he didn't want to make a traditional Jimmy Page produced guitar orchestra record. So what we are left with is sparse arrangements that only hint at the drama possible. There's good stuff here, but it feels rushed to press and lacks the solid production signature we expect from Jimmy Page, even when shackled with hack David Coverdale. 2001 may bring a new Page/Plant CD -- hopefully this one will return Jimmy to the wheel where he belongs. Oh, and by the way, Plant's singing has never been more nasal and whining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointing","review":"Its very hard to understand how two seasoned musicians of the calibre of Page and Plant could produce such a dud album.The production sounds like some cheap demo, but not in a good sense, just dull and flat. After Jimmys return to form on the Coverdale Page album, he sounds restrained and uninspired on this one. (much like he did on Zeps Inn through the Out Door)And I dont care what Mr.Plant thinks, the vocal performance and the songs on this disc still arnt as good as any Whitesnake album.Rob hasnt sounded any good since Physical Graffiti anyway, but all of his post Zep work still craps on this effort.If your gonna bag Coverdale you have to do better than this! What a letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Led Zeppelin Would Have Been?","review":"Just like virtually every Led Zep album, this CD requires one to sit back and listen several times before the absolute majesty of the music rings through. Plant seems to be somewhat meloncoly, but Page is definitely is at top form. The format of the CD does not seem to follow in particular pattern, but that is probably due to the fact this CD was recorded in just over 30 days. Steve Albini is defintely overrated; however, what was he supposed to do? He had little choice in how this CD was to be engineered. Afterall, Page insisted all the Led Zep albums be engineered by different people to ensure no one other than himself got the credit for Zep's unique, \\"light but heavy\\" sound. Kudos to Page and Plant for giving all of us a taste of what 70s album oriented rock was all about. \\"Walking Through Clarksdale\\" is a must have for any true rock fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Our perceptions of music are so different and so subjective, that my review will probably mean very little to you, and yet, I am so disappointed with this release that I just can't seem to keep quiet.This album is completely devoid of the chemistry, energy and power that made Led Zeppelin one of the greatest bands of all time. Every track on this album is singularly boring and uninspired. Plant's voice shows the ravages of age and time, and Page's guitar playing is a mere shadow of what it used to be.I love Led Zeppelin and I like a great deal of Plant's solo work. I can even listen to Page playing with Coverdale or the Firm. But I cannot tolerate this. Listening to this album makes me feel old and tired."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOW KEY EFFORT","review":"No one was expecting Led Zeppelin reincarnated, but this is more like the leaves dropping off the tree. Understated, and not exactly incendiary. I was expecting a little more kick...perhaps John Paul Jones was missing. This CD doesn't see much airplay on my player. If you're a Zep fan, I would suggest looking to Robert Plant's solo works instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't think this is Led Zepplin","review":"Great album. It's not Led Zep. Don't expect it to be. Led Zep was a foursome where all the members contributed to every song, which is why the songs on \\"Walking into Clarksdale\\" isn't as Led Zepplin as a lot of people and music critics wanted it to be. This is only half of Led Zep. Granted, it's the lyricist and the songwriter, but without John Paul Jones and Bonham the extra touches and depth that Led Zep had aren't nearly as apparent--but they are there if you listen for them. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the mixing problems. Bass line is buried somewhere in there, but it's next to impossible to find. Drums take a slight hiatus on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaders become followers","review":"LZ was enormously influential in the rock world. The most influential? Maybe.So it's odd to hear these songs, which echo many of the people who imitated Led Zep.A couple of them, you could swear, were written by Rush or Chris Isaak.

For guys with their pedigree, it's a disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring record with little lasting impression","review":"I like two songs on this CD: Walking into Clarksdale and Shine a Light.

These guys mellowed out too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only problem with this album is the production","review":"I bought this release on vinyl which was pressed on two Lps. The songs are not the problem. Page plays great and Plant sounds fine. The production by Steve Albin is awful. Where the hell did they find this guy? Why did Page produce the album himself like in the Zep days? I would love to hear this album remixed. The songs sounded great in concert. I am awaiting the arrival of my Page/Black Crowes CD. Anyone who says Page has lost his chops hasn't heard this two CD set recorded at the Greek Theater. Walking Into Clarksdale is a great album with a lot of great music. If you really like Zeppelin then you will really like this set of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"P&P living in the present","review":"Page & Plant live and write songs for today, and don't pretend they are back in the good old LZ days. I like the fact that they are artists doing what pleases them and don't seem to particularly care about recreating the megaselling LZ days. Plant is in fine voice, Page plays the atmospheric shadings and brutal crunch that will feel good to LZ lovers, and best of all, the songs are almost all very good. Most likely you bought this as soon as it came out, or never intend to get it, so reviews won't matter much. But if you're of a mind to give it a chance, you'll hear some good music by 2 guys who are masters at what they do. I'm glad they are still at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't stand it!","review":"I'm having a hard time getting through this album. Not melodic at all.

So when 'Walking into Clarksdale' first comes through the speakers, keep in mind that Page and Plant have grown and evolved, both personally and musically, for two decades! How very boring it would be if they had simply slapped on \\"Whole Lotta Love Part II\\", made their money, and gone home. Instead, Jimmy and Robert challenge their audience with minimalistic arrangements and genre-twisting songs. The only song that falls flat, \\"Burning Up\\", is indeed every bit the classic rock retread that a lot of reviewers here seem to be pining for, but other than that, the album succeeds marvelously as a profound yet intimate presentation of Page & Plant's continued evolution. 'Walking into Clarksdale' is easily one of the ten best albums of the 1990s."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited so long for so little...","review":"As a die-hard Zep fan, I was really excited about this album. Sadly, I have to say it was a big let-down after 18 years of waiting.Plant's voice is deep, raspy and horrible throughout. Page meanwhile has lost all the subtletys and fluency that made him great. All we get now is one heavy distorted sound. Apart from \\"Most High\\", the songs are a let down as well. The production is also far too bassy and muddy and reminds me of \\"In Throught the out door\\".The last good thing Page did was the soundtrack to \\"Death Wish II\\". Its sad when guys like Clapton and Beck are getting better with age, that Page seems to be getting worse - the confidence and fluency have well gone in his playing.Here's hoping for next time around if there is one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Fine Return to Form","review":"The failure of this album to sell big speaks volumes about thelegions of metalhead Zep fans who still haven't made it out of the 70s. It's not Zeppelin, but it may as well be- Zep was Page's child and he crafts each song here the same way he did way back when. An early sense of melancholy gives way to the heated excitement of the final five tracks, and overall the guitar has an eerie \\"Houses of the Holy\\" feel. Page is fantastic, and Plant sings like a man personally familiar with the blues. The real blues, not the noise simulated by a thousand Zeppelin imitators. A great live sound, also- Steve Albini wisely set up the mics and got out of the way. And the drummer deserves to be sitting in for Bonzo"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This! Dangerous!

I walked out of the room for 5 seconds to grab my camera when my son got on it the first time and a heard the crash. I ran in and he was on his side along with Thomas. I have to stay by their side riding this toy just so they do not get hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"this toy not good","review":"dont buy this toy my aolmost 2 year old son cant even press the button because of were you need to press it. he would need big hands to squeze the button on top of the bar. and my almost 3 year old daughter cant hold the botton down for more than 2 seconds and thats after i help her press it. they both get so mad at it it was set up 2 days and they would not even go near the toy i took it down.BIG WAIST OF MONEY POORLY DESIGNED FOR YUNG KIDS TOY."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst buying experience EVER!","review":"BUYER BEWARE!!!!I recently ordered (December 15th, 2007) this product through Amazon filled by Joe Brands for my son for Christmas. On Amazon's website it says you can cancel an order any time before it ships, if it does ship, you simply refuse receipt. I canceled this order on December 16th less than 24 hours after I placed it, I called and emailed Joe Brands & emailed Amazon. Never the less the package arrives on December 22nd. I called the shipping company, called and emailed Joe Brands, emailed Amazon and the package was finally picked up on the 27th of December. The billing however has yet to be straighted out. My credit card has yet to be credited, I do not have the product, and no one returns calls or emails. BUYER BEWARE!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Kids Love this Thomas","review":"My 2 yr old son and 3 1/2 yr old daughter love riding on Thomas. The only problem with this is that your child has to understand to hold down the \\"go\\" button or it will not continue to run. We had to remedy this by putting a small clamp on the button that they can easily remove when they want to stop. Also, unless the child sits real still and stays centered on the seat, the train gets very tippy. After a couple of spills, my son took a couple week break from riding on it and my daughter wouldn't try it at all. But, they have gotten over that and now ride it all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed","review":"I was so disappointed with this item. My son (who's 3) received this for his bday. The child has to continuously hold down a button with his hand to keep the train moving and my son couldn't do it. He ended up getting so frustrated, he broke down in tears! The noises the train makes are MUCH TOO LOUD! And you need a lot of room in your home to set up the track, which we do not have. I was surprised at how poorly designed this was since it's a Peg Perego. The manufacturers should've really tried this one out on the recommended age group before they released it. Why couldn't there be a pedal to step on to make it go like every other ride-on toy for little ones? I put it back in the box and back to the store it went."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thomas rules","review":"We bought this for our son when he was 3 which was at the high end of the suggested age. He loved it and still rides it off and on even when he was 5. The only downfall......the weight limit---which we ignored. He was riding it at 5 when he weighed 50 pounds no problem. This year I'm giving it to my cousin for her little girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"mon of 2yr old","review":"My son loves the train, and rides on it for hours on end. However, the battery was low by the end of Christmas day and takes another 24 hrs to rechange which isn't conventient and for the price it should have a better battery. Also bought the Annie & Clarabel 3rd car which attaches for a second child. The train does not work well and barely goes it another child is riding in the attached car. The product could be improved with rubber on the train wheels or groved track and wheels so it doesn't slip. The product needs improvement for the lofty price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Disapointment!!","review":"This ride is very disappointing! This was a gift for my son's 3 year birthday. His grandparents bought the train & extra track and we set it up as a surprise for his Thomas party. We made childsize railroad signs, Sir Topham Hatt and had Harold flying over the train track. He had is own Island of Sodor. But none of the children at the party, including my son, could hold down the handle to keep the train moving. A couple of the children got their foot stuck when the train would go around the turns. HUGE WASTE OF MONEY! We returned it after 2 weeks of aggrivation. It should have a peddle like other battery power vehicles, he has no problem driving his truck that he received on his 2nd birthday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crapanese","review":"I have a musical ear, and learn languages best through songs and poetry. I was a French language and literature major, and took beginning French and Italian in college, and gained proficiency through varied mediums. I am a beginner in Spanish, so I thought level three Rapanese would be a challenge. It is not. It is two poeple chit-chatting, half the time in English, half the time in Spanish (with an American accent), going over extremely basic words and grammar, such as the present tense of ser (to be). Occasionally, if you fast forward enough, you can find this same English/Spanish babble set to music. Very disappointing! Obviously, there are people who love this, but I say too much talk, too little music, too basic."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice clock radio","review":"This is my 2nd sony clock radio the 1st one I got is still in use after many years.

It's a nice radio/alarm clock. I've had no trouble with it. My only complaint is the same point another reviewer made: it needs battery backup. I have to say, in all the years I've had this clock radio, I haven't tried the weather alert yet. Since we now live in Georgia, I plan on giving it a try. I do hope, however, the power does not go out during an alert! Also if the power goes out, you have to redo the time, the alarm clock setting and preset radio stations, and that could be avoided if there was battery backup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony AM/FM radio","review":"Nice radio, a tad larger than my previous Sony radio, but it works fine.Quick delivery.!

However, volume 1, \\"Road to Stalingrad,\\" has NO MAPS!I do not know if other editions have this same defect, but I believe they do.It is just inexcusable--it makes it very hard to follow some of the descriptions unless one has a map.

Willie Dixon, Junior Wells, Coco Taylor, Mike Bloomfield, Dr. John, Johnny Winter, Buddy Miles and Nick Gravenites were all there. They all jam on many of Muddy's best hits.

The Great Polar Bear Rescue is a longer show, nice introduction to puffins on the Puffin Fishing Adventure and we already love Okapi's from the ones we've seen at our zoo. It doesn't change our enjoyment of the dvd at all, but I have to say it puzzles me why Okapi's were included in the Arctic Rescue bundle."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too sweet...","review":"This granola and also the tropical fruit one, are both way too sweet.

What turned me off was the lack of subtitles. I am an old man suffering from a hearing loss and while I could hear Rufus Sewell well enough I found his wife inpossible to understand and some of the other characters were marginal. If lack of hearing is not a problem one well might enjoy it. This movie is not for everybody. Yet how many movies are? BB"},{"rating":"1","title":"Charles II","review":"For anyone who knows something of the history of this English monarch, I warn you not to get this movie if you are looking for something that is even close to historically correct. It is a good movie, and follows the events of that time period somewhat acturately; however the personalities, characteristics, and physical appearances of many of the central figures are completely off. I was very disappointed, but that was only because I believed this movie would be at least close to historically accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"the last king-the power and the passion of charles11","review":"The movie was in a home camera verison.

Money wasted on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply dreadful","review":"Wonderful costumes and sets and fine actors cannot help this miniseries. It was torture to watch. The story of this king is compelling and deserves better treatment, but the writers can't seem to do that, relying every 20 minutes or so on \\"naughty\\" suggestions of oral sex and lesbian exploration to keep the viewers glued to the set. I love period dramas from the BBC, but this was a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy this DVD","review":"It's a terrific miniseries, I would highly recommend watching it.But DO NOT buy this DVD - as another reviewer notes, A&E; has cut an hour from the series for no apparent reason. Maybe they just think North Americans are to stupid to watch more than three hours of a series. Or maybe they wanted to save on costs.Amazon.co.uk sells the BBC version, a full 240 minutes, in Region 2 and VHS. Or buy directly from the BBC itself. Just don't support this company in continuing to butcher series and then use their monopoly to shove it down our throats."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Original, and Vastly Preferable 4-Hour Version","review":"This is the full 4-episode, 4-hour version of the superbly written (Adrian Hodges), directed (Joe Wright), designed, shot and acted mini-series. In the U.S., it was shown in a version that was heavily cut (by 1 hour!) and slightly bowdlerized (f.i., no view of a topless Nell Gwynn posing for a court painter) called The Last King. The original U.K. version, on 2 discs, is vastly preferable in every way. If you can play Region 2 DVDs, avoid The Last King and buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last king--dvd","review":"I rented this from Netflix and loved it--it came as two separate discs, for Part I and Part II.The DVD that I bought from Amazon had the entire movie on one disc--about one-third of it is unplayable, it skips and freezes! I checked it against Amazon's DVD troubleshooting tips and nothing worked.I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceiptful Product Description","review":"Once again, I was TWICE \\"fooled\\" by A&E;'s format description of their dvds - this time it was the historical movie \\"The Last King\\". According to the format info of this dvd as described on Amazon's website, this dvd included CLOSED CAPTIONS and IT DOES NOT!!!!! It is my opinion that ALL DVDS should have conventional subtitles in English and in another language (Spanish, for example...) or AT LEAST Closed Captions both for the hearing impaired AND for English teachers who use English spoken movies as audio and visual aids in class to improve their foreign students fluency and knowledge of the English language and culture! It is INCREDIBLE that producers of great documentaries on dvd such as A&E; and The History Channel are not focussed on such an important issue! SHAME ON A&E; and THC !I would also like to advise Amazon to ensure that the DVD product offered online actually provides all the specifications informed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply engrossing","review":"I have just finished watching this mini series (in the longer European cut of 228 minutes) and it had me longing to know more of Charles II. Rufus Sewell makes for an intelligent king you can sympathise with, although sometimes harsh to his loyal servants. When he gets trapped between his angry queen an his mistress Barbara Villiers you really feel for him. I think Sewell plays the role to perfection as do all the other principal actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is it titled \\"The Last King\\"?","review":"If you're interested in learning more about Charles II of England then get this DVD and then read \\"Forever Amber\\". The costuming and detail is wonderful and Love-to-Hate-Her Barbara Palmer is marvelously scheming and evil. You'll recognize--at least by her distinctive voice--Moaning Myrtle as the King Charles Portugese Queen. It seems just a bit sterile though because most of the scenes are shot indoors. I think I'm missing the scenery of Merry Old Restoration England. Rufus Sewell is a hunk and plays Charles II the way I would imagine. Enjoy.NOTE For Parents: At the beginning of the movie Charles II witnesses his father's beheading. He's directly under the scaffold and the head drops towards his upturned face and the blood splashes all over Charles' II face. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"My review is not on the series, but the DVD.","review":"I've reported this to Amazon and hope the page will be updated and once that has done so I will remove the review.

I got them today, and immediately saw the quality was deficient. I cut my finger on a sharp edge under the handle! I compared them to my 1.5, and the edges of my 1.5 are smooth and well-made. The pouring lips on the new ones are barely there, tiny, compared to a nice 1/2\\" lip on the older model. The picture of the 3 quart on the listing isn't the same as the one sent to me, with no metal plate and rubber washer under the lid handle to buffer from the heat.

It seems that this time around, AVB has created more of a mainstrem album that is appealing to those who are fans of dance tunes in general. This is unfortunate for me, who prefer uplifting trance tunes that AVB usually spins, as he does in his live sets. Don't get me wrong, this album has some great assortment of tracks, from mellow, chill songs to Euro-trance-esque tunes. It would be interesting to see how he mixes tracks from this album into his club sets. There are some gems to be found in this album, especially those that feature System F and/or Justine Suissa.

There are a few decent tracks on this which can be found on probably 1,000 other mixed CDs, but the rest is garbage that is commercially prepared for the next shampoo or shaving cream commercial. Trance music can be such a powerful and emotional force but this CD is plagued with these horrible love-sappy vocals that pulls this genre away from electronic expression and into the pop norm. AVB is a decent DJ and this compilation feels nothing more then a few recycled (yet powerful) old tracks acting as glue to push out some other mediocre talent tracks. From someone like him I expect a lot more. This is nothing more then his name on a comp acting as a promotion tool for the record label. Sad sad sad. Save your money on this one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite buy!","review":"This is an all around an awesome album--a balanced collection of vocals, fast progressive dance beats, and down-tempo dreamy melodies. The voice of Justine Suissa in Burned with Desire is captivating, as well as Victoria Horn's catchy song Wait for You that makes you want to drop everything, dance and sing along! Communication is one of my favorite tunes. The pace starts out slow and progressively moves you and captivates you! The piano melody is reminiscent of Robert Miles's Children, but then switched to a much better faster beat! It is an awesome dance tune that doesn't get boring. The other best songs are Precious, Flipstream, Never Wanted This, Blue Fear 2003, Astronauts, and Stay. The song that should you might skip would be From The Heart.

This album for me is about transition. I was a senior in high school when it was released and a freshman in college when it blew up. I can't help but reminisce about all the good things during my freshman year. I always drift away to Freaknik '94 (The Best Ever) when I played this CD the entire day; along with 100,000 other HBCU students in ATL. This CD will definately bring back good times.

Even after reading the positive reviews on this, I was sceptical but decided to give it a try. What a pleasant surprise - it does work! As other reviewers stated, it can be used on dry fur.

Oswald was married to a white woman, had been converted to Christianity, and was not a fully initiated Hopi Indian. Thus, as one might expect, many of the traditions reported in this book are inaccurate. See: McLeod, Roxie. Dreams and rumors: a history of \\"Book of the Hopi\\".

For a more accurate version of Hopi beliefs, try \\"The Fourth World of the Hopis\\" by Harold Courlander."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Thought It Was All Gone","review":"This book is truly a unique text, in that it relates to the reader the more esoteric religious oral traditions of a culture that is quickly vanishing. In fact, I was amazed at the length to which the Hopis views were restored for this book. Admittedly, some parts of the book seem to become lost in detail (in the more literal portions of the book), but even these are quite interesting when accompanied by the more 'philosophical' world view of the Hopis. A worthwhile read...highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book of Hopi","review":"Well researched piece by Frank Waters.

Unfortunately, these artists put themselves out in front, not the songs themselves. Listening to \\"Singers Unlimited\\" sing Alfred Burt is painful! One performance where a Burt song actually is allowed to speak is the Peggy Lee recording of \\"Star Carol.\\" The Dave Grusin instrumental of \\"Some Children See Him\\" isn't bad either.

Re-making tunes like \\"I Shall wear a Crown\\" and \\"Because He Lives\\", she has a unique style that blends R&B rythums with old time Gospel. This CD has a nice mix of both praise and worship music. She certainly has the talent and vocal skills needed to draw young people to Christ with tracks like \\"I know I can Make It\\" and \\"Do You Wanna Go\\". Straight from the Heart is today's Gospel. If your are a music lover this is a CD you will want to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great....","review":"She has a nice voice...it does not sound very \\"strong\\". Overall, I only liked maybe 3 songs on this CD and they were basically some of the older songs that she \\"re-made\\". The other songs sounded too much like she was trying to sound like Aliyah or somebody (but then again, some people like that).... I thought that there was too much heavy breathing and panting....I also thought the cover was really too reavealing to be a christian woman (her stomach is out)....Christians can look good without looking \\"seductive\\". You don't promote a Gospel CD by looking \\"sexy\\". I thought the focus was \\"Jesus\\"?

I would like to read a more recent book on this subject also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flashman at it again","review":"I really enjoy this series of books about Harry Flashman, coward, scoundrel, and unwitting hero of the glory days of the British Empire. This series, which has been ongoing for 30 years, always delights me with its wit, and also with instilling knowledge of many exotic places and events. The scholarship behind the tales is quite sound, for I have read about a lot of these incidents and what the author presents (with the exception of Flashman's participation, of course) is accurate. This latest work is a combination of three different incidents, each one different and entertaining. You know that our \\"hero\\" is always going to get out of the situations in which he finds himself, but the joy is in reading and discovering how he accomplishes it. May this series go on for another 30 years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Also waiting for the Civil War","review":"Any Flashbook book is welcome, but like the earlier reviewer, I am also waiting for editor Fraser to publish Sir Harry's exploit's in the Civil War. I am convinced that Flashman is responsible for the loss of Lee's Special Order 191 before Antietam (the orders were found by a union sergeant wrapped around three cigars -- doesn't that sound like Flashman?). I've also been waiting for years to hear the views on Picket's Charge from the only man to survive the retreat from from Kabul, the Charge of the Light Brigade, Custer's Last Stand and Rourke's Drift. Please, Mr. Fraser ... Civil War next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Long Awaited Return of Flashman is here","review":"Just when you thought you heard the last of Sir Harry Flashman he pops his head up with more tales told out of school. This is his 11th Adventure, and it seems that even as he ages he never changes. George MacDonald Fraser has done it once again with the ever cowardly Flashman, put in with some well known people and places and dispite his being a coward, a liar, a rogue, and more Sir Harry comes up smelling like a rose. Mr. Fraser has mixed fact and fiction to bring his charater to life. I have read all of Mr. Fraser's Flashman stories and at the end of each one I wanted to see what Harry would do next. This novel is no different. Who will be next, Tombstone AZ, or will it be with \\"Chinese\\" Gordon? I will eagerly await for more from Mr. Fraser."},{"rating":"2","title":"The end of the line","review":"For me this is the last of the Series and only leave GMF's last work for me to read.

Any suggestions?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on, George, let's do the U.S. Civil War one.","review":"Any Flashy is better than almost anything else in historical fiction (and Flashy at his best is beyond that category). But this is the weakest of the lot. If you're new to Flashy, start w/ either \\"Flashman\\" or \\"Flashman at the Charge.\\" After those two, you'll be so hooked that you'll overlook the inadequacies of this offering. And to branch out, read Fraser's war memoir, \\"Quartered Safe Out Here.\\" It's the story of the young Fraser fighting in WWII in Burma w/ the Brits under Gen'l Slim. It is terrific. And, in the meantime, for an American reader (and we buy more of these books than the rest of the English speaking world combined) where is the U.S. Civil War one, which has been referenced repeatedly in earlier Flashmans?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who is Sam Salter?!?!","review":"After all these years, this cd is still one of my favorites. Sam Salter is not getting the recognition he deserves. Very talented and comparible to other famous R&B singers. Trust me, this CD is Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best R&B albums ever","review":"I bought this CD the very frist day it came out. I still play It over and over again. I first got this CD because I liked the song \\"AFTER 12 BEFORE 6\\" but what I did not know was that the rest of the CD was so fantastic. The best songs are #5 \\"THERE YOU ARE\\" #7 \\"SHOW YOU THAT I CARE\\" #11 \\"ON MY HEART\\" Sam has so much feeling behind his songs. I can relate to everything he says. This CD is A must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"~PURE... Undiluted talent!!!~","review":"Sams stunning debut, absolutely defines how R&B should sound like. Lyrics so rich in content, which are showcased in \\" I love you both \\" ~show a brighter side of men. Also melodies which will drive one insane, (especially 2wards the break of dawn) are displayed in this CD. This is one of the rare Babyface projects which leave the artist's vocal undiluted with the genius' trademark. For follow up albums, Mr Salter can do better by disbanding from the trend of sampling other people's songs as in \\"After 12 before 6\\", though I must admit he added some bit of 'salt' 2 it.

You bet this album evoked a love spot \\"On my heart\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great start","review":"When I first heard this CD back in 1997, I knew this brother had a carrer ahead of him. The first song Your Face a whole ballad set of sexy slow jams. The second track After 12 Before 6 is a great song to dance with your boo to. The thrid tarck is a fast track great for the clubs called It's On Tonight.Number four us entitled Give Me My Baby the best song on the CD.

Its not worth getting at any price."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book on mother-daughter relationships","review":"\\"Mom I Feel Fat\\" is a well-written and thoughtful book to help mothers help their daughters improve their self-images. The author is a licensed professional counselor and she focuses on the entire mother daughter relationship. She asks thoughtful and provoking questions and provides stimulating exercises for the reader.The author believes a mother has to understand her own emotions and behaviors in order to connect with and help her daughter understand hers, so this book is about the transformation of the mother as well as the daughter, which I agree is very necessary.I would have given this book five stars were it not for the cover (I wish there were a 4 1/2 star rating, which is what I would like to give it.) The cover shows a model-perfect mother daughter pair, awash in flattering lighting. The real mother daughter pair, not so model-perfect are in a tiny picture on the back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much religion.","review":"This otherwise promising book relied too heavily on God and religion for the lay reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible dictionary","review":"First, it should be obvious that this being essentially a pocket dictionary, isn't going to be the most comprehensive dictionary around. That being said, I hate this dictionary. It is incredibly frustrating to use: under any given entry there will follow a list of a dozen or more words, but without any indication as to how they are supposed to be used or in what context. If you don't already posses a substantial command of the language you will end up pretty far from what you really want to say. I greatly prefer the Webster's New World Dictionary. It is much more user-friendly and will help you find the RIGHT word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete","review":"We bought this to help out with guests from what used to be East Germany. Guess what, all Germans don't speak English, they learned Russian behind the wall. Anyway, in the german to english section there had been a mistake and about 100 pages were misbound, replaced by english pages.

Next time I purchase a comb it will be on site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but out of date and not very practical","review":"I can imagine this book would have been very useful in 1984 when it was written, but with the myriad advances in statistical software, not to mention the field of cluster analysis itself, it isn't that much use today. If you are looking to understand and perform cluster analyses with something like SPSS, this book is not at all what you need. If you are looking for a very general understanding of cluster analysis as it was 22 years ago then this might be okay, but otherwise you should look elsewhere.I feel a bit cheated having bought it on the basis of the other reviewer's glowing recommendation. As a colleague of mine says \\"An idiot learns from his mistakes, a clever man learns from other people's\\". Learn from this idiot's mistake and don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"I found this book just ok and none of the recipes jumped out to me as something I'd like to cook. I found some of the recipe translations were not accurate, probably a little pedantic on my behalf but if you are going to write on a subject I think you need to be well informed. My biggest disappointment was that the author missed a complete region for Italy, not one recipe or story about Le March the coastal region along the Adriatic coast. There are so many delicious recipes from this region . There are better travel /food books"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"First I didn't realize the book is a small in size w/ small printing, definitely needed a stronger pair of glasses to be able to read comfortably.The book does not really contain anything that can't be found in a number of other books on Italian cooking. The anecdotes are nothing remarkable, all the recipes, or ones similar to them, can be found in other more reliable, professionally prepared sources. There are several recipes for sardines. I'm of Sicilian heritage and a former professional cook, and love sardines, but...Just paging through the book I think there are at least 4-5 sardine recipes and several rissoto recipes. Spaghetti w/ tomato sauce???? Was this recipe really needed?A quick search using \\"Italian Cooking\\" will bring up a bunch of better choices, many of which I own. This was one of those impulse purchases, came up with another search, looked like it might be interesting.......It isn't.Overall, the best part of the book is the preface."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining and original","review":"One of my high school teachers once opined that there was no future in writing historical novels because all the best ideas had already been taken.CC Humphreys has proven him wrong. He has lifted a nameless minor figure from one of the tragic tableaux of history -- the expert swordsman specially sent for from France to cut off the head of Queen Anne Boleyn -- and made him the hero of his first novel \\"The French Executioner\\".\\"Blood Ties\\" is the sequel, set twenty years later and focusing on the next generation.Perhaps not great literature, but certainly good entertainment: an original idea, well-researched and well-written."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Own for All Sewers!","review":"The video is an absolute must for sewers from begging to professionals. It not only tells you how to sew the bra and belt; it also provides tips for all types of sewing. You can implement all the sewing techniques in just every day clothing.

I definitely want the rest of the videos in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart wrenching and joyous at the same time!","review":"The fourth book in the Journals of Corrie Belle Hollister holds its own with the previous three! Not as much action (yet it has its times!), but had a way of making the reader emotionally spent. As the title suggests, this book was a lot about how everyone, in God's eyes, has his or her own place in the sun/world. Christian values and morals are upheld superbly throughout the novel! The love that God gives shines through in this novel; whether it be through the little things that happen to Corrie or whether it be through the love of those around her, even though love seems not to have been earned. Very good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality product","review":"This product had at one time been damp to the point of mildew .... It never should have been resold.

If you are paying for them yourself rather than via a gift voucher, I would shop elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster in every way","review":"I am still confused as to why the author decided to pick Gertrude Stein's home as the setting. This book was about a Vietnamese chef who left his home country as a young teenager, sailed to France, was gay, and that was that. Gertrude Stein was barely a focus to the book (which is why I squandered my money) and there was virtually no mention to the cast of characters who frequented her quarters. The book had the recipe to be brilliant, but quickly deflated like a screamed at souffl��.Supremely boring and written like a haphazard high school biography. Never was there a funny story to read and it was as dry and unexciting as an Afghan rub. You should consider a different book if you want to learn more and laugh about the legendary Gertrude Stein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring... But Well Written","review":"I was supposed to read this novel for an Asian Literature class as an undergrad at UCLA (over three years ago) but I could never get past the first few pages. Figuring I'd give it another chance I recently set out determined to discover why a university professor would select it for her class. Apparently I was right the first time; the only thing that got me to the end was Truong's exceptionally well written prose- the actual plot itself literally bored me to sleep on several occasions. Bare in mind, though, I am not particularly interested in Vietnamese history or Gertrude Stein, so if those are topics that interest you it may be a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment . . . . .","review":"When you read the description on the fly leaf of this novel you are totally hooked. an inside view into the lives of Stein and Toklas through the eyes of their vietnamese cook . . .this has to be a good read . . . not!! The premise was good but if you enjoy good writing this one needs some serious work. The language seems stilted and artificial at times and the incidents contrived. If you want to read something with depth and richness I recommend getting Yann Martel's Life of Pi instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant voice, but cold and dense","review":"It is clear that this book is the work of a brilliant mind, and in its way it is exquisitely written. That said, I found it cold, overly dense, and confusing. The voice of the narrator was not believable or authentic; it was too intellectual and culturally sophisticated. It is the author's voice, and I found it disingenuous to make it out to be Binh's (but many of the observations are amazing!). Also, the reader is \\"supposed\\" to feel Binh's longing, but the weight of the author's words interfered with that for me. In the end, I came away from this book with a cold, empty feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Poetic?","review":"I wish I had a better, more reasoned critique, but the narrative voice for the character didn't fit with the image I had of him. The consciousness of the conceit of an uneducated Vietnamese cook telling his own story in such poetic language didn't fit. It made me like the book less and less as I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried But Couldn't Finish","review":"I really, really wanted to like this book. I kept hanging in there, sure the lovely writing would finally win me over. Alas, not so. The dense writing and wandering plot were finally too much to overcome and I gave up and didn't finish. I wish now I'd waited for the library copy instead of buying it. Paris, GertrudeStein (that's funny--inside joke from the book), it could all have been so wonderful. This is, in the end, a sad book because it could have been so, so wonderful...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is over-hyped fraud","review":"Anyone who buys this book believing it is about food, feasting, cooking or sitting in on any of Gertrude Stein's parties at a time when her Paris salon was visited by so many influential artists, writers and other creatives is going to be EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. Book manages to demean both Stein and Toklas's work and lives as only an envious out-sider can. More of a self-pitying romance novel than historical fiction.I gave it one star but deserves a black spot. Back cover blurb completely misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the kind of book we should be reading?","review":"This book is full of things that offend the sensitivities of Asian-Americans. I truly don't think this is the kind of book that we should be seeing published and read in the 21st century America. Please think about it. A gay Vietnamese cook employeed by Americans in France, the former colonial master of Vietnam!

The slip of a plot maintains no tension, conveys no interest and makes the reader plow through only in hopes that something will happen. (It doesn't.) I appreciated the deft descriptions of food, but the psychological aspects left me cold and unsympathetic. I liked the glimpse into Vietnamese life, though felt unenlightened by the Parisian location. The main character seems grossly unconvincing. Lush language is often verbose and superfluous. I think Ms. Truong would be greatly served by a strong editor and an inner discipline that recognizes some of the most poetic statements are the simplest. One feels she's riding the immigrant-experience wave and that the book reviews are overinflated. Still, the book does show a lot of talent.

Sure Frozen and Ashanti are great tracks. There is no argument there, but why pay for a single when you can buy the whole album??For me this is very frustrating. Maybe people here are thinking this is the album, but then again Ray of Light is the Album, which this is from. Is it not??I will certainly be trying to pawn this cd off to someone cause it is useless to me.As an aspiring dj, I am looking for quality remixes that can be played in clubs and stand the test of time. The usual song has been played out by radios, so it is important that it is kept fresh with a good mix.I just can't understand why record companies put out these singles that offer nothing different from the original songs on the album. Kind of greedy in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful song of courage and willpower!","review":"Madonna has perhaps never been more emotional and moving than on her CD \\"Ray of Light.\\" One of the tracks on this album, titled \\"Frozen,\\" is a slowly haunting and deeply visceral anthem which explores one's need to have the love of another. It laments over someone's hardness and unwillingness to change, while at the same time the singer is determined not to give up on the hope that she will one day open the doors to her love's heart. It uses lots of little electronic instruments and synthesizers to give the song a very surreal and broad quality, and the lyrics are the finishing touch to a song that is, without a doubt, uplifting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna's best single in decades","review":"Madonna's best single in decades.

After some persuasion, Dorian accepts a job: she will tutor Briny in etiquette, culture, and image, so he can successfully put his new status to work.But behind the frosty facade she presents to the world, Dorian is lonely and painfully insecure.

These and many other bands can offer the same energy and aggression as \`the Bronx' without all of the high fashion haircuts and expensive designer punk clothes.

This is definately a book I'm going to read over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Why Things Burn is Worth the Read\\"","review":"I strongly recommend reading Daphne Gottlieb's \\"Why Things Burn.\\" Gottlieb has a way of disturbing you while turning you on at the same time. \\"Why Things Burn\\" doesn't feel as strong a collection as her more recent book, \\"Kissing Dead Girls.\\" \\"Why Things Burn\\" is a collection of jumbled topics, which is fine - and actually pretty common for a book of poetry. And \\"Why Things Burn\\" has more traditional forms of poetry, while (some) readers might find the lengthy prose in \\"Dead Girls\\" to be lacking the \\"poetry\\" that they were looking for. Gottlieb is bold and in your face, which has been a much needed relief from the women poets I have been reading lately. She doesn't \\"dainty\\" around any topic. If you pick up this book, I recommend watching some online archived footage of her reading. She is known as a slam poet, and hearing her read her own work with give you a good feel for her voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"very informative","review":"I thought that this book out of all the ones I've purchased in the past years...had given me the best ideas on how to save money.

It is easy to read, with user friendly exercises and if you follow most of the advice, you can start really saving some money. If you are serious about trying to figure out how to start a budget and save some money without too much pain, paperwork, or time, this is a great book! My husband and I would recommend it to any couple who are trying to figure out where their money is going.And as far as one of the reviews I read on this site about the book telling you to borrow from relatives - they didn't read this book and are totally confused on exactly what they read because nowhere do the authors give you that advice. This is a real gem. Read it now and get started on being financially healthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, duh.","review":"This book is - how can one put it politely? - garbage, yes, that's the word. The book has two big messages: that men and women shop differently, and that consumers can buy a particular brand of an item without buying the 'message' that goes with said brand. Well, duh. Hard to believe people get paid for this - and, in the case of Ms Popcorn (real name: Plotkin), paid very well. So don't buy it, it will only encourage her to write something else.In fact, if you still have any faith in Popcorn, I advise that you cure yourself with a quick look at a book by William Sherden called 'The Fortune Sellers'. Pages 221-224 deal with Popcorn/Plotkin. While you're there, check out what he has to say in other 'futurologists' (read: charlatans) like Toffler and Naisbitt."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good glimpse of history for children","review":"I thought that this book was a really good book. The best part about it was that it had to do with history. I think it will still keep the interest of kids while teaching them about what happened back then. It also had great pictures. While I was reading it, the pictures jumped out at me. It wasn't too lengthy either. I found that to be quite nice. I would recommend it to children if they are looking for an interesting and educational book. With this book, you can not only enjoy it, but you can also learn. That is why I gave it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"2005 BMW 330CI Oxygen Sensor","review":"You can buy it or all four(15680,15681,17215,17216)from Amazon for super low price or pay an arm and leg at your local dealer.

The subject matter is interesting, but it skims over the tales too quickly (e.g., how and when were Rackham et al captured?). Druett also jumps around too much - mixing the tales of more than one woman who were unrelated in terms of place and time.In addition, the book really bothered me for its lack of quality research. The author relied too much upon myths and stereotypes to embellish her story. In particular, the chapter about the Vikings contained a lot of misinformation, most from romanticized tales from the Victorian era. A 30-second web search would have told her that the Vikings didn't wear horned helmets, that they ate a lot more than plain, boiled meat (as traders and farmers, they had access to a variety of fruit, vegetables, herbs, and spices), etc. They were a lot more sophisticated than Druett made out.It's fine as light reading and a quick overview of the topic, but the devil's in the details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the pictures","review":"I have both the hard cover and the kindle version now and I am VERY disappointed that the pictures are all missing what's up with that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"What is this world coming to?","review":"I'm not much of a moe.head, but I have to say that the last reviewer...y'know, the one that gave this album 1 star...is probably the single most idiotic cretin to trudge this dust we call earth.

If you have insomnia try reading this book! It's so poorly written that it should have you snoring in no time. You would think anybody could write a book about this, the subject is one of the easiest, as it is virtually self written in it's own lineage. It was just a matter of someone putting it on paper, which was done by the author in a very dry, boring manner. The various areas of focus in the book are off a bit, sometimes too much time will be devoted to one subject, and not enough to another, the author obviously does not know alot about music at all. I think this is probably one of the easiest subjcts to write a book on, and the author failed dismally.1 star from me, half-hearted attempt from one who doesn't understand the subject matter, probably just an attempt to make a quick buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful CD for toddlers to fall asleep to.","review":"My 2 year old loves this CD!

The tracts are all creative and varied. Each artist has clearly given their best. There's no \\"filler\\". Two other pluses for toddler bedtime music: all the tracks are calm (this sounds like a silly thing to say, but as my fellow parents know there are too many CD's out there with boisterous songs in the middle) and this CD is long-enough for the child to fall asleep to before it finishes.

There are many names to remember and in the beginning I thought I may be \\"screwed\\" to remember all of them. But this was not the case. This read left me with truly ambivalent feelings for several characters but most of all Hughes.

So if all you want is to have travelled the actual route 66, then the maps may be helpful, but if what you want is to have an understanding of each leg and any history or events that happened there, you wont get that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here It Is!

If your plan is to travel route 66 these are invaluable. They enabled us to leave the route and return when necessary. They kept us from getting lost and when we did take a wrong turn we knew it in less than a half mile. The turn by turn descriptions are excellent.

When I first pressed play and listened to the thundering opening of the 1st symphony I was very pleased...then came the obvious edits. During one movement I heard a [not very good] edit that sounded like some 7th grade punk band with a [not very good] 4-track recorder. The music skipped and came back in and it surely was not a cd defect. I don't think I am being too hard on the performance. The performance isn't really at fault as much as the production. Poor job! If you respect the work of Brahms then please do not buy this cd regardless of the great price. I am very picky about Bach and Brahms recordings and this particular recording is only sitting on my shelf because I can't return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas present for brother restoring a nova","review":"He's looked through this quite a bit, and I know he likes it, but I think with today's wiring and other items, its better or easier to go to a muscle car forum online and get advice from people who are actually restoring them, they can help you get around the fact that a lot of parts aren't made the same way any more, some things that used to be a foot are now 8 inches and need rigging to get into tight places.I wouldn't say don't get it, just be prepared to need more help than is offered, nice book though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A satisfied review","review":"hey dudes, I totally suggest you buy this album! their songs (as are most of their songs) are very upbeat and yet simultaneously deep and just primarily feel-good shtuff.. my fave songs on this album are Running Away, the Fragile Army and Light to Follow.

The color was off. Finally after 3 phone calls, all lasting over an hour each, 3 e mails, epson decided that even though the photos were printing fine on the epson 960 model, the RX700 was so sophisticated that it was putting all the undetected color into the photos and saturating them with red.In addition, the controls are far from intuitive, and even the techs on line [2 of 3] were having trouble finding things as they read from the manuals.

They have told me that I need to run a head cleaning, so I go out and buy some inks for 60 dollars, then I run the cleaning and still nothing happens, the printer still prints out blank pages.

I have had this camera for about a year now and it is horrible. Agree with so many of the other reviews - lots of blurry pics, the shutter spend is simply horrendous. I have a baby and to actually catch her smile is impossible because it's so slow. I took this to my sister's house and she started taking pics with it and was appauld at how slow it is. Yes, when you can actually get the right shot, the picture quality is great. But it's rare. Oh, and don't even try to use it indoor without flash, impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems like an excellent camera.","review":"I've been using the camera for several days now, including during our recent monster snow storm. It is easy to get up and running. All of my pictures have been sharp and clear. The start-up manual is good and so is the user's manual. I really should give the camera, itself, 5 stars but the graphics software that accompanies the camera is a pain. It does what it wants with my pictures and doesn't allow me to do what I want. If you have XP, don't bother using the software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy again...","review":"I've had this camera for a couple of years now. I'm a novice photographer and wasn't looking for anything fancy. At first I was happy with it, but after awhile I started to really dislike the delay between snapping the picture and it actually taking. A good couple of seconds that was enough to make it very difficult to take pictures of anything moving. Also after two years of occasional use, maybe a 1-2k pictures and the lens stuck. I was able to get it to retract with some light tapping on the lens, but you can tell by the sound of it that the gearing mechanism has started to strip effectively making it a paper weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best upgrade I've made in a long time.","review":"Does just what the reviews said it would do (http://www.steves-digicams.com/).

It takes high quality pictures and I was very pleased with them. It has an auto mode, for those who aren't camera experts and there are also a few different scene selections. There is also a Manual mode, which my old cyber-shot dsc-p72 didn't have.To the person who said they had blurry pictures, perhaps you had it on the wrong setting for the particular situation.

I haven't noticed the blurriness, (I read all the bad reviews on this camera, to see if anyone else had my problem) but my problem with this camera is that when I go to take a picture, the wheel (thing to change the setting - what type of picture to take) spazzes out. Basically it is TOO sensitive and then I go back to look at the pictures I've taken and it's on a completely different setting (for example, I am supposed to be viewing the pictures I've taken, but it is in portrait mode or night vision).........it is screwed up!!!!!!!!

My husband thought it was the way I was taking the pictures, so when he tried, he realized he got the same crappy results.

At first it worked well and I was happy. Then about 6 months ago the quality of the pictures took a nosedive. Like several other reviewers, I'm having the same problem with the pictures being very dark and blurry. I went through the manual several times and did the trouble shooting steps online at Sony's website, but couldn't figure out the problem.I called Sony just last week and they had no idea what was wrong with it either. It's not under warranty so they said they would charge me $181.00 for parts/labor/shipping even though they have NO idea what the problem is! I don't see how they can give me a flat price when they have no idea if the camera can be repaired or not. On top of that cost, I would have to pay to ship the camera to them, insured of course. I told them no thanks.My camera isn't even usable. Next time, I'm going with a Nikon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I had this camera for a little bit over a year and it suddenly breaks down on me. It wouldn't turn on.

Some pictures come out dark and some shadows on pictures. This camera's randomly broke after about 1 year and I did not drop the camera. I bought a Sony PDA and the same thing happened to that lcd - randomly broke - has a crack across the front. Of course, Sony said it was my fault and that I must have done something to it and refused to honor the warranty on that PDA. Since the camera was out of warranty, I knew there was nothing they were going to do. So if you want a decent camera with lousy customer service to support it - go for it!

This is especially apparent when shooting outside on sunny days, where there is a lot of greenery (trees, etc). You can make an adjustment in the White Balance mode so that colors are more natural, but it can be difficult to decide using only the viewscreen as reference. Black and white mode is good. Also, the auto-focusing is not always consistent; don't be surprised if a number of your shots come out less than sharp. I am very disappointed with this camera and will think twice before putting down $$$ for another Sony Cyber-Shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera","review":"This camera takes fabulous digital pictures.

I was looking at Canon SD500 and Sony W7, and chose the W7, as the SD500 was just too small in physical size and really needed to hold it with both hands to feel secure. W7 is easy to use and picture quality is great. It would have gotten 5 stars if it had shutter and aperture priority mode built in. 1Gb memory stick, 15 minute charger and extra batteries should be considered must have accessories with this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehh...","review":"The only reason to purchase this album would be for Dana Harris' remake of As We Lay.

Im not on to pick sides though, I think Esham, Eminem, and Dice are all tight but Esham is the most hardcore (horrifying) rapper in Detroit if not the whole frickin world. The people featured on this album is Violent J from ICP, Mastamind and TNT from NATAS, Kool Keith, and The Dayton Family. FLINTTOWN. One of the tightest things that he did was hook up with The Dayton Family. Flint rap and Detroit rap are both hardcore as hell.

What makes this album even better is he disses that f4ggot eminem...and disses him hard. no joke, there has been proof that eminem really is gay, and its good that esham dissed this faker on this album, because eminem copies everything that esham did and duz it like 10 years later. what a w4nka, eminem can go to hell. esham is the unholy rapper who invented acid rap, and the king of acid rap he is, and he is the king of detroit rap."},{"rating":"2","title":"No, not dull... very deep and powerful.","review":"I felt I had to respond to the above comment by saying that this is a masterfully written short story and a moving account of a Master who makes the ultimate sacrifice, whether knowing it or not, to his lowly, faithful servant.

I really enjoy the romance, mystery, and suspense she puts in her books. Unforgettable is about Greg Braxton and Dodger, a search and rescue team (Dodger being the dog, which you will just fall in love with!). They find a woman that has run off a cliff in her car. Both save her, but she has lost all her memory, so they call her Lucky, since she can't remember her name. Greg starts to discover clues about Lucky and they soon figure out that someone tried to kill her, not that she ran off the cliff. In Unforgettable there is lots of mystery surrounding Lucky, and her and Greg have to find the answers before the killer strikes again! Unforgettable is a good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"I loved the beautiful \\"Manic Expressive\\", but this one was a big boring letdown.

Well, every song on this CD sounds like an inferior re-write of that song, with an almost complete lack of melody or invention. The whole time I was listening to this, I kept expecting to hear that same B.B. King sample.

All these stories have held up wonderfully (no pun intended) after over 40 years. Bill Cosby is a master comedic story teller - and most of what he is telling is through real life experience.I have several of Cosby's album's (I mean CD's!) on my iPod now, and it's hard to keep from chuckling in my work cubicle when a story like \\"The Chicken Heart\\" comes on...Highly recommended to anyone who has never heard Cosby's old bits, and also to anyone that wants to enjoy them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Cosby's Wonderfullness","review":"I bought this CD because it features Bill's Chicken Heart comedy routine.

Wonderfulness is from the days when Cosby would put out an album per year and the sheer wonder(fulness) of the material that focuses on everyday anecdotes means it's hardly aged at all. This is comedy that can be put on in any company, there will be belly laughs (my faves here are Go Carts and Special Class). Celebrating a child like enjoyment of living and with his chutzpah in full swing, this CD is so cheap that there is little reason not to part with your hard earned.Unlike the other Cosby albums in the Warner Archives series this one does not have any liner notes, presumably there were none on the original to transpose over.

Quite simply, a classic!...although I have to say that whoever made the decision to shorten the classic \\"Shop\\" bit, with it's exploding-bullet-in-the-kiln payoff, should be pushed down Deadman's Hill into heavy traffic on a rickety go-cart.

It seems to support many misconceptions in people have about the Bible. While claiming to explain what terms in the Bible actually mean, it actually distorts the meaning. For example, it talks about the verse in mark about the camel going through the eye of the needle, and explains how there was a gate called \\"the needles eye\\" in Jerusalem. While many laymen believe this, this just ain't so.

The quote holds up an old, easily debunked lie as fact, with no research or sources to verify the claim.Like the 9th century fiction of \\"They eye of the needle\\" being a small door in the Jerusalem wall that was left open overnight the claim is based not upon facts and research, but a shoddy tradition of convenient lies used by lazy pastors to write slipshod sermons.The book is an amusing read, but given the apparent lack of research and verification, the content should be taken with more than few grains of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other low opinion valid","review":"As another reviewer rated the book 1 star, I gave two.

But I am hesitant about this one, primarily because I don't see how I will start to like this more unless I buy a large amount of mood altering drugs. And mood altering drugs might have something to do with this album, it sounds like a Prozac album. The songs, for lack of a better word, are dull. Most follow the same formula, a somewhat slow moving pop song that goes into a three minute instrumental fade-out. It is Steely Dan on downers. Maybe I'm just tired of analyzing these songs until I \\"get them.\\" And you can rationalize all you want, but this album falls flat, which is why Tweedy is probably so much on the defensive when he discusses it.

I'll break it out in ten years when I have kids and I need a soundtrack to wash the dishes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love those VW ads...","review":"Wilco is unquestionably one of the best bands of our time, and this is certainly worth a listen.This is very different from Ghost / YHF in that the songs are much more direct, with less elaborate mixes / elusive lyrics than their prior two masterpieces. Sort of hearkens to Being There, but with less of an alt-country sound.One of the best of 2007 - but not quite as good as at least this fan was expecting (check out Cassadega for the best to date this year)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow Gold","review":"From the opening melody of \\"Either Way\\" to the gorgeous outro of \\"On and On and On,\\" Wilco succeeds in creating a cohesive, moody atmosphere that could best be described as mellow groove. At various times the listener will detect hints of the Grateful Dead, the Eagles and even Fleetwood Mac, but Wilco also manages to elevate themselves beyond those 70's influences and create a classic rock/alternative album all their own. And that is largely due to the words and phrasing of Jeff Tweedy. I won't say that his meaning is always clear, but the words make you listen and draw you in closer, and like the best poetry, are vague enough to allow your own interpretation. I have my own relationship to the words and sounds on this album, and I thank Wilco for helping me feel something that is at once familiar and entirely revolutionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"This album is just OK.

I've seen them in concert once (and greatly enjoyed their show.) So I will feeling a great deal of anticipation for their album. Unfortunately, I came out gravely disappointed. It is not like the songs on the album are, bad per se. Its just that they are deeply, intensely boring. I have trouble getting myself to work up the desire to listen to them, particularly when I still have access to A Ghost is Born, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, and Summer Teeth. I miss the old, experimental Wilco and hope that there next album is a return to form, rather than the boring snoozefest that is Sky Blue Sky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"I listen to this CD every day and will for a LONG time to come! I love all Wilco records, but I have a special place in my heart for this one, for reasons I cannot divulge, but I have a good reason.I love the title track, Jeff's voice is better than it's ever been, and it's an emotional record, full of just downright beautiful music. Also, for the fan who wants \\"rock\\", you've got Walken, Impossible Germany, Shake it Off, what more could you want? If you've never seen Wilco live, you must, a completed rewarding experience!You won't hear a lot of the noise that was on the last two Wilco CD's, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot or A Ghost is Born (both equally excellent records), this new one is quieter, but the lyrics and musicship are first rate.

Unfortunately it doesn't work and the album is disappointing and uncompelling even though some of the songs are very good. To me the biggest problem with this record is the overall sound: For a supposed return to alt-country the sound on this album is remarkably cold, sterile and unsatisfying. The music has no warmth and this is largely due to the sterile sound mix. This could have been a stellar album because some of the songs are really great: \\"Shake it off\\", \\"Walken\\", \\"On and On\\" and my favorite song on the album \\"What light\\", but the album is ruined by the disappointing sound mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Ghost is BORED","review":"this is boring. really boring. these songs, except for the first track, sound like outtakes from the third Wilco album, released in 1997, or perhaps songs that should have been free with a purchase of \\"The Wilco Book\\".

Their lead guitarist is flat out great. Very creative and he can burn when he needs to but most is just fun listening to. Some songs I just listen for his leads. But Tweedy and his new songs are fantastic. Great little melodies and their simplicity raises them even higher. But they are creative and original as anything I've heard in a while.

Mellow and laid back without being dull. The companion video is nice, too. I almost gave it 5 stars. The imagery in the lyrics are poetic without being too obtuse or pretentious. The music and words fit together quite well without feeling forced. The song structures and melodies are also fairly memorable without sounding overtly \\"hooky\\". It took a little while to grow on me, but it's become one of my favorite albums. I appreciate them not over cooking this one and keeping it a slightly raw. It's a little rough around the edges, and lacks some polish but this approach worked really well for \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" and is often far better than over-thinking and over-engineering an album."},{"rating":"1","title":"review:","review":"jeff tweedy is getting a little old. too bad. this album is pretty disappointing. it's not bad, but i think my expectations were too high. i'll never get my hopes up again (just kidding, i will)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite surprised, but pleased","review":"Wilco is not your ordinary pop band. Any new Wilco album will take time to get to know.When I first listened to Sky Blue Sky, I liked what I heard, and even picked out 3 favorite songs right off.Now I have listened to the album at least 15 times and feel that Wilco is both branching out to new sounds and refining their old style. They have really found their niche.This album is definately Wilco. If you liked Hotel Foxtrot, on whole, you will like this album. Give it at least 3 listens before deciding whether it is your favorite Wilco album or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nels Cline/Jeff Tweedy Collaboration","review":"The reason this is different from any previous Wilco album is that it features guitar iconoclast Nels Cline and is more a collaboration between Cline and Tweedy than a Wilco album per se. Cline's guitar playing is unlike any other, totally fresh and original, completely non-derivative. That being said, there is a Beatle-esque undercurrent to Tweedy's songs and the CD sounds like something the Beatles could have released in 1977 if they had continued recording and evolving that long. Tweedy and Cline collaborating is something like Rembrandt and Salvador Dali collaborating on a painting but somehow they make it work. This is a very good CD that may take several listens to grow on you so don't give up on it if it does not hit you all at once. If you are a guitar player of any musical style, Cline's playing is not to be missed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hugely enjoyable - a band in full bloom","review":"I've been a semi-fan of Wilco for a while, but they never seemed to hit that emotional sweet-spot that makes you swear undying love.Until now.This CD showcases what happens when a band hits full maturity -- the songwriting and musicianship brim with those tasty little nuances that separate the great albums from the merely good.Wilco has left the sonic meanderings behind and focused on fully developing each song into shiny little gems that you appreciate more with each listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great aid for sleeping disorders","review":"I give this new Wilco album credit for being so helpful with my insominia.

At any rate, Jeff Tweedy and the rest of the band continue to deliver great stuff with Sky Blue Sky.Standouts include smooth tracks like \\"What Light\\", \\"Either Way\\" and the title track. The band also does well with funkier songs, as evidenced by \\"Shake It Off\\" (although it's not the most accessible). And while some listeners might say that \\"On and On and On\\" is aptly titled, I think it closes the album quite nicely.The only real misstep is \\"Hate It Here\\", which made me say just that.

Count me among them, for although I eventually warmed to the \\"Summerteeth\\" to \\"Ghost is Born\\" sonic progression, I missed simple pleasures like \\"Passenger Side\\" from their debut album.That said, \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" is a huge disappointment. Whether Jeff Tweedy and company decide to dress their songs up with sonic flourishes is irrelevant if the songwriting isn't terribly compelling in the first place. \\"Sky\\" is a tepid folk rock album which contains not a single memorable track. It slides along pleasantly, and then fades from memory almost instantly. Too bad.

Mr. Johnson is quite creative, but his ideas lack any firm basis in classical studies or biblical studies. Instead of revealing secrets of Greek myth, he is instead creating new myths from whole cloth. Apart from having no apparent credentials or practical experience in classics and no peer-reviewed publications in the field, Mr. Johnson formulates what are effectively conspiracy theories that lack logical integrity; I am a non-professional, but even my avid amateur pursuit of ancient mythology and archaelogoy reveal the serious flaws in his books. I apologize to anyone who has been deceived by his work. In their place, I would respectfully recommend works like Mary Beard's excellent work for general readers \\"The Parthenon\\" or the somewhat denser \\"The Nature of Greek Myths\\" by G.S. Kirk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Athena and Kain: The True Meaning of Greek Myth","review":"ATHENA and KAIN is a superb read, a thoroughly enlightening experience. This book and Mr. Johnson's previous one, ATHENA and EDEN: THE HIDDEN MEANING OF THE PARTHENON'S EAST FACADE (which I have also read), are changing the way we think about the ancient Greek world. For the first time, Greek myth has meant something to me. I always knew that it connected somehow to the broader history of the human race, but I couldn't see how. Now I do.How quickly these books catch on in schools and among the public is anybody's guess. But I wonder: when we get to the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, and the media begin to speak about the Parthenon and other cultural treasures, will they understand what they see, or will they simply \\"ooh\\" and \\"aah\\" at some old Greek stuff somebody told them was important?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"Although this isn't the best book in the series, I enjoyed it nonetheless. Nora is a good character and strong, like all the Sunfire heroines. The romance makes for some very sweet scenes. My biggest complaint about the book is that there is more about Nora's romances than about Nora herself. Amanda (in the other book) has a character, with or without Ben, but Nora's isn't nearly so apparent.

In other words, it gets a little too silly at times. But the story is interesting, involving a rich young man from Switzerland who may or may not be who he claims to be. Another young man ends up dead in a swimming pool at a party, starting the mystery. At one point, McNally is working for three clients at the same time, which I thought would develop into more conflicts of interest than it did (seemed like a lost opportunity for the author). The drama of the second pool party was one of the best parts of the book.

Also, the two main characters in the beginning go to this house that basically has the ability to lower people's sexual inhibitions. Throughout the book, this is pretty much what Anthony talks about.

And, since the editors apparently listened to criticism of earlier editions, the third editions includes a useful index as well as table of contents.Some readers will be disappointed that it's not the book that it never meant to be. It never meant to be a tutorial or text book, it never meant to be a full specification of the language and libraries, and it never meant to be an encyclopedic description of the many available libraries.

The true heraldic craftsmen drew their inspiration from true heraldic sources, i.e. the Middle Ages. After 1600 or so heraldry went into a steep decline, culminating in the truly awful Victorian concept of depicting the 'real' thing, as opposed to the brutal and wonderful power of the symbolic art of earlier craftsmen. Thus we're stuck with 'real' lions and dragons and any kind of object, complete with shadowing. Well, the book was published in 1859, so I should have known better....

Color was not expected, but without blazon (heraldic description) or any other reference other than plate number, only the images are of any use. There is no table of contents, and although the images are grouped according to their central character (lion, tree, etc.), that is the extent of it. There is some mention of another archive, but not in a complete context. Hunting for it may be more of a chore than throwing your hands up and finding something else. I'm not even going to try. Also, since the images are in roughly the same style, an estimate of time period or place from one's own judgement of history is nearly impossible.Still, there are a lot of images, and by themselves are inspirational to some extent.Overall, not a complete waste, but not worth it, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always delightful","review":"We enjoy Bill Cosby's humor and never tire of listing to his stories.

The ending is similar to Oz, but also twisted on its head -- just like the rest of Chemical Gardens.It's not the predictability that bothers me. Given the nature of the story, that's unavoidable. The biggest issue for me is the ending. I have to admit there's closure of a sort, and the denial of expectation is nicely handled. But it felt too abrupt to me. I kept asking, \\"Really? That's it?

The first four tracks are peak hour goodness...after that, we get some energetic dubs (tracks 5-7), then the really boring tribal track AC/DC, before returning to some diva vocal and dark hard sounds on Can U Feel It. And 1974 ends things on a throbbing high note of hard tribal energy. Track times:1. Love in the Shadows (9:51)2. All around the World (7:19)3. Disco Inferno (6:03)4. Nothingness (5:22)5.

The larger scale responsibility challenges Alucius' leadership, but as always he responds with his best effort.His relationship with his wife Wendra is true love but quite bland. On the other hand his relationship with his executive officer Feran is wonderful. Modesitt captures the camraderie of brothers in arms and the graveyard cynicism of veteran troopers.One problem I had was Wendra leaping into battle with her young daughter in a carry sack. I found that hard to believe but that was the only problem I had with the book.A very enjoyable world and characters and I would highly recommend this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrapped Up","review":"Scepters is a satisfying mini-closure to the first three books in the Corean Chronicle series.

There is no momentum between the chain of events as each happening did not seem inevitable. Instead, it seemed as if the characters were bored so the author had to invent something to keep them busy. Also, the awareness of time is weak. One week could be forever and another 5 years so be just a paragraph. The reader has difficult picturing Hennie (and the other characters) grow and mature and to be aware of any distinct changes. In characters such as Dan, we see the author trying to present two sides of a personality. Unfortunately, it is so badly done that we see it as out of character. Furthermore, the author's attempts at sentimentality and to present inner strength are corny and lame, I had trouble not laughing.

Some like The Phantom Of The Opera are great campy fun but some are pretty dated as they were shot long ago. The audio for the videos vary. Some are louder than others.

Option Delta like the other Rogue Warrior bestsellers, takes the reader into a shadowy world that crosses between Indiana Jones and James Bond. Murder, evil terrorist conspiracies, world domination and historical behind the truth tidbits are just some of the elements making Option Delta a hard hitting gritty action packed, in your face adventure told by a veteran SEAL whose derring-do's allow him the journalistic ability to tell it as it really happens. Option Delta once again displays the talents of Demo Dick Macinko's highly motivated group of Naval SpecWarriors as they take us along for a grand adventure of shooting and looting and elimination of Tangos-in-question, as we sit safe in our reading chairs watching the Rouge one and his merry bunch of marauders do all of the dirty work."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked other Marcinko works, you won't be disappointed","review":"Option Delta is another Marcinko action packed tale.

Seven bucks down the toilet in my opinion. WTF, being macho is fine but little Dickie must wear a size 38 hat to match his IQ.Full commander in the Navy, huh? Now there is an example of the military state of incompetence that Dickie tries to present. The book itself is pure formula fiction with Dickie as the rogue hero and the rest of his two-dimensional characters inserted merely to prop up his over inflated ego. As a veteran of SpecOps myself, I think Dickie is FOS (look it up in the glossery). His tactics are a sham, his mission is covert yet he brags to everyone he meets that he is a SEAL. If this work of fiction is based upon his personal experiences, as he claims, then it's a miracle that he and his team are still among the living.

I too love my Bollywood, Tollywood and Collywood film music to put me right back into the modern sub-continent but, it's got to be classical Indian for that timeless, tranquil quality redolent of wide-open spaces almost untouched by human hand. A truly beautiful mellow sound with the somnolent tanpura knowing its place in the background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite Journey","review":"This is a wonderful album that I listen to almost daily for meditaion, relaxation and as inspiration while I paint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only two bangers","review":"I been a fan of SPM music since '96. I ain't trying to hate on this one, but this is his weakest cd. His production and Filero's production has'nt changed since the Hustle Town cd. This is mostly freestyles from Spm and Dopehouse family and not one song really stands out. Track 15 is probably the best and 17 is good but it sounds like you're listening to a tape. Some rhymes stand out and Spm shows he can freestyle, but the beats sound weak. Spm says this album was done in two days. They should've put more work on the music before releasing this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"More like Nowland, but still good","review":"It's a nice compilation of stories that takes now and brings it into a look-ahead perspective. It's got a lot of variety, so you won't get bored that easily. Ranging from sibling rivalries to dating hassles, all the short stories have some common trait we all can relate to like fear, loyality, faith, love, envy, anger, hatred and so on. The best story in my opinion (which actually boosts this rating) is the one written by the compiler himself. Cart's pre-millenium tale about a boy in love with a priest's daughter is pretty good and the climax of the boy's choice over right and wrong, between love and faith is released very well. All in all, the book's not a bad read...worth a look but not a buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tomorrowland Review","review":"Excellent book! The stories are interesting for young adults. I really recommend it to teachers to use it in the classroom. Students will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"This is quite possibly one of the best compilations of short stories I've ever read... each one good in its own way. This is a great book for someone of the middle school to highschool range, there's a lot of stories to relate to. Its very magical in the way it captures you... even more so than most adult novels I've read. This book really makes you think!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Why Is There Air\\" Is Hilarious!!!!!!","review":"This album is hilarious. You'll laugh till it hurts. This album has some of the funniest routines I have ever heard.Like \\"Kindergarten\\" and how they never learn anything exept how to say goodbye to your parents without crying, And of course there's nothing better for a bunch of five year old children, than a glass of..Luke-warm, Curdly Milk (In Cosby's own words).Or \\"Driving in \\"San Francisco\\".And \\"Hofstra\\", one of my favorites, I'll never forget the way Cosby says, \\"And the pain.....Was..Tremendous.....And I dropped the ball.....and I said..OH.\\". That makes me laugh so hard evry time I hear it. Those and others are all on this album. Correction.. Those and other Wonderfull routines are on this HILARIOUS album. I recommend you get this. I order you to get this. SO, GET IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good clean humor -- really funny!","review":"My son loved his Christmas gift. I originally had this as a record; time to upgrade. A classic that never gets stale or goes out of style."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Have you ever tried to blow out a flare?\\"","review":"I have a few of Bill Cosby's albums. This one and \\"Himself\\" are my two favorites. Every track on this album will give you at least one good belly laugh. \\"Kindergarten\\" is my favorite track. \\"Hofstra\\" is another good one where he discusses his days on the Temple football \\"nut squad\\" as he calls it. \\"Baby\\", where he discusses being an expectant father, will bring a smile to your face. Overall, this is one of the best comedy albums I've ever heard and the fact that it still very funny forty years after its release is a testament to Bill Cosby. A highly recommended purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Who puts a stop sighn at the top of the hill?\\"","review":"Great. Top notch. Better than....ummmm...LOTS!!! You gotta like the Cos. (short for Cosby for the younger readers :))! Buy this, I don't care who you are you will laugh. He was the inspiration for Jerry Seinfeld, or so I heard. Funnyer than the show and the cartoon (fat Albert). If you like Bill Cosby, you may also like Richard Pryor, or Steven Wright. Please buy it online, or it is also available at most Borders near you. Don't just disregard this, either. It's only $10.00. And it provides hours of laughs every time you hear it. It's totally free of profanitys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cosby answers that question along with others","review":"Cosby's third album deals with more contemporary situations: Driving in San Francisco, the trouble of owning a watch dog, buying a very cheap car, dealing with a toothache, among others.

I once saw him perform live in Chattanooga, TN at the yearly Riverbend festival. It was strange because they usually reserve the main stage (\\"Coke Stage\\") for big musical acts.

Many of the \\"Self Review\\" exercises go beyond what has been covered in the chapters. It would be extremely helpful in the event one is unable to code the solution to an exercise, to be able to review sample code, learn from it and move on. The accompanying CD's and Website downloads offer no assistance. They are simply a mirror copies of the chapter project solutions already printed in the book and do not provide solutions to the \\"Self-Review\\" exercises. The absence of the \\"Self-Review\\" solutions, in my opinion, reduced this book from a 4 star rating to 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Beginners","review":"This book does not deliver what it promises. I bought it BECAUSE it claimed to contain exercises and solutions. $100 dollars later (yes, that is what I paid, for the book and CD) I discovered, buried in the Preface, that in order to get the solutions to the actual exercises, you must be a teacher and have a PH representative.The authors also smugly tell the reader NOT TO send them mail requesting the answers. I thought this sneaky and unfair and I will avoid these authors in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read without some outside help.","review":"I thought this book would launch me from my former enjoyment of Microsoft Basic programming endeavors into the fascinating world of object- oriented programming. I found it unfriendly and was sorry that its inability to lead one into new territory really required a knowledgeable guide or teacher. The CD which came with my copy would not boot on my PC, so that resource was unavailable and no help was forthcoming from the publisher despite many calls. This purchase was a... mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent VB6.0 book for intermediate level VB programmer","review":"This is the best VB 6.0 book I have ever had.

Incorrect answers to exercises, text out of place, etc. However, I like Deitel & Deitel. If you are a beginner D&D are some of the best books out their to learn programming from. Their books give thorough explanations. They are not designed to be read in 21 days! These are books for people who learn from books. I skipped the section that contained trigonometry though - more complexity than I need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate for a student","review":"This book has been used as the standard text at a well known university for a number of semesters. However, due to numerous complaints, they will be taking it off the text list as of semester 1, 2002 and about time.The layout of the book is hopeless with its' mixture of BOLD text and red diagrams, let alone the assumptions the majority of the chapters make about the readers' experience. The answers to the chapter questions should be provided on the CD, not just to teachers/lecturers. I have read the book a number of times on various topics without success and gave up - looked elsewhere for the answers. Definitely not a beginners book - \\"VB6 for Dummies\\" is a far better option and approximately $AUS70 cheaper.The authors really need to look at their text layout style and providing answers to end of chapter exercises - I'll avoid further books from Deitel."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID THIS BOOK","review":"If you are someone who is confused by Visual Basic 6, then DO NOT buy this book. It will only serve to confuse you more. If, however, you are an accomplished programmer and enjoy poorly written books, then go for it. The book, supposedly for Visual Basic 6 novices, is written in a very complicated language that is inappropriate for beginners. It disorganized and the included tutorial has a very sedative effect. This book is about as useful to a student of computer programming as a hammer is to someone changing a light bulb. So much so, my entire class has petitioned the school administration to not only discontinue use of this book for Visual Basic classes, but to not use ANY other titles by these authors for other courses. Consider yourself warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most chaotic textbooks books ever written.","review":"This book has a seemingly random structure. For example, arrays are taught before basic control structures.It constantly gives a simple explanation(meaning not adequate), then gives you a complex, non real world example by way of practice.This is our textbook for a vb class. Yet most of the students have spent more money to get themselves another understandable textbook appropriate for beginners.Teachers - Save your students the agony of sifting through this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners!","review":"I am new to VB, but not new to learning, and I found this to be one of the most frustrating books I've ever tried to learn from.

I lay most of the blame on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"The book is just plain horrible! It assumes WAY TOO MUCH! I am learning VB6 in school and this is the book that they are teaching us from. Many times throughout the book they give program examples using things that haven't even been covered yet. The exercises at the end of the chapters are very vague. The choice of color also is bad (brownish/red text) and makes for a poor reading experience. The tips and common programming errors sprinkled throughtout the chapters become annoying very quickly. My advice, pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for the warning","review":"After reading reviews I checked it out and many are correct. This book is not for one trying to learn VB.

After, reading Chp 1 and Chp 2, I am so mad at this text book, I could scream. If the book contained working exercise problems, one might be able to work through and learn from them. I guess the only way to get the working answers, you must purchase it through an authorized Prentice Hall represenative. The examples are very difficult. I am very disgusted with this book. In fact, it really made me to re-think Visual Basic. Visual Basic authors need to think about really teaching Visual basic, and stop showing the world, Hey look how great I can program. This book is written for the MIT students of the world, however their is a 95% of us who do not fall into this cat. Very unhappy with this book. Awful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good introduction or refresher book","review":"This book is written like a college textbook.

The lining is very soft though they feel a bit thinner than I expected. They are \\"one size\\" which generally means they won't fit me as I have long fingers, but these fit me quite well. Each mitten was sewn very differently. One was nice and rounded on the top and the other was sewn with much more of a point on the top.

Over all these are cute and soft, but I would not recommend them based on the lack quality for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super cute on the outside, super soft on the inside","review":"My husband gave these to me for a Christmas present.

You can hear the joy and the pain, as Gerald's voice goes from sweet to scratchy, and the music goes from just his guitar to full band. It's very basic, the lyrics and Gerald's voice carry the album, with a backing band filled with pedal steel, drums and bass. You don't really need anything else - the power is in what he as to say and how he says it.

Maybe, but this disc is so cliche, it seems to be the only explanation. The lyrics are clunky at best, the melodies are tired. I tried to get into this disc, I really did, but it's an absolute snooze. (Note: Live, he's even worse.) Trust me: Save your dough, and buy some of the CDs Collier is so obviously stealing from: Willie Nelson's The Red-Headed Stranger, Wilco's Being There, anything by The Replacements, etc. Maybe I got this guy pegged all wrong, but something tells me I'm right on the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty","review":"All I will say is that there is enough nudity in this to fill a magazine.

This globe is very good for the price. He loves the raised relief on it and the vividness of the colors, you can see the mountainous terrain even below sea level. This globe also comes with a mini booklet that gives you ways on how to use it including a dial for time zone difference around the world. The base is metal and it looks great in his \\"man cave\\"/office. Also I want to add that this item was shipped super fast!

On this globe, you can see both the mountain ranges on terre firma and under the oceans. It is a beautiful globe, not cheaply made as I have seen on other globes. I guess the only thing that I don't really like about this map is trying to find particular countries or cities...they are there, just in small print. But, as I said, I have plenty of maps with that info on them, but this globe, it is one of a kind. Both sides of my family have oohed and ahhed over it.

His investment and acquistion strategies that have resulted in him winning the market time and time again are reviewed extensively. Buffett does not buy stocks, he buys companies. Not only that, he buys and holds. A good review of the influence of Buffett's mentors like Ben Graham and Philip Fisher is also undertaken. This is a must read for people looking to profit in the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I think it is a very good book to understand how the guys thinks about the whole game of investing. You can clearly see the signs of a seasoned investor throughout the book. But how much useful will it be for people like you and me, that's questionable. Imagine if Tiger Woods tells you how he plays golf or Mozart tells you how he composed those lyrics. It is kind of that. I think it is just a knack of things that either you have or you don't have. But do read the book just to get some idea about the financial market and its potholes that you need to be aware of."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is crap!","review":"The author of this book, Robert Hagstrom, has never spoken to Mr. Buffett about investing. Yet for some strange reason Hagstrom feels qualified to write about Buffett's investment methods. After the book came out Hagstrom started a mutual fund to exploit his readers' trust, Hagstom claimed that he was going to use Buffett's methods as outlined in this book. But Hagstrom's mutual fund turned in such poor results he had to close it down. If you use the investment methodology found in this book you too will get the same poor results that Hagstrom did. If you want to know how Buffett did it, you should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly written precise of Buffett's annual reports.","review":"Far from giving the reader an insight into the investment strategies of the world's greatest investor this book simply summarises selected comments from Buffett in his annual reports of Berkshire Hathaway.

Don't waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and not very useful","review":"This book was a chore to read, which is a shame because it could have been a great book due to its subject matter (Warren Buffet, one of the greatest investors ever). Unfortunately, the author's presentation is dry and dull, and the information detailed within is not as useful as it should be -- I had hoped to see more detailed discussions of the process by which Buffet makes his investments. My expectations for this book were high and they were dashed.Instead of reading this book, I would seek out and read Warren Buffet's own writings, as well as articles about him and his investments in magazines such as Business Week. Doing this will give you a rounded picture of \\"The Warren Buffet Way\\" with the additional benefit of Buffet's own commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"No depth to this book","review":"I can quickly summarize this book for you:<ul><li>Warren Buffett is a very intelligent man</li><li>Coca-cola Washington Post, Wells Fargo are all exemplar companies</li><li>Buy good value companies with good management</li></ul>This book does not go beyond repeating these points. It does not answer the mechanics of valuing companies or Warren Buffet's methodology of determining good companies. It merely looks at companies who have done \\"well\\" and provides historical data on what \\"well\\" means. The author does not even attempt to explain the companies' success by analyzing management's decisions or otherwise.This book is a good start for somebody who has never seen an investment book, but provides no real information to help with evaluating businesses. The information presented in this book can be summarized in 3 chapters -- Chapter 1 for Warren Buffets biography, chapter 2 for investment philosophies. Chapter 3 for historical data for Warren Buffet's favourite companies."},{"rating":"2","title":"good introduction to value investing","review":"I was fascinated when I first read this book. It was during my junior year in college when I struggled to comprehend vague ideas such as covariance between stocks, portfolio variance, beta, etc. This book opened my eyes. It was like a fresh breath of air.Hagstrom does a good job at introducing Warren Buffet's way of investing. The book is a mandatory reading for everyone who wishes to invest money in stocks.As other reviewers pointed out, Hagstrom doesn't reveal anything new about Buffet's investment style. You can find the same information, and much more, from the source: The Berkshire Hathaway Annual Reports. Hagstrom, however, offers a well-written and fairly accurate presentation of what can be found in Buffet's letters to shareholders. It is a good introduction to value investing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little content","review":"There really isn't much content in the book. I suspect the author had other interests, such as his management of a mutual fund that claims to be inspired by Buffet.First it goes into a little historical background on Buffet and his companies. Then one reasonably good chapter that summarizes his investment strategies. The final chapter repeats this all over again; a waste of print and paper.In the middle there are several chapters that describe his company's permenant holdings, long term holdings, and other holdings. These sections are extremly tedious and boring, and add very little value to the reader.Birkshire is very honest and strait shooting in its annual reports. Many readers would be better off reading to a copy of that, before picking up this book. And the annual report is free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Six stars!","review":"This book describes Buffet's investment principles and decisions in a clear, brief and very good way. Especially interesting is the discussion of the tenets that guide Buffet's purchases and the analysis of some of Buffet's investments, following these tenets. Buffet is the most succesful investor of the last decades, so studying his decisions and philosophy is, according to me, one of the best things an investor can do to learn about the business. This book offers an excellent opportunity to do so.(By the way, if you really want to know how Buffet operates, reading the books of his masters, Fisher and especially Graham, is a requisite too!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Go right to the heart of the matter with Graham and Dodd's Security Analysis if you want to know how Buffett started.

I think I got bored with chasing it down after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book doesn't work - I lost money","review":"I have tried to follow the aggressive growth investment strategies of Mr. Richards, but I have lost a great deal of money during this period. I appreciated the writing style and the content of the book which left both enthused and looking forward to boosting the value of my portfolio. Unfortunately, I think that Mr. Richard's premise that \\"the trend is your friend\\" is specious and misleading, because sometimes the trend is not your friend. I think perhaps I will attempt to adopt a less aggressive approach, and may try the 'value investing' approach of a Mr. Warren Buffet, whose company Berkshire Investments attempts to follow this approach, although they have lost a lot of money recently. Or maybe I will just try some treasury bonds, or maybe try nothing at all, or try gardening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read and interesting","review":"I'm not an expert in economics and finance at all. However, the author explains difficult terms very easily and provides the reader with interesting examples and curiosities about the professional life of Warren Buffet. Specially interesting the explanation of the intellectual framework of Warren Buffet, that is, from which authors and ideas he developed his financial strategies. I haven't finished the book yet, but what I've read so far (more than a half) really worths the money it costs. You will learn very interesting issues that I think you'll be able to apply to your financial needs, like the tenets on which Buffet decide his investments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing original or enlightening","review":"I don't know about Buffet's annual letters, but I have read books that talk about his style/philosophy of investing. And this book seems to do the same. It severely lacks originality and brings nothing new to the table. A high school student could summarize 10-12 books from Buffet's investment principles and do a better job than this. There are much better books in the market, I would pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's nothing new here","review":"There isn't anything in this book that you won't find in Warren Buffett's annual letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (available for free at the Berkshire Hathaway website). If you've not read those letters then I suggest you get right to it - they clearly lay out Mr Buffett's approach to investing and are written in a very easy to read, humorous and homely style.This book pulls many of the highlights from those letters together in one place and lays out some major tenets and themes that could be said to make an investment \\"Buffett like\\".If you're not familiar with Warren Buffett and have not read his letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway - then you will likely find this to be a good introduction to Buffett. Anybody else should probably steer clear as there isn't anything new here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Weiner","review":"The hat came in perfect condition and my dad loved it.

Out of nowhere it will get all fuzzy and skippy and sometimes it will skip 5 second clips.3. It reads the cd tracks very slowly.4. It takes about 30 seconds to load, WHY DOES IT HAVE TO LOAD.5. You can not just skip right to one song, if you press buttons too fast it will get confused and the laser will move all around for no reason.6. (...)The prosessor is too slow to show streaming graphics so the games are all skippy. If you play the games a lot you loose even more battery life.7. The only format that it plays well is mp3. I do not want to waste a ton of blank cds just so that the cd player will play right.8. You have to keep it still.

As I've gone thru \\"Season 4 (The Definitive Edition)\\" it's like viewing an entire \\"lost\\" string of episodes from the genius of Rod Serling. They are all wonderful but I am drawn particularly to \\"Mute\\", \\"The Parallel\\", \\"No Time Like the Past\\" & \\"Passage on the Lady Anne\\" as my personal favorites.Some intriguing artifacts are the colorized scenes from the syndicated version of \\"Miniature\\". While this is an interesting aspect of the storyline and gives a nice \\"over the rainbow\\" effect to the story, it also demonstrates why the dreaded colorization process of original Black & White films should NEVER be applied.

Lewis is the only human that knows about their powers, but later on Zane and Ash(Rikki and Emma's boyfriends)find out the magical secret. It would be more, magical if the main characters had different color of tails. Such as Emma would have a light blue tail. Cleo which has the power of wind would greatly benifit if she had a silver tail. Rikki would have the same color sence it resembles fire. This would be a great change in a further season if you plan on making one. It would be Their powers(stronger) and their tail colors changed. Like an evelotion of their powers as mermaids.

It has a windcap rather than a pirouette, which would make it a rauschpfiefe, but unlike either, the bore is cylindrical (or very narrowly tapered), rather than broadly conical. The sound was weak and lacked any of the strident power of a shawm (which should be loud enough to raise the dead, or at least get them to roll over in their graves...). When compared with a real shawm (like a zurna), it is apparent that this instrument was designed by someone who really knew nothing about shawms.About the only positive things I can say about this are (1) it makes noise, and (2) it's a fairly attractive looking thing if you want it as a prop rather than as an instrument.I'd consider this instrument to be worth about $20, not the $100+ that it's being sold for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Racist Trash","review":"I'm not sure how anyone can speak of this book as well-written, and I'm even more horrified that the racist tirades contained in it are described as a complex secondary narrative. No way. This is poorly written self-congratulatory racism, homophobia, and (much more subtle) sexism. The author doesn't have the skill necessary to spin a complex secondary narrative, much less one that is critical of its narrator; this racism is heartfelt, and it should not be ignored or overlooked. It turns my stomach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pressfield Does it again.","review":"I read Pressfield's Fantastic \\"Gates of Fire\\" and this is a close second. I have also read Valario Manfredi's supurb Trilogy on Alexander. This story is even more gripping.Also to all those who are dissapointed in the non-gayness of this book: There is absolutely no evidence that Alexander had a gay relationship with Hephastion. All that is mentioned by the ancient authors is that they were \\"philoi.\\" (Greek for Good Friends) The kind of very close friend you have when you know someone from childhood. It was the lesbian Mary Renalt who corrupted Alexander's legacy to be primarily gay. This is bogus. Read the ancient authors such as Plutarch and you will find no evidence of this. Steven Pressfield rightly concentrates on Alexander's great battles, not on prime time tv style gossip. It urks me to no end when people twist facts to fit their own agenda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"Readers of historical fiction will be utterly captivated by \\"The Virtues of War.\\" This was the first Steven Pressfield novel I've read and was totally impressed by his writing. The storyline flows seamlessly and the tremendous battle scenes, told through the eyes and voice of Alexander the Great himself, unfold in all their chaotic grandeur. Battles aside, Alexander's memoirs - his upbringing and his rise to power - are fascinating. Trained to be a soldier and a warrior his memoirs reflect a man who is most restless when ruling an empire but is most alive when leading an army into battle. As a warrior-king he is a man of extremes - compassionate and utterly ruthless, forgiving and uncompromisingly vengeful. Ultimately, Alexander is shown as a man, much like Ahad, who is obsessively driven in pursuit, not of a great white whale, of conquest itself.\\"The Virtues of War\\" is a terrific read about one of the greatest military geniuses in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alexander The Obsessed","review":"This is my third, but not last, Pressfield historical novel on the ancient Greeks. Not as good as Gates of Fire, but better than Tides of War. He is much more focused here, moving the history along at a brisk pace, using his typical first person account of events. But this time the first person is Alexander himself, not just an observer.According to Pressfield's lights, the protagonist starts out a decent, wise leader and great military tactician, gradually over the years becoming a maniacal killer of friends as well as enemies, infatuated with his destiny as Lord of the Persian Empire and India. The battle scenes and speeches, as always, are lyrical and captivating. Read Pressfield."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well crafted.","review":"This is a well researched book on some of the campaigns of Alexander the Great that is creatively written in the novel format. The reader becomes privy to the strategies and the problems of waging war across Western Asia during Alexander's time. My heart raced as I read some of the battle scenes and I could feel the anguish of the soldiers who lost their comrades to mutilation by their enemy. This book will not appeal to the whose who enjoy romance novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocrity at its best","review":"I don't know if the author is trying to make ancient history more understandable for the modern reader, but he turns me off. He talks about lieutenants and captains and regiments and corps as if Alexander's army were a modern one. It wasn't. To compare, try Colleen McCullough's infinitely superior 6-volume historical novel on the Roman Republic of Caesar's time. She uses the right terminology and gives the reader the feeling that both she, and now the reader, really understood how the Roman cities, army, and government were organized and what life was like then. You just don't get that with Pressfield. I assume he did research, but it's just not evident."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing compared to other Pressfield","review":"There are interesting aspects of Alexander which a fictional book can take a stand on: his godhead, patrocide, homosexuality, fascination with the East, etc. Pressfield ignores these almost completely. E.g., he doesn't even mention the pilgrimage to Sliwa.So I agree with other reviews that you would do better with a biography such as Michael Grant's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed because Bagoas was never even mentioned.It was an interesting perspective on the 'joys of war'. But I was certainly hoping for some mention of my personal favorite Alexander player.I suppose most readers wouldn't have my hangups, but I was hoping for a more personal view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made for TV Movie","review":"Disregard all the pretentious blather by the 5-star raters. They must be friends of the author or in league with the publisher.This latest pseudo-historical is nothing more than glorification of an idealized western conquerer who was more akin to Peter Pan ad Michael Jackson than Genghis Khan. That's right, Alexander was known to invite 'pretty little boys' to share his tent during the evenings--and it wasn't for milk and cookies.. How come most Historians and books about Alexander leave out the telling nugget of information.As for the rest of the book, there are some interesting moments when topics related to battle tactics, logistics and strategy are covered. Otherwise, the book seems to pander to the Hollywood crowd looking for the next Braveheart or Troy where central hero gives a motivational speech before the killing begins.If you must read this book, check it out from the library and save the trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Nice and very personal in some descriptions, e.g. the battle scenes, but Pressfield leaves huge holes in his story of Alexander the Great.

The first unit started by randomly telling me that my DVD was a \\"BAD Disc\\" after about of minute of trying to load. Then it would lock up or freeze while playing a movie and I had to unplug it to reset the thing. Sent that one in and got a new unit that played fine the first few days and then, you guessed it, right back to the same symptoms once again. This time around I was able to get the service rep to send me a prepaid shipping label to send the unit back so I don't have to fork over another $41 shipping fee to send it back.

Christine McVie is truly underated in her talent as a singer and songwriter. If you like the smooth vocal blends and the consistent performance that Fleetwood Mac offers, you'll love this work. Christine shows that she can write and sing blues, ballads, and mid-tempo rhythms that would make Mick Fleetwood turn his head. In fact, Mick is on a song or two. Not only is McVie in better voice than ever, her songs tend to rock a little harder her norm. McVie also creates many atmostpheres that stick to a very pleasant formula. While she doesn't go over the top like Lindsey Buckingham, this album is very solid and a definite gem for your collection. It's safe to say that Fleetwood Mac would have a huge hole without Christine. Great songs: One in a Million, Got A Hold On Me, Ask Anybody, This Smile I Live For, and The Challenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfortunate disappointment","review":"To be disappointed in anything Christine McVie does musically is a surprise, but this album was disappointing. Always the better voice in Fleetwood Mac, she doesn't disappoint in that area, but the songs themselves are fairly mundane. Most of the songs contained on this album seem over-produced which seems to make them bland and repetitive. I had no real desire to go back and listen to anything again after my initial and a repeat play of this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Although you can probably find this CD in the bargain bin, don't even waste your $$$ . I was really disappointed in this CD. I like Christine but have always felt the true draw and star of Fleetwood Mac was Stevie Nicks.It does't sound like there was any thought or effort put into the songs on this CD.It's a good thing Christine has decided to retire -"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Heart and Soul of Fleetwood Mac","review":"Christine McVie has long been the glue holding Fleetwood Mac together. She has been the one constant -- and this solo album from 1984 should have been the start of a second solo career for the former Christine Perfect. How it was overlooked the way it was I cannot imagine, but these things sometimes happen. Why McVie hasn't tried a second solo effort since this is also beyond fathoming. But, like I say, she IS the heart and soul of Fleetwood Mac -- not Stevie Nicks or Lindsey Buckingham, as great as they both are. When they both jumped ship, Christine anchored the not as bad as everyone claimed Mac album \\"Time.\\" She was the highlight, but even the other songs weren't throwaways. I fear for the Mac's new disc -- without Christine's vocals and songwriting. It won't be as good...that's a given. But will it be an embarassment? We'll see."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of, if not the, best solo album from a Fleetwood Mac member","review":"Always the possessor of a rich, deep singing voice no matter what she's singing, this solo work from Christine McVie pretty much goes to show why she was always considered the most important member of Fleetwood Mac. She had a huge pop hit here with the indelible \\"Got A Hold On Me\\" and a somewhat less sizable hit with \\"Love Will Show Us How.\\" Also great are the Got A Hold On Me-ish \\"The Challenge\\" and the dark, haunting \\"Ask Anybody.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Christine McVie is Ms Perfect","review":"This album shows that Fleetwood Mac needed Christine McVie/Perfect, not the other way around.

Her songs on Mystery to Me, Bare Trees, etc. got me into the group before they hit the big time, and her later songs, often along with Lindsay Buckingham got even better. So I am sad to say I am disappointed by this disc. Just not as good as her best. Many rock songwriters run out of creative gas, and it sounds like she has. I hope she can reinvent herself rather than try to rehash the same chords and lyric themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Christine - Less Instruments!","review":"I think Christine is just wonderful but I wish that this album had been mixed with more emphasis on the vocals. I just heard her solo \\"Songbird\\" number on the making \\"Rumors\\" DVD (which was also spoiled by the insertion of John McVie's comments) and it made me again realize what a wonderful voice she has. Unhappily it is largely overwhelmed on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown!","review":"I love Christine's input with Fleetwood Mac, but this CD is bor-ing! The chorus of \\"Got A Hold On Me\\" is repeated about 4 times too many, and the rest of the CD is only average- there is no song on this CD I would really want to hear. Christine sounds much better when heard between Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks songs on a Fleetwood Mac album."},{"rating":"1","title":"radio review","review":"I got my radios before they were due to arrive.

I had never heard of her when I read \\"Onions In the Stew\\" 25 years ago, and now that's it's coming back into print, it deserves re-discovery. I defy anyone to get through the first chapter without laughing out loud. I'm loathe to describe Mac Donald as \\"in the Erma Bombeck mold\\"-as Betty is MUCH wittier-and also warmer. \\"Onions In the Stew\\" is thirty-something Betty's account of life during WW2 with one husband, two adolescent daughters, and many, many assorted pets, neighbors, unwanted guests,et al on an island in Washington's Puget Sound. No sentimentality, loads of wry observation, and some touching, quite beautiful descriptions of what was then wild island life.

I read it over and over and over until my copy just fell apart. I have often wondered over the years just what the island those people lived on looks like today, it sounded like a beach-y heaven to me. Today I suppose it's paradise paved over with million dollar condos, pricey strip malls, and Starbucks. I recommend this book, it is a warm and witty slice of life that is no more.

The main event was supposed to be Vader vs Sid, and the show was even advertised as such. However, at the last minute a drunk Arn Anderson attacked Sid, and so Ric Flair was substituted, thus guaranteeing a boring show. Elsewhere, Steve Austin's moment of glory is ruined by the lights going out (really), The British Bulldog-Rick Rude International Title Match becomes Rude-Bossman five minutes beforehand, Steve Regal and Rick Steamboat bore the fans, and the Tag Title Match is endless, and not in a good way.

Faith is about love, religion is about the institution around, not worse nor better than all other institutions, ie a machine with its own robotic logic that can brainwash and destroy.This book is about dedication, humility, respect and tolerance.

It seems as though they couldn't decide between making it a mini-series or a movie and the end project is pretty scrambled. All and all it was an hour and a half movie crammed in to 4 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"After hearing of all the work and committment to accuracy that went into this production, and having just finished the book, I had high expectations for the film. Far too high, I'm afraid. Not only did the production virtually strip out the Union officers, it portrayed the remaining Confederate offcers in two dimensions. I was so disappointed, I didn't even finish the video. To it's credit, the unpaid Civil War re-enactors did a fine job portraying the battles. Beyond that, the movie doesn't do the book or the characters the justice they deserve. Do yourself a favor and spend your three hours starting the book - you'll have a tough time putting it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete and way too long!!","review":"It's a good thing I watched the Ken Burns documentary, \\"The Civil War\\" or else this film would have been a star less. This movie is way too long. The film should have been cut down by about 1 and a 1/2 hours. I would have also liked to have seen the Jeff Daniels' character taken out and concentrated more on the Confederate generals relationships further. The battlefield sequences were well done and could have used more blood and graphic depictions to show how real war is. Overall, there are better films out there that do a much better job in telling the story of the Civil War such as the outstanding film, \\"Glory\\" or the controversial \\"The Birth of a Nation\\". \\"Gods and Generals\\" could have been a much better film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing....","review":"I completely expected to love this movie. I'm a proud Southerner with a passion for Civil War history (or ANY history, for that matter). But watching this movie actually made me squirm in my seat, I felt so sorry for the actors. I guess they did the best with what they had, but the script seemed terribly \\"plastic\\" and unrealistic. It was one speech after another about the importance of honor, or the Confederacy, or love, or some other grand notion. Life just isn't like that, especially during war time. I can't imagine that anyone ever really talked that way! Compare it with Cold Mountain, which excellently shows the human struggle to maintain honor amidst the horrors of war. In \\"Gods and Generals\\", the writers just tried too hard. SHOW us honor, don't just TELL us about it. SHOW us love, don't just TALK about it. Very awkward. See Cold Mountain instead, if you're a Civil War buff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually, one star minus!","review":"I've never written a review before, and I know there are already fifty bad reviews of this movie, but it was so bad I can't help it.I bought this DVD for my husband for a gift and ended up apologizing for it.

Save yourselves the agony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully bad","review":"As is obvious, the only people who like this movie are reenactors and Lost cause enthusiasts. The movie itself has absolutely no connection with history. It is filled with scenes that never happened, invented by the moviemakers in an attempt to re-write history. No matter what some of these reviewers say, the moviemakers editted the rather large mention of slavery from Virginia's secession declaration, again in an attempt to portray secession as something it wasn't. As a movie, it is a complete failure, a series of bloated, neo-Victorian speeches wrapped up in a gauze of self-importance. The moviemakers claimed that it failed in the theaters because of a liberal conspiracy. Yeah, liberal as in an appreciation for good movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me when we get to Appomattox","review":"The Civil War lasted four years, and if you watch \\"Gods and Generals\\" you'll swear it does, too. Odd, \\"Gettysburg\\" was just as long, but held my interest from beginning to end, and I've watched it three times. I couldn't sit through one showing of this mess.

The characters were like marble statues; cold, hard, distant and impersonal. The action was like reading half-interesting plaques about the battles; there was struggle, there was strife, but I didn't care. Ultimately, the best feature was seeing the authentic weaponry and uniforms the soldiers used.The camera work was either distantly fake or staged close-up. Nothing flowed, nothing drew me in, it just happened as I casually observed. The acting of some was plain horrible. The dialogue given to decent actors was painfully ostentatious. Finally, the movie just tried too hard to apologize/explain the Confederacy.This is a pretentious film that fails as an epic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad","review":"Really bad acting and an even worse script. This might be historically accurate, but this is probably the worst movie that I have ever seen about the Civil War. I would have rated this 0 stars, but that was not an option. I am a really big fan of Robert Duval's, but even he could not overcome the horrible script. I did watch this until the end, but the pain was unbearable. If you want to see a great Civil War movie, watch Glory, Gone With The Wind or Band of Angels.....not Gods and Generals."},{"rating":"1","title":"What exactly did I just plunk down 6 bucks for?","review":"The genius behind Gettysburg is that it takes 3 days and looks at the events that unfold through the eyes of three very different men. In this way you learn how the people really felt and you can see what they were thinking.Gods and Generals is somewhat historically accurate. Most battles are resonable portrayed but the section where Lee is \\"affirmed\\" as the Southern Military leader is absurd. In relaity, Lee only was promoted to the head of the Army of Northern Virginia when Joe Johnston was injured.Furthermore, all the brilliance of looking at the events through the eyes of one character is simply lost. What does the Civil War early days have to do with Jackson drinking lemonade?I will never know.Gods and Generals could have been a magnificent movie, but it spent maybe 40 mins portraying the war and about 1 hr and 40 mins looking at Jackson.I give this 1 star. I hope The Last Full Measure, if they make it, is not made in this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Civil War at its most boring....","review":"I enjoy Civil War movies. I've read more books on this war than I can possibly count. I've spoken with The Late Shelby Foote, David Stroud and a number of other prominant Civil War writers. So the subject matter was flat out interesting. I was excited to see this movie. Especially after Gettysburg. This movie, however, paled in comparison to just about every movie I've ever seen on this subject. It was boring, poorly edited and the dialog was contrived and unbelievable, not to mention unmotivated. You're in a WAR! That's your motivation!The ensemble cast includes giants such as Jeff Daniels and Robert Duvall. But the casting of several others failed to meet the mastery that was Gettysburg.This movie was a monumental failure and one that is not likely to be repeated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for The Last Full Measure","review":"I saw this epic the day it was released & went to it again a few weeks ago.

To begin with, the opening credits have what could be one of the most beautiful and touching songs ever written. A stunning ballad by the lovely Mary Fahl called \\"Going Home\\" melts your heart. It is sure to be an Academy Award nominee for best song (or at least it should be). One can only wonder what other gems are on Ms. Fahl's new cd \\"The Other Side of Time.\\" And more of beautiful women ... the very attractive and under utilized young actress Mira Sorvino gives a compelling performance. It is a pity we don't see more of her on screen. Jeff Daniels is a class A actor and never disappoints, and of course, Robert Duvall is always superb. Stephen Lang is the star of the show. While we may get tired of the non-stop \\"God bothering\\", Lang is a wildly talented actor who gives an Oscar-worthy performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Premise, poorly executed","review":"The historical aspects were fairly accurate, but the acting was so poor that it detracted from the story.

Recently, I purchased Patton and a few other 'oldies' on Blu-Ray and was amazed [and thrilled] at the quality of the content. If you enjoyed Gods and Generals on DVD, you **MUST** get the Blu-ray version. It is outstanding. I am on the list for the BR version of Gettysburg. Lastly, a word of thanks to Ted Turner for having the guts to produce both Gods and Generals and Gettysburg. There are many of us who fervently hope he will eventually complete the Trilogy. These are priceless and timeless works of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Movie about the Civil War","review":"Despite it's length, this is a great movie. The battle scenes are excellent. The emotion is overwhelming. The determination of each side is inspiring. This is a well rounded movie. It not only opens your eyes to the reality of the Civil War, it also makes you feel as though you are there. At times I believed that I was watching the battlefield from afar. The actors and actresses are great, but I was particularly affected by Stephen Lang as Stonewall Jackson. He is the movie. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to see a great movie, and to everyone that loves history."},{"rating":"2","title":"From an Educated Southerner","review":"As a re-enactor and Civil War Historian I tend to be critical of movies based on topics I know about. Gettysburg was a great movie and I believe Maxwell did another great job with this one. The attention to detail was amazing complete with the sight of the Nothern Lighs after the Battle of Fredricksburg, which is well documented on both sides. It showed both sides rather well and I think Stephen Lang was better as Jackson then I expected him to be. I believe that at least Sharpsburg, (Antietam for you Northern Folk) should have been shown. This was Chamberlian's first view of war and a very important battle. I also think they could have followed the book a little more. Over all though it was accurate, to the point of the famed 4th Texas Infantry Band and the conversation between General Hood and General Jackson. Seemed like it would be Hollywood but the conversation really occured and is documented in Hood's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed! I hoped for much more.","review":"Not nearly as good as \\"Gettysburg\\". Much of the movie was booooring ...... The battle scenes not nearly as good as say \\"Band of Brothers\\" or even \\"Gettysburg\\".Depicts the southern actors as having a moral blind spot to the whole issue of slavery - hardly ever mentioned in the movie.Rent before you buy. Seeing it once will probably be enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"COOL FILM!","review":"This is one of the absolute best war movies ever made. It's almost as good as Gettysburg.

This movie was a four hour, boring, and without a plot. Important characters were left out, The srceenplay was nothing like the book, They even left out the bloodest battle of the war. It contained long speeches that went no where. To sum it up, After Years of waiting to see this I couldn't wait for it to be over. It was a disappointment of a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Epic","review":"A great historical drama one must see several times to fully appreciate. Much has been said by several past reviewers of why they feel Gods and Generals is so good: the acting, the battle scenes, the historical accuracy, the music, etc. I can't agree more. I found this film to be a very enjoyable experience and saw it five times in the theatres, appreciating it and gaining more each time I saw it. This is a movie that you'll definitely want to add to your home DVD-video collection, and I'm sure is destined to be a modern film classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A STORY OF IDEALS AND LOYALITY","review":"The movie \\"God and Generals\\" was a wonderful movie and I would recomend it completly. BUT it is for a certain type of viewer. You really have to appricate the Civil War to like this movie. It is long, true but it is good if you can sit down and watch it. I appricate the book \\"The Killer Angels\\" and I think that \\"Gettysburg\\" was also a great movie. All the books written by the Sharras are very well done and the movies capture the important themes of theses great American novels. I think that people need to look past the length of the movie and see the real themes that lie within. Truly a great movie and great to watch if you enjoy history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book","review":"I have been reading about the Civil War for over 40 years and have been a reenactor / living historian for over 10 years. I really looked forward to seeing this movie. Having seen it, I now encourage others not to. It is very boring and many of the \\"stars\\" overacted, especially the overdone scenes with General Thomas Jackson. These were so bad that in all the years I have been going to the movies I have never been so happy to see someone die on screen. It was also interesting to see not what was shown on screen but what was left out. Almost makes me think the screen writers had a message they wanted to get across."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Pathetic dialogue. Pathetic costumes. Fake beards. Fake accents.

Gettysburg was kind of boring because it dragged on and on and on. Besides, Lee was terrible. In this one, you can see the war through the eyes of regular people like you and me. It didn't just focus on the soldiers and the war, it gave you a look into the lives of the people of the south. I think this opinion the South was somehow wicked and the North was good is wrong. People need to read true sources of history and find out the truth.I also liked the fact that it was a very Christian video.Annie"},{"rating":"1","title":"It would have been a great radio show","review":"This Robert Duvall vehicle to eternal boredom is guaranteed to drive you straight there! What could have been a sensational visual epic turns out to be little more than Ted Turner indulging his liberal views through long and protracted dialogue that will put the viewer to sleep. There is little action, and what there is remains muted and surreal.

Some reviewers who didn't like this movie also didn't like \\"Gettysburg\\" I have to disagree there. I did like \\"Gettysburg\\" which just makes my disapointment in this movie so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad movie, great songs","review":"Sorry ... We expected so much more.

How about \\"Sermons & Speeches!\\"","review":"This film is too preachy and boring to be of any interest to anyone (except perhaps the re-enactors who participated in it). English films are short on action, but they capture the time period with a feeling of authenticity that \\"Gods & Generals\\" sorely lacks. The dialoge in this film is so painfully stiff and unnatural that it becomes a burden to sit through it. I was also bothered by the depiction of slaves as happy, faithful servants who love their masters more than freedom...Not since \\"Gone With The Wind\\" have I seen something so awkwardly insensitive.

And the mistakes in the film were just unbearable.For instance at one point of this four-hour piece of [trash] i saw someone wearing a purple baseball cap. With all that in the regular movie I was just waiting to see the blooper reel.And anyone who says that Jeff Daniels was good, wasn't awake for the whole thing.

The surrender of Harper's Ferry to Jackson right before Sharpsburg, the last minute arrivial of A.P. Hill could have been done with excellent effect instead of the overly long Fredericksburg episode, which as a battle was inconclusive to both sides. Very unfortunate - a lost opportunity to tell a great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing...","review":"It's hard for me to describe how disappointed I was with this film. I mean, fine, General Jackson was a very religious man. He put his trust in God and Heaven and feared not death. But this doesn't make good film! The scenes with the General praying drags out and gets so boring that it makes you wonder if it really is a war movie or a churchschool-movie... I was bored beyond belief. The reason for that I gave two stars in stead of one is because of the battle scenes. They really show (except the Manassas scenes) how the Confederate Army under leadership of General Lee gave the Yankee invaders a serious whooping! Other than that the movie is a sad, sad attempt on making a good Civil War movie... I really wish that I could say that I liked this movie, but sadly I really didn't..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Civil War Film Ever","review":"Wow, I'm not sure 1,000 words are enough to describe the horrible injustice this movie does to Shaara's brilliant book of the same name. Perhaps they would have done better to leave Shaara out of it and named the movie \\"The Tragic Tale of Stonewall Jackson\\" Stephen Lang gives an excruciatingly painful performance as the brilliant Southern General, having seen some of Lang's other work I'm tempted to blame the writer's or directors for this laugher.Believe me, I am no stranger to the Civil War. I am a Cival War maniac, I take Civil War vacations, and all this movie inspired in me was a strong desire to turn it off...Historical fans spend your money on the book or get the DVD Gettysburg based on the novel \\"The Killer Angels\\" Its a billion times better than this piece of trash and deserving of your hard earned money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful movie","review":"Beards that resemble badgers on chins and way too much religion in this overbrown civil war epic. History buffs may like to watch but those who appreciate acting & writing should stay away. Ah, them happy slaves..oh, they overlooked that story! Too many re-enactors who cannot act or react & constantly look at the camera as they fall dead. Duvall great as Lee but hardly in the film. If I saw Stonewall Jackson character look up & pray to heaven one more time, I'da soiled my pants.Director has 4 more hours on cutting room floor. Please, please do not release them on DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is up with all of the religious pontification?","review":"I live in the Capital of the Confederacy so naturally I awaited with great anticipation the release of Gods and Generals. What a waste of over 3 1/2 hours. The battle scenes were good, but the story lines never get developed nor do the characters. Rather I am left with the feeling that I watched Thomas Jackson lead sermon and quote scripture for two hours of the movie. Not what I expected at all. Jackson may have been an EXTREMELY pious man and have been compelled to feel as though he were serving God's will by casting out the invading horde (the Federals), but the movie gets lost in the constant dialogue to this end. Truly lost unfortunately. Do yourselves a favor and pick up the book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Worst","review":"If you like movies, if you're interested in the Civil War, if you want to spend 4 happy hours... avoid this film like the plague. Even Robert Duvall turns in a sub-standard performance. The costumes, dialogue, fakey battles, and slavery-glorifying plot are pathetic. This is a wicked bad waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"God, is this a Bad Movie","review":"Awful, awful, awful. Awful script bleats on for four hours, big ol' fake beards (Jeb Stuart's beard is so bad that you'll want to rewind to take another look). Lots and lots of praying, so we know Stonewall was a good god-fearin' fella. Lots of really bad \\"southern\\" accents. This is just a BAD movie. Bad like a puppy that needs a whack with a newspaper. I'm wracking my brain to think of something positive to say about it... well, at least I didn't die while it was on."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no Gettysburg.","review":"After enjoying Gettysburg I was really looking forward to Gods and Generals. Unfortunately I was very disappointed in watching the DVD. This was actually the Stonewall Jackson and the freedom loving Confederates story. I got a little tired of this revisionist saga especially the Black cook as one of the good ole boys in the Rebel camp. While Gettysburg focused mainly on the Confederate side it did offer a balance of compelling Union soldiers also. Gods and Generals throws in a few scenes with Jeff Daniels and that's about it. Characterizations on both sides made Gettysburg the classic that it was. I cared about everyone in it. G & G is strictly Jackson. If you love the South and Stonewall Jackson this is for you. If not, stay away. Only the carnage and slaughter of the Union forces at Fredericksburg was noteworthy for it's depiction of war and why we should try to avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll fall asleep in your popcorn.","review":"This movie gives dry, ponderous movies a bad name. The acting was quite good, but the writers only gave the actors long, boring speeches to enact. And if I'd had to watch Stonewall Jackson pray one more time, I might not have made it through. Okay, he was devout, I get it. Let's not belabor the point.If you've seen Gettysburg (a far superior film) and haven't seen this one, just picture Gettysburg with the historical battle scenes cut to about a tenth of the film and the other 9/10ths consisting of those slow scenes from Gettysburg when the generals were going on and on about so many of their friends being on the other side. That's Gods and Generals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad. Just bad. No all bad. But pretty bad.","review":"I loved Gettysburg. For me that remains the best Civil War movie yet made. I very much looked forward to Gods and Generals coming out in the threatre, and I dragged several friends along to see it.I was embarassed. First let me say, the parts with Jeff Daniels were well done - he's an excellent actor.However, every scene with General and Mrs. Jackson made me ill. They were poorly scripted and poorly acted. It was like an overly melodramatic Bugs Bunny cartoon, but not funny. The whole script seemed to focus more on melodrama than on making the characters seem real and genuine, as they were in GettysburgI'm wondering if the problem has to do with the book's author. I have read historic books by Jeff Shaara, and he is not a great writer - his historical facts tend to be wrong, among other things."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC WAR FILM EPIC","review":"This film was wonderful. It preserved the integrity of \\"Gettysburg\\". It is a four hour work of art. I have read that if the film makes at least 50 million dollars at the box office, they will go ahead with the third and final film in the series, \\"Last full Measure\\". I am not sure it will make that much, I have not heard as much praise for this film as I expected. It is a classic. If you enjoy war films, go and see this at the theatre. You will get your money's worth. I hope it will make enough money to clear the way for the third film. I'm sure it will also be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Historical Drama!","review":"Let me start off by saying that I am a non-reigious person and I love this movie. If you are into historical movies, movies that are intelligent, and portray persons acting heroically, then this movie is the one to watch over and over again.The acting is great, Stephen Lang's portrayal of Stonewall Jackson is magnificient, and this movie portrays the many viewpoints and causes of the civil war. It does not demonize the different sides like other movies that only portray one side. Plus it is filled with emotional scenes that bring tears to your eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever Historical Drama","review":"Not pro-war, not pro-North, not pro-South, this one is pro historical accuracy as it follows people from all walks of life as they laugh and cry, live and die, just trying to make it in a world falling apart around them.. If you don't feel tears welling up sometime in this movie, check your pulse. Yes, these were real people and yes, they really acted and dressed and talked like that. But guess what? They were human, too and their humanity is what makes this movie so marvelous!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Effort","review":"I thought the movie was a very worthy effort and well done, except for the few inaccuracies that every historical movie tends to have. Over all good. It's a shame that a few reviewers most notably the gentleman from Freemont CA. does not have a true understanding of history. It is true the war was at first not over slavery. However the South never had the right to succeed and if they had not been so adoment about slavery and their right to continue it, the Civil War would most likely not have happened. The economic problems and most others could have been solved eventually without a shot being fired. Slavery was wrong and they simply refused to except that their way of live had to change. It's amazing how we expected the Indians to except the change we forced on them, yet it was considered so horrible that the South's dying life style had to change. I am a major student of Civil War history and thought I would lend my opinion to those of others."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a Yankee, But I loved this movie!","review":"I rented this movie because I wanted to see Gettysburg, but I wanted to see the first movie first, plus my uncle worked on the set. I thought the movie was excellent, but Jackson's religous preaching did get on my nerves a little. The battle scenes were very well done and made child-safe, but during the battle of Bull Run, I noticed one scene of Confederate soldiers advancing was used 3 times. I even found it sort of funny when Stonewall was shot in the hand and rode by his soldiers, it made him look like he was giving the fingers. I loved this movie and plan to buy it soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true story - not \\"based\\" on a true story","review":"It is a rare movie made today this is not \\"based\\" on a true story - instead, that \\"IS a true story\\". I find it refreshing to see characters and history portrayed as they actually were - not a blur of reality and fiction. Though there are some imperfections, the historical accuracy is beyond what I have seen in years. The historical accuracy allows presenting issues normally risky, including issues of their time and ours - such as politics, race, and god. This is done even handedly...opening eyes and letting one individually consider them. This movie is a gem and I am thankful for its production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much better - disappointing","review":"This is a B movie - very disappointing. Jackson is portrayed well, but the portrayal of Lee is awful. Some of the lines are part lie/part truth - especially dislike the change of what Jackson said on his deathbed. The truth would have been just as moving. People may enjoy the movie if they are not as knowledgeable. On the whole, a waste of good actors in a slow, somewhat artificial feeling movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly bad","review":"This film really is jaw-droppingly bad, with no redeeming feature whatever. The script is clunkingly abysmal, with feeble dialogue and characters periodically obliged to deliver paragraphs of pre-school-standard historical explanation. There is an incomprehensible Irish theme to it, which originates, I suppose, in the novel (not that I am remotely tempted to read it, after seeing the film), that gave birth to this abomination. There is no point in commenting on the acting, since even an actor as great as Robert Duvall has no chance to excel in this morass. \\"Gettysburg\\" was cinematic roadkill. What on earth persuaded anyone that the world needed any more of the same?"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Long - So Dull. All Most like the War...","review":"Compared to Gettysburg, this movie is a flop. It's long, dull, drawn out, and it is astonishing to me that anyone in the South ever had children if all they ever did (according to this movie's depictations) ever did is snuggle in bed with full nighshirts/gowns on and talk. While I wasn't expecting all out sex, for krimminie's sake, let's see some passion -- even in the acting!This movie could have been half the length and probably have suffered little in the cut. God help us if the third installment is this bad. Forget this dud and watch Gettysburg, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agendas Make For Bad History and Bad Movies","review":"The attempt to paint the slaves as being sympathetic to their masters is really just disgusting. Also, making the North, the real country, out to be just a bunch of money grubbing fools is really so far off the mark that it makes this movie into a comedy. Yes, Ted Turner grew up in the south and thinks the people who committed treason against their country such as Robert E. Lee are heroes. No, pretending that the South had it right on this one is not even close to the truth. This movie doesn't even come close to being anything historically, and worse than that it is a cinematic joke, over written, sentimental and over produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware \\"# out of #\\" thought this review helpful\\"...","review":"People who haven't seen the film and are debating whether to buy the DVD from the reviews should beware using the \\"_ out of ___ thought this review was helpful\\" rating as a benchmark.

Anyone who promotes this crap must be a rebel. Creighton Lovelace should be arrested for treason in his idea of a returning Confederate States of America. Guess what, I am a Yankee and an American.

The role of Stonewall Jackson has been much diminished and the role of Joshua Chamberlain, much enhanced compared to the original.

I decided to to watch this movie because I remember the one before they made this one wasn't bad. From what I've heard, this was originally a 6 hr film cut down to a 3 or 4 hr film. Maybe they should have cuttin it even more with with scenes added with fillers and this movie seeming to be more about God than the Generals. On top of that, it was based mainly on one general and seemed to take a more biased favor for the South centering on General Stonewall Jackson. The acting wasn't that great either. The only reason why I gave this movie 2 stars was for the fact that it was about American history, though this movie is a disgrace to American history.

There is no bad side or good side, because...God is on both sides, therefore canceling the point.I don't exactly know how to explain it fully within one review, but all I can say is that if you want to see a movie that's about two sides battling it out, with the movie makers trying to film it from both perspectives in a way that makes it confusing, pointless and boring, and a movie that's four hours long (including the intermission) then go ahead, watch this.

The only good thing in this movie were the war scenes. 1 star for Gods, Generals, and Cheese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long but enjoyable","review":"Though the film was very long I enjoyed it. The movie tends to dwell mainly on the role played by General \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson during the early stages of the war. I think this movie will be enjoyed maily by history buffs, but I think there is room for the causal student of the civil war. The movie is not overly Hollywood in its delivery. The human element does factor in, but is not overdone. I still find \\"Glory\\" to be the best civil war movie I have seen yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite As It Was","review":"While the movie is very stunning to watch, it avoids many parts of the Civil War. It is very sanitized. Where is the death from disease, accidents and starvation? I also couldn't believe how clean and beautiful the soldiers were in their uniforms. All the weapons worked perfectly. This is NOT the way it really was. Just check the pension files of some real Civil War Veterans and you'll find out how things really were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most accurate Civil War Movie Ever","review":"I have to admit, I've never seen the Confederacy as accurately portrayed as I did in this film. It's accurate, clean, romantic, and has action. It's got Southern and Christian Heritage in it. It's a must!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Insult to a Very Good Manuscript","review":"Unfortunately I read the book, so well written by Jeff Shaara, before seeing the movie, so I had high expectations that the movie would be equally as well done. The product that came out in the theaters was an insult to Jeff's book. One wonders if those responsible for making this movie read the same manuscript. Any resemblance between the movie and the book are strictly coincidental and probably non-exixtent."},{"rating":"1","title":"what i learned from the movie \\"Gods and Generals\\"","review":"i learned that Abraham Lincoln was an evil dark lord of the north. and that the union soldiers were as bad as the stormtroopers. i learned that General Jackson was the luke skywalker of that time considering he lost his arm at the end. and his mentor Obi...err i mean General Lee was there too but he didnt die at the end though. jackson did. that was a great little twist they added. and who can forget the lovely \\"Esposita\\"(princess lea) and general jackson's slave friend(im not even going to say who they tried to parallel him with). oh and the most important thing i learned was that the confederates were the good guys! who knew!? at the end of the movie, it says that this movie is part of a trilogy with Gettysburg being the 2nd part, so i'm going to rent Gettysburg today and i expect it to be somewhat similiar to the Empire Strikes Back. ;p"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Gods and Generals\\"","review":"I liked this movie alot. If you like war movies see it. But its very lengthy, 4 and a 1/2 hours! It has an intermission! Overall the movie was fantastic! I would recomend the DVD it might be more convienient! The battles were cool and the acting was not bad either. I loved how they went in depth with the humanity aspect it really pulled the movie together. I own \\"Gettysburg\\" and DVD and I will own \\"Gods and Generals\\" on DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern Finally","review":"This is a great movie, sweeping and poetic. It is sad and touching, as well as rousing in portrayals of good men gone to war to fight and die for their country. It is finally a good movie that is done to the \\"right side\\" without making the Confederates look like racist idiots. I could have done without the Yankee side in this movie, but overall it is fantastic. The movie follows Stonewall Jackson and his devout belief in Christ and his fierce moves on the battlefield. The beautiful relationship with his wife is also handled well, showing how complex this man was and where his heart and soul lay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once you get past the opening credits, it's downhill","review":"This movie is a tremendous injustice to the fascinating men it attempts to portray. Part of the problem is it does too much, if it concentrated on the lead up to First Manassas and that Battle and explored the characters in depth it may have been good, but it covers too much ground to make character development meaningful and then wastes a lot of time in parlours with piano playing and philosophical ramblings. Despite the focus on Jackson, you come away with little insight as to what made this man arguably one of the greatest generals of history. I was excited with Robert Duvall as Lee, but you can measure his screen time with an egg timer, a waste of a good actor who could have explored the complexities of the man.It was a sad waste of a topic worthy for exploration in a film, and I am afraid this turkey may scare off future better attempts to explore this topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"why did it start so late","review":"the battle of sharpsburg was passed over and as a former resident of the peninsula i was disapointed by the absence of the penisula campaign but overall it was a good movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Excuse for Anything","review":"I will begin by saying that I'm proud to call \\"Gettysburg\\" my favorite movie. I'm also proud to say that this film has to be my least favorite. This film simply makes me want to vomit. It's the most pathetic excuse for a movie I've ever seen, not to mention a Civil War film. The only thing this movie had going for it war Robert Duvall's portrayal of Lee. It would have added merrit to \\"Gettysburg\\". Unfortunately, he was cast for this flop. I'm a Civil War historian, reenactor, collector, and fellow reenactors of mine, who were actually in the movie, also agree that this has to be the worst film ever made.

This brutally violent and brutally boring film was one I was forced to watch as an assignment. Well, if I ever had to watch this film again, I will be the most unhappiest man on the planet.This film is bad from start to finish. Robert Duvall and Jeff Daniels are stiff in their roles, and whoever plays Stonewall Jackson (forget his name) was forgettable. The film is drawn out beyond belief. And the film was also very violent. Normally, I can stand violence, but here I didn't like it. (Then again, I loved \\"The Patriot\\", and that had 2x the violence).This is definitely a dreadful movie. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"The movie Gettysburg was a faithful onscreen rendition of Michael Shaara's The Killer Angels. Grant it - transferring Gods and Generals to the big screen was more of a challenge. Gettysburg took place in three days, Gods spans years. Having said that, there is no other way to describe this movie other than disappointing. Here's three reasons. First - NO ANTIETAM. How can you depict the first half of the Civil Ware and SKIP SHARPSBURG! Stunning omission! Second - the acting was contrived and overly dramatic. Although Gettysburg did show signs of this, Gods went overboard. Like a very bad made for TV movie. Third - absolute unacceptable use of computer graphics. I want to like this movie. However, it is awkward to watch and at times downright painful. Ron Maxwell should say, \\"It's all my fault!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow and stodgy","review":"First of all, I am not a Northerner. I am pure Virginianthrough and through. But I didn't feel this movie was anygood. Even though it was told from a more Southern point ofview, it did not really lead to any major character developmentand the performances were way over the top. Not reallyvery convincing. And those terrible Virginia accents! Did theyhave a dialect coach on site? Because they really butcheredit. I'm not sure how people spoke in those days, but theydid not all sound like Reverend Bob. Note to Actors: Guideyour speech to fit your character. I was much more impressed with the accents in Gone With The Wind. Of course, apples and oranges when applied here. I think the script has too syrupy and sentimental. And.... Will the Southern accentof any type ever be done right on screen or stage??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring....preachy...too long!!!!","review":"This movie could actually have been good had it maybe been an hour shorter...battle scenes were OK but nothing great....too much talking and preaching and reciting poetry. Watching this movie you can't help but think that so many of these characters talk like some kind of higher beings and not regular people. My brother summed this movie up pretty well about 15 minutes after we'd seen it, he said \\"That was a bad movie\\"! This was the worst film I saw in 2003.......I definately can't recommend this to anyone...maybe civil war buffs but that's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragging Documentary","review":". . . everything takes too long.

It's hard to say. I don't typically comment on other reviews but the Christian Girl who wrote that this movie is about the christian south and un-christian North.

I'm sorry this movie put me to sleep.","review":"This was the worst of it's kind. I love war movies but ... The battle scenes were intense but not authentic. Not enough blood and guts.

This is a must see movie for history buffs or anyone who actually cares about United States history!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great historical film","review":"My family and I enjoyed this film very much. It was a war movie suitable for the children, and it allowed them to see a bit of our history in action. The only reason I rated \\"Gods and Generals\\" four stars instead of five was due to the length. The movie was so long and drawn out that at times we had to rewatch parts to refresh our memory on certain events. Other than that, it was a really good movie for those who appreciate American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Propaganda","review":"This was a great film, and was as historically accurate as it could be. If you're interested in the Civil War, check it out. Don't listen to all of those who carp about its supposed pro-southern stance. Those people seem to forget that the Civil War was fought between two sides, not the \\"good guys\\" and a bunch of cardboard cut-outs. For pete's sake, any person who knows just a little bit about the run of the war can tell you that the reason this film seems to focus more on Southerners is because in the period of time this film covers the South was winning the war. To blams something like that on Ted Turner is ignorant and borderline racist. Move to Gettysburg (even the movie wasn't even-handed at all, no Civil War film until this one has ever tried to see past the ignorant \\"boogieman\\" image of the South) and things change. This film is useful because it helps dispel some of the stupid innacuracies that Americans are taught about the South and the War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This was a great movie and can't wait till the DVD comes out. It is about time that history is told more correctly. Religion was a big part in people lives in the 1860's, and this is demonstrated in the movie. The actors did a good job of portraying the way people talked and mannerism. Also beards were in style and this is portrayed as well. It is a long movie but interesting. The movie tells a side of history that people want to deny and and also it cuts out modern thinking, language and ideals unlike so many movies of today. After all it was the 1860's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie","review":"Overall a great movie, I like how it shows the view points from both ends and pretty much how the war started. Definitely recommend to people who like and enjoy watching and learning things about the civil war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Improvement","review":"This new \\"director's cut\\" is a big improvement over the theatrical release. Historical inaccuracies (Lee riding a horse at Antietam, Lee looking down at Sharpsburg from the wrong side of the river, slaves viewed more as members of the family than, well, slaves) remain, but the less the film focuses on Jackson, the better. Visually, it looks great. Unfortunately, there's no way to free the film from the characters speechifying at each other rather than talking. This goes well beyond the normal \\"dialogue as conveying facts to the audience\\" that inflicts many historical films. The worst example is still Jeff Daniels reciting some lengthy Roman text out loud while waiting to go into action at Fredricksburg. Even family members interact with discourses that would make a thespian blush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money--","review":"The acting was weak, and the director took a subject that was filled with drama and distilled it into being trite. Moreover, the video was historically inaccurate, with a distinct bias toward the Confederate States, not unexpected since Ted Turner bankrolled the film and has a bit part as a Confederate officer. I wish I could say it was on the whole entertaining, but alas it is not. Read the Shaara book--it is well written and dramatic enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"God-Awful, and Generally Boring!","review":"Never thought I'd be bored with a Shaara-inspired Civil War epic, but this DVD was a huge disappointment. Bad beards all around, a turgid storyline, and the film didn't hold a candle to the book. Some of the special features included with the DVD were okay, especially interesting to my non-Civil War literate spouse. I own \\"Gettysburg\\", and use it as a teaching tool, but there was nothing even remotely as inspiring in G & G. (Not even Ted Turner's vanity role!) Save your money, and buy the books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plods and generally tedious.","review":"Yea, I didst valiantly and with much anticipation embark upon the viewing of this mighty Civil War motion picture epic, but as I doth sat and pondered my fate the sand in the hour glass moved ever more slowly until I found myself gripped with the growing trepidation that perhaps I might be subjected to an endless concatenation of bombastic utterances such as this one.So, I pulled the DVD after watching a bit more than an hour and decided to watch something else. Usually I wouldn't give even two stars to a movie that I survived less than half of, but I suppose that if someone had a great interest in Civil War history they might be more patient than I was and would get a lot more out of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much praying","review":"This is a truly authentic film. The depiction of battle scenes was realistic. The problem: General (Stonewall) Jackson praying that the Lord would give him the victory reminds me of the Old Testament where God is supposed to sanction butchering, rapes and slaughter. This is too much doggie-doo! But he does add \\"thy will be done ...\\"In the end, after all his praying, he dies anyway of pneumonia and other wounds. What a relief!!Some day Hollywood will wake up and leave God out of these war films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money...","review":"..with this propagandistic piece of southern revisionist bull excrement! Do your self a favor and get Ken Burns' documentary or better yet read a book. The idolatry of Stonewall Jackson in this \\"film\\" is truly nauseating - in reality he was the 19th century version of a jihadi. This film buys so deeply into the imbecilic mythology of \\"the southern cause\\" that it borders on full fiction. Those southern generals (traitors by the way) were only good because of the shear incompetence of their northern counterparts - Mrs. Lee could have beaten Burnside and McClellan. Reality check for those of you who chug the Kool-Aid - the south started the war, the north ended it and the Confederacy got what it deserved - ruin and Reconstruction! Huzzah to Sherman and his March to the Sea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"God! This movie is Generally boring!","review":"The South will rise again! And when it does, I hope it wakes me up when this movie is over. Running 3 hours and 49 minutes in length, this film is major test on both the bladder and the patience. Having neither the depth of Gettysburg or the dramatic impact and visual style of Glory it can hold the interest of perhaps only the most avid Civil War buffs. Even to them I say save your butt and pocketbook some strain and wait a few months for the DVD or the inevitable TNT \\"special event miniseries\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and revisionist","review":"Did the people who made this bother to research their history? The history in this reminds of a friend of mine who was teaching history in South Carolina and the book said the South WON the Civil War. In another review, someone was wondering what America would have been like if the South had indeed won. Duh - slavery, discrimination, hatred of others, no progress. The south was a backwards culture. They even still had jousts for entertainment in some places because they longed for the \\"good old day\\". No, if the South had won, America would have been a nightmare of a place.

Anyone who feels it's a Christian's God given right to own another human being deserves an ignominious thrashing. Get over it, Pastor Lovelace, your side lost. It's over.

Painfully slow, and drawn out with incredibly dull directing through all the non-action scenes, which are about 90% of the film. I was skipping through a lot of it to get to the battles after a while. Since some of the actors are very talented, I have to assume it was the the script and directing that made this so painful to watch. Although some of the acting by actors/actresses I wasn't familiar with seemed to be at a high-school drama class level. The only decent portrayal was Robert Duvall as General Lee. Other than that, yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bore!","review":"I have always been a great follower of anything to do with the Civil War. I very much enjoyed Gettysburg the first film in this trilogy, but I can't remember the last time I saw a film that I found this disapointing!The biggest problem in this film is with the editing. Some scenes deserve to be left on the cutting room floor, unfortunatly three quarters of this film falls into this catagory! I also have a real problem with the depliction of the slaves in Gods and Generals, this film makes it look like slavery wasn't a problem for anyone and that it really didn't even excist.I will say that the battle scenes were very well done, unfortunatly that isn't enough to save this cluncker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my, did that ever suck!","review":"Aside from the special effects that looked like something out of a ten dollar video game, the fact the actors aged considerably (and had far much less enthusiasm) from the Gettysburg epic the movie just stank up the entire theater and the one next-door. Steven Lang was Pickett, and watching him as Jackson was a tough transition. Then there was the glossing over of the slavery issue. The movie seemed to imply \\"it wasn't bad, we were all friends, had the slaves on up to dinner and sat around and sang like birds\\". Casting the aristocracy of the South in a beneficent role in slavery does a disservice to us all. I never cared for Turner but this travesty is an all time new low even for \\"Mr. Colorization\\".

I have been looking forward to seeing this film for a couple of years. I am a big Shaara fan and his books are outstanding. I was disappointed right from the opening scene when I immediately recognized that about a third of the book had been left out of the movie. I don't feel that the movie lead us into Gettysburg very well. There was not enough about Hancock, Champerlain, and Lee in the movie. Leaving out the pre-war material and skiping so much that was in the book weakened the movie and kept it from having a good flow.The movie should have been called the Stonewall Jackson story. That would have made me enter the theater not knowing what to expect. I did enjoy the movie, but like I said, I was expecting a movie based on Jeff Shaara's book and in that sense I was disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie I've EVER Seen","review":"I genuinely wanted to like this film, but it dragged from the very beginning. I was relieved when I was under the impression that it was ending, and I let out \\"oh thank god\\" as it faded to black. As the word \\"Intermission\\" came on screen I swore quite loudly, that had only been near two hours, yet it felt far longer than the three hours and forty minutes this movie was supposed to be. The movie is too drawn out, has for all practical purposes one battle scene, and focuses on people from the North for no reason when they seem to be making a point about the South during the period. If they want to talk about the South, then focus solely on the South, if they want to focus on the North, then do that. But both is a ticket to boredom and an incoherent plotline. And that's just what Gods and Generals gives you. Don't buy this film unless you like pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could have been better","review":"A fabulous portrayal of the war and the human side of the men who fought it. If the film has a fault, it's the effort to portray the humanity, which sometimes becomes a bit boring and bogs down in places. The performances are excellent, and the dialogue, although decried by some critics (who obviously don't realize these are DIRECT QUOTES), is authentic and gives us insight into the motivations of the men who fought - and the truth that for the majority of the soldiers, the cause wasn't slavery. Could have been better; impossible not to give an accurate portrayal of the war by leaving out the carnage of Sharpsburg/Antietam. Still, should be required viewing for any serious student of the War and the period."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Antietam??","review":"Although the photography in this movie is breathtaking, I can't recommend it. It seems to me as if Ted Turner is trying to rewrite the history of the Civil War, only this time the South wins. Purportedly, this is the prequel to \\"Gettysburg,\\" but a major battle is missing -- Antietam. The only major battle in the East which the North won before Gettysburg, yet it is completely omitted from the movie. How can this movie be historically accurate when a major battle is omitted?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Battle scenes are weak, but not the main purpose of movie...","review":"The movie is very powerful when you get caught up in the characters and ignore the some of the slow parts. Some battle scenes go on and on, you feel like you are watching the same clips over and over again. I didn't notice much in the way of special effects. So there are a lot of people just dropping dead or using the wrong end of their rifles when charging into a fight. If you are looking to learn about the personal and professional sides to \\"stonewall\\" Jackson, this is the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book easily defeats the movie","review":"If you read Gods and Generals, you know the focus of this book revolves around the charachter development of Lee, Jackson, Hancock, and Chamberlain. In addition, a significant portion of the book addresses how the charachters came to their decision to support the Union or the Confederacy.In the movie, the charachters are bland and the background of their decisions (Particularly Lee's) was handled without creativity. Too much time was spent on the accuracy of the Period.Finally, the acting was poor and often laughable. Just read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a history major","review":"I began hearing rumors of making Gods and Generals a movie since the book was released in the late 1990's. So, obviously, since Gettysburg is my favorite movie of all time, I was really hyped to see this. The acting was great, especially with Stephen Lang jumping from Pickett in Gettysburg to a more serious General Jackson in Gods. I also enjoyed Jeff Daniels reprising his role as Joshua Chamberlain. Also, Robert Duvall far exeeded Martin Sheen in his portrayal of Robert E. Lee. Also, the story was very good, but I do have some criticisms. I felt that it focused too much on Jackson. If Ron Maxwell would have stuck closer to the book and included more on Lee and Hancock and others, the movie would have by far been better than Gettysburg. As a history major about to enter my second year in college, I was especially thrilled with the historical accuracy of the movie. Unlike with Gettysburg, I was unable to pick out any flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretty bad movie","review":"What can be said about this movie that hasn't been said before? The pro-Confederate bias is pretty standard revisionism, with plenty of talk of states' independence but almost none of slavery. The screenplay is uninspired, the acting dull, the editing haphazard, the directing doesn't really add anything of value. It includes Bruce Boxleitner. Robert Duvall and Jeff Daniels have their moments, but these are few and far between. Stonewall Jackson is flattened into a couple of shticks, which is really too bad because the book by Jeff Shaara was the only thing I've seen or read that gives him dimension and humanity.Don't bother with this movie. Instead, see 'Gettysburg' again and hope they do a much better job on 'The Last Full Measure' - if they ever make a movie of it, unlikely considering how 'Gods and Generals' flopped. I give it 2 stars because it is dull, but I reserve the 1 star rating for films that are really terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gods & Generally Boring","review":"Some 10 years after a good effort with Gettysburg, director R. Maxwell tries to comply with Turner's wishes to make an 'anti-war' war movie. Instead he made an 'anti-viewer' movie. Lang's talent is wasted trying to cope with the stilted dialog of a 19th Century version of a Shakespearian drama. While generally true that both the North & the South thought they had God on their side, I suspect that there was quite a lot more on their minds during the day than discussing Old Testament passages and looking up into the night sky to discern the mind of God. And what was the special effects cloud routine near the end of the battle of Fredericksburg all about? Even a good cast couldn't defeat the writers and director in this tedious film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch it with Gettysburg","review":"I'm not a Civil War expert, but having recently visited Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg, I paid very close attention to the history told me by the guides as well as the books I read. When I came home I watched both Gettysburg and Gods and Generals again, and I must say, the events of these important battles come to life in these DVDs. Yes, there's always going to be some interpretation done, but overall I thought the acting was well done and the information reliable. The characters were well developed, as I felt that I got a chance to really know what these men were like. If you want to see history, then I would recommend this and Gettysburg as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted longer than actual Civil War","review":"This movie is extremely boring!

There are simply too many reasons why this film failed so miserably.If you're a civil war re-enactor, it's inevitable that you're going to enjoy this film.For the rest of us, however, sitting through this bloated monstrosity is painful.Do yourself a favour - pass on this movie...!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Banal, Pontificating, Civil War Claptrap","review":"I walked out of a \\"sneak preview\\" of this movie and still felt cheated even though admission was free.

Too many speaches and not enough acting! Much worse than the first installment Gettysburg a film I enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Civil War Re-enactors ONLY","review":"Yes, this film has enormous attention to detail-period costumes, period weapons, period everything. However, no amount of authenticity can save it from being terribly dull, plodding and overwrought. Every line of dialogue is written and delivered as though the speaker were giving the West Point Commencement address. The film contains multiple plot lines and characters, but none of them have any clearly defined or dramatic conflict-the plot seems derived entirely from biographies and historical accounts-it's as though no attempt at crafting an actual story was made. The only thing that kept me awake was the occasional spurt of gunfire from one of the battle scenes. Save your time and money-STAY AWAY unless you dress in Confederate or Union fatigues and shoot blanks at other people every weekend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This movie is very good. Not quite as good as Gettysburg. The whole prequel thing is usually not very good. Stephen Lang plays Jackson in this movie and he does a very good job. The only thing about it is he played Pickett in Gettysburg. I just couldn't get this out of my mind. Pickett and Jackson are complete opposite if you know anything about their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I was a little hesitant on buying this dvd because the reviews werent all that great and I didn't go to see it at the theatres. But i went ahead and bought it. Wow I'm sure glad I did buy it. This movie is awesome. The combat scenes although they aren't many they are still very very realistic. I would recomend this movie to anyone and dont forget its about 3 and a half hours long. Have fun watching"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gods and Generals","review":"The movie of Jeff Shaara's Civil War novel of the same title.Gaaahh, this was awful! Awful!Bloodless battle scenes. Bemused, wooden Stonewall. \\"Jeb Stuart\\" portrayed by an actor who was such a bad rider he was dragging on his horse's mouth in a way the real Stuart would have had horsewhipped, and what was that on his face, a dead Shih Tzu? Worst Fake Beards Ever.Other than the topic being of interest to me, I can't dredge up anything good to say about this movie. I recommend WICKED SPRING, COLD MOUNTAIN and GLORY instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn and Enjoy","review":"Historically accurate. Excellent portrayal of Stonewall Jackson by Stephen Lang.

I recomend it to everybody it is ong but worth it there is not enough union scenes i think go buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing from the book","review":"If you read the book, don't buy this movie for you will be very disappointed. While the movie does have it's own value entertainment, it does not follow the book very well at all. The movie does not develop the characters at all, especially the relationships between the various Generals for both sides. The book particularly hit on the close relationship between Hancock and Armistead that was never even mentioned in this movie. I actually ran into Jeff Shaara in Gettysburg a few years ago and expressed my disappoint in the movie and he expressed his disappoint in how the movie was portrayed also. It would be nice if they finished the series and did a screenplay of \\"The last full measure\\" but it would need to be a mini-series or at least 3 hours long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"Actually, I gave Gods and Generals 2.5 stars. This film had me anxiously in wait to see but when i watched it I couldn't finish it. Few battle scenes showing no blood to get your heart pumping ruin this film along with too much attention on the Confederate army. The music was good but over dramatic compared to the horrendous acting. The details were great and the directing was so-so. See this film if you have 4 spare hours and if you aren't in the mood for a gory bloody war film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poetry and Prayer","review":"I loved Gettysburg...fantastic film. I own several movies about the Civil War, and have read several books. In other words, I had expected to love this film. Instead, what I find is the story line doesn't seem to flow well, and they keep interupting it with poetry and praying. How many prayers do I need to listen to about keeping them safe and that they return? I've only managed to watch half the film because I got so bored. I then put in Gettysburg (which is just as long...I do have a long attention span) and enjoyed every minute. This is from the same director...I wish he'd done the movie the same way. I think I will give it another try. But I'm also going to use a timer and figure out how much time they wasted on poetry and prayers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make your own choice","review":"Watch for it on cable since it will be broadcast soon.

Ron Maxwell details more about the people within the civil war than focusing on the horrible brutality of the war. The New York and Los Angeles critics will be offended as they learn that slavery was not why the Civil War was started. Robert Duval and Jeff Daniels are great, but the real scene stealer is Stephen Lange. Should receive an Osca nomination! Excellent! The movie is almost four hours long, but it does move fast. The next one, Last Full Measure, should be another exceptional film. I highly recommend this film. It combined with Gettysburg should be used in all US History classes throughout the nation. Go see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Great!!","review":"\\"Gods and Generals\\" is great and very amazing! So much detail and story in a long 3 hours 49 minutes, but it was worth every minute. I am a \\"History Crack Addict\\" and I give this a movie a hell of a job well done. The movie showed you many view points of the South which made them seem less evil then we learned in history class. This movie showed you many great American soldiers even if they wore gray. The music for this movie was fantastic and the battle scenes were great by showing you different ways how the Civil War was fought. The actors were unbelievable. The American's cause and their way of life were very touching in this movie. \\"Gettysburg\\" was excellent and now \\"Gods and Generals\\" has joined it to share and take on an excellence of its own. Some new faces in the movie, they did splendid including Robert Duvall. And many returning who that once again have done a job well done. So when does this flick come out on DVD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gods and Generals","review":"A need to study for background would be helpful, for there is LOTS of historical information in this movie! I found myself riveted to the screen, totally fascinated! (and I am NOT a history buff!) Refreshingly without foul language, this movie accurately portrays the lives of General Robert E. Lee and Thomas Jackson, plus introducing other officers, from just before the Civil War began, up to Gettysburg."},{"rating":"2","title":"God and Generals review","review":"Again very accurate portraying 3 battles of the Civil War prior to Gettysburgh. The focus is more on the Confederate Generals.A necessary watch for any Civil War Buff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gods and Generals","review":"This movie is important for so many reasons as it tries to lay bare the troubles of the time and the reasons men fought. Without going deeply into the lives of the main characters it gives you just enough to become involved and care. One of the most touching moments of the movie is the fight between the Irish Battalion of the North and the Irish Battalion of the South. This battle scene literally makes you hold your breath and brings foreward the feeling of brother against brother without belaboring the point. As you watch one Irish soldier from the South break down, tears streaming down his face, as he holds his gun pointed at his Irish Breatheren you understand completely how this war truly divided a Nation. This an important film, beautifully done and worthy of much discussion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"You know it has to be good when you study these reviews. Themajority of the one-star ratings come from Northern reviewers. Need I say anything more?One guy actually criticized the dialogue where Jackson was pointed out to his troops for \\"standing like a stone wall.\\" Read any basic history book on the subject and you know that the lines were really spoken and it is how the man got his nickname. No doubt this reviewer is a product of the public school system.There are some worthwhile complaints about the movie. The criticisms about the overweight middle-aged combat troops is hard to deny. The complaints about the prominent role of religion in the character's lives is bogus. Christianity wasa key aspect in the lives of many of these men. You can't ignore the fact and there is nothing wrong with examining it in a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased with this 2nd installment of the trilogy","review":"The movie moved well. Not that slow as some have stated. It should have come before the Gettysburg film though. Great action and story. Nice extra's too. looking forward to the 3rd film in the trilogy to come out. You don't have to be a cival war followerto enjoy these movies. However; you may be one after viewing them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly one of the best movies ever","review":"This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. Not only does it follow history closely, but it also provides a glimse into the lives of everyday people who lived during the \\"War of Northern Aggression.\\" The only disappointing thing about the movie is that there is simply not enough time to thoroughly touch on everything that happened during this time period, and thus many things were left out. If you are even remotely interested in the Civil War, I would recommend watching this film. It is a great starting point if you want to learn more about how southern people--especially Virginians--felt."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Stonewall Jackson Story ?","review":"Gods and Generals could have been the best civil war film ever made, however the slow script,dreary music(even during action scenes),bad acting and poor camera work fail to stir much emotion. For the sixty million Ted Turner put into this mess, and with GETTYSBURG's Ron Maxwell directing, I was hoping for something alot better. Yes, there are moments when it almost starts to grab you, but it never quite gets there. The only redeeming factor is Stephen Lang's wonderful performance as Jackson. This film would be great if they trimmed everything out except his part and retitled it \\"The Stonewall Jackson Story\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointed","review":"Yes the battle scenes are great and Stephen Lang does a fine performance as Stonewall..but everything else is lousy. Where do i begin: 1) Skipping battles from the 1st Bull Run to Fredericksburg? This was a huge dissapointment. 2) I don't wanna listen to a man sing for 3 minutes when there was so much left out. 3) Yes, the Irish brigade story was very interesting (fighting against fellow irishmen of the Confederacy) but what about alittle development of Hancoock and his division. I feel like he was thrown into this movie and there was no explanation whatsoever of who he was. 4) The Chancelorsville depiction gives no credit to May 3rd when over 23,000 men fell (they only refer to how Stuart triumphed on that day) 5) Robert E. Lee was really a minor part of the movie..i honestly got alittle tired of Stephan Lang talking so much"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe I watched the whole thing","review":"Okay. I didn't see the DVD. I watched this in the theater. Maybe they reworked it after it ran in the theater to make it better. It couldn't get worse.I am a fan of the Civil War (movies, novels, etc) so I was very enthused to watch this movie especially since I heard this was made by the same people who made Gettysburg (I highly recommend Gettysburg). Unfortunately, the storytelling was horrible. It had no life. The acting didn't help. The performances were wooden and amateurish.The worst thing of all was that this drivel lasted 4 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SLOW!","review":"I usually work out in the mornings and love to watch action / war / epic films to help me get through. I had to turn Gods and Generals off because it was so slow and tedius."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my 220 minutes and $6.50 back!!!","review":"This movie sucked, it was far too long,was incredibly boring,and the acting was horrible.The only semi-redeeming quality of this movie is that it is very historically accurate,but that doesn't make a movie good...and did I mention it was long?When I saw it at the theater(only God knows why) they had an intermission in the middle of the movie...a f*#@ing intermission!!!!!What the hell?I thought only plays had intermissions.So all in all please do not see this movie unless you're a civil war buff or are interested in american history...but for entertainment purposes.Oh,and just because I say this movie is too long DOESN'T mean I have a short attention span...nothing captured my attention throughout the movie,it was just slow,plodding,and lethargic in it's presentation.I remember thinking to myself at the theater...it's going to get better...it's going to get better...how wrong I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obscures real moral issues","review":"In the 30 minutes I could take of this boring film, I saw two Blacks: both seemed very happy with life in the South. One phrase from a slave narrative I once read was \\"...and then began the whippings.\\" Didn't see any of that in the movie, however.Regardless of what the main characters in this film allegedly believed (states rights and all that) the objective fact is that they were fighting to save slavery. IF they were fighting to defend their state AND AT THE SAME TIME were planning to free slaves, then their defense of their state would be fine. But this was not the case.Those who praise the nobility of southern leaders need to confront the ethical issue involved in holding protection of one's state as having a higher moral claim than freeing enslaved people."},{"rating":"1","title":"just awful","review":"first of all the movie is like 4 hours long! only a little bit of it is battles and the battles they show dont have any blood or guts! they southerners talked so educated and trust me southerners dont talk like that. the movie made stonewall jackson seem like moses! it was like a religion story. gods and generals is boring and dull. there were only two good parts 1. stonewall got shot in the hand and they wrapped it up with only his middle finger showing so for 10 minutes he flipped his soldiers off. 2. the ending becasue it was over.save your money go buy the patriot."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lost Cause lives on...","review":"How can one possibly describe this 4 hour train wreck of a movie...historically inacurate might be the understatement of the century.

Apparently the late Edward .D Wood is credited with making the worst film of all time.. well that cannot be true.. because he did not make this film or Gettysburg..the producers and directors of Clods and Generals and Gettysbeard cannot be serious.. liberties taken with fact and accuracy.. acting the level of street entertainers (Robert Duval excluded)..the curse of political correctness.. all these matters got in the way of some sort of historical representation.... but then again.. look what so called professional film makers did with the subject of Pearl Harbor.?if the trilogy is completed, then please let it be made by someone with a sense of reality.."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about No Stars","review":"Poorly written, historically inept, and boring to boot, this movie focuses mainly upon the career of Stonewall Jackson (an aging, pudgy Joshua Chamberlain is a distraction)and features just about every cliche that the director could fit in about the Lost Cause. The Marble Man, Happy Darkies, God is a Southerner, Southern Rights, Yankee Vandals, the ironies of Irish killing the Irish Brigade, what tripe. Even the battle scenes could not hold my attention. I could easily put this in a worst ten list of movies ever made. The characters are wooden, there is NO historical insight, the actors walk through their roles. Blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassingly bad dialogue and ideology","review":"It is rare for me not to like a movie, and rarer for me to write a review. But this movie inspires comment. First, it is breathtakingly bad in its endless and embarrassing dialogue. And it is irritatingly juvenile in its one-dimensional portrayal of what motivates people and historical events. If you like cringing in embarrassment, you might find this movie enjoyable. If you think this is history, sue whatever school you came from.A few positives: The unfortunate amounts of money spent on this laughingstock of a movie gives you nice panorama views and period images to look at. There are a few good actors in this movie who did their best to shake the stink from the script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring from start to finish","review":"I had the feeling while watching this film that this movie was made by drunk 'Sons of the Confederacy', and 'Gettysburg' was made by rational thinking men of the north. Gods and Generals is probably the worst Civil War film I have ever seen. Long, without content to make up for the time and money spent, and lacking any real action. Battles only occupy the screen in a seemingly secondary role, you have to really be paying attention to even know they happened. Excessive canned repeat shots and horrible CGI ruin any battles that are shown on screen. This, coupled with the use of actors now far too old to reprise their roles, music that just doesn't stop playing throughout the film, and lengthy monologues by the primary characters that border on religious sermons, are all just 'too much'. This was at best a bad TV miniseries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever happened to...???","review":"I understand that the movie had to be keep within some time limits, but how can you have a movie about the beginning of the Civil War without mentioning a few things. Gen. McClellum and his poor battles; how Lee came to lead the Army of Northern Virginia; and how about Antietam (I think it was kinda important). Do away with some of the lengthy religious dialouges and use this time more wisely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie Ever Made","review":"Gods and Generals is as stunning in its insights into the minds and motives of these 19th century characters as they are faithful to the historical text. That the critics excoriated it says nothing of the film and speaks volumes of their pathetic grasp the events. Roger Ebert began his critique with \\"Now here's a film Trent Lott would like\\" proving he is more qualified to perform in an exercise video than understand and review this movie.The language, customs, values, uniforms and events are so penetratingly accurate it is like stepping back into the 1860s. If you want to really understand this epic event for what it was and will allow yourself to be moved by its power and realism you cannot miss this movie. As an American, if you were to see only one movie in your entire lifetime, this should be the one. Unless you are a brainwashed PC automaton you will never be the same again."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Dreadfully long. Dreadfully boring. And dreadfully too detailed to the point of failing to capturing an entirety of the Civil War. In essence, it placed too much focus on a microscopic view of the lives of a few individuals and omitted a more panaromic view of a more historical perspective of the Civil War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gods and Generals","review":"What a tribute to \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's military contributions to the US Army, then as an instructor at VMI and finally the ultimate sacrifice.Prior to seeing the movie, we strongly recommend reading the history of three battles on the war, First Bull Run or First Manassas, Fredericksburg 1862 and finally the Wilderness and Chancellorsville, 1863 prior to seeing the movie.This will clearly set the time of the American Civil War and help follow the leading characters depicted in the book by Jeff Shara. One will see how well Jeff's book mirrors the history of these events.As compared to Gettysburg, this movie becomes very personal on the life of Stonewall Jackson.This movie provides a novice historian a good prespective of the hardships of the soldiers and the horror of war.I recommend this movie for historians and for good entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film, but a bit too much dialog","review":"This film mostly views the war from the southern viewpoint, highlighting how the war started out as state vs. federal authority, but later including slave emancipation. The primary character is Stonewall Jackson, with some attention given to Robert E. Lee and Joshua Chamberlain.The battle scenes are better produced than they were in Gettysburg, but the amount of dialog between the battles is a bit much, which slows the pace at times.Overall, it is a great film that delves deeply into the Southern viewpoint of the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Clash of Pieties","review":"Reviewers have been very unfair to this film. The intention of a film drawn from a book are often revealed by the changes a scriptwriter or director makes. By making Jackson the focus of the film instead of Lee(who was the hero of the novel)the focus was placed on the competing spiritualities. Jackson enters the battle after prayer Chamberlain quotes a classical author's narrative of Ceasar at the Rubicon. Jackson represents a style of spirituality no longer tenable in our world, which was fading even in his own time, yet many of us are nostalgic for this simplistic faith. neither is Chamberlain's clacisism a replacement. We still search for a spirituality to replace the lost style represented by Jackson. The film deserves the title even more than the novel. The film has a spiritual depth that is rare in a modern film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Film Should have been Titled \\"Calvin and Jackson\\"","review":"The domination by the character of \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson and his, in the film at least, utter devotion to the predestination taught by Calvin leaves the film with no other major characters of interest. Having read the book I'd hoped for visual insight into other generals in the book who were involved in the early Civil War; but they are essentially omitted. Too bad; I believe that the war ended long after the death of Thomas Jackson and even when Jackson was alive many others, including several very interesting generals were also involved. Others seem to have become transparent; Jackson, only Jackson, is protrayed with any depth here. This may be the first DVD I return for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Gods and Generals\\"","review":"This is a great film. Its totally differant than I expected. As you probably know the picture is 4 1/2 hours long! The first half of the movie is battle sequences and the second half is human drama and emotion and I loved that.

The only thing I didnt like is the leather has some blemishes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hat, some minor issues over time","review":"I wear this hat in all kinds of weather. It's extremely comfortable, the style is a bit of a cross between Crocodile Dundee and Indiana Jones (and I've had people call me both while wearing it). In the sun, this hat is incredible - keeps my head cool, the sweat off my face, and the sun from my eyes. In the rain, the hat does a great job of keeping my head dry.My one complaint is that after a few hours in a pretty serious downpour, the glue holding the band down started to come loose. It's only apparent if you look for it, but it has me concerned about the quality long-term. Wouldn't be a big deal except that the bag is specifically advertised as *waterproof*, it even says so on the bag the hat comes in.So yeah, love the hat, and if anything were to go wrong with it, I'd honestly probably buy another, just frustrated at the seemingly low quality adhesive used on this supposedly waterproof hat."},{"rating":"1","title":"pressing issues","review":"When I hear my university colleagues condemn vanity presses, I often object, and I do so because of books like The Parthenon Code. Surely hobbyists such as Mr Johnson deserve an avenue for presenting their work to the public. The rigorous review to which juried publications are subjected demands, perhaps, an unnecessarily burdensome familiarity with scholarship in the appropriate fields of study, to say nothing of a career's worth of work in the academy and environs. My only regret for this book is that Mr Johnson has not yet quite mastered the conventions of scholarly discourse, where -- in the words of the great Dorothy L Sayers -- \\"a bland and deadly courtesy is more devastating\\" than rudely deriding the works of scholars who have devoted their lives to the formal study, teaching, and illumination of, in this case, the classics and the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opening","review":"This book is one of the most original books I have ever read. The National Enquire has been looking for Noah's Ark since I was a kid (a long time ago). Turns out he could be found in ancient Greek art all along. It makes complete sense that the Greeks were too smart to believe in what has evolved into the popular interpretation of \\"Greek Mythology\\". Their belief in the creation as told by the book of Genesis makes much more sense. This book is a must read for all believers as well as most non-believers in the Old Testament of the Bible"},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious Judeo-Christian Propaganda","review":"The book contains some serious Judeo-Christian PROPAGANDA. The author should have known that the Greeks of the old had never heard of Noah. In Greek mythology there is information about three floods (Ogygou, Dardanou and Deufkalyona) instead of one. The Greek Noah was called Deufkalyon and his wife was Pyrra. Athena's veil could not had been Noah's veil because the Greeks simply did not know who Noah was.Zero stars for its content and five stars for the propaganda which the ignorant brain-washed by the (seemingly) biblical propaganda readers will find \\"interesting\\" and \\"amazing\\". This book is only worth buying because of the wealth of pictures it contains. Otherwise it is absolutely and purposefully biased, it is absolute CRAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking History and Art Seriously","review":"I love the book. In Mr. Johnson's introduction he writes, \\"Education is not necessarily enlightenment. Education, in fact, sometimes casts a dark pall over the truth. We can be thankful that Greek art was not meant for some super-educated class: it was meant for all thinking Greeks. And that, in turn, means that we can understand it as well.\\" He adds in Chapter 1, \\"Greek artists went to great pains to tell us who they were and where they came from. It's time we took them seriously.\\" The author does just that in this remarkable work of sythesis, scholarship, and common sense. I'd give ten stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"About Time!","review":"Finally some information about mythology that makes good sense.

Moo apparently put a lot of thought into including all the various viewpoints when discussing controversial passages. When you finish, not only will you know which view Moo favors, but the strengths and weakness of the other viewpoints. I especially liked his discussion of election.Moo includes a lot of background information on Paul, controversies in the early church, insightful comments by early church leaders and the reformers like Luther and Calvin. All this makes for a large book, but he does a very thorough job in this well written commentary on Romans. I do wish that he would have spent a little more time on Romans 3:23 and 6:23, but they have been covered exhaustively elsewhere. If you like this commentary, be sure to pick up his commentary on James.

It is a masterful commentary full of pertinent insight and many nuggets of considerable import. My only negative critique is that this commentary is not more Pastoral. It is extremely useful (read \\"invaluable\\") for scholars, theologians, seminarians, etc., but is not nearly as easily digested and presented for Pastors or Sunday School Teachers or Church Bible Study teachers, etc. I only wish Moo had included more pastorally, but nevertheless this is a magnificent work and highly recommended for anyone wanting to understand Paul's message to the church at Rome. I would recommend that perhaps some other commentaries be included (even such trustworthy classics such as Calvins or Luthers)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most extraordinary CDs of the past 5 years","review":"Quite simply, this CD has become one of my top 4 or 5 favorite of all time - right up there with the best of Pharoah Sanders.

But not going to buy until there is a complete season package.

The reason I gave it only 1 star was to lower the average so people realize how flawed this DVD release is. It has already been stated how the episodes are out of order. Totally annoying unless you don't mind switching discs back and forth to view them in proper order. Otherwise the episodes don't make sense, and the previously on... at the beginning of each episode is a spoiler for upcoming episodes that should have come earlier. Also, you will need to print out the episode list from the internet just to know the proper sequence. It is just totally screwed up and shows the disregard Disney execs have for their customers.

But a curious drummer-boy, from the garrison of a castle long since in ruins, has disturbed the King's rest too soon. Can our heroes set the world right before it is destroyed?One thing I really liked about this book is that the risen magics are never fully explained and named.

This songs are amazing the lyrics the music all really meaningful and are not just songs that can be dismissed as ok or good. no these songs are worth remembering. All have a meaning and make you see the worth in things. The album touches on so many subjects of life.When John Nolan and Shaun Cooper left TBS, i was a little sad because i liked the forcefulness of Johns vocals and i liked the bass lines shaun had, but i think that leaving was one of the best things they could have done. I just don't think that John was getting the recoginition he deserved as a song writer with TBS but he with out a doubt gets it with Straylight Run. If you have not picked this album up I deffinatly recommend it. Go buy it. You won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"This cd is the epitome of mediocrity. I usually play it at about 11:30 or 12 at night when i would like to go to sleep. Dont get me wrong, its a decent cd, they play well together but its SLOW, theres not enough guitar on the cd, and the female vocalist is only good as back up, please NEVER give her a solo song again, shes not good enough to do that. John is good on the piano but I cant help but want him to pull out a guitar on this cd. Its a decent listen, but nothing memorable. They left their best song of the cd, \\"A Slow Descent,\\" which is about the TBS break up.If you're looking for some good piano rock, go get Something Corporate's \\"North,\\" event TBS new cd is better than this, atleast I dont fall asleep when I listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done.","review":"This album for the most part is well presented. The few exceptions are the two songs sung solo by the female vocalist, which are mediocore if not bad. Other than that Straylight Run's 1st album sounds like a winner. The album is a mix of emo and indie music. The lyrics are well thought out and beautifully done with the piano and backup female vocals. The standout tracks are Existentialism on Prom Night, Your Name Here, and It's for the Best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A welcome addition to the emo genre","review":"As a 22-year-old, I've been through the grunge era (Pearl Jam, Nirvana, etc.), the post-grunge era (Collective Soul, Live, Bush, etc.), and now the emo era, which started to get big with bands like At The Drive-In. I was skeptical of how emo would do until I heard Taking Back Sunday's 'Tell All Your Friends.' That is still the best emo album I've heard. So it is not surprising that I likewise greatly enjoy this offering from a couple former band members of TBS. While Straylight Run is, of course, more mellow and piano-based, I think TBS fans will like it. Lord knows we don't need another band with the traditional emo sound.Those who give this album (and other emo albums) one star reviews do so because they dislike the sappy romanticism of emo, or at least, much of emo. Those who feel that way should stop posting negative reviews. Leave the reviews for those of us who see emo as a worthy art form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivaldi at its best","review":"The opera contains some of the best music written by Vivaldi, who was an opera composer as much as an instrumental music one. Wonderful arias, in various styles. There is some sensational singing by Cecilia Gasdia, for example, the aria Se mai senti, in which she mimicks, with soft and long notes, the breeze that carries the laments of a lover to his beloved."},{"rating":"2","title":"magnificent","review":"To me this is Cecil in his best (and most accessable) period. It's good to hear his playing without the distraction of horns. William Parker and Tony Oxley play beautifully with him which makes me prefer this to his solo work. The music is positive, powerful and strong -even rock fans end up liking this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps this book needs an update","review":"Having thoroughly studied this book, I was surprised to find that the actual test was rather different. There were questions on legislation and assessment statistics that were not covered in the book. Also, this book stressed that grammar and writing ability were important in the constructed answer questions, but on the test you could use list, outline, prose - whatever form you wanted to get the information down."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good","review":"not worth the money to small not what it said to be its a piece of junk don't wastes your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish they wouldn't have changed","review":"These bars are great but recently they changed packagaing and style, I get why less waste, better for the environment, etc. But unfortunately for me, my autistic son recognized that they changed the packagaing and refuses to eat them now. He used to love them and I also noticed the bar is more compact now and texture is different. I still think they are good but unfortunately I will have to take them off my auto delivery service since they were purchased for my son. The Bars were already delicious I just wish they wouldn't have changed them. But I do recommend these they are delicious."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son LOVES these","review":"My son is on a Gluten free diet and these are one of his favorite items. I can't keep enough in the pantry for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and Organic","review":"These are very tasty bars. They have enough dried berries to taste, and I usually get at least one with every bite. It is a sweet bar, kind of like a Rice Krispie Treat, but not quite as sticky. They're soft and stay fresh for a long time, too.I love the organic ingredients, always feel good about eating foods without synthetic pesticides or other crap like that.These bars don't have high fructose corn syrup, thank goodness, so right there tells you they're worth the cost. They do contain invert cane juice, which is 1/2 fructose, so if you have a fructose intolerance, use caution because of that ingredient.I highly recommend these, especially for those on a gluten-free diet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yum!","review":"Healthy and delicious, plus it's organic! Would highly recommend to anyone seeking an easy, but healthy, snack for their kids!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cross contaminated with dairy","review":"We've tried these bars several times in a few different flavors and they are always cross contaminated with dairy. I think the chocolate actually contains milk so that may be the source of the problem. My kid's allergic so it's pretty easy to tell when a new food is causing a problem.They're delicious and the times we've tried them they are never stale or too hard to chew (like the other natural crispy rice bar that is actually dairy free). Wish they didn't have a cross contamination problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"high sugar snack","review":"These taste good, but are a bit too sweet. The sweetness level reminds me of Rice Krispie treats. Keep in mind they have 7 g of sugar and just 1 g of protein. There really isn't much nutrition in these bars... 110 virtually empty calories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"I also had ordered these bars and had my order cancelled. They sent an e-mail stating that this item was on back order and should ship within 7-10 days. Then a couple days later, they decided to cancel my order. It was LIE!!! They never had stuff on backorder. They just didn't want to sell it at the low price. The email indicated that I could search for it again and buy it if I wanted. Conveniently, the price jumped to over $18 for the 6 boxes."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves these!","review":"My daughter eats one of these bars almost every day. She had to go gluten-free last year and this was the first treat we found that she really liked. She takes them to school for her snack and doesn't care that the other kids are getting things like animal or graham crackers. I like them because they are healthy and portable. I keep one in the car and one in my purse for emergencies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Take Along Snack for Those with Food Allergies","review":"My 2 1/2 year old is allergic to foods very common in traditional granola-type bars: wheat, soy, nuts. We have tried various \\"bars\\" that were \\"safe\\" for her to eat and this has been, by far, her favorite! I'm happy that they're organic & she loves the taste. Great all around. They are individually packaged, which makes them great for when we are on the go."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAS SOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"When I purchased this item the ingredients on amazon did NOT say that it was made with soy oil. My son is alergic to wheat, milk, soy, peanut and eggs. I was so happy when I found this because it was affordable and (I thought) he could actually eat it. When it came I was really upset to find that it's made with soy, not canola like it states. Amazon should fix the discription. I ended up bringing the bars into my classroom and giving them away."},{"rating":"1","title":"tea light holder","review":"This is just a tea light holder. I am serious just take your ball to the store and get a tea light holder that fits and looks good with the ball. I have one that looks exactly the same but it cost me $1.70 at benfranklin crafts."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a joke","review":"This was just too small. Should have figured out what a 50 mm sphere was before it was ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong release","review":"This is a totally wrong release (re-issue) trying to cash in on iconoclastic hard rock/proto-doom British outfit, using the original artwork of legitimate compilation featuring:1.

Now, that one is a must for everybody about HMR and doom"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the \\"Sabbath-style\\" doom?","review":"Contrary to the info given by the label, there's absolutely no Sabbath influence or \\"doom metal\\" (or any metal for that matter) whatsoever on this disc. It's a fairly entertaining 70's organ-driven rock album, and I probably would have enjoyed it more if the label was upfront with their description of the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pilgrim wanders a little too far to the middle.","review":"If it was Clapton's intention to complete the crossover to 'lite' rock/pop, consider this CD is a smashing success. It took only the 1st 3 or 4 songs and a glance at the credits to see where this CD was heading. I did however hold on to some hope for a gut wrenching version of the great blues number Going Down Slow. Boy, was I in for a surprise. Some disks take several listens to fully appreciate. I'm afraid this is one disk I won't be giving a second chance. What could have been a powerful CD, has been lost to 'technopop'. Sorry Eric, you're a proven and wonderful artist - but you've lost me on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not your father's Clapton album","review":"I anxiously awaited yet another album from Eric Clapton, and bought it the first day it was available. Instead of hearing yet another great performance, I heard a stunning letdown. This album has Babyface's fingerprints all over it. Eric's guitar is all but gone, and his voice whines like a pimple-faced teenager without a date. If you expect the Clapton you know, this album is a disappointing stranger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exceedingly disappointing and lacks \\"fire\\" of previous works","review":"I like blues and R&B and I prefer the use of real instruments. I was very put off by the use of \\"electronics\\" and I could not get beyond the lack of real drumming. I listened to the CD once and gave it my 21 year old daughter who really enjoys the album. I believe \\"From the Cradle\\" and \\"Unplugged\\" are excellent examples of his talent. If I could choose one song that epitomizes Clapton guitar work, I would choose \\"Crossroads\\" from \\"Wheels of Fire.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down to this huge Clapton Fan","review":"After the wonderful \\"back to the basics\\" Unplugged & From the Cradle albums from Clapton in the 90s, long time fans have been dissapointed with this high-tech album. I admire EC for trying something different, but drum machines & so much synth seems out place with Clapton. He may have spent a little too much time with Babyface prior to this one. Try the 2 previous CDs, Slow Hand, Just One Night or 461 Ocean Blvd for great solo Eric."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one's worth listening to","review":"In Pilgrim, Eric Clapton's work is rich and textured. His guitar is not the guitar you will hear in classics like Layla, but it is present, as an aid to his increasingly rich and resonant voice. To listen to that voice in River of Tears is to hear pathos, to plumb the depths of pain. Clapton's diverse talent is shown in his abiltity to present himself both in the soulful She's Gone and the electronica influenced Inside of Me. Never one to rest on his laurels, Eric continues to experiment along the way. Pilgrim is evidence not only of Eric Clapton's maturity, but of his ability to tell it like it is, from his heart and soul. And like a vintage wine, he just keeps getting better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Letdown","review":"Eric Clapton is probably the best guitarist ever. This CD is certainly not one of his best. I am a big fan of Clapton, but this was a letdown. The only real strong song on this is My Father's Eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be getting old...","review":"This album received a lot of good reviews, but I hear it as fluff designed to sound comtempory and sell records. \\"My Father's Eyes\\" was a good single, but on this album Clapton not only loses his musical roots, but brings to mind a quote from a long-ago Clapton song, \\"Bet you didn't think I knew how to rock and roll.\\" After listening to this album, I'll take that bet."},{"rating":"1","title":"It went in the trash","review":"I have most of EC's recordings and love most of them and really like the rest. However, I bought this abomination the day it was released, naturally figuring I'd at least greatly enjoy it. I played it through once, took it out of my CD player and threw it in the garbage, because that is what this is...garbage. The electronic drum tracks ruined it the most, but it honestly doesn't even sound like Eric Clapton, more like some R&B guy trying to sound like him. Spend your hard-earned money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"I play Unplugged again and again, and never tire of it. I played Pilgrim once, and was so disappointed. Mechanical drum beats, strings in the background, no audience showing appreciation and inspiring the performer.Come on, Eric, this is not the way the old blues men played."},{"rating":"1","title":"His day is gone!","review":"After hearing the first track, \\"My Father's Eyes\\", I became sick. This CD is a recording of a man whose day it gone, and who is trying to catch up with Rolling Stones and other groups of his decade (or century, we're not sure which, it was all so long ago) by adding synthesizers instead of true blue guitar. ERIC, YOUR DAY IS OVER!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A rocking pilgrim!","review":"I bought this album a few days after seeing Eric Clapton in concert in April 1998. He was then promoting this album. He opened with MY FATHER'S EYES,which was the first hit from this album. That song along with RIVER OF TEARS was reused for CLAPTON CHRONICLES,released in October 1999. PILGRIM is from the Mel Gibson-Danny Glover movie \\"Lethal Weapon 4\\". BORN IN TIME was written by Bob Dylan. ONE CHANCE and INSIDE OF ME have hip-hop style R & B. I heard SHE'S GONE on the radio so I believe that was a hit also. All the other songs are good."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Imagine yourself standing on a precipice with the wind in your face being all that seperates you from what lies below. An exercise in subtlety and restraint - that is Pilgrim. I love this album and highly recommend it. Clapton has matured but he hasn't lost his edge (pun intended). As for Reptile...that's something else altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to old slowhand?","review":"I always admire artists who try to break new ground while holding on to their roots. A great example is EC's brilliant work on the soundtrack for the movie Rush. But on Pilgrim? When I listen to this album (75 minutes, no less!), I expect a disc jockey in a smooth, low voice to announce between songs, \\"Music for your work day, on LITE-FM.\\" What's next-a connection to lonely teens by playing full-force heavy metal?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly worthless","review":"This Clapton CD is totally un-listenable. What a bunch of lightweight pap from the most respected guitar player of a generation. Keep it up Eric and you'll be the next McCartney - a non-seller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eric, What were you thinking?","review":"There are artists whose CDs I buy whether I have heard them or not. Bruce, Carlos, SRV, and up until now Clapton. From this CD on I listen before I buy. How can a guy who has brought us such great music stub his toe so bad every now and then?it doesn't diminish Eric's talent but it certainly does makes us question his judgement."},{"rating":"1","title":"somos humanos.....errar es humano......","review":"clapton es uno de los musicos mas talentosos que he podido escuchar en este trillado mundo del rocnroll.....puede ser que haya aprovechado la ignorancia de muchos para cimentar sus comienzos en yeites del gran freddie king, pero eso a quien le importa!!!! quizas buscando renovarse haya errado el camino y nos encontramos con este fiasco...disco para sala de espera de dentistas o algo asi.....en mi humilde opinion, es un trabajo muy especial, my dificil de digerir si uno ve el nombre de clapton en la cubierta...pero de todos modos, es mi humilde opinion!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eric Clapton is Finished","review":"I'm awfully surprised Clapton released this. The vast majority of this album is \\"B\\" or \\"C\\" rate music. Actually, it's the all-time worst album from Eric Clapton. I don't know why this guy refuses to release material like the stuff that put him in teh spotlight in the first place to at least reassure his fans that the fire is still in him. This CD sux."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't the Clapton we all know and love....","review":"If the cover didn't say Eric Clapton on it, I'd never had known who or what I was listening too. This is certainly his poorest offering ever. I would not recommend this album at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is So Bad","review":"I'm the most advid Eric Clapton fan on the planet but, this cd is so bad. He better stop working with no talents like babyface, because that could be his demise. He should work with new up and coming talent like Johnny Lang & Kenny Wayne Shepard. But don't buy this cd buy an older one of Clapton's"},{"rating":"2","title":"realistic, heart and soul displayed, set to expanding feelin","review":"During this time of the Millenium, I found this work exceptional. The ability to bypass boundries of class, expose heart and soul to those of us living apparently more basic, simple lives was and is real. To know Stars are still quite able to display those feelings with which some of the rest of us can identify, is a positive reality check. I found both the lyrics and the music composition moving and quite unique. The story of the CD is a fasinating one to experience. Eric Clapton, I wish the best for you and your co-workers! Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Dull CD","review":"I am a terrific Eric Clapton fan and have every CD the man has made. Indeed, my very first record (remember those?) as a teenager was the Yardbirds For Your Love, and have been an avid fan of his for years. I have seen him live probably 20 times.This album is just terrible. It is slow, dull, uninspiring, and over-produced. \\"My Father's Eyes\\" is the only memorable track, and is hardly worth the purchase of this CD. Buy it used if you must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man, this Sucks.","review":"This music is banal, uninspired, boring, monotonous and just sucks the soul out of the living. The final cut, Inside of Me, contains an almost subliminal message of the most trite kind. All things considered, if Utopia is closer to us than anyone can imagine, then it sucks. If this is applied science and centralization, then Clapton has become a zombie going through the motions. This album should be blown to smithereens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the same ole' stuff","review":"The complaints you'll read about this album from reviewers seems to be that this isn't the Clapton of old. Well guess what -- to them I'd like to say that artists are generally compelled to create and to change as they grow. Staying formulaic isn't creating. So having said that, if you're looking for more of the same, you will not find it on this album. If you want sweet soulful blues that sound like the ghost of Curtis Mayfield slipped into the booth for a few of the tracks -- you've found the right one, baby, as Ray Charles used to say.I popped this one in the CD player this morning after not listening to it for more than a year and it's still one of my favorites.This is the Clapton that partnered with Sting to create the hit jazz blues ballad \\"It's Probably Me\\". from the movie Lethal Weapon (I don't remember which sequel). If you like that song, you'll love this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to this album before you buy it!","review":"I got this album at a used music store, which meant it was cheap, but also meant I couldnt bring it back for a refund. The song \\"Father's Eyes\\" is great. I love it and it almost justifies this album. I understand Clapton did this shortly after the loss of his young son, and that accounts for the tone of the album. In fact, the lyrics are exceptional, but this amounts to a $5,000 paint job on a burning Pinto. There is one other song on this album I liked, the title track, and that is it. Two good songs, two stars, that seems more than fair. From the reviews it is clear this album grows on some people, but hey, so does fungus if you're not careful. Buy this with eyes open. Maybe you will grow to like it, maybe you won't. In a month of listening I still hear a dozen tracks out of 14 that bore me silly. I honestly think it was mostly catharsis for Clapton, and most fans, including me, just arent going to dig it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pilgrim, the sequel to 461 Ocean Blvd. Bravo!","review":"At 47 years I continue to listen to and look forward to the continued evolution of Eric Clapton's mastered craft. After many many listenings of Pilgrim it struck me that the understated guitar playing that everyone talks about on this album is not understated at all but in fact Eric has achieved the ability to sing through his guitar in a way that can only be acheived by a person who has played for over 40 years. The track \\"River of tears\\" brings tears of joy to my eyes at the shear beauty of the story, composition and rainbow of sound color. In addition Eric has certainly proven that his vocal talents are in top form for a person in his middle years. It is appropriate that Mr. Clapton not try to revisit his younger Cream years and instead explore his fully developed seasoned talents in a way that is unique and totally enjoyable to me. Great Great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clapton should stick to what he knows best","review":"I am a long-time fan of Eric Clapton. I can appreciate all of the changes he and his career have gone through. However, this is the first Eric Clapton album I have purchased and actually considered returning. Like many other artists, Clapton has apparently chosen to try and do something that sells records rather than make something that lives up to his legendary status. Like Bonnie Raitt or Joe Cocker, Clapton is at his legendary best when he sings and plays from his gut. Raitt gave up the blues and went with the slick sound on 'Nick of Time' and Cocker seems to go back and forth on virtually every album. One song great Cocker, the next a slick disappointment. Do you honestly think 'Pilgrim' will go down in history like 'Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs' or even 'Journeyman'? If this is the road Clapton has chosen, then I wish him the best of luck, but I won't be buying any more of his albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse than 1 star","review":"This is the worst album from eric crapton.I didn\`t think eric could go bee-gees on us but he did.This is some disco danny stuff.I\`m surprised eric isn\`t wearing his polyester pants on the cover of this lemmon.Next eric will cover,how deep is your love or night fever.Disco down eric!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wine-&-Cheese Clapton","review":"With Pilgrim, Clapton completes his musical transformation from a blues/rock giant to a lame, lifeless R&B/pop wannabe. Hey, Eric, remember Muddy Waters? Quit hanging with bozos like Seal and remember where you came from!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the motivation?","review":"Eric Clapton can be really great, shown primary in older tracks like \\"Layla\\", \\"Cocaine\\" and \\"Wonderful tonight\\". But on the other hand, Mr. Clapton can be so very boring and that's the case on \\"Pilgrim\\". Ask yourself: Would any of these tracks be suitable on a best of? I don't think so. The whole album is uninteresting and lack enthusiasm - it's a real sleeping pill. No great melody, no groove, no action and no hunger. On \\"Pilgrim\\", Clapton sounds like an old tired man who has lost it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album that never gets old","review":"Easy listening. I Love this album one of my very favorite of all time. Smooth and relaxing music. Highly recommend purchasing entire album"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album displays the tremendous diversity of Clapton.","review":"I love listening to this album and never tire of it. It is one of very few albums in which I catch myself enjoying every song, though each one is different from the rest. \\"She's gone\\" is rougher and biting; a touch of Flamenco in \\"Circus,\\" and the final track is one that makes me think. Clapton was ROBBED when he did not get the album Grammy on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clapton shows diversity","review":"\\"Pilgrim\\" is a perfect display of EC's diversity at this stage of his career. I like his early stuff as much as the next person, but it's also nice to be able to sit on the deck with a drink in my hand after a hard day's work and just chill to some softer, smoother Clapton. This is weekday Clapton. When the weekend arrives, pull out \\"From the Cradle\\" or \\"Unplugged!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clapton Sells Out","review":"Every time i think back to the days of Cream, I cant imagine what he was thinking when producing this album......I had no idea Clapton was such a R&B fan. Although this is a good r&b disc, it would've been better if he'd stuck to his roots. Yeah, I know all great musicians evolve (Hendrix--from physcdelic to funk), but i think this album was an overkill. Last, my favorite song is \\"Born in Time\\", a Bob Dylan-written song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves Long Time Fan Stone Cold","review":"I have virtually everything EC has ever recorded & have seen him in concert many times over the past twenty something years. The only reason I listened to this CD more than once was to make sure I wasn't missing something. I don't expect him to repeat the same guitar solos, styles & formats of his past work, but this piece is devoid of any of the reasons I have always been one of his biggest fans.Also, the fact that so many reviewers here can give a five star rating to a Clapton CD with so many drum machines permeating every track confirms my belief that there are at least two very different sets of Eric Clapton fans. I don't think Eric himself would have been inspired by this CD had he heard it in his earlier years from another artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pilgrim this!","review":"Ick! Nothing about this album impressed me. I found the songs uninspired, and the production over the top. I love Eric's work but this one has to be skipped. I couldn't distinguish the bass lines on most of the songs either, they were just nuevo-R&B mud. I hear the latest album, Reptile, is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't!","review":"i wish i had heeded the one star review that warned me against this cd. i got on an eric clapton kick after reading his biography, and got carried away. you might as well have a disco ball spinning while you listen to this one. the loud tinny electronic back beat drives me crazy. what an amateurish endeavor; not worthy of this great blues guitarist."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing, as compared with \\"Unplugged.\\" bland, studio-p","review":"I was disappointed because it was produced in a studio, and had no \\"life\\" to it. Perhaps the same music performed in concert might have a little more zip\\" to it. I think Eric writes songs that reflect his inner personality. Right now, I think he is still mourning the loss of his son, and is trying to forgive himself. I understand, but lets have an \\"Unplugged II' LIVE, with old fashioned blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Was Sooo Much Better Live!","review":"When ever people go to a concert, they can't wait to here the old stuff, that's how I approached the Clapton \\"Pilgrim\\" concert, summer of 98. He started off with the first 6 songs from Pilgrim and I loved it, forget his old stuff. But when I bought the album, the songs had lost the soul and strength from the concert. Than I noticed that the songs are paced by a soulless metrinome-like drum machine. Eric, this could have been one of your best, re-record it with a live drummer and an audience, if that's what it takes to bring back those soulful, driving tunes, I heard on the night of the concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"erics best work to date","review":"the first song \\"pilgrim\\" let me know that clapton had madea break through and he was playing and singing from deepin his soul.i have listened toeric for 35 years and have every album he played on,we must allow our music hero's room to grow and change,to keep him limited to the traditonal blues would be tomiss out on his great talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo! Eric","review":"Pilgrim is all about emotions - From \\" only the broken hearted.. \\" to \\"...a world full of anger and no one to blame..\\" through \\" I wish that I could hold you one more time just to ease the pain...\\" Listen to it carefully, it takes usually an artist a couple of decades to produce one - So enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You must be a real EC lover not to be disappointed","review":"After \\"Unplugged\\" and \\"From the Cradle\\" I was really looking forward to this one but was badly disappointed.

Lets hope he will find his way home to Blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love most of the songs on this cd","review":"I had this cd lying around for a while and started listening to it a couple of weeks ago and now I can't stop. There are some real gems on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Work Of Art","review":"This album is one of the best Eric has ever done.I admit I am a fan of the more current refined Clapton work and there are those that lament the downtone of wildness present in some of his early work with Cream,Derek and the Dominos,etc.,but this album puts Slowhands at the top of his class. He has honed his craft to a new level. The disc also contains a great version of the Bob Dylan creation\\"Born In Time\\".It's never been done any better.Clapton's voice is much better now and in case you think he can't play anymore,listen to him let it loose on the \\"She's Gone\\"track.This is a great album,good enough to make pilgrims of us all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It may be heresy, but... it's just awful and kind of sad","review":"This c.d. is for people who love Shania Twain and think Kenny G is great. This is the worst Clapton album I've ever owned (well, formerly owned). It reminds me of the 2 slick, souless and forgotten Arista albums recorded by the Allman Brothers (Reach for the Sky & Brothers of the Road) prior to their amazing comeback in the 90's. Avoid if you admire in any way the 60's and 70's EC music. I'm not giving up on Clapton like most critics have, but let's be honest: this is awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Haunting","review":"I have owned this albumn for several years, and I am still finding new things to love about it. The music has so much depth and layers, it is a truly satisfying experience. The mood is almost orchestral in nature, vibrantly grand and sweeping. Sorrow Marry Me, Camptown Misery, and Monarch Mine are amazing. Peppermint and Stars Fly are beautifly performed as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Band to Watch Out For!","review":"Powerpop at its best. There is not a single mediocre cut to be found on this CD. Standout songs include \\"Hold You Down,\\" \\"Peppermint,\\" \\"Stars Fly\\" and \\"Frosting.\\" Intensely romantic with catchy lyrics. Amazing debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"There are better glasses out there for the price. The ear pieces on this model crumble. This causes the glasses to slip off your face.

(if she even gets half that far with this album)!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wasnt her 1st flukie cd bad enough?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?","review":"why dont those who cant sing/write/play instruments just go away???the best thing i can type about her''music''is that she at least keeps her clothes on.will she soon become a stripper like mariah carey and jewel in order to boosts sales remains to be seen.my guess is she doesnt have the physical goods to pull that off either."},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER THAN THE FIRST","review":"Overall, the album is much more stronger than \\"Whoa, Nelly!\\"... the only drawback is that while \\"Whoa, Nelly!\\" had much more stronger singles, \\"Folklore\\" works as a whole. The multi-layered production on \\"Whoa, Nelly!\\" may be better, but the songs here are much more low-key. This album is my favorite of last year. A radiant blend of pop, folk, rock tinged with an international vibe.STAND OUT TRACKS:One Trick Pony (a great song reminiscent of what was on \\"Whoa, Nelly!\\")Try (an introduction to what the second half of the album sounds like...)Forca (makes me wanna get up and dance)The Grass Is Green (very soulful)Build You Up (the best song on the entire album!)Childhood Dreams (a beautiful and haunting ballad)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nelly's identity????????","review":"Just a reminder: Nelly Furtado is Canadian and her parents are Portuguese. As far as I could confirm, Portugal is still a independent nation. So, I don't see how Brazil has a big part of Nelly's identity, as it is said in the Editor's Review. I can understand the brazilian influences, but the brazilian identity really I don't get... is it the Portuguese language that confuses the Editor? Or is it just ignorance and lack of History and Geography basics???P.S.: Nelly comes frequently to Portugal, giving interviews on TV, promoting her record, doing gigs. Last year, Nelly came to Portugal to do a gig on a very very small town in Madeira island: it's her grandmother village and as a promise she played there. And she did it after she got the Grammy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan of the 2 minute pop song? Forget this album.","review":"Nelly Furtado is one of those artists who takes aspects of any music she hears, and incorporates it into her work... On \\"Folklore\\" influences of fado, pop, rock, church music, rap and so on can be heard, and it can be tricky to appreciate.But all in all, this album is beautiful. Less layer and busy then \\"Whoa Nelly!\\", I think it's as good, or surpasses \\"Whoa Nelly\\".In interviews, Nelly has said it herself - this album is less party sounding, a lot more mature. I think it's less radio friendly, but deliberately.Many people have been bashing \\"Childhood Dreams\\", and I have to say, really, if you loved all the singles from the last album, you won't like it. I think it's kind of epic, and it reminds me of Tori or Ani at times.Anyway, if you liked songs like \\"Trynna find a way\\", \\"My love grows deeper\\", \\"Scared of you\\" and \\"Onde Estas\\" from her first album, you will probably enjoy this one. But if you only liked the singles, don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok for Nelly","review":"Im no fan of hers but there were a few good songs on her last cd, this album is much better...the only thing im surprised about is that most people do not like CHILDHOOD DREAMS on this album...honest to god, that's my most favourite song of hers EVER...\\"you're the little boy made for me...\\" is the sweetest line she can sing. To me, it sounds like a diary-like love song. It sounds like like a love and loss song to me, but anyways.Fressh off the boat sounds cool, Forca is cool as well, very cultural sounds here folks!One trick Pony is another awesome opener but EXPLODE is def another hit on this album, very cool, catchy and meaningful.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is wonderful CD. Nelly Furtado's style is just amazing. My wife gave me this CD and I have to say it is great. There are 3 or 4 songs I like a lot and these are the type of songs you never stop liking. I rate this cd with 4 stars, because frankly I skip few songs (not that they are bad, they are just not my type).Enjoy. Overall it's a very good CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so fast","review":"I loved Nelly Furtado on the \\"Loose\\" CD and I love her in concert. I was impressed with the many positive reviews on here of her CD \\"Folklore.\\"It was an easy decision to get it after all the positivity. HOWEVER, after listening to it many times it has not grown on me and I really am disappointed in it. I do not see how so many loved it. Not me, I wish I had of never had bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boys beware!","review":"I bought this album blind, being (still) so impressed with her first effort \\"Whoa, Nelly!\\" This one is chick music! None of the quirkyness, originality and sexy vocal escapades here. Just another average mainstream pop effort that is probably sounding alright to your average nurse but lacks edginess and spirit to satisfy the music connoisseur. You might as well buy something like Norah Jones or Shania Twain, yikes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cry me a river---no just strangle me.","review":"This album is definately not \\"Whoa Nelly\\" 2. I honestly gave this album away,because it depressed me so bad. The tempo is melancholic. Her songs are depressing.Definately not worth the moey. If you are fan of hers,perhaps you might consider downloading her music for 99 cents somewhere,instead of going to a store and paying nearly $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"nelly furtado sucks and she can't sing. she sounds SO bad when she sings. she like...moans. and she likes Powerless cuz it \\"blends cultures\\" or some s*** like that. psh riiiight. does that mean you changing your clothes every five seconds??? she's such a bad singer and writes annoying music i have no idea how she could have fans. if u wanna check out GOOD music by girl singers check out: Katy Rose, Michelle Branch, Avril Lavigne or Lillix....those are female artists with actual...TALENTps-nelly, ur a disgrace to canada...we're known for our GOOD and TALENTED artists"},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE HER VOICE!!","review":"Nelly Furtado has to have one of THE most annoying-sounding voices in music history. Whiny as all hell!! Whiny and nasal-sounding. Totally irritating. The first single off this new cd puts me in a bad mood every time i hear it on the radio. And of course, pop radio overplays whatever is current at the time. The only ONE good song she ever put out was I'm Like A Bird, and that was only tolerable for part of it. Why is she being so hyped up? Nelly, the needle on the suck meter is going into the red zone. I cannot get over how she sounds like a whining little baby when she sings. Will somebody please smack her for me? Her voice is enough to incite me to commmit murder. I seriously hope this is the last cd she puts out. She's already done enough damage to my ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Converted fan","review":"First of all, I wasn't really a fan of Nelly. I'd heard the singles I'm like a bird and Turn off the light like everyone else but never really paid attention to her. This record has converted me into a fan. It hasn't left my CD player since I got it.I love the eclecticism. The music moves from introspective to celebratory to dreamy and keeps you guessing. Nelly also has a lot to say. The lyrics touch not only love but also childhood, immigration, teenage life.The songs themselves bring amazing vivid imagery to my head. In One-Trick Pony the words gallop along with the music. The last track is ethereal and ends the album beautifully as she sings 'I'm sliding on the rainbows of my childhood dreams'. In Forca, I find a celebrative mood that puts a bounce in my step. In Explode, I find teenage angst and a wonderful bridge segment.What can I say more but get it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED it!!","review":"I loved her first album but I think I love this one more. It's absolutely excellent. I love it when you put a album on and every song is great. That don't mean I don't have favorites cause I do they are Powerless, Forca, explode, saturdays & Childhood Dreams But the whole album is awesome. Thumbs Way Up!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Innovative and awesome tracks.","review":"This CD is really awesome for anyone who is into deep, original sounding music. The tracks all have lyrics that can be taken literally and yet you can take it to a different more personal level. Songs like \\"One Trick Pony\\", \\"Forca\\", \\"Powerless\\", \\"Childhood dreams\\" and \\"Grass is greener\\" are awesome.After basically downloading the 1st album, I made a decision to purchase folklore since Nelly proved she isn't a 1 or 2 hot songs per cd type of artist, and she certainly is not.This album is so worth the money if your looking for something more than just a britney spears album.Its got meaning and its just a happy yet mature record, that I can't see myself get sick from.Representing awesome songwriters from BC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nelly's identity?

Well flash forward to 2007 when I first heard her song \\"Say It Right\\". I definitely fell in love with this song so I looked it up and got Loose. I then realized that she had made two previous albums and got them too, and that was when I realized that she sang \\"I'm Like a Bird\\".Anyway, Folklore has to be her best album. It has so much meaning in the lyrics and her style is definitely something unique and amazing. I can say now that since I have heard her older work, that her older style is definitely her best. If you like her newer style a lot, you will probably not like her older style as they are very different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"I recieved a burned copy of this cd from my friend, and ever since then, ive been in the best mood.

She has her own style, her own distinctive voice and unique and tantalising rhythms and beats.As she sings on \\"One Trick Pony\\":Nobody can control meNobody can conform meNobody can disown meNobody can ignore meSongs that can't be ignored are \\"Powerless\\", \\"Fresh Off The Boat\\" and \\"Forca\\"(both repetitive but very catchy), \\"One-Trick Pony\\", \\"Build You Up\\" (a slower song), and the wonderful lyrics of \\"Childhood Dreams\\".A great follow up album, with more depth than the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the best","review":"This Folklore album is by far in my opinion the best of Nelly's.

She is very energetic and powerful and her music is good as well. The difference between her and Anggun is : Nelly is more hip than Anggun in making music, (although both of them play ethnic music), and she's more into hip-hop. Whereas Anggun is more sensual and elegant. But I love both of them (remembering that both of them can speak more than 1 language) and I wish they could do a duet song. That'd be a great one!!!.Keep it going Nelly Furtado, I love your music!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"I liked all of the songs played on the radio that were released from the first cd, but never ended up buying it, I heard the first single from this cd and thought what the hey I'll buy it it was on sale.

I thought Pilgram at Tinker Creek was a unique approach to the eternal question of the goodness and badness of the world, and the nature of its creator. However, I found Dillard rather self-absorbed, and was not able to relate to her. While parts of the book are beautifully written, her style can be awkward and jarring at times. I'm glad Dillard was able to end her journey on a positive note of praise, but I didn't gain much from her experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow down long enough to read the whole book!","review":"I first read the famous chapter \\"Seeing\\" from this book about 15 years ago. it was, literally, an eye-opening experience. When I finally got around to reading the entire book, it was more of the same. a beautiful, classic book.Tinker's writing requires patience on the reader's part. she has an extraordinary eye for detail, and a very appealing voice. Some readers may tire of chapter after chapter of detailed description of the minutiae she observes in the woods around her house. But reading the entire book is its own reward. Writing like this is not to be rushed through. after all, the great lesson from this book is to SLOW DOWN and look around. it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tinker Creek Review","review":"Maybe it's being forced to read something that usually makes it so unappealing. That was not the case with Pilgrim at Tinker Creek. My schedule is packed full, and normally i'd slack off in reading books for class, but I really enjoyed reading this book. This book by Annie Dillard is not as philosophical as say, Walden. It doesn't contain as many quotable nuggets, but it certainly is more entertaining to read. The book offers an insiders view to nature-Often getting too close and personal with nature's processes. Dillard offers insightful information about nature that could be used as a guide for city dwellers, or as a book to relate to for nature lovers. This book provides an urge to go experience nature. Dillard is exceptionally descriptive and provides for an entertaining look at nature. She notices the things that are unnoticable to others, and makes you want to go experience it for yourself. Pilgrim at Some Creek."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pilgram at Tinker Creek","review":"I am a junior AP student in Athens, TN. After just finshing Annie Dillard's Pilgram at Tinker Creek, I am pleasently shocked. Dillard beautiflly writes of the horrors and joys of nature; this is done at times by compairing vastly different subjects. An example occurs on the first page of the book, \\"And some mornings I'd wake in daylight to find my body covered with paw prints in blood; I looked as though I'd been painted with roses.\\" The comparison of blood and roses truly creates an interesting begining to her novel. Dillard continues the book with persise blends of humor, fact, and personal experience. Her religous allusions and scientific data keep the reader interpreting the book's worth and meaningon a personal level. Dillard has certainly written a book that is highly individual and a worthwhile, meaningful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Sleep? Don't have ambien?

The author has a fluid prose style but goes on too long on a few original ideas as if she is showing to us half-wits how pretty she can write.I did find some incidents interesting. For example, her ruminations on hiking in her local environs. But certainly a few pages would be sufficient to describe this and her thoughts. Dillard just can't seem to say anything without examining its every nuance and tiring the reader.In short, I don't particularly like or dislike this book, but I expected more from its reputation. Save this book for later, is my recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's no Walden.....","review":"After reading Walden for my AP English class, I personally never wanted to look at nature again, so I was not looking forward to Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, especially since it was about nature. Ew. However, I was suprised to find it somewhat enjoyable. Compared to the 30 pages I read in Walden, I read just about all of Pilgrim, minus one and a half chapters (sorry, Mrs. Lane!). Dillard uses delicate, but edgy diction, many anecdotes, and so much imagery it was practically leaking onto my nice, dress code compliant shirt. I even came upon some humor in the book, which I always find to be a plus. But the best part of the book, I'd have to say, is that it is NOT Walden. Sure, that can be said of any book (other than Walden, I suppose), but I think that after reading Thoreau's take on nature, reading PaTC was like eating chocolate cake after eating a shoe. Or a woodchuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Spiritual Classic","review":"Though not represented as a Christian book, Annie Dillard is often quoted in Christian circles. Pilgrim at Tinker Creek is a modern spiritual classic of extraordinary insight and exquisite writing. You will either fall in love with this book or find it hard to wade through the detailed, almost laborious, descriptions that seem at times to meander randomly through the pages only in the end to be twined together in purpose and meaning. Her abstract thoughts and spiritual excursions tease the reader with questions of the meaning and purpose of a violent world that riddles its occupants with pain and suffering. In the end her questions find resolution in her own soul as she walks the banks of Tinker Creek in Virginia and comes to grips with the diametrical realities of a fallen world and of a loving God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well writtien with one shortcoming the book is about nothing","review":"Annie Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker Creek is a well written book. In fact it is beyond well written. The language and her use of similies and metaphors is profund. However the book does leave something to be desired. A subject. The book is about nothing. Every well written page essentially says the same thing, nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sara Bennett","review":"I read Pilgrim at Tinker Creek as part of an English assignment for AP English 3. We had already read Walden by Henry Throeau. I had already prepared myself for another not-quite-so-interesting book. As it turned out I enjoyed Annie Dillard much more than that. My favorite part of her writing is the wonderful desctiptions and diction. She kept her writing much more fresh and entertaining than Thhroeau did. She started each section with a capturing narrative and followed with her view. She was also not afraid to show the not as pretty side of nature. I would reccomend it to anyone with a decent vocabularly and a love of nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"I do wish I could write like that...","review":"I read Pilgrim at Tinker Creek (along with Island by Aldous Huxley) a few months ago when I was really searching through my soul. At the time I was really confused about life, this book didn't help much, but it was still amazing. I spend time in a cemetary near my house, and numerous times, I have tried to write about it in the style that Annie Dillard does, with sensitivity, grace, and subtle humor. As of now, I am reading my second book by Annie Dillard, Teaching a Stone to Talk, and it is wonderful. Read it slowly, chew it, digest it, let it soak in a while. It's great how she compares human nature to the lives of animals. I sometimes wish I could see Tinker Creek, I mean really SEE it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very well written but very long and tedious.","review":"I had very high hopes for this book but was disappointed. To be honest, I gave up after reading 30% of the book. The prose is wonderfully constructed and some of the descriptions of the natural wonders, both great and small, border on the poetic. I understand that this is a book about 'stopping to smell the roses' and seeing things in an entirely new way. But those copiously detailed descriptions of nature just go on and on and on and on ad infiitum. I knew that with this book story and plot and chacters are perhaps secondary, but there has to be something to connect the narrative and sustain interest, and I just found it lacking.I also hoped that this book would have more and better theological insights, but those that I noted were few and far between and not really moving. Perhaps the book gets better later on and I should have persevered, but time is precious and I just couldn't justify devoting the time needed to finish this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imitation","review":"For all of you Walden fans out there, this is the book for you! Though it does not go into as much detail as the ever famous author Henry David Thoreau, this book by Annie Dillard is a great immitation. Annie Dillard includes alot of detail, mostly about such miniscule things as preying mantis eggs and cats. The book is a great read for the people of the world who love to \\"see\\", being that Annie Dillard includes a whole chapter to just \\"seeing\\". The entire book, in my opinion, is about seeing. That is mostly what Annie Dillard describes: things she sees. For the nature lovers of the world, I advise you to buy this book, it would be a great read for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exhaustive and Mind-Numbing","review":"Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, a novel written by Annie Dillard, was not the most enjoyable piece of literature that I have ever read. The style and structure used by Dillard was advanced, and therefore a bit more challenging to read. This book compared to Walden, by Henry David Thoreau, although much more enjoyable. The story revolved around Tinker Creek, and every single organism that was in or around it. Dillard's similes and descriptions were nothing short of amazing. Her ever present telegraphic sentences seem to set the book off. The transiotions were better than most any author that I have read. However, I would not recommend this book to read unless you would like to punish your children with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Disappointment","review":"I too was forced to read this book for an AP English course. In fact, the only reason I finished reading the book was because it was required reading. Except for a few interesting stories and facts (emphasis on FEW), the book is incredibly boring. I live in an area similar to where the book is set, and I still found it uninteresting. A book only for hippies, environmentalists, and people looking to \\"find themselves\\". Save your money. There are a lot better books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Seinfeld of books","review":"Like the series on NBC, this book says nothing, and says it very well. However, Seinfeld has humor, and this has none. You will find yourself trying to analyze the book for hours, until you will come to the conclusion that it is smart because you don't get it, or that it is saying nothing, and taking a very long time to do so. Everyone I know has eventually come to the same conclusion, that this is nothing, and the only reason people claim to \\"get it\\" is because the words Pulitzer Prize are on the cover. Try to analyze this is you must, but just remember, if you do come up with something, you are misinterperting the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very tedious, slow moving book.","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever had the misfortune of reading. Annie Dillard manages to waste 250 pages talking about absolutely nothing. There is really no plot and no message to the reader. I would think that if she loved the enviornment so much that she wouldn't want to waste the paper it took to print this drawn out description of her lawn and stream. I would recommend it to anyone who is cold and wants paper to start a fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book for People with Big Brains","review":"The book P at Tc is a very complicated book. I do not suggest that you read it if you do not have time to think about life in general. The read is by far not easy at all. I do not suggest that anyone who is still trying to figure out who they are read it because the book is liable to confuse you even more. The book is good, however, I said earlier-it is an extremely hard read. our AP class read it and i know that my friends and I all stumbled through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"She flies her sentences like a kite.","review":"I enjoyed it immensely, even if its sentences are overwrought often to an annoying degree. I appreciate how she looks at the world in poetry: the world is a painting, and we are the poets charged with understanding it. The thing about Dillard is that in spite of the fact that her uber-emotive imagination stands in that place in her brain where my philosopher/mathematician stands in mine, she can still ask brilliant--even terrible--questions without all of the normal dillusions about what the alternative answers really are.There are downsides: the overdone sentences, the fact that not every chapter drove forward toward the point--or even manifested her goal. But one reads her and agrees, at the end of it, that yes, she earned that Pulitzer after all.And to all of the \\"bright AP English\\" students out there, for goodness sake put the book down and leave the book reviews alone. It just isn't for you. Pick it up again once you've lived some more of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Journy","review":"This is a great book, however it is not for everyone. This book is about the exploration of nature and understanding. Quite a few AP students dislike this book, and I believe the reason is being forced into complex exploration of your surroundings is asking for rejection. This book is more appealing to natural science majors, or the general curious.Annie Dillard writes with fearsome clarity and complexity. She does cover controversial ideas like, pristine beauty inter-tangled with violence within nature; some people might find that offensive.I personally think most people should read this book at some point in their lifetime, but only if they are willing and ready. If exploration, and inquisitiveness are your forte this book is for you. If this doesnt describe you don't read it, because you might find it confusing and not to the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"the daddy","review":"One of my favorite books ever, even with the ongoing story of the maltreated moth. I will read this book many times."},{"rating":"1","title":"very boring to the average reader","review":"I had to read this book for my English class, and I really didn't like it at all. Mostly cause there was no dialogue which made me lose interest quickly. I thought some of the facts were pretty good, but other than that, I wouldn't recommend it if you don't like the whole nature/animals thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST","review":"What kind of book is this? A description of some grass needles, a tree and a praying mantis. You can analyze all the hidden meanings you want, but where now does that get you? Don't waste the time or money, Pulitzer means not a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This book is a waste of time, nothing happens whatsoever. It only takes Dillard 250 pages to describe her hack yard, something I could do in probably a paragraph. In fact, I can summerize what the book is about in one word: Nothing. There are no characters, no plot, no action, nothing, just 250 pages of pure description. How does anyone stay away reading such a book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can Not STAND This Book","review":"This book is definantly suited for those who enjoy both abstract and natural literature. Personally, I despise both, so I did not enjoy this book.However, I did find her secular arguements pretty interesting. Other than that though, I'd give this book a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius!","review":"For all lovers and admirers of Henry David Thoreau, this book is a great revival and devlopment of the general love of nature that seems all too lacking in our society today. Dillard's prose is so unique, she is one of the very best! Every line reads like poetry, using eloquent words and uncovering deep epiphanies about life. It's a fresh look at nature and the philosophy of mankind in our place on this earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"great content, poor disk quality","review":"Babylon 5 is a great series with well-developed characters and plot - I heartily recommend it.

In the 2nd episode on the 2nd dvd there are several shots where subtitles appear out of nowhere. And in the 4th episode on the 2nd dvd, in the 'dogfight' scene, just as the dogfight is almost over... the dvd suddenly skips off to the FBI warning then the main menu. Guess it's not bad overall? Can't wait to see what's in store on the remaining 4 of the 6 dvd's.LOVE the show... but i think that the quality of the dvd's have really slipped for this 3rd season.

A voice that stresses the importance of LOVE. From the opening song, \\"Sofrimento\\", to \\"Querida Angola\\" he intertwines the various African and Latin rythms along w/ his feelings of love, pride, fear, shame, and passion for his homeland.

I had concerns about my knees hitting the seat, but there is plenty of room. My six foot tall husband also has no problem either. The bike is much easier to balance than with a rear mount seat. The only thing I don't like about the seat is the seat belt. It doesn't feel as secure as I would liike.

He always wants to go on the bike now!It is very easy to get the child in and out and you don't notice it while you are riding. It is very well designed. We get so many comments while we are out. Everyone wants to know where to get it from!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Check your handlebar stems first","review":"Despite al the research I did online the ibert did not fit correctly on either of our bikes. My mountainbike stem does not extend as shown in the instruction photos. I managed to install it on our beach cruiser but couldn't turn the handlebars more than a few degrees before it hit the side of the ibert. Because of the shape of the wide beach cruiser handlebars turning was dangerously limited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very inconvenient","review":"I had such high hopes for this child bike seat and it fell flat on it's face! I read all the reviews and it seemed great. In reality though, it is extremely awkward and very dangerous. I am a woman of average height and build (5'6\\" and 140 lbs). There is only 6\\" clearance between the child seat and my bicycle seat even with the child seat pushed all the way forward. This makes mounting the bicylce next to impossible. Also, my knees hit the child seat when pedaling, even when adjusting it as high as it will go. Please beware of child and parent safety before using this bike seat! I am returning it and starting my search over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe good for cruising","review":"If you intend to get any kind of decent workout, while riding around with your kid... do not pick this bike seat! I have six bikes. Due to clearance issues, this seat would only fit on one of the six. It will probably work with most cruiser bikes. The position of the seat forces you to pedal with your knees spread out, which is ok for a while, but gets uncomfortable after 10 minutes or so. The rear mounted seats are much better IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for taller bikers","review":"I loved the idea of the i-bert. Not available anywhere locally, I had to order it online and was thrilled to find it for a decent price on ebay. This turned to disappointment. I am 5'7\\" and I need to have my saddle on the lowest setting in order to safely ride with the ibert installed. Which makes it very uncomfortable to paddle and I am not able to use it for any kind of longer trips. Otherwise with the saddle at the correct height for me, it's almost even with the ibert and I am not able to get safely and quickly on and off the saddle, because there is not enough space between the ibert and the saddle when they are almost at the same height. If you are shorter, this might work for you, as your saddle would be at a low setting anyway. Maybe it's also the type of bike I have, but I am not going to get a different bike to accommodate a child's bike seat ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the iBert Seat","review":"My 19 month old loves this seat. It's very easy to install and it fits him perfectly. He is 26 lbs and 33 inches tall, and he still has room to grow with the seat. The only thing I don't like about this seat is the straps. They are hard to adjust and don't seem to fit him perfectly. But other than that it's a great buy. My husband has it on his bike and he's 6 foot tall and it doesn't bother him or hit his knees when he is riding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"We are extremely happy with our purchase. My husband is 6'1\\" and on the larger side and he is not hindered by this seat at all. Our 2 yr old loves it and says it is very comfy for him. Very stable, light weight, and easy to install and easy to get your child in and out of. Highly recommend!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bike seat!","review":"We purchased this bike seat after reading many reviews. My husband had it on his bike in 5 minutes and we could not believe how easy it was to put together. Our son is 13 months old and loves riding around town on the front of the bike. He has a great view, and it is easy to talk to him while riding. He even tilts his head back to get kisses- so cute! We get so many comments in the neighborhood, seeing a cute little boy on the front of a bike seems to make everyone smile. My husband is 6 feet tall, and he needs to ride with his knees out to the side a little to accommodate the bike seat. We have had so much fun riding around as a family, I highly recommend this iBert bike seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"So much fun!!! It's incredible how this seat changes your bike ride. With your child so close to you, it becomes more interactive for both parent and child. Easy to handle. Very cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for fun rides..","review":"My one year old LOVES to ride in this seat. It's great to have her in front where I can see her and she can see ahead. It's fun for easy rides with my six year old around the neighborhood. The only issue I have with the seat is it is not great for hills or times when you should lean forward / or stand to get momentum on your bike... but oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seat Didn't Fit Mountain Bike","review":"I am 5' 4\\" and have a Raleigh Women's Mountain bike that was not compatible with the iBert. When installed, my infant's legs were underneath the gear shifts, so I couldn't shift gears. I modified my handlebars to raise them, but that didn't make much difference. In addition, I could not ride without really bumping my knees (it was not a minor inconvenience). There was also no way to safely mount or dismount the bike because there wasn't enough clearance between the iBert and my seat. When coming to a stop, I couldn't put my feet on the ground and had to really lean to one side and balance on the toes of one foot. Too bad, I was really excited about this product. I think how well it works is 100% dependent on the adult's bike frame - and I have no doubt that if it did fit my frame, I would have given the product 4 stars. iBert should give some instruction as to frame sizes that are iBert compatible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great for smaller people","review":"We were pretty excited to try this device out. So we decided to buy a really nice commuter bike since this would not work on my wife's road bike.Unfortunately after installing this, we had to lower the seat post all the way down, and the ride is still not comfortable. The ibert is placed as far forward as it can be, and the saddle is placed as far back as possible. The problem is there's not a large enough gap between the saddle and the ibert if my wife needs to stop without tilting the bike a lot.We contacted the company, and they said that this was a problem for many smaller bikes. At the time of purchase (and now) there was no mention that this might be an issue on the web site.We might experiment a bit with this, but we may end up having to re-sell this, and purchase a rear-mounted bike seat. I think this product would be great on a larger bike, my child truly does love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for shorter women / men","review":"I love the idea of this seat but it does not work for shorter women or men. I am 5'3\\" and attached to my mountain bike. I only had a couple of inches between the back of the iBert seat and my seat. It was impossible to stop safely because there was no room between me and the seat. To stop, you would need to lean sideways on one leg and tilt the bike significantly.I had a male friend who is 5'7\\" and he had difficulty stopping for the same reason. Definitely make sure this seats your bike and your body frame before purchasing.I don't write reviews often but this seat offers limited compatibility for smaller frames."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ride on","review":"I'm 6'1\\" and ride a larger beach cruiser with the Ibert. I have no problem with peddling.Meaning I don't have to bow my knees around the the Ibert to peddle. I imagine it would be a problem if I had a smaller cruiser.I ride a jamis earth cuiser 21\\" I think. It's great being able to interact with him as opposed to having him hidden behind me. Bike feels well balanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This seat is awesome! I had a back seat for a while and it was just no fun. I couldn't talk to my daughter or see if she was okay. In the front she could talk to me and i could see everything she was doing. The seat doesn't get in the way for pedaling and was easy to take off. It does effect the weight for steering, but it doesn't take that much time to get use to it. The reason i gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because once the seat is removed the metal attachment for the seat is easy to whack your knees on."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no better bike seat","review":"You cannot go wrong with this bike seat for your kids. It makes your balance more stable. You can have an actual conversation with your child and, if you stop for Mexican food for lunch, your little one won't want to walk home. I only wish I had thought of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digging it","review":"I bought this over a year ago. And we use it about three times a week. Only thing I wish I could change is the harness. Many times I had to stop biking to slide it back on his shoulders. So it took me a while to get it right but now I don't have a problem. Still think the harness could be better.

I first installed it when my son was one and we logged many miles. He outgrew it just in time for his little sister to take his spot.It is durable, sturdy, and safe. Obviously, this isn't something to take to the trails with, but for pedaling around town it is unbeatable. It's a real head-turner!Make sure your bike fits yourself first! Most of the bad reviews seem to be written by people who are too small for their bikes to begin with. You should be able to put your feet on the ground while sitting on the seat. If you have to hop off the seat and straddle the frame to touch the ground, you need a shorter bike! Don't blame the iBert!Fantastic. It is such a bonding experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"not \\"one sizr fits all\\".","review":"I purchased the iBert seat yesterday. It will not fit on my 2007 Specialized Expedition Elite.

It is really safe and secure and allows us to interact while riding without my having to look backwards. Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bike seat","review":"My 1-year-old son loves this. He totally pitched a back-arching fit when I took him out the first time. Now he puts on his own helmet (I still fasten the strap)--and this from a kid who hates hats. It does interfere a tad with the gear shifts on my bike and, being 6'2\\", it also forces me to slightly widen my knees when pedaling. The primary fallout of that is I take hills in a lower gear. Overall, great product that is easy to install, solid, and that my son adores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"My 13 month old daughter LOVES this and so do I! It is easy to use, easy to install. She signs for bike and helmet twice a day at least. Some may think it throws you off balance, but not at all. My daughter even gets excited and bounces around and it is fine. I did have to move my gears around a bit, but it was no biggie."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't regret this purchase!!","review":"We love this product! We bought it for our 12-month old son as his first bike seat. And he lOVES it! It's great for him to ride without having to face daddy's back.

I thought having my child up front would be perfect, both for her to learn how it feels to ride a bike and to have close interaction. Unfortunately, it didn't fit my bike (a 2008 Giant Sedona). There wasn't enough clearance between the back of her seat and the front of mine. I felt very precarious every time I needed to stop and put my feet down. I'm a small person, but I needed at least another inch to feel like I could quickly and safely make a stop. I think the frame of my bike angles back more than others and it just put the seat too close. So disappointed! PS-This item was VERY easy to install. I did it myself in just minutes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FRONT RIDING BIKE SEAT","review":"HAVEN'T USED THIS YET, BUT IT WAS REALLY EASY TO INSTALL AND OUR SON SEEMS TO LIKE IT AS WE HAVE PUT HIM IN IT TO SEE HOW IT FITS, ETC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great European Style Seat","review":"We really like the i-Bert bike seat. My husband and I had been all over Europe and particularly in Amsterdam, the kids rode on the front in small \\"bucket-type\\" seats. Rather than spending $500 on a Chariot where the kid is stuck in the back, we opted for the i-Bert.My son, 10 months, really likes it.In Austin, we get mostly, \\"hey that's cool\\" comments around town. It's great for a commuter bike and 2-5 miles around town. I wouldn't go on a century ride with it. The only thing that keeps it from 5 stars is that on occasion, my husband, bangs his knees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knee-bashing disappointment","review":"I was very excited for the first use of the iBert, based on the benefits outlined by its front-of-bike design. But, my excitement quickly turned to great disappointment as my knees bang the bottom of the iBert on every pedal. I now have to choose between inefficient bow-legged riding, or a return of the item. I am 6'1 with long legs and perhaps that poses a problem for the design of this product. So, if you are an experienced and efficient biker and are looking to maintain your good body position, you may want to reconsider.Tim -- Denver, CO"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough clearance between my saddle and the iBert","review":"I looked at several other front mounted seats like the BoBike, Yepp Mini, and an old Hamax and it seemed like this one would work best with my bike (cross bike with threadless headset). But I have a smaller frame bike for my height (5'8\\") since like many women, I have a fairly short torso and longer legs - compared to male proportions. The seat mounted easily but when I tried to test ride it, I could not get on and off the bike - there was not enough space between my seat and the child seat. Not even close! Very disappointed. I finally got on but then my knees hit the iBert. The manufacturer should give a minimum distance needed between the stem and saddle so that those of us with smaller frames won't waste time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"The installation was easy (just be sure you have enough stem to your handle bars, about 1.25\\" is good). Lots of people look amazed as we ride by and we've had lots of great comments. I should have bought this immediately the first time I saw it in the store instead of waiting 3 months to buy it online. My son (19mo. old) loves the rides and he gets really excited when I ask him, \\"do you want to go for a bike ride?\\" He usually grabs my hand and drags me to the garage. Not much improvement could be made to make a more perfect child seat for your bike."},{"rating":"2","title":"iBert Safe-T Front Mounted Child Bicycle Seat","review":"I am very pleased with this product and purchase. I have never used any other type of child bicycle seat before, but the positive reviews I read about this product were all accurate. It was quite easy to install this seat on my mountain bike, and I felt confident that my 15 month old/20 lbs son was secure in the seat. My son enjoys the rides. I can easily mount my bike, get him strapped in while I am on my bike, and remove him from the seat and dismount my bike as well. I can ride well balanced. Other reviews did mention the issue of the straps not staying in place on the shoulders. That is true, but I don't find it to be too much of a hinderance. I am glad I bought this seat and it is worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Idea","review":"This seat is a wonderful alternative to the traditional pull behind or ride behind child carriers(we have both). My husband loves riding around the neighborhood with our 1 year old daughter on display, and of course she is beyond thrilled to ride up front with Daddy. That being said, I am a small person and this seat does not work for me. I am 5'3\\" and cannot even get on my bike with this seat in place. However, I believe that it is a worthy investment for our family in the Daddy/Daughter department...the smiles beaming from their faces says it all.BTW:When we want to do serious road or trail biking vs. neighborhood biking we use our pull behind child carrier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - easy to install, use and fun for the passenger!","review":"My husband had this seat installed in about 20 minutes, start to finish. The standard rear mount took him at least an hour. There were differences in the bike frame, but this one seemed much easier to install overall. Our son is very tall for his age (35\\" at 20 months) but he fit just fine. He loves holding onto the handlebars and pretending to steer. It was far more interactive for me - I could see what he was looking at and pointing out. This also contributed to increased safety - instead of feeling and then reacting to changes in balance, I could proactively anticipate balance changes simply by watching where he was looking. Getting him in and out was easier than the rear mount - just reach down while straddling the bike. The shipment arrived quickly and the company is very customer-oriented. Excellent product! Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Front Bike Seat","review":"We bought this bike seat for our \\"little\\" grandkids to go biking with us on bike trails in Illinois. We put it on a hybrid men's 26\\" bike which \\"grandpa\\" rode. Grandpa is an experienced road biker and triathlete who is 5'7\\". He felt it was easy to ride and handle (we had a 3year old -30lb grandson in the seat). However, when stopping the bike and standing over the bar, the space between the child seat and bike seat is rather tight. Both seats were pushed as far apart as possible. We are waiting to see how comfortable our 6'3\\" son is with his 9 mo. old son in the seat, when they try it out when they come to town. Overall we like the seat, it is comfortable and enjoyable for the child. We would recommend it, but definitely try it out first without a child in the seat, so you can get used to riding and stopping. Also, have the child wear a helmet for safety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will outgrow in length before weight","review":"I've been using the Ibert for two seasons. I love it. My son loves it. Unfortunately, he will be outgrowing the seat in length way before he will outgrow it in weight. He is almost 2 1/2, weighs 29 lbs, and is 37\\". His feet are already touching the ends of the seat. In hindsight, the BoBike Mini front mounted bike seat may have been a more long lasting option as the feet pegs are adjustable, even though the weight limit is less than the Ibert.I did have to install a riser on my mountain bike stem in order to get enough clearance under the seat for my legs. It is still a really tight squeeze getting on and off the bike if you have your seat adjusted for optimum performance/comfort (vs. with your feet touching the ground while seated).You do not feel the weight of the child and your steering is not affected. Pretty amazing, actually.I am female, 5'6\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it!","review":"I am so happy with this bike seat. Our little boy LOVES it! He really enjoys being on the front of the bike. I was worried about not being able to manipulate the bike with him on it as I am 5'4\\", 125 lbs, but it so easy to ride around. He is almost three now and 34 pounds! It almost feels as if there is nothing on the front of the bike. It was easy to install as well. You must be on the bike when putting your child in the seat or taking him/her out. I strongly encourage anyone on the fence to purchase this product. You won't be disappointed! Well worth the money! Enjoy your ride!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Seat, Old Model","review":"There were no specifications indicating the model, which ended up not being the current model (the current model is a 2010 to the present and I purchased this in April 2011). This model has a shorter leg length than the current model. Be sure to distinguish between the model being sold and the model you want. Your kids can stay in the seat longer if you get the current model. It is still a great product, but I am frustrated with Amazon for selling me an old model."},{"rating":"2","title":"My boy loves his bike rides!","review":"This seat installed pretty quickly but did require adjusting the front post of my trek bike slightly to give enough clearance for the install. It's easy to get my little guy (16 months) in and out and he LOVES going for bike rides with me now. Everytime we even pass the bike in the garage he gets excited and points to it. I do have to ride with my knees a little wider than I would naturally to avoid bumping my seat with my knees but it's not so much that it's uncomfortable for our casual bike rides. I would completely recommend this product to a friend and I think it makes bike rides more fun from the child's perspective versus an expensive bike trailer which takes up a lot of precious space in our garage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Was concerned that this bike seat looked very bare bones and wouldn't do the job but boy was I wrong! It is very secure, sturdy, and fits my tall 18-month old perfectly! She loved it and we are biking every day this Summer! I really like the front mount allowing me to hug her, touch her, speak to her, point things out, and listen to her babble and sing as we bike along. I did not feel ANY change in balance or weight shifting, did not have any problem with my legs hitting the seat or the baby's helmet hitting me, did not have any problems switching gears or braking, etc. All in all, this item works perfectly and feels very safe. I did a lot of research on the safety of toddler bike seats (front, back and ride along types) and highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVIN THE VIEW","review":"I bought this as an alternative to the bike trailer. I like that it is in front and gives my two year old a great view while we ride. I have a trek mountain bike; and I did have to make a few adjustments to my handle bars and gears in order to get the seat to fit comfortably on the bike. Overall it is a great seat! As long as you are familiar with making adjustments to your ride; your kiddo will love their ride :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I love this bike seat, it is very easy to install and remove. My 2 and 1/2 year old loves to go for bike rides in it. This bike seat works best with handlebars with a slight curve or handlebars that can be repositioned. Also, the longer the bicycle the easier it is to use this bike seat. The seat fits on my husbands mountain bike, but the straight handle bars make getting my child in and out a slight challenge. It fits our beach cruiser's and it works very well on my commuter bike. The only problem I have had with the bike seat is the safety straps, which fall off of my child's shoulder. I have to monitor her very carefully. Prior to using this bike seat I used a rear bike seat which was very nerve racking because my child would wiggle out of those safety straps, and I could not monitor her behavior. I have found that other cyclists, especially those without children, do not like the safety seat. They appear to believe that the seat is unsafe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great front mounted-seat","review":"A great seat, We love it, you don't feel the weight of your baby unlike rear seat. It looks like any kind of bike might fit. Our baby likes it, he's 22 months. It looks safer than a rear seat since you got full control of your kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"I bought the ibert few weeks ago and I am loving it! My daughter is 15 months, and she enjoys it a lot. I am not particularly athletic, I am 5'-7\\" and I have a hybrid bike. The ibert is easy to install. Easy to get the child in and out of it, and when you ride, you don't even notice the extra weight. I like the fact that my daughter is in the front because that provides better control of the bike than if she was in a rear seat. Also, I can see her through the mirror. The only problem is that she wants to manouver the bike and keeps trying to take my hands off the handles! This product is excellent. I would suggest the manufacturer to make the inserts for the strap in the back a little bit more close together, so the strap sits well on the child's shoulders."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Absolute BEST!","review":"Installed this product in two minutes...can't believe how easy it is! Put my 2 year old in it, and went for a bike ride 5 minutes after it was delivered to my house! This is absolutely the BEST bike seat...my 2 year old didn't want to get off the bike!

I use it almost every day with my daughter (who is a little over a year) on my cruiser bike. I really love that my daughter is right between my arms, and we can interact on our rides. I can see her waving and squealing with excitement during our rides. This seat rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing ....great item","review":"This is a very easy seat to put on. I had to raise the handle bars slightly, but the piece is easy to attach and easy to remove for when I am riding solo. I love that I am so close I can leave over and kiss my son. Easy to balance, as they said before. We are riding daily. This has been a great purchase.** I can see how it could be hard for long legged men. I occasionaly tap the seat with my knees. Probably have to raise it a little higher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get one: Front Mounted Bicycle Seat","review":"I highly recommend the IBert Safe-T Front Mounted Child seat. I was looking for an option that would allow me to transport two children. I initially tried a trailer but my son was a little long for it. I went with the tandem attachment for him. For my 2 year old daughter I decided on the front mount bike seat. At 6'4\\" I was concerned that I wouldn't have sufficient clearance but was pleasantly surprised to find that leg clearance was not an issue. Assembly was quick and my daughter LOVES it. There's sufficient space for her growth and the safety belts hold her securely in position. I do worry about bugs hitting her in the face as she yells, 'go faster daddy!\\" However, I make sure she dons her sun glasses and away we go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous bike seat!","review":"This bike seat is awesome!

Took seconds to hook up. Unfortunately, it was very hard to ride the bike after the seat was in place. I had to shimmy into place on the bike seat and my knees would hit the iBert as I pedaled. Made it very treacherous to stop and extricate yourself from under the iBert. Also didn't work for my wife. We have pretty standard path/pavement bikes--mine's a Raleigh C30 and hers a Giant--so I'm not sure how this seat works for others. It has been returned and we are happy with our cheapy rear-mounted child seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best little baby bike seat!!","review":"This little seat is worth taking the time to review! I looked at every bike seat out there and read every review I could get my hands on before we settled on the iBert. My baby is almost 9 months old and I've had the seat a couple of weeks. She loves it! She is small-average 8-9month size. It fits her. The low back on the seat allows her head to be above it so it doesn't push her helment forward when we are riding. She can reach the lap bar so she has something to hold onto. Super Super easy to install- took like 5 minutes- REALLY. I have a crusier bike, so I didn't have to worry about leg room. I am shorter, and was worried about keeping my balance with her on a bike, and it is barely noticable when she is on it with me. Doesn't affect the balance of the bike at all! She loves it and so do we!! It gives all 5 of us in the family the opportunity to get out on our bikes together. I would buy it again, hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"This seat is AMAZING! I bought this after doing a few hours worth of research, and decided on this seat because it was the only seat that had virtually no bad reviews.After using the seat over the past week every day, I am very happy to say that I love it and am very pleased with the purchase. The seat feels safe, riding the bike is still comfortable for mom (or dad), baby is happy and can see the sights, getting baby in and out is a breeze (little tricky with the handlebar, that's my only complaint-- wish the green lap bar clicked up into place), and it is so easy to take on and off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive but worth it!","review":"My husband was skeptical at first but my daughter (19mo) loves it. We are able to talk and point at everything for a much closer experience. It does take getting used to, but I feel very comfortable on it now. The only problem I have is that the cushion won't stay on with the small plastic pins supplied. Other than that, we have had a ball with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this seat!","review":"It installed in under 5 minutes. I was worried that it would make steering difficult but I didn't even know it was there. My 14 month old weighs 20 lbs and fit perfectly. She had the best time riding up front and pointing at everything. This was a great investment and will be used a lot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great carrier but no head support","review":"I loved it for my 1 year old son, but he loves the motion so much that he fall asleep after half an hour. I have to use my left hand to hold his head while I am biking. Overall, it is a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wobbly, doesn't fit some bikes and has no head support for child","review":"We really liked the concept of this seat, but it just didn't work out. For one, our bike's stem could not be raised the required 3/4 inches, so I had to move the handlebars slightly off the top of the stem. The people at our local bike shop found this terrifying.The seat wobbles and rattles a bit. It seems secure, but the feeling is unnerving. I emailed ibert and they said some people had put duct tape in to stabilize it, but why wouldn't they fix this themselves?Aside from the difficulty of getting on the bike with so little space between the child's seat and yours, the biggest reason we ended up returning it is because there's NO support for the child's head when they fall asleep. Our daughter would last about 15 minutes before she fell asleep, then it was difficult to support her head and ride at the same time.All the bike shops I went to thought that these front seats were a bad idea and now I see why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough clearence","review":"I have the same issue that the other one star reviewers have.While the seat seems promising, there just isn't enough clearance between the back of the seat and the bike seat if the bike seat is adjusted correctly. If you're seat is adjusted correctly you should not be able to put your feet flat on the ground while sitting on the seat. This makes it very difficult to ride with the child seat installed. You either need to lower the bike seat or lean considerably when stopped.For those who like to have their bike seat very low, this seat seems like it would be a lot of fun. It is very sturdy and easy to install. However, it is almost impossible to have the bike adjusted for an adult rider and have the seat installed correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of a kind","review":"Think this gets more head turns then my wife's pink bike. Very european style of seat but...our child loves it! He becomes part of the trip in this one as he can see everything we are doing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Our 18 month old daughter loves this. It feels totally safe and fits our bike perfectly. The only thing about front bike seats in general is if your a short person, seeing over the helmet might be hard. or a tall person might have to open knees wider to keep from hitting them on the seat. Im 5'5 and it was perfect though. i would and do recommend this product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Has postives and negatives","review":"This bike seat is unique.Positives:it does not interfere with steering, and my 30 pound toddler LOVES the ride.Negatives:I am 5'8 and on a Iron Horse and Columbia men's style bike the I-Bert is not usable unless the seat is dropped all the way to the frame. If the seat is raised one is unable to maneuver and getting on and off the bike is nearly impossible.The compromise of dropping the seat cured any issues, and riding has not been a problem hills are a little more difficult however.So far this a a good alternative to the trailer and rear sitting seats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seat even if your are short!","review":"I read many reviews about this seat, other seats and even trailers. I decided to purchase this seat based on reviews and the information provided at the ibert web site. My 5 1/2 month rode in it for the first time this past weekend. He weighs about 17 pounds, and absolutely loved it. He complained anytime I stopped, or if I went over large bumps. He has much room to grow in it. I purchased a hybrid woman's comfort bike at the same time. I am only 5'1\\", and it works great for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"Got this for my husband for Father's Day! He loved it and our daughter is having a blast on it. Its very secure and she looks super comfortable. Only thing is with my husband's gear shifter makes her slipping into the seat a little difficult, but we manage. We've taken her around almost every evening and she just loves the wind blowing in her hair..and looking up at her dad. I'm glad I spent the extra money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for both parents and toddlers","review":"I bought the iBert Safety Seat from Amazon (much cheaper than at the actual iBert site) as a Father's Day gift for my husband. He installed it in literally 5 minutes but he had to raise the bike's handle bar to fit the seat properly. My 15 month old ABSOLUTELY loves sitting in the front of the bike! The strap is a little hard to adjust but we learned to put it on first before putting on her helmet. I would definately recommend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad.","review":"This product was difficult to use. I did not feel that I had the control I needed to have while riding with my daughter. I would not use this product again as I do not feel it is safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as great as everyone else said","review":"I read many reviews before buying the Ibert. I am not a tall person at 5'9, but my knees do hit the seat. I do not feel comfortable riding with my child on a busy road due to the hitting of the knees. Also, getting off your bike seat quickly could end disasterously as well. The Ibert takes up some space, so you may hit yourself if you quickly had to jump off your seat. The Ibert seat did not work on my husband's bike because the front post was too big, so you could not turn the handle bars at all with the seat attached. For my bike, we had to worry about the brake lines and the seat resting on them. I was quite excited to use this with my child riding in front so she could experience the world going by. But it has yet to be used in our house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but....","review":"When we first got this it was alot of fun. The kids love being in front. The problems I had with it was that the kids legs are right up against the handle bars (we have mountain bikes). This also made it hard to get the kids in and out. Also, our kids are fairly tall, and the legs of the seat don't go too far down, so they out grew it very fast. Our kids are also very thin...but if they were bigger, I can't imagine them fitting in this too comfortably. Also, wehen they fall asleep, there's no head rest, so their heads would kind of flop around. At one point, I had to take one hand to support my son's head.I'm not going to go through the safety pros and cons of having them up front versus the back. I think in the end it's your personal comfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST Read","review":"This book is a must read for any dog lover. The stories are heartfelt and tug at the emotions.

He answers questions like \\"Was that a real joint you were smoking,\\" \\"Did you take steroids,\\" and \\"Did you really miss your own father's funeral\\".

It shows the world of bodybuilding before it became the steroid-fueled, freak-show it is today.Despite the fact that the bodybuilders used steroids back then (which were legal and Arnold admits to in the special features), they had not gone down the road of no return that has created the bloated 5'2\\", 300 pounders we have today that look like crap.Buy this DVD for the great training sequences, the mind-games of Arnold, and the underground training of Lou Ferrigno.The special features (including a Cinemax documentary on the making of the film, an interview with Arnold, and a retrospective on the participants) are fantastic, as well.All in all, a great DVD.

I'm not sure if he's looked at it, I think he said he remembered seeing it when it first came out in the VHS tape format. I plan on looking at it sometime in the future and I decided to purchase it because from time to time, I heard references about it in various media arenas and more recently I was looking at my husband's muscle mag and there was an article about both guys where reference again was made about them in Pumping Iron so I was curious and the price was right!

Arnold is highly entertaining especially when he is playing with Franco Columbu or messing with Lou Ferrigno's head before the big Mr. Olympia showdown.Ferrigno is shown as the up and comer who is pushed repeatedly by his domineering father. He comes to train for the contest in total awe of Arnold, which makes his father mad and makes him push Lou harder.We also see a very touching scene as the fourth place finisher of the Mr. Universe contest has to deal with disappointment and then listen as his friend is crowned Mr. Universe. He then talks about what must be going through his friend's mind and that he should go out and shake his hand out of courtesy.Those familar with today's sport would say that these guys were obviously using steroids or some other body enhancing drug but that type of thing is never even hinted at."},{"rating":"2","title":"bodybuilding knowledge","review":"This documentary gives a background on Arnold and focuses on his, and others, training for what will be is final competition."},{"rating":"2","title":"PUMP","review":"I LOVE ARNOLD!!

I am going to write that anyone who weight trains, a few days a week as a hobby to split training 6 days a week as a job, this movie is a must have. After watching a few minutes of some of the greatest, most well known bodybuilders of the 70's, you will want to literally pull your car out of its parking spot (like Franco Columbu in this movie) and head straight for the gym. On those \\"lazy\\" days that everyone has, when I don't really \\"feel\\" like going to the gym or giving it my all, I throw this in and slap the lazy out of myself.This is a great documentary about the sport and the personalities that helped make it.

After trying all the typical remedies (stretching, proper hydration, starting out slow to warm up the muscles...the combination of which worked worked to an extent), I decided to try the Kinesio tape on a friend's recommendation. I'm not gonna say 'miracle cure', but it certainly helped to a degree I definitely did not expect from what appears to be simple athletic tape with a wavy texture on the adhesive side.

I wrap this multi-dimension stretchable tape beginning below my knee on the outside and wrap it around and up the inside. I round off the corners of each end to prevent the corners from curling up prematurely and, of course, it helps to shave first. This has helped me so much that I no longer wear knee braces when doing exercise or anytime that I would have thought I needed it. I wear it 24/7 as it is waterproof and after several days, usually 3 or so, the ends and edges begin to peel and so I pull it off and put on a new piece. My knee braces were hot and bugged my skin and cut off circulation, this tape does none of that and yet relieves pain, holds ligaments where they need to be sort of, and constantly pulls in both directions like a massage."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"i have used k tape before this is the real thing great price. the stuff is amazing. use it all the time for soreness. watch the you tube vids to learn how. or just trial and error."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak tape","review":"I bought this item hoping it would work for my knee ...did not have the sticking strength it needed to hold..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing product!","review":"I use this Kinesio Text Tape on my neck to help support my SCM muscles.

It starts to roll at the edges. Also, if you are allergic to adhesives or latex, be careful. I got a very bad rash from it and the adhesive is very difficult to remove from your skin. You also need to know the proper way to apply the tape for your particular injury or it doesn't do you any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me","review":"I bought this product to alleviate some IT Band issues I was having. My physical therapist taught me how to apply the tape and sent me on my way. I have never been able to get this product to stick for more than an hour or so. I have followed the instructions for skin prep, but as soon as I sweat the edges start to come off. This has happened with all 5 attempts I have made at using the tape whether running, cycling, or CrossFit. People swear by this stuff, but it really didn't work for me. I don't sweat any more than the average person, but perhaps I need to the super waterproof type?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for me","review":"There is a certain amount of controversy about whether or not therapeutic taping actually does anything. I am no scientist, but I use it on my fallen arches, shin splints, and knees when they ail me and its worked quite well to alleviate the pain. Is it the placebo effect? I can't be certain, but it helped me and many others when it was applied correctly. My only problem is that it's advertised to stay on for days, when in reality (At least for me) it only stays on a day at most on shaved, clean legs. Your mileage may vary, but it's worth a try, especially if you have reoccurring injuries but would still like to exercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinesio Tex Gold","review":"This tape is one of the greatest inventions I've found for athletes who suffer from overuse injuries.

It has some activator that is overkill for someone like myself.Aside from wasting a few dollars and some time, I do not think the damage was permanent, but it surely was unexpected and unwelcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tape doesn't stick","review":"I bought this tape because I like variety -- colors. In all respects it appears just like the tape my PT uses. However, it doesn't stick. It falls off in water and rolls off in bed sheets. It is truly a waste of money.

If you put it on exactly as the videos say, it still comes off. I have tried EVERYTHING to get it to stay on. Short of wearing an ace wrap over the tape so that friction is not a factor, I have no idea how to get it to stay on. In reading about the tape it sounds like it can be worn 4-5 days with all levels of activity including showering...this is simply not true. Personally, I find it a complete waste of money when using it for the purpose I bought it.

The characters were also unbelievable because I have two sisters and believe me if either one of them ever was a sour apple like the older sister in this book I would definitely have to set them straight. And the younger sister was just too sweet and too tolerant.Like I said, I normally enjoy Mrs. Oke's books, so don't think I'm coming down too hard on her.

A lighthearted comedy about an insurance salesman (Arkin) who unwittingly gets caught up in a scheme by Falk and his wife, played by Beverly D'Angelo. Many twists and turns in this classic! You will long remember the highway scene, the nose reconstruction, the drink, the kidnapping, the drugstore, the train, the homeless man, the adjuster. 4.9 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bow wow","review":"Don't be fooled by the big name cast, script writer, and director. This film is a dog. A complete dog. The story is wholly unbelievable, the laughs are few and far between, and the overall production makes one wonder about the sobriety of all concerned. It isn't a screwball; it isn't black comedy; it isn't much of anything. Arkin has never made anything this bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cassavetes fans, don't bother.","review":"This film, as far as I know, is the \\"real\\" last film Cassavetes directed -- not LOVE STREAMS, alas, though that makes a much more fitting final movie. Cassavetes was probably trying to generate funding for a film biography of Django Rheinhardt he was preparing to make (which, of course, he never did get to); either that or he was doing a favor for his friend Peter Falk. In any case, the film has NO bearing on Cassavetes other work. You'll see no sign of his touch at any point, and little sign that he particularly cared about the project. It plays through as a mediocre commercial comedy, poorly written and not very funny. It's professionally done -- but that's about it. Don't even be curious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I saw this move for free at a preview before it was released and I was angry that I wasted 90 minutes on this trash.

The master film should be burned so that nobody could make the mistake of airing it in public ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"black specks","review":"This onion powder when mixed with a small amount of water contains many small black specks that under magnification look like animal waste.

It could cause disease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes a little like chalk","review":"I was really not impressed with this. It doesn't have much flavor to it, onion or otherwise. It has a tendency to clump, so if I'm adding it to a soup or something I end up with little onion powder balls throughout. I've never had that problem before. It just doesn't taste right."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can smell the onion!","review":"Last time I bought a jar of onion powder, I couldn't smell anything at all.

Directions says to make a slurry","review":"Not impressed with the flavor.There are others with much better flavor.The grind is very very small.It may be okay for soups and stews but too powdery for sprinkling onto anything solid like a rub.In fact the directions says to mix with the broth of what you plan on adding it to first.I will probably use what I have for a brining solution for pork and chicken, along with salt and sugar."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best onion powder","review":"This onion powder is a very fine (tiny particles) powder - much more fine than most brands. It is not just for mixing into sauces or meats - which is does well. It sticks very well to dry foods such as chips, and is really great when lightly sprinkled onto potatoes (fries, hash browns, tater tots, etc). Great for grilling also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edwards and ecumenism","review":"Morimoto analyses Edwards \\"catholic\\" soteriology and shows it to be consistent with the thinking of the great Reformers. The study highlights the compatibility between at least some reformation traditions and the doctrines of Trent on justification. He is successful in showing that much of the disagreement between Reformation teaching and Tridentine Catholicism are differences in the way words are used to describe a shared understanding. These differences became hardened into theological systems that until recently have seemed to both sides to be incompatible.Anyone interested in ecumenism grounded in the common search for the truth will find this book very useful and enlightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stained Glass?

I wear it on a daily basis. Some of the finish has worn off to reveal the silver underneath, but that is ok. I wear it with my platinum and diamond art deco wedding ring. It is a fantastic match. It is very thin in size so it looks best with another ring along side. No one ever questions that it is not real or vintage. Would purchase again if I ever lost the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying","review":"Dead bodies are inexplicable moving around the London area, and Scotland Yard is on the case.Mixing mystery with science, the book ultimately leaves much unexplained. It makes use of the statistical analysis and the scientific method in the earlier chapters. Then intuition, and latching onto the 'possible but unlikely' in the later chapters. The moral is 'some events don't have a conventionally scientific explanation, but life goes on'.An unsatisfying novel which takes great mental energy as the reader attempts to use the multitude of details to puzzle out the case. The book is dense and rich in minutiae, for example pages 151-155 are a single paragraph.Only read if you love both mysteries and unexplained phenomena, want something different, and don't mind half-hearted resolutions. Reminded me of reading Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"House of the Seven Gables\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid science fiction detective story.","review":"Lem was one of the most imaginative science fiction writers ever. He was the most widely read sci-fi authors in Europe. Lem was a doctor who wrote more as a past time, (like William Carlos Williams). Some of Tarkovsky's great films were taken from Lem's stories - Stalker, Solaris, (NOT that American abomination), to name two. The Investigation takes place in and around London, and concerns rather bizarre happenings, bordering on the supernatural, at area morgues. Detective Gregory of Scotland Yard is assigned to solve the mystery.This is not a very long book, but very well worthwhile a mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"A whimsical delight by a creative author.","review":"Not only was this book truly delightful but as the parent of a Child with Tuberous Sclerosis, my child benefits not only from Mr. Liput's creativity but from his generousity as well.

I got the distinct feeling that the author wrote a book about sales automation ROI, and then substituted \\"CRM\\" for the words \\"sales automation\\" after the fact. Anyone who actually works in the CRM field for a business will know more than this author does about CRM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"Now I know why calculating ROI for CRM initiatives is so difficult - people try to do it after reading this book! All this contains is a repackaging of some basic finance & statistics topics. If you know anything about NPV calculations, cash flow analysis and probability you've already got everything contained in the book. Additionally, the text is laborious to read. There seems to be no thought in terms of flow from one topic to the next and the author can't seem to remember if he's writing about CRM or simply sales force automation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book if you want to fall asleep!","review":"The author repeats himself over and over and over again. It sure cured my insomnia though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be allright in its proper place","review":"The blurb says \\"The essential buyer's guide for the DIY or trade renovator, woodworker and student\\" and this is fairly accurate, although the \\"essential\\" will only be true for a limited group of users. This booklet is a pocket guide bringing together basic terms and names: information offered is quite limited, mostly just enough for a quick check on the basics.This is quite a modest booklet, illustrated with a few black & white photographs and a few drawings. I have been given free booklets for promotional purposes that looked better than this, and thirty dollars is wildly overpriced. The claim that this is \\"the most comprehesive guide to the Australian retail timber market\\" is incomprehensible, since this book reaches only to kneeheight when compared to the book by Keith R. Bootle.Still, a pretty decent booklet, that might be quite useful in the right dashboard compartment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Set!","review":"See my review under Volume 2 of this set.

Tamia is the real deal. She has one of the most beautiful voices in the R&B game. When I first heard this album, I thought it was hot, then I had to listen to it again, and I realized that this was a classic. She was hitting notes so perfectually. The CD's off the hook.

Billed as \\"historical novel,\\" these words rely on name dropping of only two historical figures as very minor characters in this story.Missing a great opportunity to tell of dangers and adventures (geographic, social and political) faced by pioneers traversing the Oregon Trail, the author studiously avoided anything exciting and/or intellectual.Stuffed with comic-book cliches, and romances with predictable misunderstandings and resolutions the reader is caused to discard this writing as the work of a frustrated student of English 101 who prays the prof. will at least count the number of words as worthy of a \\"C\\".This is a real page-burner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative, Fun Book","review":"Bare Essence is one of my favorite books because it's both extremely well written and entertaining. All of Meredith Rich's books are this way, but this is the first one that I read, and I love all the characters. I love the heroine, Tiger, a young woman just finding herself and creating her life in the midst of a fascinating scenario involving lots of intrigue and drama. I also love the settings because they truly capture the corporate drama of the perfume industry in a page-turning way that makes the book hard to put down once you start reading it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what you might expect.","review":"The overall impressions of other reviewers seemed to be that the quality of this product was better than the cost would indicate. I have to disagree. The silver beads are of a similar or lower quality than those found in any old bead shop. The ruby beads are very milky and have little character. The feel in the hand is stiff and cheap. Overall, it feels like a $5 piece of junk store jewelry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I own this necklace, it is beautiful.

Can't believe the price for it has shot up.Must Buy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much \\"merde\\" and \\"Gott in Himmell\\"","review":"The premise of this book sounded so wonderful that I immediately snapped it up. However, Janes's writing talents--in plot, character, dialogue and sheer command of language--are sadly lacking. The French surete repeats \\"merde\\" at least 100 times thru the book, with the Gestapo agent keeping up with dozens of \\"Gott im Himmel.\\" Amazingly enough, the sheer repetition of these two exclamations drag down the entire book, defusing all suspense and any plot build-up. As one with an avid interest in prehistory, I found the insipid descriptions of cave paintings, as well as their use thereof in the plot, dampening and dispiriting. The characters of St-Cyr and Kohler (the two main characters of the book) are ill-drawn and flat; the author of the book seems to rely primarily upon the sheer interest of the premise to make his mystery at all interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring disappointment","review":"Having an interest in mystery novels set in Nazi Germany and Nazi-occupied countries (i.e. Pavel Kohout's THE WIDOW KILLER, or Philip Kerr's BERLIN NOIR) I looked forward to reading some of J. Robert Janes works. After several attempts to read more than a few pages of STONEKILLER each evening, I gave up and started skipping pages hoping the story would take on some zest. The author was determined to murder his own plot by continually revisiting the crime scenario and making lame attempts to draw every character under suspicion. Finally, I was interested only in finishing the book to get it over with, I skipped to the end and read the last 5 pages. I should not have bothered. I so am annoyed at having wasted my time on this book, I want to e-mail the author and ask him for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"so confusing,and so off","review":"I purchased this book because Tony Robbins, 'The body you deserve\\" suggested it.

I like the bulk roll because it last a long time. The only downside to this tape is the adhesive on the back sometimes doesn't adhere to people with hairy skin.

Irene is a survivor of sorts who is easy to admire. She clearly loves her boys Ben and Jason, finds another job cleaning houses when the grocery store fires her (\\"I was fast because I was high, but when I came clean I slowed down.\\"), and even checks herself into rehab. But she leaves rehab early, spends her kid's birthday check on crack, and leaves her dead beat husband for a recovering addict named Bob. Their emerging love devolves into relapse, co-dependence, and new spasms of self-destructive choices. Writer-director Debra Granik also won a Sundance Director's Award for this film. Befitting the despair and depth of Irene's problems, the entire film takes place in the dead of winter, and at the film's end the plot remains open and unresolved. Rated R for drug use and some nudity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vera is great in a well made movie.","review":"It seems to me that addiction, in the media, is usually portrayed unrealistically in one way or another. Either addicts are vilified, or portrayed as helpless victims, or are perhaps portrayed in some other extreme way. This movie provides what appears to be a very realistic version of what addiction is like on a day to day basis for real people. Vera Farmiga is the center of the movie, and the story, while there are other important characters, revolves around her character's journey away from drugs. Nothing is sensationalized. Nothing is blown out of proportion. If you are looking for excitement and thrills, this is not the movie for you. If you're looking for something down-to-earth, engrossing and, really, educational - done in a manner that makes you actually CARE about the characters, this may be what you're looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie","review":"This movie was very realistic.

Attaching the bins to a base (in my case a piece of plywood), mounting the base to the wall, sticking on the lables and then sorting the correct bolts and nuts into the bins took two to three hours to accomplish. After everything is in you'll probably want to take a trip to your hardware store and stock up on some of the more frequent use items - for me the 6mm and 8mm. There is nothing worse than breaking off a project and making a home depot run because you dont have the right bolt/nut so for me these storage aids are a great deal. I'm giving this a four star because of no instructions and maybe a bit skimpy on 6mm and 8mm hardware but this is really no big deal for most buyers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"Unlike the last reviewer I was lucky enough to get all the parts in my shipment.

My wife and I do all our own building and renovations and this little 12 volt is great for a multitude of construction jobs because it is light and compact. I especially like it for drywall because of its size and the fact that it has a belt clip. My first one has seen a lot of use in the four years I have had it and the battery packs are still well over 50 percent. More that I can say for some other cordless drills I have had. Keep in mind that it is a 12 volt and as such is limited in the jobs it is designed for. I have stronger drills for the big jobs.

I take care of my tools exceptionally well; I don't drop them, mistreat them or abuse them. A spare can quite often be 1200 feet below and the effort needed to achieve work position necessitates the minimum load during tower acsention. The problem with Hitachi drill is the way the battery is locked in the place. Two very small tabs along side the batteries break very easy during insertion. The broken tabs allow the battery to fall loose from the tool endangering anyone or anything beneath the work area, be it 3 feet or 1200 feet. Anything impacted by the falling battery is subject to injury or damage.

She with her many awards, does not only deserve to be a well known pianist, but also one of the few artists, who truely give new breaths to those classical masterpieces. These recordings are very good, if you think that Biret is considered to be one of the outleading Chopin artists of the century. You can find energy, sense of humour, dynamism, personality and creativity in her playing. She certainly bewilders the audience, who for the first time listens to her.

There are so many features to play with and he loves them all. I've read some reviews that complain about the loudness of the toy. We just put some duct tape over the speaker which seems to tone it down a bit. It would be nice if it had an on/off switch or volume control like so many other toys. The other issue that I have is that now some of the features are beginning not to work. The bubble blower is no longer functioning, which is such a fun feature. I tried to replace the batteries and then nothing would work. So I put the old batteries back in, and today the part that plays the \\"winnie the pooh\\" song is not working either.

Be warned, though the history is presented as short stories and personal accounts, the editing is somewhat suspect. Names and dates between books are prone to typos.

I enjoy the thorough warm-up and often just used it on its own to warm-up for other activities. But from there the video goes downhill. The aerobics are speeded-up low impact and I found them to be jarring and poorly transitioned. The toning section is better but after doing the Firm and others, it was quite a bore to me.

The steps change too often and without adequate warning, it goes unnecessarily in too many directions, and it's so dark you can hardly see what they're doing. I really like the general feel of the video and the intensity is great. If you're patient enough, you could try doing this one a few times and learning the routine to where you don't have to rely on cues. If you did, I'm sure you'd get a very nice workout.

They draw on blues and jazz harmonies that wouldn't be heard until 100+ years after the composition of these concertos! I found them quite off-putting at first, but have warmed to them after subsequent hearings. Haydn was always the musical jokester, and loved to surprise his audiences; if he were alive today, he might get a kick out of this recording.Cadenzas aside, these are very good performances. They are warm, never stiff, and the musicians sound like they are having a great time. The Haydn C concerto is particularly inspired. Only 4 stars though - partly because the soloist's tone gets a bit squeaky on a few occasions, but mostly because Boccherini simply is not a composer on the same level as Haydn.

It has a beautiful ring to it that hooks you-- along with the rest of the album's songs.I'd reccomend this album if you like Bowie, Blur, or Pulp.

Be warned -- Mr. Fisher seems to have been a bitter man when these records were made (one cut is an urgent plea to never have to play or sing or, for that matter, hear \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\" ever again.

Both of these are good pieces, and are played acceptably well on this album, but that's where the good stops. It will cost extra money to buy other albums that have good recordings of Russlan and Ludmilla (my 2nd favorite overture of all time) and the Russian Easter Overture, but it's worth the money.

There is a real Baroque spirit, although Mozart is warmer and blither than his master, and the German Wind Soloists seem to get (and give) as much pleasure out of playing the piece as any jazz improvisors, or a seaside brass band.This is not to say Mozart doesn't exploit the characteristic wistfulness of the wind instruments: his Adagio and Romance hauntingly evoke the Romance of 'Einekleinenachtmusik', while the closing Rondo, though rich and exhilirating, has a sleepy, old-world melancholy reminiscent of the the theme music for 'Mapp and Lucia'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin Material, Low Quality","review":"For the price, I did not expect thick, luxurious bath towels.

It's hard for someone starting out to learn so many dances at one time, even if one only learns the basic step.

This dvd has apparently come from a film copy in which the scenes, depicting how Stevenson finally overcomes the ghosts of his past and comes to accept a brighter future, have ben deleted. By removing these scenes the film really loses most of its best qualities.The Yul Brynner character was not in the original book but takes the place of two other people in the story.

As a bonus, it holds a charge for a long time, although to be fair, I keep mine charging all the time.It will lose it's suction as you use it over a period of weeks.

But it can be washed very quickly it's not a big deal, and it's nice to know that it's strong enough to pick up dust.No, it won't replace your normal vacuum. It lacks a brush/beater to clean rugs.

Cleaning it after using it is more of a chore than I expected. The filter has to be cleaned well and then even washed; letting the filter go uncleaned will reduce the power of the vacuum's suction. It is powerful and I had no trouble picking up almost anything that you would pick up with a normal vacuum. The battery power lasted long enough for doing small jobs well.

Wall mounting, easy to charge. Nice attachments.The bad: Ni-Cd batteries. This technology is like 30 years old. They use it because they know the product will die after about 6 months. These companies should be shut down for destroying the environment. You might say, well just buy one with a Li-Ion battery...good luck, Hoover makes one for $150. Dyson makes one for $250. Neither mount on the wall. The Hoover has all kinds of suction problems...so you are FORCED to purchase something like this.

No need for replacing bags as with my regular vacuum. The cordless is a must! I wouldn't have known to get the more powerful hand vac except that my daughter had purchased this one and really liked it. In looking at what is available, there are a number of models with less volts, but I think it's well worth it to spend a little more and get the 15.6 volt Dustbuster. I paid $49.00 with free shipping after looking around at various sites. My daughter indicated she remembered getting hers for $39.00, but I'm sure she probably paid for shipping.

It is a very extensive text suitable for classroom instruction; however, it is very lengthy, uses odd notations and spellings that can mis-inform new students who do not have benefit of an instructor, and the book is both hard to find and very expensive to purchase.

These Tex Ritter Grand National B westerns are about average for poverty row oaters but \\"Arizona Days\\" is missing the middle 15 minutes or so (probably one complete 35mm reel). There is an abrupt cut 20 minutes into the film that makes you say \\"Huh?\\". Running time is 42 minutes instead of claimed 57 minutes on packaging. The print is also horribly out of focus and splicy and looks like it was sourced from a VHS tape at EP speed. Maybe it's best those 15 minutes are missing. I don't know if my eyes could have taken 57 minutes of such poor quality video! \\"Trouble in Texas\\" is complete at 63 minutes and the print is barely passable. Young, beautiful Rita Hayworth (billed as Rita Cansino) is the highlight of this one. Lots of stock rodeo footage pads what little plot there is.

Trouble in Texas is better than Arizona Days which looks like it was taken from a VHS copy. Arizona Days is fuzzy and there are missing frames plus occassional out-of-sync audio. Trouble in Texas is sharper focus and appears to be from a 16mm print.While you can purchase this disc for $1.00 at Walgreen's and other chain stores, it is only worth buying if you want to watch Trouble in Texas. My low rating is not a reflection of the films but this release of such."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"The title implies a solution to the very practical problem faced by many of us in trying to quantify the effects (ROI among them) of marketing communications. The authors affirm that it is impossible to disentangle the effects of all communications (ads) by the firm and its competitors, not to mention all other contacts customers have with the firm. That I knew.Finally one comes to the grand spreadsheet for solving the riddle.

Overall very impressive and a must read for anyone involved in sales, advertising or marketing functions. Another book I highly recommended is 60-Minute Brand Strategist by Idris Mootee. This book is LOADED with super solid, meaty real world branding insights and techniques that can are being kept as trade secrets. You will probably find this book a real eye opener.

For me, this isn't it. I felt that their synopsis claims were not entirely honest: not only is this book based entirely on a proprietary operating system, but the learning version included with the book has been hamstrung to protect the full version. This makes sense, but their chosen method was to prevent you from being able to save your programming to disk or ROM; in other words, so that it can't be embedded. Seems difficult at best to learn embedded programming with software that can't be embedded. And the retail version of the tools on which this book is based cost a fortune. I suppose you could filter for more generally applicable information, but for me it just wasn't worth it.

Great acting, emotional depth, great themes. Made me think, and feel, about what the reality is with regard to dealing with death and the part that recollections/memories can play into that. It's a powerful film in that it is not sentimental, but provides a greater overall understanding to life: you feel the struggles and experiences of the characters. And, I think it's the type of film you see a second time and notice new and different things you had't caught the first time 'round.

Not all of the painters are youngsters - there is a good smattering of the old guard like Kitaj, Hockney, Auerbach, Freud, and Weight to name a few. But the interesting contributors to this show/book are Jenny Saville, Peter Blake, John Wonnacott, Alison Watt, Euan Uglow, Celia Paul, John Kirby, Ken Currie, and Humphrey Ocean among some others who retain the figure intact but push the edge to keep the painting fresh while fairly traditional.

The oval shape is really nice, too...rectangular ones seem so goofy and circular don't fit inside small jars as well. These come with a cuff that goes around them in the center to hold them all together for storage, and it is a nice touch. Another nice touch is including the 2 teaspoon measure.

I keep it next to my bed.the songs -If God Will Send His Angels - very soft, sweet, sultry, kind.Uninvited - Alanis Morissette, haunting, sultry, memorable.Mama, You Got A Daughter - love it! I want a whole CD with just this guy! John Lee Hooker - New Orleans kinda blues - so good. Angel - sweet, Sarah McLachlan. yummy good.Iris - beyond beautiful. Goo Goo Dolls.the rest, all good.

I would recommened this soundtrack to anyone. If you liked the movie you will love the soundtrack!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're a fan of rock only....","review":"... Then you'll find out that only two songs on this soundtrack - the ones by Alanis Morisette and Goo Goo Dolls - are worth listening to. The classical overtures at the end by Gabriel Yared certainly is also enjoyable to some extent, but overall the CD has far too many different genres of music all criss-crossing each other which can be too much of a variety to some. I for one personally don't see what all the hype on McLachlan's 'Angel' is about. A number of other tracks has been underrated by the majority of critics which is a shame to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for two good songs","review":"This cd was a waste of money. the only good songs were iris and uninvited. don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks!","review":"I hate this cd! The only good song on the whole album is \\"Uninvited\\" by Alanis Morissette. The others are just boring. Don't buy this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"intreguing styles of music, adding to a great movie","review":"My opinion of this cd reflects on the movie as well. After being touched by such excellent acting as Meg Ryan and Nick Cage did, I had to run out and buy the music, to remember the warmth of the movie. The soundtrack is very emotional, with \\"I Grieve,\\" and \\"Angel\\" very soulful ballads. My absolute favorite song is the Goo Goo Dolls \\"Iris.\\" The Jimmy Hendrix and John Lee Hooker were kind of out of place, and I could take or leave Paula Cole and U2. Another great addition to the music was Gaberiel Yared. For the most part, a very good investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alanis Morissette Rocks!","review":"Most of the songs are pretty good and worth getting, but Alanis Morisette's \\"Uninvited\\" is an excellent song. It is one of her best songs and is by far the best on the album. I recommend buying the album just for her song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Folks!!!","review":"Clapton's song was great, because she was a Blues fan. She loved blues guitar and it was featured prominantly enough in the movie. And in case you've been asleep for the last 30+years I'll tell you, Clapton has more to offer than just that one song. It's like people want him to only sing that song. Like Sammy Davis Jr. and \\"Candy Man\\". Give him a break folks. \\"Tears in Heaven\\" was already on a movie soundtrack BTW. And it's a good release from the sadder tunes on the soundtrack. If you want an album full of nothing but sad songs go buy Chicago's greatest hits or something, this CD is perfect the way it is. Who wants a song that would only be clashing with \\"Angel\\" over tear jerker status. Sarah made the grade with that one, a masterpiece, leave it at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best cd ever","review":"i thought that this cd was one of the best i had ever listen to until i got to the song by the goo goo dolls then it made it the Best."},{"rating":"2","title":"the cd is great.","review":"I think that this is a great Cd because it uses a mixture of music.

Recently, I saw the movie to which this is the soundtrack and haven't seen such a wonderful piece in a very long time. This beautiful music takes the feelings and emotions experienced in the film and brings them to your ears, as well as your heart. Sarah McLachlan's \\"Angel\\" is a song without compare, and is likely the best track on this CD. I loved the movie, and the soundtrack leaves nothing to be desired.

The CD will fool people: you'd think that with Alanis Morisette and the Goo Goo Dolls, the whole album would be mostly alternative, but it sounds annoyingly jazzy to me. The Alanis Morisette song is decent; the Sarah McLachlan song is also pretty good. If you are like me and love only \\"Iris,\\" however, don't go for this CD, buy \\"Dizzy Up the Girl.\\" You'd probably enjoy it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"The only reason I got this CD was because I needed another CD in a buy one, get one free deal and I liked Iris by the GGDolls.

However to my disapoint, I realized there where plenty of better soundtracks out there than this. I did enjoy the songs: What If God Would Send His Angels, Uninvited, and Iris. But those songs are constantly blaring on the radio anyways. As for the rest of the songs on the album, these songs are not much to my taste. I rated this album two stars because I felt it fell short of expectations with all those big name singers on the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knock-off CD, user reviews are about some other CD","review":"Folks, there are two problems here. First, this is a knock-off of the original City of Angels soundtrack (you can listen to excerpts from that CD here: http://www.amazon.com/City-Angels-Music-Motion-Picture/dp/B0000062VP/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1244065276&sr=1-1).

The best album to go with a movie up to now.

And about shooting Alanis and others, ? Buy this and take it with you on long drives!

I don't care for Jimi Hendrix singing \\"Red House\\" and John Lee Hooker crooning \\"Mama, You Got a Daughter.\\" But I bought this CD only because of Alanis Morissette and the Goo Goo Dolls, so I didn't have high expectations. But Sarah McLachlan's \\"Angel\\" is really calming. I can listen to that over and over again; it helps me go to sleep. So does U2's \\"If God Will Send His Angels.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"I have bought this cd recently as a present for my wive. The songs are not frequently on the radio.

Sarah McLachlin has a wonderful quality to her voice and sounds like an angel."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much better recordings out there.","review":"The fact that I gave this recording only two stars has nothing to do with the works performed here. Vivaldi's \\"Four Seasons\\" are true masterworks that never age. They are brilliant and priceless musical gems. However, this is not a very good recording of these works. I'm still trying to put my finger on what exactly is wrong. The tempos are a bit sluggish, and it's way too heavy for such lighthearted music. And yet, this doesn't quite describe what's really wrong with it. Maybe a large part of the problem is that there are so many superior recordings. I can't listen to these works without hearing great performances of them run through my head, which makes this recording even more difficult to sit to. For one of the few times that I've ever encountered, this Naxos release is truly not a bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your usual bread recipes","review":"If you're looking for a bread cookbook with recipes that are different than the usual bread recipes, this is an excellent choice.

It is well made and easy to use. I found that I was able to improve the trap's performance by using a strong U-shaped wire (look at picture of \\"Rainbird Galvanized Tie Down Stakes\\" - coat hanger wire will also work)about 4\\" long to stake the base of the trap near the spring directly to the ground. Otherwise the moles were able to raise the entire trap up and tunnel right underneath it without tripping it. By fastening the base to the soil, the trap would stay in place and when the moles tried tunneling through the trap, the raising dirt would pretty much guarantee that the trigger plate would release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works!","review":"I've already caught six moles since purchasing this item.

The book covers all of Europe west of the Ural Mountains (including Ireland). It lists all amphibians and reptiles withing that range. The keys are very well written, and the corresponding line drawings are exellent. The book also covers many of the variations that occur withing the European lizards. I would recomend this book for the above reasons, over any book that only covers western Europe/Britain because this book also covers easter Europe, which is becoming more and more open to the west every year.

My only complaint would be the spacing of the tracks- they fade in on each other, so it is difficult to tell when one ends and the next begins.

Really, I did. But there was one flaw that I just could not get past, and her name is Irene. The character is already difficult to sympathize with, but she might have stood a chance if it weren't for the grossly miscast Gina McKee. I don't doubt McKee's acting ability, but she was a mistake for this role. Her stone coolness was a bit too cold. Her interpretation of Irene is not the sort of woman that would cause this kind of \\"enchantment\\" of so many members of this family. I just don't believe it. I didn't believe passion at all, and she had three different chances to try to prove it to me. I don't like to judge anything until I've finished it, but I had to grit my teeth any time Irene was on screen. This made it near impossible to enjoy some of the pros, like Damian Lewis's extremely convincing Soames. Yes.

It is not worth the tape price, however, since it does not do justice to the nuances of one of my favorite novels.The one thing this version does accomplish is not so much to create sympathy for Soames as to divert it from Irene. She comes across rather accurately as self-centered, intolerant and smug. After three readings of the novel, I can have no sympathy with a woman who passes all the emotional costs of her mistakes on to others.

Damien Lewis plays him as Uriah Heap;a jumped up clerk decked who would not have made it to square one in the circles Soames moved in.Irene, Galsworthy's ethereal presence spinning her web, half spider, half enchantress, is portrayed by Gina McKee with all the grace of a Catherine Cookson heroine, clogs and all, more Olive Oyle than gazelle.

If you're tired of the humdrum violent, mind-numbing movies of today be sure to expand your library with this gem. The acting is top notch...you will, at times have a love-hate relationship with some of the characters. Though the pace is a bit slow in places, it is worth the price! Be sure to get Series 2 to complete the set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brillant Series","review":"I saw this when it originally aired on television and knew that I had to own it one day.

A must see for any Masterpiece Theatre lover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Cast but with a Story Problem","review":"In this version, the Soames Forsyte character is a tragic man, but not evil or mean. Irene on the other hand is a real creep. She marries Soames for his money and never gives him a moment of happiness. Then she gets into a passionate affair with Soames architect which she makes very public knowledge, humiliating Soames at every turn. It is really hard to have an ounce of sympathy for Irene. This show would have played much better if Soames was more of a jerk and Irene was less of a jerk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor portrayal of interesting characters","review":"In the original book Irene is a woman of extreme beauty, while in this version she seems rather lacklustre. Soames is an extremely well-spoken, ultra conservative, shrewd and cool headed attorney - in this version he speaks through gritted teeth and throws tantrums. Soames is a complicated character but in this version he is simply evil. Boring. Jolyon is a strong man but with a kind and tolerant nature, but in this version he is just some sappy man. The actors are supposed to go from 18 to 88. However, no one really is able to age. Fathers looking younger than their daughters... All in all a very disappointing endeavor. Please see read the book or see the original BBC version that is superbly well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"It started out a little slow but the story just started to grab me.

This modern version is a terrible disapointment. Obviously low budget and abbreviated it did not capture the essence of what it means to be a Forsyte. It fails at that point.The existence of the Irene/Bosinney affair is a fundamental feature of the story. It is the fact that the affair occurred that is important. The drawn out sordid details of the details of it went on too long and are boring and irrelevant. With due respect to the beautiful and talented actress, the casting of Irene is a disaster. Young Jolyon is marginal. Winifred's role was misunderstood. The role of June was simply overdone. The producer, director and production crew are too much influenced by soap opera and refuse to bow to the classics. I concede that the classics may be judged as simply high class soaps. But high class makes an enormous difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad remake","review":"This is an sad remake of the BBC mini-series and a loose and inaccurate rendition of a brilliant book. Many of the characters were hopelessly miscast, particularly Uncle Swithin and the elegant and mysterious Irene, on whom the focus of the story lies. Did anyone here even read the book? I was so thrilled to learn that The Forsyte Saga was being put out on DVD, but this was an unmitigated disappointment. Hopefully, the Beeb will feel the same way and release their original series in order that the audience can enjoy the true quality of a finely crafted series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful aspect ratio","review":"I'm not sure what happened with the transfer to DVD, but it looks as if the picture were transferred from anamorphic widescreen to fullscreen with no compensation for the aspect ratio. Everyone looks as if they were in an El Greco painting (tall, thin and distorted). The facial closeups make actors look as if they are leering into the camera because of the distortion. I have a headache after 10 minutes of this DVD. I never been disappointed in a DVD transfer before, but this one is unwatchable.

Thats what happens when over production removes everything decent about your band. The asexual vocals are still there, and jazzily rhtmic in a way that doesnt suit the band's early stuff but does suit this droll sound, also, the lyrics appear to have retarded with the spark this band once had.if i were you id check out 'on a wire' by the get up kids as an alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the same band?","review":"Like I said is this the same band. Chris' voice is hardly recongnizable. If you listen to their previous albums, and this one, he sounds a lot different. His voice was annoying sometimes in Stay What You Are and the other two albums, but now he is really high pitched and can not be listened to more than five times without you wanting to turn the cd off. They may have stated that they were trying to be like the Beatles in this album, and are definitely influenced by Sargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. But the problem is SPLHCB is an amzing album, this isn't. Lets hope a once amazing band can get out of their Power Pop phase and return to the Through Being Cool band we all love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under-appreciated pop gem..","review":"I normally don't like this type of music (punk/emo), but this album has catchy melodies and strong hooks.

Every cd that Saves The Day has released has marked a step forward from the previous album. Through the transition from \\"Through Being Cool\\" to \\"Stay What You Are\\", Saves the Day has transcended above the almost formulaic genre of \\"punk/emo\\" to a more original sound. In their latest transition, Saves the Day has made a deeper connection with their lyrics to their music (It's not just stuff that people can mosh and crowd surf to). So give it a chance and really listen to the words and make the connection to the music. You will not be let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Saves the Day?","review":"This is the worst Saves the Day album. It was almost as if they never really got going. I felt it was loose and was not catching at all. I thought it would be at least half as good as Through Being Cool, but sadly I was wrong. In Reverie did not even come close. In Reverie was by far a big disappointment.

STD has gone completely pop! If you are a fan of their old music, seriously do not buy this album. I think that whoever gave Saves The Day the idea to have a new sound should be shot or stoned...or run over by an 18 wheeler. I am so angry about their new sound, I threw the cd in the river in the back of my house, after breaking it in half. Hopefully Something Corporate and Green Day wont make me feel the same way with their new albums..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This can't be Saves the Day","review":"This album is incredibly awful in every aspect. No matter how you want to look at it, it is terrible. I don't even see how they let these songs leave the studio. They don't even sound like B-side worthy songs. Can't Slow Down, Through Being Cool, and Stay What You Are were great...some of the best albums I own. This is a huge let-down.

Didn't really think Saves the Day could sound like this. However, different doesn't mean bad, their music has progressed so much since Can't Slow Down that this album reflects the musical stage that they're in at this moment. For all those so quick to brush off this album, they're just ignorant of the fact that good music grows and becomes something more than itself throughout time. Saves the Day has come a long way and growing up part of my teenage years on Saves the Day, I think they're heading on the right track. Plus, this album was basically made after the 9-11 incident and the music also kinda reflects that. Give it a chance, next thing you know, you're tapping your foot to all the songs in this album. But if you can't give it a chance, then wait for future cds; but don't give up hope, this band is still young and can make many more rockin' songs in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED!!!!","review":"first off if you like saves the day do not buy this album. this is not saves the day at all. big disapointment! i think the problem is that chris isnt a strong guitar player and on most of the cd he is singing and playing which is not an easy task, for anyone. please chris, put the gutitar down and keep to writing songs!! we miss you chris. we forgive you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, but strays from what STD does best","review":"Don't get me wrong - this album is decent musically. The songs are well-written and well-executed, as we have come to expect from Chris Conley and the rest of the band. However, since the departure of longtime drummer Bryan Newman and second guitarist Ted Alexander, the songs have lost a little bit of the edge that was so appealing. Chris' departure from whinier, pop/punk to a more straight/ahead, mellow tone is alright, but in reality, the former tone, heard on STD's previous recordings, is what gives the songs flavor. That aspect is lacking on this record, and I cannot help but feel that the shift to California's Vagrant is pushing the band in the wrong direction musically. At this rate, STD is primed to become a second-rate copy of Built To Spill...sorry guys, but Built to Spill does it and does it better...I think you have to go (in this case, stick) with what you know."},{"rating":"1","title":"mellowdramatic letdown","review":"This latest cd from them is a completely different sound than thier last one and going in a bad direction.

These guys used to be sooo good but this album shows that they seem to have lost all emotion in their music. I was really anticipating this cd, considering Saves The Day USED to be one of my favorite bands, but I was extremely let down. What happened to all the intense lyrics and hard core music? They totally changed their sound, and i don't know what group of people this new music appeals to, but certainly not me or a lot of their other old fans. If you want to check out some of their GOOD stuff, try the older cds. The best song ever is \\"Sell My Old Clothes, I'm Off to Heaven\\". As for this CD, I wouldn't pay a cent for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened.","review":"Changing to Dreamworks mightve been the worst thing that could happen to this one-time good band.

The Cd sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"a major disappointment","review":"I am really disappointed in this album. I have always been a huge fan of saves the day and i love their first 3 albums, but i didn't even find myself able to listen to this whole album.

Maybe if i listen to it a little bit more it will grow on me, who knows, its happened in the past. For now however, i am going to have to say that this cd is really awful.

This particular release shows that the boys from New jersey are not only capable of evolving their sound to be more grown up, but do so with ease.

I don't know if something with management has changed or just the band, but it wasn't good.The singing is good but just doesn't seem right for the band from previous albums. a lot of the tunes seem too similar. and I just can't find what i've came to enjoy in the lyrics.I've noticed after listening to it a couple times that There are quite a few times where the old sound is there, usually just for a moment, but it is quickly covered up.Don't worry guys...

Its like they slowed down the tempo since stay what you are, but not slow enough, so it gives you the feeling that there is a tempo governor on their music. It is just so bad.

The lyrics are pure brilliance and capture the range of teenage emotions from love to heartbreak to boredom to plain disgust. On Cant Slow Down you can feel the emotion come through the speakers.

Then came Stay What You Are which was Saves The Days \\"radio friendly\\" CD which prettymuch put them into a mainstream audeince of stupid little \\"emo kids\\". It wasnt very good anyways. The new CD In Reveire is unlike any other Saves The Day. Its not \\"emo\\"-its not \\"screamo\\"-etc. From what Ive heard its more a cross between the \\"alt pop\\" that made Sub Pop big in the 80s/90s mixed with a bit of \\"emo\\" and some Cave In style \\"space rock\\".

My favorite track on the album is the title track though the choice of \\"Anywhere With You\\" as the lead single was a good decision. The album depicts Saves The Day as sounding like Weezer which is fine for seasoned veterans of their music. Newcomers may get the wrong impression of the band however. They definately aren't Weezer, and by this I mean they're 100 times better. Definately check this album out and listen to it with an open mind.

They are a great Jersey band and deserve much credit for their sound. In Reverie is a great album overall. I only gave it four stars because I liked STD's previous album a little more. Chris Conley's voice is also different in this new album. I can't really explain how, but if I had to, I would say he sounds younger and less nasally. I had grown accustomed to his voice on the last album, but the overall conclusion is that I like the change. What don't I like about the album? Nothing really. It is very upbeat, pop, and addicting. I knew all the lyrics after a week of obsessively listening to it. After I retired it, I can still say that if you like Saves The Day, then you will really like In Reverie."},{"rating":"1","title":"utterly disappointed.","review":"i love \\"stay what you are\\" & \\"can't slow down\\". both are amazing albums in their own light. but this is just.....bad. overproduction & half assed work by chris make this album one of the biggiest let downs of 03. now, it's obvious to anyone that saves the day's later material was influenced by the great Weezer, but with a more....dark twist. but this album was as if touring with =w= had led them to believe that they could be them. i tried to like this...but i just can't. some of the songs aren't horrible. but after about 5 songs it just gets boring. if this is the direction in which this once great band is heading, count me out."},{"rating":"2","title":"saved my LIFE","review":"haha not really but this album is UH MAZE ING. so dreamy. makes me want to float away on a lilly pad or in the clouds. it's such a dreamy cd. and i love how its different then all the other std albums. i had to come to amazon to buy it because i couldnt find it in stores anywhere. when it first came out i bought it but someone stole my cds about 3 years ago and i hadn't rebought it until last week and i've been playin it nonstop since. if youre a dreamy person and love wild lyrics. you'll love this cd. if you're only into the other side of std you won't. so just have an open mind and let this cd IN IT. <3"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves to get no stars","review":"The only other CD I have of Saves the Day is Through Being Cool. I bought this CD thinking that it would be along the lines of Through Being Cool and boy was I wrong!!! First of all its sounds like a whole different group of guys. The singer sounds totally different and trust me, change isn't always good. The singers vioce is high and whiny kinda sounds like weezer but higher. Almost like a girl. The music is mellow so don't expect any fast beat uptempo punk rock tracks like in Through Being Cool. I listen to the CD once and tossed it into the abyss that is my CD holder. Never again will I waste my time on it. Download a couple of tracks before you buy to see what I mean. I'd rather put 14 bucks in the gas tank than to buy this cd. Junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this??","review":"This can't be Saves the Day... the band who used to sing \\"cut some flesh away, I'll carry this piece of you with me...\\" and \\"buy you lemonade right now if you were here... and then I'd throw it in your face, and I'd listen to you cry...\\" (Rocks Tonic Juice Magic)No way.This new album just isn't that great, quite frankly. It's not up to par to their earlier works of \\"Can't Slow Down\\", \\"Through Being Cool\\", and the \\"I'm Sorry I'm Leaving\\" EP. It just isn't. \\"Anywhere With You\\" is a decent song, but that's about it. The dark humor is gone... the vicious lyrics that are so great for break-ups just aren't here.There is always hope though -- this album may have been an experimental or filler album of some sort... and Saves the Day can come back fresh and with overtones of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you thought you liked STD...","review":"Hoo boy. I bought this on the strength of their previous releases and was sorely disappointed. It may be a good album, but it's not my cup of tea. Not one song that made it worth buying, IMHO. If you like the older STD like THROUGH BEING COOL or other bands of that slant, don't waste your $$$. If you like overproduced wannabe Brit sounding crap, then this is right up your alley."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would actually give this album ZERO STARS!!!","review":"THIS ALBUM IS THE BIGGEST PEICE OF CRAP I'VE HEARD IN MY LIFE.THEY SOLD OUT, THATS ALL I CAN SAY. DOES THE LEAD SINGER EVEN SOUND THE SAME ANY MORE? NO!! BECAUSE THEY ARE BUNCH OF PUSSIES THAT SOLD OUT. I did have respect for their older albums when they sounded original and good.

I've heard a lot of people say that it was \\"too different\\" from their pervious albums, and I can see where they're coming from, but really it wasn't so drastically different that I wanted to through it out a window or something. I didn't really have to give it a \\"second try\\" either, I liked it from the start. So, yeah, this is a great album by a great band that can tweak with their sound but still come out great. Pick it up, but don't be expecting \\"Through being cool\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even worth listening to","review":"This cd blows!!!!!! If you like yhe previous SAVESTHEDAY then listen to them but this cd it is horible i mean it actually hurt my ears. Way way to poppy i mean it doesn't even sound like music stay away from this cd!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good but not great","review":"i love saves the day. especially \\"Stay What You Are\\" definitely in my top 5 favorites of all time. this cd however is much different from stay what you are, and although sometimes change is good, like for instance the change from through being cool to stay what you are (not that through being cool was bad, it just wasnt as awesome as stay...), this one was bad... most all of the songs are in minor, which isn't really my style... i like happier music. the lyrics are still great, but the music and singing just isn't the same. i recommend stay what you are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saves the day ROCKSSSSSSSSSSS","review":"Yea right. I listen to alot of Saves the day and I was so looking forward to this new cd and i popped it in for the first time and It sounds good till Chris starts singing.

Its a good cd if you want to laught at it with your friends cause it sounds like his balls are being smashed and forgot what to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to Different!","review":"I got this album as a gift. i have trough being cool and stay what you are. those are 2 incredible albums. ive herd people sayed that Saves The Day matured with Reverie. i have to agree with them, but i also have to say that they matured in the wrong direction. they should of stayed with the path they were heading with Stay What You Are. i would not recomend this album to anyone who is a fan of the older Saves The Day albums. If you want a good cd by them go out and by Stay What You Are, thats a good album"},{"rating":"2","title":"every one who thinks it sucks is... not cool","review":"well i've heard a lot of bad things about this album, like how it doesn't sound quite as good as Through Being Cool, or Stay What You Are, but i would have to argue. i think that the quality of this album is phenominal. The lyrical quality is still high, and the music has an emo/alterintive sound similar to weezer. My personal favorite off the album is \\"where are you\\" (due to the double bass), and \\"anywhere with you\\". i'm proud of the band. They are continuing thier music journey, and not one of their cd's sounds the same. but they all sound amazing. i highly recomend this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Reverie","review":"Well, I anticipated this album for about a month before it came out, my mates and girlfriend were telling me to shut-up about it by about the third week before it came out. Eventually it did, much to my delight, already having heard \\"Anywhere With You\\" which was a fantastic opening track. The rest of the album was not a disappointment (although a couple of tracks lack something, but are still great) but there did seem to be a dramatic change from the fantastic \\"Stay What You Are\\" in Chris' voice (Lead vocals), as my girlfriend and I agreed, his voice has matured, but maybe not for the better, I miss the slightly rough edge that came through on the previous albums. However, any fan will love it, and anyone else should enjoy it, because it is just a great album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Now Im a fan of the old Saves the Day. The last album \\"Stay what you are\\" was a slight change of saves the day, but it was still a good album. Now this album is a major change for saves the day and its horrible. In my opinion \\"cant slow down\\" and \\"throug being cool\\" were the best albums they ever made. They've been going down hill since then. If you'd prefer older saves the day, stay away from this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"for all of you bashing in reverie","review":"This cd is brilliant, listen to the lyric patterns, its revolutionary to what we know as pop/rock music. these songs grow on you. reminds me of the beatles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD.","review":"Like most of you, I agree that this CD is different from the rest,which is good. It took me a few listens until I started liking it more and more. I saw them last saturday and the songs actually are a lot more powerful than I thought they would sound. The lyrics to me aren't as straight forward as the other albums, but more artistic I guess. It's nice to hear something new."},{"rating":"1","title":"i don't even think i have to say anything...","review":"we all know that saves the day used to be great. everyone loved them. we all know that stay what you are was their \\"sell-out\\" record but it had redeeming qualities. it wasn't terrible. this record, however, is godawful. i can't say anything that hasn't been said before. we all know."},{"rating":"1","title":"what...what...what!?","review":"In Saves the Day fourth album they blast through their old sound and find something that we all knew they had inside of them. Really bad music. Not like bad like Michael Jackson, but bad like running over a cat. The vocals are a high pitched attempt at singing in a soft beautiful manner. Basically the vocals [are bad]. Well I have good news, if you can't stand the vocals you still have the music to lsiten to. Oh wait, nevermind that [is bad] too. Here's a recap, Saves the Day used to rock the party that rocked the body but now they just [are bad]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely dissapointing","review":"I was very dissapointed with how boring this album was. Its too mellow, none of the songs are upbeat at all. Chris' voice lacks any excitement to it. I never listened to them for their lyrics but for their sound, and this new sound is pathetic. I bought the new Thursday album, War All the Time, at the same time and Ive already listened to it over and over because it has much more life to it, while In Reverie sits in its CD case. If you are a die hard Saves the Day fan, its hard not to want to buy it, but for a new listener, try their old stuff first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great piece of music...","review":"I dont know why so many STD fans were turned off so quickly when this came out. I love it and see it for what it really is; a great piece of music from a great band that wanted to try something new. I applaud them for that, a highly recommended album..."},{"rating":"2","title":"El Capitan Falcon's Review","review":"Saves the Day's latest album In Reverie is something different. To come out with an album like this is daring because of it's completly new sound. Fans of the old may not like In Reverie because of the dramatic change in the pitch of Chris's voice. However as you listen more, it will grow on you and you'll come to terms with the indie sound that goes along with it. Their lyrics could almost be compared to an old hippie sound like simon and garfunkle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cd","review":"I have to say that this is a very good cd. I know a lot of People don't like it but you can't expect them to make the same cd every time. I just takes some getting used to. It is much slower then anything they have done and the lyrics are a bit different. Chris also sings very differently. Altogether it is solid album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Emo Kids\\" need to shut up","review":"I dont expect this review to be popular, since everyone seems to hate this album, but, here it goes. Im so sick of \\"emo\\" (i hate that word) kids hating anything thats not whiny. Im not saying this cd is perfect, or that saves the day hasnt changed their sound, but it sure doesnt sound like ANYTHING weezer has ever played (i would know since I own most of their albums) and none of the songs sound the same at all. You poor closed minded teens, will you ever listen to music thats not punk or emo. Listen with an open mind and this CD is not as terrible as people say. Not as good as their old stuff, but its not the end of saves the day. Definitly there are some new influences, more indie sounding. Good Job for not staying the same with every release STD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I was looking forward to this cd for a long time. As with all the Saves The Day cds, I bought it without even hearing a song. Their previous efforts are just amazing. But his is such a disappointment. What the heck happened to their sound. Simply put this cd is Stay What You are with VERY few catchy hooks and a very irritating sound. The STD that I loved is quickly becoming a memory. If you are new to Saves The Day, buy Can't Slow Down or Through Being Cool, those are the cds that made STD into the great band that they were. I hope Chris will realize that and go back to those days."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad...","review":"ok. first of all i love std...i went to high school with chris and he was in my gym class...i loved all of their old stuff, i eventually loved stay what you are...but this new cd...oh man, ok, it's a new sound, think: weezer meets big bird..do you remember the old std shows and how amazing they were...remember chris with short hair..? those were the days...i'm not feeling this cd...i'm leaving it out of my collection... stay what you were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another original, creative, fresh sound from Saves the Day","review":"I got into Saves the Day when I bought \\"Stay What You Are\\" a couple years ago, which I feel is in many ways, a perfect CD. I couldn't wait for \\"In Reverie\\" to come out, but I didn't know how they could top their last CD. \\"In Reverie\\", although a completely different sound, is just as good or better than anything I've ever heard...from them or anyone else. The tracks are light, intricate, and upbeat. So many different sounds and techniques are experimented with, and the results are incredible. The singing sounds completely fresh and different, and the whole album has a \\"happy\\" feel to it. Saves the Day took a courageous step forward by changing their sound and attitude, and the results are incredible. You can't get sick of these songs and you can't not like them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save The Band??","review":"I would have to agree with the previous reviewers that compare \\"In Reverie\\" to a sort of Beatles sounding album. This was definetly not what I was expecting. There are no standout tunes like \\"Holly Hox, Forget Me Not\\", \\"Shoulder To The Wheel\\" or \\"At Your Funeral\\" from previous efforts. The band appeared to be on the verge of big things when they appeared on 1999's Rebirth of Hardcore compilation followed by \\"Stay What You Are\\", but this effort is sure to alienate more than a few of their fans. Overall a nice effort for maturity in their sound but they lose a few points for abandoing their roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Saves the Day CD out.","review":"Wow. I excpected this STD CD to follow the example of it's fellow awesome CD releases by the great emo band. But instead I was forced through 12 songs of slow, emotionless, sappy drivel.This is a step in a very wrong direction for STD.They aren't in the same ballpark with this release at all. In fact I doubt they are even in the same country.Skip this CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Stuff","review":"This is a truly fascinating and at times startling account of one man'sdesperate search for wisdom and knowledge.Few books have held my attention as this one did,and any serious seekerfor Truth will recognise in the author and the main character a fellowseeker.To follow his journey through deception and delusion to his final encounter with destiny was a delight indeed.Recommended to all who likewise seek for wisdom and understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong Chemical Smell","review":"I wanted a shampoo bar to cut down on packaging, to be more environmentally friendly.

I use it first, rinse, then use my shampoo I like. After using this & rinsing, my wet hair feels like a strong buildup is on it from this soap.

Following his Army career, he taught and then worked for Rolling Stone magazine for a brief period of time and Soldier of Fortune magazine for far longer.He wrote this book as a memoir primarily of the low intensity conflicts he covered for Soldier of Fortune and painted his travels in a way that is interesting and engaging.

Bob Brown (who has the attention span of a 14 year-old boy), SOF Publisher is painted as his lovable self - scatterbrained but a great guy.Morris tells it the way he sees it/saw it.

An enjoyable yet informative read. I can't hardly put the book down. Thanks Max for all you do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, even for a best-of collection","review":"How this guy ever got a recording contract is beyond me. Boasting elevator music-styled lite jazz arrangements that make Kenny G. sound like Charlie Parker, some of the worst lyrics known to man (the title \\"Popsicle Toes\\" alone proves that) and awful, AWFUL vocals....the music of Michael Franks has absolutely no quality or value whatsover. And that voice.....what does this guy do, suck on a helium tank before he enters the studio? Absolute dreck. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth Jazz with a twist","review":"I am a real hater of smooth jazz; in the old days people who hated jazz hated it for it's shronk-fests (think John Coltrane's \\"Ascension\\"), but now the hardcore generation know not of jazz's fire and only of its snooze-fests thanks the popularity of smooth jazz.So why would I give a smooth jazz artist a fairly good rating? The reason is that Franks does create pretty sleepy songs, but the point of his music, unlike many other smooth jazz musicians is to be interestingly lyrical. He doesn't have very cliched song ideas (who would sing about popsicle toes and tigers in the rain?) and that is what makes him memorable. Just like real jazz artists attempt to amaze the audience with their creative improvising, Franks marvels us with his witty and metaphore-rich lyrics. Isn't that what jazz is about, pushing the boundaries? Well done Franks, you have proved that a genre that is so often so boring can have true artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Michael Franks CD","review":"I have really enjoyed listening to this CD.

The title quote above, is from \\"Hourglass.\\"Bee Bop Jazz is his home base, but his marvelous sense of humor, sexuality, and fun, make this compillation a great investment, because you will listen to it again and again. The songs cover a variety of moods with a variety of musical attitudes (its not all upbeat), so you'll hear something new every time you play it.My favorites are \\"When Sly Calls,\\" \\"When you give your love to me,\\" and \\"Hourglass,\\" but like other great collections, its all good.Influenced by others I'm sure, but he is absolutely unique. I'm curious about how these songs were produced, because he uses a large number of instruments (synthetic or real?) so he gets exactly the sound he wants when he wants it.

Gives comprehensive overviews about all aspects of the game -- rules, strategies, the world of professional soccer (the leagues, tournaments, events), as well as an excellent history of the game and its development. It's refreshing to see a book for newcomers that doesn't strip things down - there is a wealth of well-researched information here that is useful for the experienced fan or participant."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible...some basics but no tactics","review":"If you have never played soccer this book might be 'just' OK for you. The book gives some basics of the game but then completely skips tactics and goes into all the different league types in the USA and the 10 best world players and than 10 best US players and then does reviews of certain great games. But once it lists the basics it misses tactics and goes straight to soccer History. If you play the game try the 'usborne soccer school' booklets instead. They're short but at least well written. I've bought 10 'For Dummies' books and have never been disappointed till now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"This is the first time I have reviewed a book for Amazon. I am doing this because I consider this book to be 100% garbage.If you are looking for a book full of annoying cross references (i.e. see page 118; see page 73) and for a book which repeats the same quotes or phrases in different chapters (was there really no editor?) BUY THIS BOOK.Also, if you are looking for cheap tid-bits and trivia about the US women's soccer team (was it really necessary to write three times about one female ripping her shirt off after a goal?) BUT THIS BOOK.If you want to have a general overview about the rules of Soccer but want nothing of strategy, technique, training, then BUY THIS BOOK. (or why not just go to the FIFA website and download the same rules which make up 50% of this book)But if you want to learn how to play or coach soccer, forget it. This book is a COMPLETE waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"You won't learn how soccer is played from this book","review":"I just wanted to know what the rules, plays, and basic strategies of soccer were.

Now that Mickey is eleven, he is determined to follow in his father's footsteps, starting by beating the local bully in the town's big children's pool tournament. When an old friend of his father's walks back into their lives and offers to coach him, Mickey is thrilled. His mother, though, isn't quite so enthusiastic.The story is decent, although a bit cliche. It is obvious what will happen with all of the conflicts; there isn't a whole lot of tension. I didn't really like any of the characters in this story. I thought Mickey was really whiny, and he and his friend acted much younger than fifth grade. It seemed they were always screaming something, and I found that irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's alright....","review":"A story of a boy who tries to live in the shadow of his dead father. The main character lives with his mother as he tries to figure out who he is. His best friend is a whiz at math and helps him to learn and understand the angles of pool. An old friend of the boy's deceased father comes back into the picutre, much to the dismay of the main character's mother. Toward the end of the book the boy enters a local pool tournament and has to go up against some stiff competition. The book's end is so predictable that its like walking outside to see clouds in the sky. Still a fairly good read with a handful of boring sections. Get through the boring parts for a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sticks: A GREAT BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Sticks by Joan Bauer is a great book! It is my favorite book in the world! It's about Mickey Vernon, a pool player, and how he wants to win the Pool Championship. When a former of Mickey's mom shows up, he offers to give Mickey a few pointers. Mom says no, she doesn't trust him. Then, when she says yes, Mickey is appoluded."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book","review":"\\"Sticks\\" is a great, but not unusual, type of book. The main chararcter, Mickey Vernon, is faced with many challenges such as facing a bully and living up to his dead father's legacy of pool champion. The book revolves around Mickey practicing for a pool tournament, and he's a pretty stereotypical guy who needs help playing and so on. With a math buddy who helps Mickey play using math and science to win and other friends, it's like average life. The story is diverse, but it's also very predictable, like at the end when Mickey wins and the bully loses, so it can get boring. The book may get obvious at sometimes, but if there are any math, science, or pool lovers out there, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very forgettable.

This is one of those immortal CDs that only gets better with repeated listenings. Funny and sexy lyrics backed by breezy, funky grooves; even the derivative songs sound fresh and innovative, partly due to the colorful palette of samples that seem to fit perfectly behind the strong rhythm section, lilting guitar licks and loungy keyboards. The CD is so chock full of double entendres (or in most instances, straight and direct meanings like \\"El Disco Anal\\") that portions of some of their hit songs are banned in their native Venezuela.

While most American-made dance music is simply endless loops of synthetic drum riffs or samples layered over a pop song, this CD incorporates serious musical elements while maintaining its dance orientation. Horns, salsa and ska rhythmic patterns are all over the disc. The beats are nothing short of infectuous.We listened to this disc out on a boat in Chicago harbor and it was like being transported to the Caribbean.

Hayashi did not charge $10,000 for master level training as this book claims. And certainly Usui did not charge anywhere near $10,000 as the book is suggesting. This book also states that Usui was a Christian monk, when in fact he was Buddhist. Another false fact presented in this book is that Hayashi was Usui's successor, when we know through research it was Ushida. The society that Usui founded in 1922 still exists today in Japan and is called Usui Shiki Reiki Ryoho. Ushida was the second president of this organization after Usui made his transition. I recommend the book Reiki Fire for those interested in the true and verifiable history of Reiki or contact the Usui Shiki Reiki Ryoho society in Japan.

In another book I found reference to the author being affectionally called Gijean..

Admittedly this book is written for a general audience, but the author still makes an effort (and succeeds, in my opinion) in distinguishing between people who fit in to one of his types and people who can be difficult at times, but don't quite fit in a specific category. I never had the feeling of \\"oh, that could be anyone.\\" And the techniques he gave to deal with difficult people were concise and easy to use.

The book is taken up with the new battle between Land and Overland, and then with another adventure to Farland, the mysterious third planet in the system.

Wow, it amazes me to see that such a band has dumbed down to this mindless and worthless emo band. Granted, i have a great disdain for emo, but that aside they still could have had something, but instead 'Friction We Live' became a heavier Thrusday record. With the cliched lyrics about life and such, perhaps the worst singer and screamer in this genre, and mindnumbingly dull and soft riffs, 'Friction We Live' is unsalvangable; nearly to the point of destruction. I thought that these guys grew up, stopped complaining about life, and were going to focus on making some, at lest slightly, heavy music. But it did come out at a good time, with excellent releases by As I Lay Dying, Nora, and Burst (all with emo influences), there is something to fall back onto.

FATA's first full lenght release showed a lot of promise; a nearly perfect album (except for 3 tracks, which i ommited when burning te CD). This sounds nothing like what I had visioned their follow-up to sound like. I blame the evil folk over at Vagrant records for this. I'm 100% for bands to progress, but this just isn't a natural progression at all. I hoped for more norwegian-inspired hardcore, but instead tey opted to go the \\"emo\\" route.

The best part about the cd are the songs autumns monologue and the fiction we live. People out there say Autumns monologue ruins the cd because the chick sings it...well all those people who say that are idiots. Listen to the lyrics....then listen to the fiction we live.. a response to it.

Out of this whole cd i found two decent songs which are The after dinner payback and Every reason too and one song with a good ending which is alive and out of habit. However i did like the fact that that one broad from the last cd came back and did some vocals for the autumns monologue which is a good song if you just like the soft stuff.When it all comes down to it, i could hear this stuff on the radio. This is not the FATA i used to know. you want good FATA? go to your local music store and get Too Bad You're Beautiful.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Bad You're Beautiful...","review":"now, the fans of From Autumn To Ashes will rejoice...this album is far greater then Too Bad You're Beautiful.They keep the beautiful symbiosis of hardcore screaming with melody and harmony, perfectly.If you're like me and found that the best songs on Too Bad You're Beautiful were \\"Chloroform Perfume\\" and \\"Short Stories With Tragic Endings\\" then this is the From Autumn To Ashes album for you; with instantly amazing songs like \\"No Trivia\\", \\"The After Dinner Payback\\", and the ever beautiful song \\"Autumns Monologue\\" (featuring the beautiful voice of Melanie Wills, who was featured on Short Stories With Trafic Endings).The sheer passion and agression poured into this album is great.Go and buy this album now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardcore for everyone","review":"This is an awesome cd. The thundering riffs and pounding drums will appeal to anyone. I'm not all that familiar with many hardcore bands, but this one just rocks. Well worth the money. If you are new to hardcore, this is a good start. This cd is much better than their previous, they have improved so much you can really notice it. As for lacking on lyrical content, songs are poetry.....and phrases that make no sense to us probably have some symbolic value to the artist. Its called expression. So get this cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Too Bad","review":"This one is much different than the first album as the drummer sings a helluva lot more. Which i guess is cool if you dig his singing, but i don't. I mean it's okay, but Ben barely sings in this one, i don't even see whats the point of haing a guy in the band who screams one line each song. Milligram smile is probably the only good song on here, as ben does a decent amount of screaming. Don't buy this expecting another too bad your beautiful, this one is pretty different, so to sum it up ....it sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"more like From Autumn To....... TRASHES !!!","review":"the drummer is a girl, the singer is fat and has a stupid beard, i dont like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"FATA fails in this release","review":"Ok. I totally disagree with everyone else on this CD. I really enjoyed \\"Too Bad You're Beautiful\\" but this CD is awful. FATA have completely neglected their hardcore roots in favor of a more emo influenced sound. This alone is not enough to make me hate this cd, however. The screaming is almost completely phased out, and when you do hear it, it is weak and obvious the guy can't keep up with the band. As for thew singing vocals, I liked them before in the 1st cd, because they were intelligently used and not overdone. This time around they are in the majority of every song. And he has absolutely no range. Every line he sings sounds the same. As for the music it's self. It is not impressive. It is overeaching and at times extremely annoying. Bottom line\\" This CD is very lack lustre and a huge dissapointment. The best song is track 7 where the girl from ONe True Thing is the only one singing. She is pretty great."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album should be non-fiction.","review":"I have no idea why this album has received such great reviews from everyone on here. After their first album (which rocked to no end) I was anxious to hear this one. The first song is awesome, the rest of the album contributes to my saying that this is the worst metal album I have ever heard. The drummers voice makes me wanna grab a cane and pull him off the stage like Daffy Duck. This record made me feel metal in a way I never have before. It actually made me dislike the genre while I listened to the horror fill my eardrums. DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE! I don't get why anyone would post this album as any good. I do not know of one person who said it was good except for here.

Each entry begins with totally confusing and meaningless drawings, a silly \\"mood guide\\" and then some of the poorest analyses one could over read marred by such trashy expressions as \\"f**k-ups and f**king up,\\" \\"metaphorical crap\\" and \\"boppy,\\" to name a few. He does provide some very good indexes, but NO VIDEO INFORMATION for each entry. Eg. GUN CRAZY should have CBS/FOX Video, No. 7337 VHS.Greatest sin is Meyer's attitudes towards noir and its creators. For example, his comments about Orson Welles re: TOUCH OF EVIL. To comment on the latter's girth and \\"self-hatred\\" has nothing to do with Welles' genius. The entire ms. is sprinkled with these kind of trashy, personal speculations which detract from the entire work.Mostly, it is NOT a complete video guide to film noir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful introduction to film noir--highly recommended","review":"This is a fond and engaging look at the dark world of film noir.

Half way through the texture of the conrad-esque becomes the centre piece and grows completly overwhelming. Your ability to distinguish the microtonal and macrotonal changes is affected. The history of modern music from minimalist to serialist and back again. Possibly the most engaging piece of music I've ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Genius!","review":"Wow! For the first ten minutes Big Jim idly twangs a couple of strings on his geetar. For the remaining 38 minutes, or actually for as long as you can stand it before frantically scrabbling the cd out of the player and hurling it across the room, Jim holds down a chord on a harmonium or a hurdy-gurdy or something. Who cares? How about a double album next time Jim? You might waste a couple of hours but, goddam, it would be worth it.News just in: To be fair to Jim, \\"eureka\\" and \\"Insignificance\\" are tuneful, well arranged and memorable.

His emmotional voice, poignant lyrics and \\"action-packed\\" guitar playing style sets him up in the lofty realm as one of Blues' all-time greats. His influence on other great artists is well documented. This CD has a set of remastered material that covers his entire career. So if you get only one, make sure this is it. Most Delta Blues fans will track down all his work though, making this album a bit unnecessary, though the remastering on this disc sounds good to my ears.Gotta love the R. Crumb art too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New to Son House? This is the place to start...","review":"Eddie 'Son' House was one of the most intense and commanding of the early Mississippi Delta bluesmen, and he was also one of the greatest. This 'best of' collection wonderfully captures glimpses of the three major periods of House's career: his debut 1930 Paramount session, his early 1940s field recordings made by Alan Lomax and his rediscovery in the 1960s. With informative notes by Mark Humphrey and Robert Crumb's distinctive cover artwork, the set is a loving tribute to one of the genre's greatest and most powerful voices."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Scandinavia wanted to be represented....","review":"Wonderful music on this CD. A few tunes I'm sure you'll recognize too. Rustle of Spring is such a soft gentle song. Even better then if it was on a piano. The Alfven Sweedish Rhapsody is a wonderful, joyful piece. You'd have to be a pretty grumpy person not to enjoy it. And of course typical of Naxos, average orchestration, but also very cheap. I think most anyone will find at least one enjoyable song on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful classic!","review":"This is a verbally and visually stunning book.

The DVD has little to no editorial structure and specifically lacks any true \\"on camera\\" segments that address the viewer. While this method could be valid for some viewers for me I found it very tiring and not worth watching.There are other videos out there that offer information on Puppy training. I would choose them over this one unless you don't mind sitting through this type of format.-----Perhaps the value of this DVD would be to introduce a viewer to what it might be like to take your dog to this particular trainer's puppy kindergarten class.

It has developed into a huge problem for organizations that have to deal with the millions of e-mails that flood their mailboxes, often delivering scams or viruses.It has gotten to the point that more than 60 percent of today's e-mail traffic is spam. And experts estimate that more than five trillion spam messages will be sent in 2005. Such volumes of e-mail result in lost productivity, system downtime, employee frustration, and a host of other problems.It is an axiom in security to know your enemy. Before taking on spammers, Spam Kings is a good place to turn for a look at some of the people responsible for the spam epidemic. The book provides the details, often comical, of the seemingly never-ending cat-and-mouse games played by spammers and members of the antispam cabal dedicated to stopping them. It's a good preview on what a company is getting into when it decides to take on spam."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book on spam","review":"This book is a page turner. The book provides a fast-paced account of spammers and spam fighters, their business practices and respective struggles online and offline. I had picked up the book, simply because I was curious about the motivations of spammers and often wondered: What kind of a person is a spammer and who would respond to those emails and actually buy from them anyway? This book can be an eye-opener and I certainly learned a lot from it. Fun side note: A lot of supporting material is available online, as the spam wars are being fought mostly online. Chances are, you'll find yourself browsing news groups and forums to research and find out more about the various people being discussed in the book.

I have no complains about plastic parts, everything snaps fine together, and the plastic is nice quality enought for the purpose. I still put jammed piece of wax paper into the slots with ornaments, becuase it just feels more \\"comforting\\" in this way. By the way, first I found this piece in Crate and Barrel.

The hatches cannot be closed when figures are in the tank.the only downside of the tank is that the seat positions are very narrow. Vintage Joe, marvel showdown,or Corp figures will not fit easily. Modern CORPS figures will not fit at all.Elite forces, Elite operations, and modern Joe were OK fit and look good in the turret.

Believe it or not, the Swivel Sweeper--with no suction, but with POWERED brushes--picks up more dirt and hair than the Transformax 180 ever did.Considering that the Transformax is much less effective than the Swivel Sweeper but costs five times as much, that makes this product a spectacularly bad value.

That's perfectly alright, since our Windy City boys prove that they're also capable of mastering the modern pop song on this second volume of hits. \\"Baby What a Big Surprise\\" and \\"Feelin Stronger Everyday\\" are 70's classics that will no doubt make appearances on radio until the end of time, and \\"Love Me Tomorrow\\" and \\"Stay the Night\\" are the type of nostalgiac 80's fare that make it easy to recall where you were, which summer it was, and which love of your life you were kissing under the stars. \\"Call on Me\\" is one of the band's several forays into jazz, and the new \\"Show Me a Sign\\" is a sunny burst of bright pop.

Did I mention he's an ex mental patient? And he has a thing for nubile young women? Ok. so this is not the most original of fare. Still, this film succeeds in making you smile at its cleverness. Of course, later when your eating that sausage for dinner, this story has a way of popping up in your mind. Its cheap, its corny and its got a dark irony that is hard to come by these days.In a belecose voice, the butcher says to one of his victims \\"you slut, how low and cheap you make yourself..this is not a whorehouse!\\".

And it's a shame because the writing is actually very good in explaining science concepts. I probably would have otherwise given this book 4 stars. However, constantly having to second-guess my answers in the molar-mass section, for example, was extrememly frustrating because of the errors with the exponents.

There is some amount of Doris Wishman charm in there somewhere, but not enough to save the movie from getting boring very quickly.I wanted to like \\"Nude on the Moon\\", but unfortunately, the title is the only good thing about the movie, and that's just not a good enough reason to waste money nor time on this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Final Cut...The ending.

And he plasters it onto his face for almost the entire movie. It's a blank stare with nothing behind it, and it grates on you quickly. The pace is plodding, and he makes it seem plodding-er.The visuals/sets are an uncomfortable mishmash with no coherence.

Robin Williams being one of my favorite actors and talented to boot, played terribly in this movie. Maybe it was the role he was playing, but he was definitely not the right pick for the role either. I squirmed at his attempt to add humor to a serious role where humor would not have been appropriate.The movie seemed to last forever with no real excitement or suspense. It just told a boring story.

The plot is weak (as in, it's difficult to spot, and when you do spot it, you wonder what the fuss was about), and occasionally the producer shows you something intriguing, and then never follows up with it, leaving you to wonder what the significance was. The little bit of the plot I managed to deduce I felt was lame.. some protesters needed proof that the ceo (or whatever) of a company was a bad guy (who did something completely unrelated to the product of the company) so they can shut his company down.

With the Rememory Project and the Zoe Ocular Implant, every memory a person has is stored.Cutters, like Alan Hackman (Robin Williams) take these stored images and create a life-tape of the person's memories for the family to immortalize the decedent. Obviously, these memories require some editing -- and some more than others. As the group of protesters say, \\"You take murderers and turn them into saints.\\"When Hackman gets a controversial job, he sees a man in the memories of another than he needs to find and ends up uncovering more about the job and himself than he ever cared to.

Unfortunately, his performance is not enough to save this movie from itself. The film had the potential to be a blockbuster. The problem is where it wants to go. It doesn't know if it wants to be a psychological thriller, a Sci-Fi Fantasy or a moving Drama. There wasn't enough to identify the characters and make us care.

Kept reading and reading just to see how all the weird dreams and signals would come together. Nothing.I wanted so much for Lewis to find his way by using his non-seeing senses. This would've been his way of finally bonding with his blind son. It also would've made me care more about whether Lewis ever got back to his son. The characters were transparent and the story predictable. I want to be surprised when I read an adventure like this! I learned nothing new about Africa. I didn't care about the characters.I've read much better books set in the Congo that have me right there with the characters. It was as if Mr. Stevens' editors cut all the visceral descriptions to make room for something else, but I don't know what, exactly. Try again, Mr. Stevens. I want to take a trip when I read.

A great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to premise","review":"The premise makes the book sound exciting: a businessman forced to survive in Africa after the plane he is on crashes. However, the plot doesn't live up to that, being a repeated series of hero gets lost in jungle, hero stumbles across some soldiers, hero gets away from soldiers, hero is lost in jungle again.... Meanwhile, his wife (with apparently unlimited resources) is flying back and forth across the Atlantic repeatedly in order to look for him, taking their blind son along as well.That being said, the audio version of the book is well-done, with the reader doing a good job with making all the voices distinctive and believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curve of the World a Disappointment","review":"For all the hype surrounding this first novel, I expected it to be a potential Deliverance in Africa. What a disappointment. A weak plot, fleshed out by weak descriptive passages of jungle vegetation and various Third World encounters. It is especially galling to see this author beginning this appalling narrative with a quote from Naipaul. We expect more from someone who has read A Bend in the River, but then, perhaps he only read the first line. The entire thesis of the novel---a businessman crashing in the Congo, escaping from his rescuer/captors into the bush, thence searched for by his nearly estranged wife and their precocious, blind son---is so unbelieveable as to be in the final analysis merely irritating. The only way that a serious reader can finish this sophomoric tripe is to continue expecting something interesting (dialogue; plot; character development) to occur before the end. It doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks!","review":"Great book :) Great service, timely response rate and I appreciated all the help :) Recommend it to other readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs links for easier reading (Good books though)","review":"Okay, I love the two books, but the Kindle layout is HORRIBLE!!

Simple. There were numerous spelling, grammatical, and syntax errors, including one in a chapter titles. That is simply unacceptable, especially considering this book was not self-published. Considering that this book did or should have gone through an editor, proofreader, and the author at a minimum, this book should not have the voluminous errors that it does.

The examples are not complete. In one section, the book covers building queries using MSDE and then jumps to building queries with Web Matix and then we just see code. Really, I have been writing ASP code for years and I am looking for a product that will automate this process. I think that Web Matrix may help with this, but Mr. Muller's book didn't show that.

When Cyd's behavior gets out of control, her parents send her to live with her real dad named Frank, who she hasn't seen in about 10 years and lives in New York City.

It is well structured and easy to understand. Furthermore it has a nice ending. But the credibility of the characters is as bad as the tension. So all in all it's a nice but also a very unrealistic novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Badly Written Novel","review":"I did not like this book and especially would not recommend it to young readers. It is full of profanity and bad language. If it were a movie, it would probably be rated R. There is also much repetition and very little information about the character's lives before they were put in the house of stairs. And there's hardly any information about the outside world which is supposed to be somewhat futuristic. Overall, it was NOT a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book was awful!","review":"How could anyone possibly like this book? The plot was confusing, and besides the fact, it was soooo stupid! Could you get anymore ridiculus? Give me a break. Don't read this book unless you have read every other written thing in the history of humankind, because it is a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"House of Stairs","review":"Imagine being blindfolded, placed on an elevator, and shipped to a strange place. When you got there, the place is filled with only stairs. There is no ceiling, no floor, and no walls. That is exactly the situation five 16-year-old orphans' find themselves in, in the book House of Stairs by William Sleator. The five teens must learn ways to survive and obtain food in a special way. Their only food source is a red machine, which will only supply them with food if they demonstrate a series of complex movements, like a dance, that pleases the machine. None of the teens know where they are, how they got there, or why they are there. This book deals with cooperation, strength, and teamwork. I would rate this book two and a half stars because it wasn't a very interesting book. It didn't hold my attention or keep me focused on the main point of the story. It also seemed to have a lot of repetition. However, the author showed a creative story plot with a surprising ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of \\"House of Stairs\\"","review":"I first read this book back in 1980, and found it to be a very haunting story, yet very thought-provoking. At first, the suspense was wondering how the five captives would escape from the house of stairs, but then it turned to how would they survive by making the machine keep producing food for them. It quickly became apparent that the motives behind the people controlling the food machine were evil, when the machine increasingly would only dispense food when negative behaviors were exhibited, namely the teens fighting with each other. This was at a time when they should most be cooperating with each other to find a way out of the trap. The reader will be horrified to see what the machine could condition people to do, and equally horrified that anybody could use orphans in such a cruel experiment. But it is a stern warning as to how easily people's thoughts and actions can be manipulated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, thought provoking and controversial.","review":"Capps touches on time scales, dispensations, biblical history, and the controversial topic of the bride or the body as the question of who the church is very well.

While reading this book I could clearly tell that he is not a bible prophecy scholar. He advocates a pre-trib rapture AND a mid-trib rapture of the church. On page 114 he refers to \\"Revelations 16:15.\\" The title of the book is \\"Revelation\\" not \\"Revelations.\\" An expert should know this. He also tries to prove that the church is not the bride of Christ even though Ephesians 5:25 is a pretty strong argument against his claim. These are just a few of his errors, and he does make many!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor and....","review":"burn this CD. whatever you do, don't believe the hype. it's really not a great CD. nor is it even good. calling it fair might even be an overstatement. 30% of the album consists of actual music with vocals while the remaining 70% is primarily underproduced experimental instrumentation not at all worthy of being called a \\"perfect pop record\\". lest we forget that there are two kinds of pop: pop[ular] pop such as Stacie Orrico or Justin Timberlake and real pop, the latter basing itself around melodies, harmonies and relatively catchy rhythms which this album doesn't come remotely close to any of those. it is boring and not even in a satisfying way. I bought this CD on a whim cos I was a sucker for the hype that surrounded it. the buzz is defintely unwarranted. the pretentious title also seems like a lame attempt to promote democracy. thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A breezy tone of voice makes even epithets appealing!","review":"Give me a break. Just the name \\"Broken Social Scene\\" hints at how this music is artsy fartsy bullsh*t.

With a song like \\"I'm still Your [...] on this album, I see that homophobic epithets (as long as they're spoken in a breezy, wispy tone of voice) are unfortunately still OK to use (just make sure you lie and call your homophobia something like a \\"valid artistic statement of expression\\").Go buy some music that has the balls to admit it's nothing more than something worth enjoying (and no, [...], I didn't say \\"savor the flavors\\").

You know how when you listen to a college station and you hear some great stuff, but you have to wait 30 minutes for the dj to tell you what it was? Well, this is like that, only it's one of those segments in the show where you didn't change the dial, but you really couldn't give a toss who the bands were you just listened to. All the comparisons with other bands made by the other reviewers are spot on - just this isn't as good as any of them.

Stick to the CD and pass on seeing them live. It's been a while since I've seen a gig so poorly mixed and socially distorted. When a relatively unknown band from Canada tries to break new ground in Europe, they might consider not ending the evening by suggesting that the Spanish and Catalan hosts \\"can improve their kitchen.\\" Simply stated, after seeing this collection of noisy musicians, it's easy to recommend they might make an effort to avoid the social commentary and focus on improving their sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired...","review":"Just because Rolling Stone liked the album doesn't mean you have to. Do yourself a favor and buy \\"Hail to the Thief\\" instead. Just because bands like Radiohead and Sigur Ros have been quite successful making experimental pop music, less talented bands feel like they have the excuse to create meandering experimental records. As for this, there is no excuse, simply another dull indie band trying to ride on the coat tails of true musical revolutionaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"original","review":"Ill keep it short.If you are looking for more than verse/chorus songs. If you need a new asthetic and an original atmosphere, this is a good pick. Every song they played changed my view of them, its a very eclectic mix of songs. Lots of crescendos. There are only a few skipable songs. If you are bored with music and want some forward thinking, check this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"No grade inflation here...","review":"This is easily one of the best albums I have purchased this year. An excellent piece of indie pop, this album is easy on the ears, provoking light but contemplative moods. Broken Social Scene (excuse the terrible name: invokes images of cliche'd pretentious wannabe art rock. They really are great!) showcases a wide range of musical styles on this CD. There are atmospheric tracks, driving rock masterpieces (KC Accidental), catchy tunes (Cause=Time). This album is meloncholy, wistful, happy, a little silly, and epic all at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"great live band","review":"Broken Social Scene is one band that any fan of big, majestic, 70's-tinged intelligent rock has to see live. These guys and girl are ready for the big time, that is if there was any outlet for a band this good on radio. Truely a transcendent live RnR experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very diverse collection of great songs","review":"This is the 2nd album from Canadian supergroup Broken Social Scene and it's an incredibly diverse and solid collection of tunes. Musically, it's all over the shop. There's some beautiful instrumentals (Capture the flag, Pacific theme, Pitter patter goes my heart). Some great art-rockers (Almost crimes, KC accidental, Cause=time). There's some sublime balladry on show here as well (Looks just like the sun, I'm still your fag).And Lover's spit sounds like a Radiohead song from an alternate universe had we hijacked a time machine and kidnapped Thom Yorke before he started travelling down the Weirdass Expressway."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much yet so little","review":"I grew up with The Police so take my opinion with a grain of salt but what I've heard of this album sums up what seems so wrong with this incarnation of indie rock. Too many possibilities for bands - all the effects and sub-syles replace what songwriting might be in there - they hit the Dinosaur-Jr style uptempos, grandiose strings / pianos build-ups, and psuedo-trip-hop cool-outs. On \\"Looks just like the Sun\\" a loopy, funky snare beat, acoustic guitar for mellowness and self-assured but weak vocals does not make a good song for me. The vocals just never make it beyond a vapid, quaalude style. The band reminds us their sweet studio also came with a banjo, a Rhodes piano, a real piano, and amps to mimic any guitar sound out there. I actually liked \\"Almost Crimes\\" and from another album \\"Hotel\\" and \\"7/4\\". But all in all this is well-played music that seems empty. I like overdubs and soundeffects just not the motives behind their use, and, well, overuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I expected","review":"There was a whole lot of hype surrounding this album which may have made my expectations too high, but I saw nothing special about this cd. I think there are only 2 or 3 songs worth listening to and everything else was weirdly experimental and completely random. With \\"Anthems for a 17 year old girl\\" and \\"Lover's Spit\\" they showed a lot of potential, these are two really good songs, but not much more worth listening to on the cd. Or maybe I just don't \\"get it.\\" Either way, 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metric does it better","review":"Metric does it better. Emily Haines and James Shaw are also in a much better and more fleshed out band called Metric who are way better than this stuff. She does all the singing so if you like Anthem For a 17 Yr old Girl it would be the worst song on \\"Old world Underground\\", Metric's debut. Buy Metric, because this just doesnt cut it at all and I really don't understand all the hype. I finally gave in after seeing it on every top five list next to the Wrens and Ted Leo and stuff, but wow. I guess I must be the one on crazy pills, Huh?

The album benefits from close attentive listening but it does not demand it, and can also work as background music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Live Album!","review":"Lou Reed's Perfect Night is overall a very good live album. It has alot of great moments and some not so great moments. A few of the songs on this album just aren't Lou's best songs, such as Original Wrapper and Sex With Your Parents. Some songs on here are very good, but the versions aren't quite as good, such as I'll Be Your Mirror. These are the only complaints about the album. The rest is great. The versions of Perfect Day, Vicious, Kicks, Into The Divine, and Riptide are excellent. The standout tracks are Dirty Blvd. and an incredible version of Coney Island Baby. This album is an excellent album for Lou Reed fans and a very accesible album for new fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this cd....","review":"I've been a fan of Lou Reeds for a long time. I've seen him in concert three or four times and I do appreciate his storytelling style.In listening to this CD, I simply wasn't impressed. Vicious, which was always more a parody to me than serious, sounded pretentious. Dirty Boulevard was rushed...the very musicality of the whole concert seemed lackluster. If I was at the show that night, I would have though Reed was having a serious off-night.Using an online radio service, I heard a version of Perfect Day (a wonderful Velvet Underground song, one of my favorites) that I wanted to own. I clicked on buy this album and this was the one it directed me to. Not the same version, but it is still the best song on this CD.Hope this helps..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Live Lou Reed","review":"An excellent album with some old stuff and some new stuff, both of which are surprisingly good."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has its moments, but very few of them.","review":"Remember when Lou Reed was great? And when he actually sang? This live collection is a disappointing document of Reed's current live show--and a blatant attempt to cash in (late, as usual) on the \\"unplugged\\" trend. Some of the tunes, like \\"Kicks\\" and \\"Coney Island Baby\\" are wonderful to hear again, but the butchering of \\"Vicious\\", is very hard to stomach. The vocal delivery is so stuttering and off-handed (even for Lou), it makes you wonder if the guy has forgotten the lyrics. Move over, David Bowie--here comes another once-great has-been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This wonderful live album was recorded live in 1997 at the Royal Festival Hall for the Meltdown Festival. There are 15 tracks which cover most of Reed's finest songs.The most noteable feature of this album is the crystal clear sound. This is immediately obvious from the first track \\"I'll be your mirror\\". Lou has a fantastic accoustic guitar sound. He describes it in the sleeve notes as \\"the sound of diamonds\\". Don't be mislead by this, the album isn't an unplugged album, although there is an element of that style that creeps into this album. In fact on numbers like 'Busload of Faith', after a gentle introduction the band really rocks out.The other musicians are Mike Rathke - Guitar, Fernando Saunders - Bass and vocals, Tony Smith - Drums and Vocals.I think this album would serve as a great starter album for people new to Lou Reeds music, and as it looks as though it may be unavailable fairly soon you should grab a a copy of this as soon as you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOTS ON THE ICE!!!","review":"Can't rave enough about this pair of ice skates!

This fits the bill while giving you weight bearing exercise. Naturally with this complete lens system, it is highly recommended that you use appropriate software that has the lens correction for this lens to account for roll-off, vignetting and barrel distortion at the short focal lengths etc. But it is all well worth it, even with the weight because of all the glass required to achieve its objectives.

The main problem for me was that this book is too grounded in a western medical background. For instance, the author states the standard western position that multiple sclerosis is incurable but with symptoms that can be controlled. In my opinion, when someone says that something is \\"incurable\\" what they really mean is that they don't understand the root causes of the disease. In my further opinion, it is irresponsible to declare that something is \\"incurable\\" as it closes people off to the possibility that they could successfully cure themselves. Returning to the example of MS, there are many people who have successfully cured themselves by treating and clearing their underlying toxicity problems.

Don't get me wrong - there are mistakes in a lot of texts. But, usually, there are only 1-2, at most. In Louie, there were apostrophes where they weren't supposed to be, no apostrophes when needed, spelling mistakes. It reminds me of another book I read - Nightmares Echo.

Would highly recommend!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Leslie needs new music. It's monotonous and can hardly be heard above her voice. Every mile is the same beat. Nothing changes. I have the 3 mile DVD and will go back to that. Don't waste your money on the 5 Day Walk Plan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"Leslie FINALLY uses DVD technology! You can actually customize your workout. Love it! I only have one complaint, the miles are referred to by color instead of by length. Just a tad bit annoying. I recommend this for novice as well as expert walkers. Leslie's the same bubbly person she always is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Let Down","review":"So I been waiting on this DVD like forever. A total Flop! The execution is aweful. So she has 3 miles 4 miles 1 mile 2 miles and 5 miles. The problem is that after you finish one mile and your heart rate is up the next mile starts off slow as if you are just starting out. This is my third Leslie DVD. Her five day slim down is way better cause its five individual miles but they transition into each other meaning you just gonna go faster til five. So you can just do one or go all the way to five with your heart rate staying up.I also have her 1&2 mile which I love. Two more things. The tonining sessions or should I say what toning session....less than five mins. Last point, Leslie has a face full of make up and a snooky hump, so not cool. Glad i only paid 8 bucks. Will be selling it for 5 at my yardsale on saturday, totally a waste of money and space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This is not for advanced walkers. What you get is series of 1 mile walks that are not very challenging, Leslie does noteven break a sweat. Save your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Hear The Music!","review":"I like this DVD Leslie Sansone: Ultimate 5 day Walk Plan. My problem with this is the music was play to low, we had a hard time hearing it when Leslie was talking. I think people who chose to buy this Ultimate Walk DVD are expreience with all the basic moves, so not so much talking that we can hear the (BEAT) music much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I own at least 10 Leslie Sansone workouts. This is my new favorite! It has a few different moves in it than other workouts I have,and you can program your own workout,pick which miles and toning you like and have a custom workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have been a fan of Leslie for a while. I have several of her videos. This one has a warm-up before each mile, and it doesn't tell you anywhere how much time each days' walk will take. The music is just plain dull. Get Five Fast Miles it is the best. Also the participants are too much like models than real women. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I'd hoped","review":"I was really excited to get this dvd so I could do a different workout each day. There are 5 different miles on thisbut that's just it, 5 DIFFERENT MILES! Whatever day you pick, it just mixes them together. So you really get going and then have to wait in neutral after the first mile is done for the next one to pick up. Each mile is a great workout, but I prefer her 2, 3, and 4 mile walks that are all done in one session."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, allows as much or as little as YOU choose","review":"Leslie has a winner here, that I will use for YEARS. With five different walks, the DVD (thanks) is set so you can design your own mix of what is on it. Great for time constrained people. PLUS it is varied. BUT remember, based on walking--it is varied within the constraints of the human body. So it does repeat a fair amount. Remember, is about WALKING...and walking is either forward, back or sideways. Personally, I listen to radio or music while DVD is on mute. My suggestion to mix it up with more variety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I have all of Leslie video walks, and I enjoy this because it has different moves. My only slight complaint, I wish I was able to turn the voice off and just have music, like another popular video I have.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this dvd!","review":"This is one of my favorite Leslie Sansone dvds. The Friday workout is 5 great miles in 60 minutes plus the warm up, cool down and stretch for a total of almost 75 minutes. It is a great workout and each mile is color themed with a different combination of walkers who are my favorites from her different dvds. Love this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this plan","review":"I have been a fan of Leslie for the past year. I like variety and this DVD provides the opportunity to build your own workout. It's fast 12 minute miles and has strength training to boot. I love this DVD. New background and faces, a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this walk plan DVD","review":"I have a lot of Leslie's walk DVDs but I especially like this one. There are a lot of choices and you can even mix and match the different walk miles to make up your own workout. I also like that if you want to do \\"floor\\" exercises other than just cardio she has included them as well. The workout music is especially motivational also."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lot of Fun","review":"A fun way to mix up the miles. Definitely for the experienced walker. Being able to choose the number of miles and which miles avoids the boredom factor. Thanks Leslie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Athletic and pregnant","review":"Before my pregnancy, I was healthy, weight training and running half marathons. I'm now 6 months pregnant and unable to do any of my previous high-impact workouts. A nurse recommended this video and I was really skeptical, walking?? In PLACE?? I've done some of the walks, and once I got over the fact that I was just walking in place, it's actually what I need right now. I can make it more intense on days I have extra energy, but on days where I just need to get moving a little bit, following along is enough. The weight/toning sessions are very simple, but once you know the moves you can do extra sets if you're up for it.It seems that Leslie has quite a following of women who have been successful losing weight and getting moving from a more sedentary lifestyle, kudos to all of those folks! But I also recommend this to other people who generally can do more athletic workouts, but need something low-impact for whatever reason (pregnancy, injury, etc...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome workout!!","review":"This is a great video for beginners and advanced alike. I love the ability to createmy own workout with this video. I would definitely recommend this video to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still walking with Leslie","review":"I own about 10 of Leslie's videos. I found this one to be very refreshing with different music and a few new moves. Each mile is 12 minutes long. The strength sessions are a little lame but I would buy this again just for the five miles. Leslie is a little less \\" goofy\\" in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Age is not a factor","review":"At seventy-one and with two knee replacements and one wrist with a plate and eight screws in it; exercise routines are not easy to find. Floor exercises are out unless there is a crane available to get me up. I can walk well now and enjoy walking the dog though with his stop and sniff routine, it is not aerobic. So this works well for me. My heart rate increases and I sweat. I feel like I did something good for myself each time. I alternate her tapes, using a different one each day, averaging 5 days a week and then repeat. Her laugh does bother me and the incessant talking. But she is so warm hearted and encouraging to her viewers that I try to overlook that. I usually set it for a 5 mile walk and only add one of the strength training sessions. I like all of her tapes for different reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"I really like Leslie Sansone. My one suggestion would be that she include an option to just hear the music and not her talking. I always get such a great workout, but her constant talking is annoying. Please, Leslie, after we have learned the moves we really don't need anything but music to do them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little that is new here, but definitely reliable Leslie Sansone","review":"Leslie maintains all of her various walking activities which are good options for indoor exercise and a full cardiac workout, especially for those who have some physical limitations or are not in excellent shape. I have both back and knee problems and can modify this workout to a level of intensity that is appropriate for me. The only reason not to give it five stars is that in order to get a walk that is more than one mile (15 minutes), different \\"one mile\\" walks are added for additional time, so it's choppy to move through the sequence for a given day. In the interest of full disclosure, I haven't viewed the entire DVD, since I use it so supplement actually walking outdoors when the weather isn't pleasant."},{"rating":"2","title":"beep beep","review":"I got two, one for each of my britts. even when set to the same sound the beepers sound slightly different so I can track them easily. easy on off, only used one season so can't say how durable yet"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite sun glasses...","review":"Pros: Nice, light, fit well, bought on GOOD clearance so 5 starsCons: Didn't come with a hard case, but not a big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A peerless Latin album!","review":"The egregious pianism of Chucho Valdez is once more, carved in relief through this nonesuch recording.But, let's go by parts.

While my daughter (now 4 months) will look at the shapes, she doesn't seem all that interested in them. She will hold one for a few seconds and then just throws them aside. They are too big for her to do much with. She has been more interested in the other Manhattan Baby toys that I purchased for her, such as Mr. Whoozit.

The game has more features comparing to the first one, but it's worthless when you can't even play it. The menues are fine, all the options are fine, but when you try to take a ride... you're screwed. I lowered the resolution to the least that I could (538 x 340) with low texture details and shadow settings off, it still lagged. It's not worth the furstration.

Apparently, pretty damn far! Story opens with half of everyone in the world gone, just vanished! Including, Lois. Superman begins to loose grasp of his humanity in a big way as he finds not only can he not save everyone all the time and that he is not always in the right all the time, but that a device of his own creation caused the vanishing in the first place (a Phantom Zone generator he was to use in case Earth was to fall the same fate as Krypton). The crisis of faith is the theme of this story as Kal confides in a dying priest for clarity.Jim Lee's art is, of coarse, remarkable. The story (especially in vol. 1) can be a bit on the confusing side, but it's still a cool read. The addition of General Zod is pretty nice too"},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming Superman","review":"Great cover, nice premise, weak story. That pretty much sums up the book. What could have been a post apocalyptic vision of Superman's world and his struggle in it, ends up being a muddled psycho treatise on nothing. What can you do with the world's most powerful hero who can do everything? Explore his vulnerabilities of course, which is why this story tries to do, to no avail. The lack of continuity and disparate storyline coupled with a muddled Superman and muddled plot (this and part two) flunk this book. Do we care ? That seems to be the one question Azzarello fails to ask. A bunch of scenarios and set ups only reveal the emptiness of Superman at the core in this one. It's hard to reinvent the character, and this is disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"JIM LEE!","review":"First off, I'll start by saying the art to this is amazing, the cover is epic, one of my favorite Superman covers I've seen. In fact, the cover and artwork inside inspired me to buy this. But... The story is just \\"decent\\" at least in Volume 1. As many people here have said, the story jumps around and it's a little hard to focus on. I also found Superman a little bit of a jerk in this. I mean, he has good reasons to be, but it's just weird seeing him act the way he did in some panels. I'd really rate this 4 stars, but the art is just that good to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great Superman story (vol 1)","review":"First I have to say, Jim Lee's artwork is great.

I think the B-52's died about twenty years ago with their last album before Time Capsule. A sikened reminding of what happend to all those popular 60s and 70s rock stars is put into the B-52's new album. I agree with the album itself. These truly unreleased songs probably wern't released because they weren't good enough to be realeased. These songs are horrible and if you like the old B-52's don't bother with this piece of junk unless you're a collector. On a final note I conclude that they really are too old to be doing this and they better be hoping that the future generation will like this retarted idea of a record."},{"rating":"1","title":"i don't get them at all","review":"a catchy group along the lines of Dee-lite.basic forgettable music.Love Shack is a throwaway Rolling stones Riff that blew up.i don't get them at all.the writting&production.they remind me of a real life Flinstones band."},{"rating":"2","title":"B-52 is the bomb","review":"Awesome compilation of the B52s kind of off-beat, wacky, yet lovable and totally listenable music. The lyrics of many tunes are weird but funny. Scneider's goofy singing style somehow works well too. Lots of tracks here, including lesser-known gems. Especially cool tunes: Rock Lobster, Private Idaho, Mesopotamia [kinda eerie in a way], Love Shack [probably the one with most radio play back in the day], Roam, and Good Stuff. But all are solid. Very good CD to pop in and just let play, no need to be anywhere near the skip button."},{"rating":"1","title":"better off with something else","review":"I heard the album and decided not to but it for the simple fact that all the songs on this album weren't the \\"best\\". Like most of the reviews, songs like \\"she breaks for rainbows\\", \\"dance this mess around\\", \\"girl from..\\", \\"give me back my man\\", and \\"revolution earth\\" (which was a single), didn't make it on this cd. i would have been happy with just \\"good stuff\\" but \\"T-I-S\\" isn't any good at all.

It's hugely original, very listenable to and definitely gets you dancing. I always play 'Rock Lobster' and 'Love Shack' at parties and I have never seen anyone not dance to them. Other favs are 'Private Idaho' and 'Roam'. This is music which appeals to a wide range of people. Punks like it cos it has great energy. The album also has great melodies so can appeal to those who like more traditional forms of pop. Yoko Ono once said that it was the B-52's music that convinced John Lennon to come out of retirement in the late 1970's. Buy this album- you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most of the best songs of my favorite band","review":"The B-52's are about as much fun as a band can be, both live and on recordings.

What I'd forgotten was how much humor there was in all their songs. Of the one's I hadn't heard, I've fallen in love with many. This won't be my last 52's cd. I think I need to acquire Mesopotamia and Cosmic Thing (I missed the title track from this collection) to start with! What the 52-s do different from most bands is tell humorous stories, over catchy, energetic, get your feet tapping & crank the volume tunes. I was so surprised to find out that I like every single song on this album - that almost never happens. I don't think it's just a nostalgia kick - this band really rocks.After I got this I had it in the car for nearly 2 weeks before I changed it. The only other CD I can listen to for that long is the 2nd CD in the 4-CD Led Zeppelin compilation.

Every song on this CD is great, including the two new ones, \\"Debbie\\" and \\"Hallucinating Pluto,\\" both of which I love. \\"Debbie\\" for it smart lyrics and great sounds, and \\"Hallucinating Pluto\\" for its off-beat, B-52's innovated quirkiness.

This album may work well as an instrumental version, or, redone by the likes of Natacha Atlas, Alabina, Fairuz, etc...

The author attacks amateurism as fraudulent and unworkable, and shows that scandals have recurred almost since the game's founding (by rebellious students) in the late 1800's. We also learn that athletic programs rarely turn profits or boost fund-raising for their host schools. Despite these criticisms, this author (and ex-player at Northwestern) remains as attached to the game as us fans. Telander concludes his concise and highly readable book with a sensible proposal for reform. \\"The Hundred Yard Lie\\" fell on predictably deaf ears when first published in 1989.

This new novel, however, leaves much to be desired. I read the first 250 pages or so before I finally got too bored to continue. Parker clearly knows how to put words and sentences together, but his talent stops there. Plot and character development are almost entirely absent from this book.Parker should write poetry. His love for language is that of a poet's. He lacks what it takes to be an interesting novelist on the scale of John Gardner, John Updike, or Gore Vidal. That is to say, he lacks the ability to infuse his fiction with engaging concepts and an interesting story.If you want to read Parker's work, pick up Hello Down There, though you might be better advised to read Fred Chappell, Jay Parini, or David Slavitt, all of whom are fantastic novelists."},{"rating":"1","title":"It only gets worse","review":"This is one of the most unfulfilling books I have ever read.

I'll stick with the expensive but trustworthy OEM one.On the other hand, I've bought Creative charge cables from this brand and had no problems with them.Also, the previous review is incorrect...this is a transfer AND charge cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT work as a charge cable","review":"Haven't tried it as a data cable, but it doesn't do half of the job it's advertised to do. My main reason for purchasing one was in hopes that it would be able to charge via a cigarette lighter-to-USB adapter I have in my car. No such luck. Doesn't even charge when plugged into a PC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk - locked up my ZEN","review":"Bought this because I needed a shorter and less bulky cable than the USB cable that came w/ the ZEN for my Ford SYNC/Creative ZEN car hookup. Half way through the first song it stopped playing, said \\"BAD MEDIA\\" on my car's SYNC display, and the ZEN player locked up in docked mode. I had to stick a paperclip in the small hole in the bottom of the ZEN to reset it. Like I said, piece of junk. But what can you expect for 1 cent these days?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, but shallow","review":"I love a good chick lit book--I'm on a first name basis with Bridget, Jemima and Becky, but the nameless chick of Easy is someone I wouldn't want to be around. The book is funny, but the character spends the entire book talking about sex and pot. Her constant approach to finding a man based on the size of his package is funny at first, but sad and pathetic in the end. I felt like there wasn't really a whole lot of plot to pull me into this self-absorbed, sexually promiscuous and chemically altered world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vacation Read","review":"I usually read science fiction, but wanted something else to read on my cruise. So I picked up Emma Gold's books \\"Easy\\" and \\"Hard.\\" I loved them. They are the perfect books to read when you don't want anything to bother you and when you want to live in someone elses world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I struggled to read Easy last summer and I hated it. The main character just seemed too desperate and I didn't like her at all.Comparing this book to Jemima J and Bridget Jones is completely wrong because Jemima J and Bridget Jones were both likeable, funny characters and Easy had none of that. I recommend that you skip this book and read a Sophie Kinsella, Jane Green, or Helen Fielding book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tribute!","review":"Elaine Elias is an excellent jazz keyboardist . She is engaged with the real spirit of the saudade ( a clever term employed in Brazil to design something more than a farewell , you may consider it nostalgia but it goes far beyond this meaning) .Anyway his magic fingers and velvet voice carries you to Rio de Janeiro and evoke the smooth mood and the seductive rhythm in every track .Elias made a sincere tribute not only to Brazil but all his talented composers Vinicio de Moraes , Milton Nascimento, Jobim these pioneers of the bossa nova and glorious and timeless themes such Garota de Ipanema , Agua de beber, Chega de saudade , Dindi , March waters ,Brazil, Black Orpheus or one note samba are some of the most emblematic titles of that febrile land so filled of charm and mystery ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Unbearable","review":"This CD made me realize I am a Brazilian music purist. Could not bear the new age additions of running water and singing children; no doubt a talented pianist, but these tunes are lousy with studio pyrotecnics. I am donating this to my grandmother's senior home after listening just once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I think this is one of the better books I have on Macram��, especially if you are interestedIn designing your own pieces. This is NOT a book with projects to copy but gives a goodBasis form how to form knots and gives tons of photos and close ups so that you can seeHow they were used in projects. More for the Creative person who wants to design than beginnerOr person that wants step by step instructions for individual projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very good--but not great","review":"In FINAL VERDICT, author Sheldon Siegel has crafted a solid courtroom mystery that narrowly misses being thrilling.Siegel is an excellent writer, and his knowledge of the law--and, most specificly, of trial law--shines on every page. He constructs scenes and dialogue that have razor sharp edges to them.Still, he seems determined to broadcast the resolution of this whodunit early and often in the novel. Even though he patiently and laboriously leads the reader to the final discovery, he makes it too clear how this mystery will be solved.In mysteries, authors who give no clues can frustrate their readers. Siegel gives too many clues, ruining what should have been an unexpected and clever ending.Nonetheless, FINAL VERDICT is very, very good reading, certainly more than good enough to warrant reading the other novels by this same author."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER GREAT NOVEL IN THIS SERIES","review":"Mike Daley and former wife Rosie Hernandez, are great defense team in San Francisco. In this great story, FINAL VERDICT, they are back after a year teaching in law school. They had decided not to do murder cases, old problem client, Leon Walker, draws them in and makes the legal team a target of the DA's office and the police. A great story that keeps you guessing, including the clients health. Will he make it to trial? If you are not reading SHeldon Siegel and the Mike Daley series, get the first one and begin. You can't go wrong. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"2","title":"final verdict","review":"I was looking for a new mystery writer and found this Sheldon Siegel book. It takes place in the Bay Area which is close to where I live. I can hardly wait to read the complete Mike Daley mystery series from the start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Completely predictable. Leon Walker is a weak protagonist. Paper thin plot, unbelievable characters. Awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product.","review":"I modified this product by cutting it to fit a custom new pickup tube on an old RV, I just cut it near the metal fitting and used a S/S clamp to attach it to the tube so this strainer cold be used in the same manor on most systems. NOTE it is a plastic strainerNot metal but is well made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just An Abstract","review":"This is only an abstract of an article, nothing else.

A phenomenal work! I enthusiastically recommend it to all.(Also recommended: CATCHER IN THE RYE, by J.D. Salinger; ON THE ROAD, by Jack Kerouac; JOHN BARLEYCORN, by Jack London; CAT'S CRADLE, by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.; THE WOMAN WHO WALKED INTO DOORS, by Roddy Doyle; BIG SUR, by Jack Kerouac.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"doggie window gaurd","review":"These are very easy and practical to use.

This book, a collection of the first five issues of Captain America comics, is a fine read, indeed! There's a particularly outstanding drawing of the Captain in \\"The Hunchback of Hollywood and the Movie Murders\\" where he stands majestically \\"outside\\" the panels, which alone is probably worth the price of the book. The only complaint I could make is that the _entire_ contents of the comic books aren't presented here - backup stories, text features; but this is probably a minor drawback. It's CAPTAIN AMERICA, for crying out loud!! If further collections are planned, I am definitely ordering them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back memories","review":"Exactly as I remembered as a child! My kids love them, too!

A MUST BUY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Children's Recording","review":"I'm a children's librarian and this CD is my all-time favorite since I discovered it 14 years ago! These are songs with humor and heart, with outstanding arrangements to boot. Great to listen to and even more fun to sing along. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Since Muhammad couldn't go to the mountain.....","review":"Simply a very good read. One needn't be familiar with the traditions of the Desert Fathers, apophatic theology, or the Yamabushi warrior traditions of Japan to feel a kinship with this work. Rather, a very serious subject is treated with great respect and sensitivity. Composer Alan Hovaness writes, \\"Mountains are symbols of mankind's search for God,\\" and Allen Ginsberg tells us, \\"Things are symbols for themselves.\\" In this book, the mountain and the desert are allowed to both be symbols of the seeking soul and symbols of themselves--they are encountered as we internalize them in our quest, and they are encountered as they really are: cold, hard, lonely, and often dangerous.Mountains and deserts occur in cities as well. Should you find yourself struggling with one, this book may just be the companion you need."},{"rating":"1","title":"fragments of soul","review":"Rather sad book which draws on his erudition and his personal experience. The background is interesting, but when he describes his experience with his mother\`s decline and death, for me he descends into unconvincing sentimentality. I guess he should stick to the academic writing he is undoubtedly skilled in, as those are the best parts of the book. Little genuine experience of the relationship of the physical to the spiritual desert comes through for me with any conviction. I\`m glad he survived;but it doesn\`t share enough of his experience to enlighten me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressed midwestern view of deserts","review":"Mr. Lane and I share a love of the desert but that's where it ends. He has a romantic and sentimental view, from St. Lewis, of deserts as a good place to go when you're sad. He trys to be sad in St. Louis but it's just not the same. (If I was in St. Louis I'd be sad, maybe I should write a book about that.) If you're looking for a reason to go to the desert and be sad, then this is the book for you!
