However, my biggest weakness was what to do with my right hand - something that would make the chord changes a little more interesting than V V V VThis book was a tremendous help as far as developing a struming toolkit that actually made all those vanilla chord changes sound a lot more like \\"music\\". My only nitpick is that the included CD had \\"background\\" insturments, in addition to the guitarist - which in some cases made it difficult to pick out the nuances of the strumming/picking patterns. But that it is a minor problem with this otherwise outstanding book - one that has made a enormously positive impact on my playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could be beter.","review":"It's a good book, but the descriptions are a bit misleading. You need to know that it uses different formats for showing the different kinds of rhythm patterns. It has slash marks for strums, and tab for finger picking. If you're not familiar with these types of notations, you might have difficulty reading the rhythms. Be sure and read the intro as it explains most of the symbols.The CD has the rhythms, but it would have been far better if all the instruments except the guitar and a metronome had been left out. Its difficult to separate them from the rest of the music. And they could have been twice as long as they are to give a better feel for the rhythm.Not a bad book, but not a great one either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent choice","review":"I purchased my Ferret Nation 143 and it was an excellent buy, my husband and I attached the add on to our 141 in under 10 minutes, all the parts were there and the directions were easy to follow.

I have both and thought I'd get this cage for them- the rats slipped right through the bars. I'm waiting on the Chins, but after I bought this (of course) I read that the bars should only be 1\\"x1/2\\" apart as they bounce off the walls and may break their legs with larger gaps. Now I have to reinforce this cage. Chins and Rats also chew plastic, which I knew; I plan to replace the pans with galvanized pans (which would be nice if Ferret Nation offered those too)!FERRET NATION- IF YOU'RE READING THIS- PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING A CHIN/RAT CAGE/PARTS THAT IS JUST AS GREAT AS YOUR FERRET CAGE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it.","review":"Given its reasonable price and quantity, I was surprised at the quality of the twine.

On some songs, she sounds like an actor on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE parodying a jazz singer, holding notes forever for no apparent reason or overdoing the \\"emotion\\" badly.

First she has a great ear for wonderful songs and writers. Lyle Lovett, Tom Waits, Charlie Chaplin.. need I say more. Her approach on this record is more of an eccentric cabaret singer than jazz, but she and her accompanying duo swing on \\"I Were a Bell\\". As she has artistically matured, she has gradually abandoned most of the quirky vocal stylings she exhibits on this release, yet you gotta love her adventurous nature. The arrangements are really cool ( \\"Trust in Me\\" and Chaplin's \\"Smile\\" come to mind) with the exception of her disasterous rendition of Lerner & Loewe's \\" On the Street Where you Live\\", where she drops the ball by approaching it as a stalker's lament.

Curt's voice is amazing and blends pefectly with the poppy music. Mayfield went the opposite direction of Orzabal and his new edgy version of TFF, sounding more light and fun.\\"What are we fighting for\\", a fast yet melodic jam, is my favorite track; but the slower songs like \\"Trees\\" show off Smith's beautiful vocals that could pass as a musical instrument.Smith and Orzabal are on the verge of releasing a new album together (Everybody Loves a Happy Ending) in April 04'.

It's a very nice looking item, I'm sure it keeps beverages hot for a good while. However, we have not received one intact. Our first shipment came with the carafe wrapped in bubble-wrap that was flat, in a box filled with Fill-air that had migrated to the sides, and a shattered carafe. We filed for a return and, as a joke, gave the shattered carafe to our sis-in-law (blamed the kids for dropping it). The next day we received the replacement item. They realized that the bubble wrap was useless, so they didn't bother with it at all. This time one of the feet is broken.

A must read for your child!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"This was on the 8th grade summer reading list, and I read it, deciding it was probably better than Wuthering Heights or A Tale Of Two Cities. I was right! The plot, albeit unrealistic ( one valley survives a nuclear war), was gripping and suspenceful. The author unknowlingly leads us into a cliff-hanger ending- does Ann find any more people? Z for Zachariah is a good book, although some people may find it's dark plot depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Z for Zachariah- A Fun and Exciting Book","review":"Z for Zachariah is one of the most exciting and adventurous books I have ever read. The book is written in a journal format. It is a book about courage and being brave. A girl named Ann Burden (sixteen years old) is supposedly the last person on Earth after a nuclear bomb was dropped. Then a man named John Loomis comes along. To see what happens, you need to read this book. Will they live happily ever after or will something go wrong? Will John and Ann get along or will they fight?The book's setting is in a small valley located in the United States. This is important because the radiation from the bombs kill everything but it skipped Ann's valley. Ann is always couragous and she needs to be because she is all alone. The story is a science-fiction adventure book and every page is exciting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A must not read","review":"Z for Zachariah tells of Ann Burden and her struggle against John Loomis, who are the last people on earth thanks to a nuclear war. In the beginning, when he arrives, he seems nice, but gradually John tries to control everything, including Ann, and a radioactive safe suit. I think it was supposed to be suspenseful, but it was quite boring. The language was uninteresting, and the author rarely used things like foreshadowing, figurative language, etcetera. The book is one giant death rattle ending in rigor mortis for the author (literally and figuratively). A bunch of monkeys typing on a 1922 model typewriter could bang out a better story."},{"rating":"1","title":"B for Bad","review":"This is a book in diary format about a young girl named Ann Burden. Ann is the only person left in her area because of a war that killed her friends and family. As boring day goes on to boring day, there is nothing new until Jack Loomis arrives in the valley Ann calls home.I definitely would not recommend this book to anyone with refined reading tastes. The plot is too bland making the whole book dry. You cannot relate to the characters, unless you are a psychopath or a sixteen-year-old orphan who lives on a farm. If you happen to like monotonous and idiotic stories, feel free to read Z for Zachariah."},{"rating":"1","title":"torture to be made to read it.","review":"i was made to read this book over the summer. i think that if they wont't let us see pg13 movies in school then we shouldn't be able to read this book. it contains adult information and an y\\\\unsuccesful rape.. it was bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it lives up to be","review":"When I read the first chapter of this book, I had a feeling that it would be filed with surprise, susupense, and intrigue.

I read this book about 3 years ago, and thought it was one of the best, most exciting books I'd ever read. So, a few days ago, I went to the library and checked it out to read it again. I started reading ... and fell asleep! What a snooze-fest! The descriptions were tedious, and in some instances, hard to visualize. I really didn't like Ann Burden at all, in fact. I didn't even finish it. I just got fed up with the way-off-base characters and boring farm description. In conclusion, read it if you're in the 9-12 age group, but beware, it doesn't hold up in a second reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay book","review":"This book did not satisfy my reading requirements for when I read books. I thought the language and writing was to plain and the events were exciting but they came out boring because they were so undescriptive. The book ahd a good plot but the characters seemed less real. Ann seemed a little to mature and smart for being only 16 years old and it seemed kind of weird that the only other person living was Mr. Loomis who was a bad man. I believe that the book had a good start but the writing was just not enough and caused me to become bored of the book part way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different kind of review than most others","review":"This book did not satisfy my reading requirements for when I read books.

The good parts were about 5 of the 30 odd chapters. Most of it was telling us that she was diging in the garden. There were a few good surprises though, so if you enjoy a heart-gripping sci-fi, go out and read Z for Zachariah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooooooky...","review":"Although the protagonist/narrator of 'Z for Zachariah' is a 16 year old girl, the adult tone pervading this book makes it a solid read for fans of post-apocalyptica. Young Ann Burden's Garden of Eden, where she's managed to hole up after a nuclear war, is every survivalist's dream, and Ann is in a class beyond many overwrought teen heroines: she's sensible, focused, capable with farm equipment, undeterred by long-term situations like lack of winter heat and even makes the effort to keep up her faith by going to church. The way she handles the strange events which unfold around and to her is both oddly dated and admirably forward. The story is economically told; readers who want histrionics and who aren't interested in the details of surviving horrific experiences probably shouldn't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Z for Zachariah","review":"This book is extreemly slow and is too imature and is quite a good book for begginers.It has only two characters.It is about a girl left alone in a vally, which has its own wheather, after a terrible nuciar explosion which killed everbody. Untill she meets this guy who is an isane man who wants her to be his slave. He also tries to [physically attack} her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one that thinks Ann is an idiot?","review":"Seriously. Mr.Loomis shows up and destroys her life. He locks her out of her store, kicks her out of her house, tries to rape her or something in the night, takes her tractor, shoots her in the leg, hunts her down, takes her dog, the list goes on and on, and what does Ann say \\"Well, maybe its my fault.\\" REALLY!!!!!! How is it your damn fault. Mr Loomis is a psycho and you're a dumbass. (That is why I wanted to scream to her. Then later when Mr.Loomis takes her dog and tracks her with it she gets an idea. I was like FINALLY she is going to shoot the damned Mr.Lookis bastard. Nope SHE DECIDED TO SHOOT THE DOG!!!!. REALLY???? She had many chances to kill Mr.LOOmis yet never took any of them.

I disliked it mainly because the heroine, Ann, needs to get a backbone. After nursing a horrible murderer back to health and then being shot by the very same person would drive me crazy. The first part of the book is terribly boring, and once the real action starts you can't relate the book to real life. The end leaves you hanging - if you can call it an ending! The rest of my class has the same opinions, and now we have to go through this torture again: we have to re-read it for a final exam! I personally (and heed these words) am considering an F as opposed to re-reading this excuse for a novel. So take the advice of a kid and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly dull","review":"I read this during my post-apocolyptic reading phase and found it bad beyond belief.. There is only so far I can suspend my disbelief and this, well...1, I find it hard to accept that everyone in this magically missed valley would all drive out hoping to meet the neighbours, once the radios had gone silent.2. Ann's sudden submissive attitude, granted she's only a teenager, but she's had to grow up a lot over the last few weeks, months etc. and shouldn't just lie down and let Loomis take her valley.3. The magically missed valley.4. That all her family would have abandoned her, surely if they wanted to find help, they should have stayed together.and of course the constant references to the chickens and how lonely she was. Personally, if I had been her, I wouldn't have fled the house after the attempted rape, he still was weak, but stayed and put rat poison in his tea.such a dull, boring and depressing book, (even for post-nuclear fiction)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze Fest","review":"I have to agree with eskimo wolf's comments.

They are most likely the last people on earth, due to a nuclear war. John has a safe suit that can protect him from radioactivity, and he wil kill to keep it. He is very controlling, and tries to control everything, including Ann. This book was very boring for me, the ending was a bit more unprdictable, but how the characters acted didn't make much sense. The whole book was supposed to be suspenseful, but the tone and style used by the author (no foreshadowing, or figurative language) made it very boring. Maybe the ending was better because Rober C O'Briens's wife finished the book after he died. This book could have been much better if the writing wasn't so simple.

I just got so bored with Ann and Mr. Loomis having their little war and Ann just kept letting Mr. Loomis beat up on her. I wish Ann took charge and stuck up for herself instead of taking the abuse from Mr. Loomis. It was a real disappointment. It was way too slow and nothing really happened.

For one thing both your Editorial Reviews misrepresent the book as being set after a \\"nuclear holocaust\\" but nuclear, biological and chemical weapons were all used and, as the man Loomis says, most people were killed by nerve gas. Also, the author uses the hoary old fiction that a special suit will protect against what seems to be fairly intense radiation, an inclusion which could contribute to the general misunderstanding of radiation and its effects. And last but not least is the scene where Loomis gropes the heroine, an event that could be construed as anti-male."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was awsome!","review":"This book was recommended to me by my teacher.

The book takes place in the future after a nuclear war. \\"Magically\\", 16-year-old Ann Burden manages to stay alive, thinking she is the only person left in the world. She encounters another man and he becomes extremely protective as they interact in the valley. In my opinion, it was too slow-paced and focused on details that were irrelevant to the book. It was very unrealistic, especially how Ann was the only person in the valley that just happened to escape the effects of the nuclear war. The writing was monotonous and colorless. The climax was very weak, and I found it hard to relate to Ann at all. The voice from which it was told was dreadfully uninteresting. I'd possibly be interested in reading the book if it were told from Mr. Loomis's view or an omniscient view.

I like the flat body over the square body lancet and when I use it, I hardly feel it piercing the skin but I always, and I mean always, get blood. Sometimes I'm even surprised I get blood because I didn't feel it going in. I don't know but it seems to me that the needle is sharper or smaller than other brands I've used.

The great contributions of Great Britain and Australia to music in the 1980's in my opinion comes largely from their composers and performers effectively combining the power and harmonic complexity of some classical music compositions of the mid 1920's to the early 1950's (no doubt the origins of some great movie scores) with the emerging sophistication and always present upbeat effect of rock and roll.

It's full of hectic shootouts and explosions but doesn't have much of cast or any kind of cohesive plotting. Joe Lara sleepwalks through his role as Decoda, the cop on a mission, and co-writer/producer/co-star Evan Lurie, muscles ablazing, tries to be a Sylvester Stallone clone, with about as much acting ability. The effects are cheesy and there's no real logic behind the whole process of holographing these criminals. And the movie has the most incompetent police force on screen.

The mainstream media is sooooooo liberal and so favorable to Democrats that if this book had ANY SHRED OF TRUTH OR PROOF TO IT- you bet your life on it that they would report it! Over and over, I might add. The tactics of the left wing know no limits. This book is for the gullible and the people who love fantasy stories. UNBELIEVABLE - the author should thank his lucky stars that he isn't being sued for slander!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad, so paranoid, so illogical.","review":"Of all the irrational political books on the market, this ranks among the worst. It's worse than Michael Moore as far as innacuracy and lack of evidence of mental strength. It would seem that Bowen has just enough functioning neural connection to write, gather random unverified stories and maintain a paranoid outlook, beyond that I guess he must at least have a functioning brain stem. Nearly everything in this book can (or has been) easily refuted. Nothing more than a middle school students efforts at critical thinking can refute his claims. The fact that idiots are out there buying this and believing it is both scary and disappointing. Nothing new I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read for an \\"ordinary\\" person","review":"I found the book hard to read. I am not a theologian, but have had a fair amount of biblical training and education overall during my life.

Tommy plays with George (Jiri) Mraz, the solid czech bass, and Kenny Washington on drums.It is a selection of standards that you've heard million times, but Flanagan makes them sound fresh. He does it in an understated manner: no flamboyant displays, no funky re-harmonizing, just very melodic solo-ing. His solo lines are so melodic they sound effortless. It is as if he is playing another melody on the chords, as they are constructed on the whole chart, not just a few bars.I particularly enjoyed Willow Weep for Me, or St Louis Blues. The only reason I gave the cd only 4 stars is because I am a little bothered by the last song. If the first 9 are jazz poetry, the last one veers into sappy romance, and sounds like easy listening stuff. Once it gets into the solo, it gets into a groove, but I don't enjoy the head."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only Christmas album you really need","review":"If you were going to get marooned on a desert island with only one album of Christmas music, this would have to be that one album.

Closer to home, McKibben shows how forests are being regenerated in the Northeast allowing wolves, moose and other wild species to reinhabit this region. But, something seemed to be missing in this volume. It lacked the focus of The End of Nature and didn't seem to go very far beyond surface observations. Nonetheless, I am thankful to McKibben for drawing attention to Curitiba and Kerala, showing that in many ways the so-called Third World has achieved greater sustainability than many parts of the so-called First World, leading him to make the salient observation that maybe we should re-examine our priorities here in the United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"Came in like new without hilighting, writing or tear/bends in pages and on cover binding.

By best I mean it painlessly gives you just the right amount of blood needed for the test strip. Every time. I know it's expensive compared to the other brands, but it'll hold up for 2 or 3 years. It's designed with guides that enable the needle to go straight in with no side to side wobble. That's why it hurts less. (actually it doesn't hurt at all.) By the way, I've met a lot of diabetics who didn't know that you can test on your knee. I've compared tests taken at the same time on my knee and my finger and always find them within 5 or 10 points of each other which is close enough.

The remixes are tired cliches and the production work is pedestrian by contempoarary standards. The fact that used CDs sell for less than a dollar clearly indicates what the general public thinks about this old release.If you are a Janet fan and don't own this, perhaps it is worth seventy-five cents.

The viewer has the opportunity to practice these fundamentals at their leisure by replaying the video lessons.

I have a C5, I can relate to the results of decisions made by Engineering.This Corvette team never gave up; through a number of senior staff shake-ups, budgetary problems, technological risks and sleepless nights. The biggest problem I had with this book is that it ends prematurely; there is little mention of the product announcement, public response or the results published in the press.

I read it in two days and then went back and reread it again about a month later and got much more out of it then. The story is of the C5 and the bigger story of what was going on at GM during this time is gripping.

Neil's ability to reach back and draw us forward at the same time makes for a study that is both relevant and reverent. His vision for a \\"church beyond\\" poses the critical questions of our present condition.

I avoided it because of the title (remember don't judge a book by it's cover?). It seemed a little trendy - maybe even too pop culture. I was looking for some good discipleship material when I came across another book that I had read by Neil Cole (author). When I discovered that this was the same author of Organic Church, I thought that I would give it a quick read.Organic Church was maybe the best book that I have ever read! It connected the book of Acts with the 21st century. It was inspiring and innovative. And it has put me in a postition to reconsider what it means to be a disciple and to make disciples. It is a very honest and very realistic look at church as we know it. It exposes the weakness in the church, and doesn't hide it's own weaknesses. It is not theoretic, analytic, or synthetic - it's just real - natural. It ends up that being organic means being effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the first half.","review":"I loved the first half of this book, even though my parish is running from a far more traditional model. I felt that the course this book suggested could be integrated into a more traditional church for a more balanced approach.But the author just kept pushing the Organic idea so far that he stretched the metaphor.

The author preaches and preaches but provides almost no real information. He doesn't even provide information about himself. Refuses to disclose his denomination, makes no mention of how he gains income to feed his family. He just goes on and on with Biblical references and examples from \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies to justify whatever vague point he may have. The little real information available amounts to: hang out in a coffee house full of weird people. Make friends with the weird people. Tell them who Jesus is. Tell them to start their own little church. Presto! Lots of people are starting lots of tiny churches all over the world and the commission is fulfilled.

Disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is too intense...","review":"When I first heard it, \\"Hooker and Heat\\" blew me away. It still does.It doesn't get any better than this. Separately, Canned Heat and John Lee Hooker both produced excellent blues material, but together, they seemed to work off each other. It seems like the intensity of each got kicked up a level when they went into the studio to record this collection.The recordings are stripped down, raw. My favorites are \\"Alimonia Blues\\", \\"You Talk Too Much\\" and \\"Peavine\\", but the rest of the set is great too. I guess if you're a blues purist or a member of some obscure mutual admiration society, the studio chatter is probably going to be offensive.My personal opinion is that all of the extra stuff adds authenticy to the recordings. That's part of what makes this collection unique. After all, if I wanted to listen to some of the material on this collection without the chatter, I could do so by listening to one of dozens of other Canned Heat or Hooker recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you feeeeeel good?","review":"You better feel good when you listen to this or Hook will make ya'. Done in a down home style of guys sitting in a studion playing music. Key tracks on this one are the blasphemous \\"Burnin' Hell\\" and the great \\"Boogie Chillen' No. 2.\\" Hook loves Wilson's harmonica and he doesn't know how Alan follows him and you'll wonder too. Well worth the price you pay for it. Actually, it's a little too cheap for such a great cd. If you don't want to spend that much there is a cheaper \\"best of hook and heat\\" which is okay too."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOOKED ON HOOKER!!!!!","review":"With 22 reviews, spanning fom 1 to 5 stars, the only reason I'm throwing my two cents in the ante is because, IF you dig HOOKER & HEAT, you're gonna LOVE the HOOKER & HOGS cd!!!

Buy it and you will go back to the early '70 years. In particular, I loved the songs in which Hooker play together with Alan Wilson: I have realised why Hooker considered \\"Blind Owl\\" as one of the best harmonica player ever heard. Canned Heat supported Hooker's music much more better than lots of other more known groups. Really nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but one note...","review":"While this is a fabulous recording and the sound on this \\"gold\\" version is very good, I encourage potential customers to seek out the version released in 2001 which is less expensive and has even better sound.

If not, save your money. La Berge totally leaves out the spiritual aspect of lucid dreaming. Its the difference between How to Paint and art. He doesn't even mention archtypes and he refers to Ouspensky, Castenada and Jung, but I don't think he has even read any of their writings. He is shallow and boring. His theory of dreaming is outdated and largely based on Freud. Even if your an amateur this book is a waste of your time. Read Carlos Castenada's The Art Of Dreaming or Fred Wolf's The Dreaming Universe. The only thing in this book that helped me was the \\"spinning\\" technique. Maybe go into a bookstore read that and put it back on the shelf. Of course this is my opinion, I could be wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of interesting information","review":"There is a lot of interesting information. The author hasn't verified a number of things to which he refers and some of the references are cursory, for example those to Castaneda's techniques.I applied his procedure, starting with keeping a note book, etc. While I have several vivid dreams every night, probably as a result of remembering them by writing them down, none of them have been lucid. Perhaps it just requires more time and diligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Helpful","review":"By merely reading this book and being concious of the concepts, my frequency of having lucid dreams increased. My lucid dreams occurred frequently during adolescence and now they occur occasionally with little implementation of the techniques explained in this book. I think that anyone who reads this book with an interest in lucid dreaming will see results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect in Every Way","review":"Lucid dreaming is the ability to control one's dreams to fly to learn new things or to just be like neo in the matrix. Steven Laberge is scientific about how he presents lucid dreaming from the how of lucid dreaming to the why such as that it happens in the rem part of sleep. I read that one reviewer thought Steven Laberge was not spiritual enough well I believe in the spiritual part of lucid dreaming but really do you want a book on ideas or something straight to the point with sooooooooooo many techniques to begin lucid dreaming. Ive looked at other lucid dreaming books and most put a new spin on what this book has.

I loaned this book out 3 times, years ago, each time the person kept the book. I let them keep it because it's life-changing. I almost promise you'll have a lucid dream before you finish the book. I've been an active lucid dreamer all my life, and began really exploring about 17 years ago. Everyone knows me by the name lucid, and I even named my 12yr old son lucid. It can become a way of life. 1/3 of your life is spent dreaming, quit wasting it. Plus dream time feels to go on much longer. I've spent what felt like days inside lucid dreams, studying meditation and psychology, it's a wonderful part of my life. Just buy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great guidebook to lucid dreaming","review":"fantastic guide book. summarizing many different techniques in logical order to learn how to induce lucid dreams. i only wish some chapters had more scientific or at least theoretical explanations of why certain techniques are supposed to be helpful, maybe a little more content about the science of lucid dreams. otherwise, great book, well written, helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too simple?","review":"The techniques in this book may seem a little too simple...but they work! I was on day eight of my 'dream journal' when I had my first intentional lucid dream. I didn't get to fly to the moon or become one with the universe, but I did realize that I was dreaming. Unfortunately my 'Woo-Hoo' response kicked me into a waking state. Hey, it's a beginning, and with that one experience the book paid for itself. Definitely worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the best book on Lucid Dreaming.","review":"First, I must state that I want to give this book more around 4 1/2 stars, but I mine as well round up.If you are starting to become interrested in lucid dreaming, I HIGHLY recommend that you order or pick up this book. It has techniques for becoming lucid and tips for what to do when you're lucid. Along with that, the book has ways for lucid dreaming to further improve your life, beyond the aspect of just having fun.However, I wanted to give the book 4 1/2 stars for one reason and one reason only. Like other reviews that have stated this, this book totally is without the spirituality that is experienced during a lucid dream and LaBerge's theories on dreams are a solely based on Freud, which may or may not be a good thing, depending how you look at it.Overall, excellent book. If you're looking into lucid dreaming, read this book. Believe me, it will be an incredibly useful tool for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the ultimate guide to Lucid Dreaming","review":"Trust me; buy this book.

Written in an easy to understand context, it walks the reader through the concepts and procedures necessary to attain lucidity. I eagerly await any followup books by Stephen LaBerge."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine overview...but....","review":"This book is a must for anyone interested in lucid dreams because it presents such a complete overview of the subject. However, there are several shortcomings. First: The style is somewhat dry and academic, which is fine if you're only interested in the facts, otherwise it might seem a bit boring. Second: Laberge give numerous tips for inducing lucid dreams, but success seems to depend more on a positive attitude than technique--they do help, but the results are often minimal. Third: This last criticism concerns the out-of-body experience, or OBE. Laberge seems to consider the OBE as just another dream. But for those of us who have experienced one, there is a subtle but real difference. Perhaps the subject was too esoteric for Laberge, but for those interested in both, Oliver Fox's \\"Astral Projection: A Record of Out-Of-The-Body Experiences\\" contains a personal account of Fox's attempt at distinguishing the two. Read Leberge first, then Fox for an eyeopener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Am I Dreaming?","review":"This is very exciting material.

It's the only wheel I could find that has analog paddle levers. And it's priced reasonably. The wheel works well for the first 20 to 30 plays, but quickly degenerates to the point where it can no longer be used. The problem is with the steering and paddle analog circuits. After a few plays, the wheel will return sporadic values as you turn the wheel and apply the paddle levers, making it useless. Once the wheel begins degenerating, there's nothing that can fix it, not even calibration. I work at a game development company and we have purchased nearly 20 of these wheels and they are all beginning to fail. We're not hard on the wheels; in fact, we use them with care. Nevertheless, we have had to replace every one. I cannot recommend this wheel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Genius Speed Wheel 3","review":"I used to use the keyboard for rFactor and i used to hate it. Once I got this everything seemed to be fine. The box was clean, when I opened it it looked like it came straight from a factory (which it did lol).

I tries to download different drivers for it but kept having the exact same problems. I run league races with a league called BOZ Racing League. I think I got 3 penalties in one race last night. After that race I totally quit on this wheel. I want to sell it to get a Logitech but I'm afraid that the item I'm selling won't be worthy for the buyer. I would love to return this for a full refund but I'm not sure if I can do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks straight out of the box","review":"Was excited to open the box and try out my new toy, and I quickly found that I was more precise with the keyboard.

While driving in the game \\"rFactor\\" the cars will not drive in a straight line. I tried all different settings as well as trying to find software to calibrate it. The windows calibration was useless on this model of game wheel. I had to stop using it for online competition because I kept running into other drivers and running them off the course. I also tried using the wheel on other driving games...same problem. The wheel has no centering setting. I tried different dead zone settings...worse reactions.

All of these I practically knew note for note. PLUS a cover of \\"Let's Stay Together\\", and the excellent \\"We Don't Need Another Hero\\" from \\"Mad Max 3\\".

All the others were approiate except for the duet with Rod Stewart (I did not think it was needed-she certaintly does not need to do duets). The only disappointment was \\"Private Dancer\\".

However, for the rest of the album it appears that the Sneaker Pimps focused more on producing a sleazy, hiply dark image rather than making music. I was expecting a darkly sensual album when I bought this but the actual musical content leaves me hungry.

The Wald steel rack is fine in itself, but it mounts in front with a very flimsy bracket that is held to the rack with one small screw and bolt. This is entirely insufficient, and leads to a wobbly rack system.A bike rack is generally useless unless it can be firmly mounted to the seat stays of the frame. My commuter bike doesn't have eyelets for mounting a rack, but many racks are sold with little adapter fittings that can attach to the seat stays. The Wald rack would be greatly improved if it could be mounted this way.

It seems sturdily made; I would guess the weakest points are at the hardware.The downside? My bike has a 52cm frame, and the provided bracket was slightly too long to mount it easily. That said, all it took was a little creativity to get it right.

So now I have an extra, and it's too much trouble to bother shipping it back.There are no instructions in the box, but it was pretty self-explanatory. I had to bend the front bracket to fit my bike, and find a bolt and nut to secure it to the brake bridge on the seat stay. My rear brake is a suspended wire design, not mounted to the brake bridge via a screw, so I had to be careful with the bracket to avoid interfering with the brake cable.

Kids are fascinated by boogers, too. If it's a natural bodily function, then of course children should be taught to fart when and where they want to. In McKy's world, couples would fart as they took their vows of marriage. The president would fart as he took the oath of office. I would walk over and fart in your face as you slept.

Choba isn't even a word as far as I know.

I've tried many towels and these are the most absorbent I've found. They are made with 100% combed cotton and have a heavier feel.

So, we have a pattern that isn't to scale, has no gridlines, and you can't copy onto a piece of paper to cut out. Like I said.

There was no sense of wonder whats happening next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar Star of the Sea Rides the Waves of Suspense and History","review":"If you love mystery, history, and stories from the high seas you will consume this tome. The characters are well developed - the historical perspective of the plight of the Irish is gripping and disturbing. The headlines and diary bits and pieces will cling and chill your heart and soul. Enjoy the haunt upon the high seas and let it resonate with you for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book of the year....","review":"I only finished reading it as it was a book club assignment. Although the history was very interesting...not only what happened in Ireland with the potato famine but the blockade of the ships carrying refugees into NY City's harbors, the book was disjointed and hard to read. It seemed like the author either put down his pen for a while and then picked it up and added new past history about his characters or...his editors told him that he had to make the book longer. I did not find the characters believable. The only person I cared about besides poor Mary Duane was the ship captain who was forced to carry so many passengers and buried a huge percentage of them at sea. I could not wait to finish so I could get on to better books...life is short and there are too many wonderful treasures yet to read plus old classics to read again. This book was neither a treasure and will not become a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary!","review":"A stunning work of art. The author uses the intertwined lives of several characters to convey the tragedy of the Irish famine and the human cost of migration, and does so in glorious prose.I've never read a more moving evocation of the Irish famine, which is the book's central focus. But this is also a tale about the Irish diaspora. O'Connor strips that event of romance of hindsight and conveys the pain and suffering that accompanied the emigrants on their journey.As a writer, I'm impressed by the book's complex structure; it's not easy to pull off these shifting points-of-view, but O'Connor does so with ease and grace. This is a beautifully written novel and a marvelous accomplishment."},{"rating":"1","title":"old book","review":"had no idea this book had been in print so long. After seeing the bronze statues in the park on a trip to Boston, I ordered the book as a gift for our seven year old granddaughter for Christmas. I was not happy at the appearance or the \\"musty\\" smell of this old book, but the seller will not take it back.

I loved this book as a kid! So to my dismay, they don't have a \\"beep\\" sound to signal the kids to turn the page. This lead to major frustration with my son who is learning to read but wanted to at least keep up with the story. He was listening but was on the wrong page and said he didn't like the book b/c he was \\"getting lost\\". Too bad the removed the page turning notification, b/c I would have given it 5 stars!

I just discovered that the book was defective...I guess the recipient didn't want to hurt my feelings by letting me know right away. It's too late to return it, but I want you to be aware of it. There were pages missing, pages out of order and the book restarted again in the middle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting book with heart-warming pictures, but...","review":"This heartwarming story will enchant any young child. The feelings of love for one's children are evident as is the notion of helpfulness to those in need. McCloskey makes it nearly impossible not to smile after reading the book.I did have a bone to pick though. It struck me odd when Mr. Mallard suddenly leaves his wife with eight newborn ducklings for a week as soon as they hatch so he can have fun touring the city while she is busy raising them alone. Is that the sexism of the author shining through?"},{"rating":"1","title":"eh..not impressed with condition","review":"it seems that the company i bought this from has a different idea of what \\"good\\" condition is than i do. the picture of the book you see is not the book i got in the mail. the book i got had no pic on the front and looked like it was from 1950. crayon color on the inside. i will not use this book distributor again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make Way for Duckllings is truly a Cauldecott Medal Winner.","review":"The Cauldecott Medal is given to those childrens' books with outstanding illustrations. In \\"Make Way for Ducklings\\" Robert McCloskey has captured the personalities of Mr. and Mrs. Mallard's brood of duclkings from first hatch to the time they must go from the Charles River to the Boston Gardens. He has created the setting for a wonderful introduction to the world of ducks in the big city, and this book gives the reader the opportunity to ask questions about how birds really raise their families, or where exactly is Boston? So, it presents an opportunity to discuss nature, geography, birds, or even the hazards of living in a big city, when you are a duck. I used this book when I taught 2nd grade as an introduction to a bird unit. I also read it to my own children, over and over. A most higly recommended piece of children's literature!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Educational","review":"Go on, buy it! \\"Make Way For Ducklings\\" falls on the list of those \\"you'll never regret it\\" book purchases.This treat for the eyes and ears, with beautifully drawn pictures and a carefully worded storyline, will bring your child into the Mallard family as they trek dangerously across town.The names of each duckling are alliterative and rhythmic. Reading this aloud will bring chuckles with the silly \\"Ouack and Lack and Kack...\\" all those \\"quack\\" rhymes.Not only will the book be fun to read and reread, but it will teach a child language skills, particularly those relating to poetry. Even though it is not a poem, because it so well-written, it has those poetic qualities.When I visited Boston as an adult, I saw how familiar the town was only because I read \\"Make Way For Ducklings\\" as a child. The memories of this book are solid 30 years later, just as they will be for your son, daughter or younger relatives.I fully recommend it.Anthony TrendlTreeFortBooks.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood Favorite","review":"This was one of the earliest picture books read to me.

They find a great location in Boston, but need the help of Officer Michael, to cross the busy streets. The best thing about the story is that it is based on a true story. A similar event took place in about 2008 ish in the states and can be youtubed.Kids love this story - and admittedly adults alike. A nice early reader for the child that has basics in reading and wants to try a slightly larger challenge of this relatively \\"big looking\\" book. The illustrations, in which there are plenty, will help them ease through and feel successful.Bravo to McCloskey for a great book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Classic","review":"This is a wonderful, timeless children's tale. The story is engaging, the art is delightful. I loved this book when I was small, and I give it constantly to all of the children in my life.

This roots rock endeavor for Steven Fearing, Colin Linden and Tom Wilson has a great full sound for a mere three piece band. But if you are lucky enough to hear them do the same songs unplugged, the music stands up beautifully without all the effects and thunder.The lyrics are wicked and insightful. \\"I got a feeling stinging like a new tatoo black across my mind\\" -- (from Water Or Gasoline by Blackie and the Rodeo Kings).

They certainly are the most under rated band in the Americana genre. Even though all three members are stars in their own right in their native Canada, there is most definitely no clash of egos from this group of Canucks. To the contrary, there is an undeniable chemistry and kinship among them that, in my opinion, makes them one of the mot talented trios of all time (I can attest to that having the opportunityto recently meet them, and see them in concert, great guys).In addition, their group of backing musicians including, Gary Craig, & Richard Bell, are superb. Their most recent effort,Bark is a tasty mix of rockabilly, blues, country, & roots rock.Their previous effort, Kings of Love, is more of the same. If you are fan of The Band, John Hiatt, Whiskeytown (before Ryan's ego exploded), etc., be sure to check these guys out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un happy customer !!","review":"I had e trust installed on my computer when I purchased it.

I was so let down after reading this \\"Christian\\" book. Please be warned this is not appropriate for those who want to keep sexually pure thoughts. Robin has decided to write a book that depicts a wonderful marriage bed. She explains in her web site her mission to balance what the world is selling as sexually appealing. But this book needs a heavy warning on it as the Bible says \\" think on these things...\\". It is very hard to have a pure thought life after reading about what others are doing in thier bedrooms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicole of Prie Mer: Book One of the Latter Annals of Lystra","review":"I was disappointed with the Latter Annals of Lystra. They had many unnecessary references to sex which actually detracted from the story. Instead of focusing on God and His power and working in lives (as in Robin's previous books with Roman & Deirdre)these Annals focused on the physical relationship of the 2 main characters. I would not recommend these books to anyone. I think Robin can write great stories without resorting to the use of sex to grab the reader's attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album of The Year.","review":"Piebald always gets better and better with age.

Although it isn't terrible, and I do love David Lee Rock, it is an incredible disappointment for a Piebald album. I don't want to believe that the new members changed things, but they haven't shown me otherwise. If you listen carefully, they even seem to sometimes recycle lyrics...To sum up, Rock Revolution wouldn't be a bad ep for a lesser band, but its a disaster for Piebald"},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware","review":"I bought this watch in january and have had nothing but problems with it.

So I recently decided to give her a try, and picked up The Cultured Handmaiden. I did not finish the book, but quite about one-fourth of the way through. While I didn't hate this book, I definitely didn't love it, either, and since a Catherine Cookson fan has since told me that her historicals are much better, I've decided to wait and try one of those, instead. I've found that authors tend to be good at either historicals or contemporaries, but almost never is an author good at both.I'm giving it one star not because it was so absolutely terrible, but because if a book is DNF it automatically gets one star from me.I suspect that only the most diehard Catherine Cookson fans would enjoy this book.

They are medium-weight and reasonably priced. Out of the box they have a very pretty satin metal finish.Unfortunately, the choice of metal alloy is not good and over time they take on a poor appearance. They are prone to small rust spots after about a year of regular use including the dishwasher. That's annoying but can be taken off with polishing. What's worse is that the metal starts out shiny but turns to a dull gray. However, wherever the metal will be shiny wherever it has been scratched recently.

If you want to increase your vocabulary of verbs you can buy a dictionary (Redhouse and Langenscheidt both have good ones).

This book might be useful as a spelling aid, because the manner of adding endings to verb roots can be difficult at first, but it leaves the student with almost as many questions as answers.

I'm interested in history but it was more like being force-fed castor oil - after pages and pages of Jordanian history. Lady Annabel, An Unconventional Life, does the memoir of someone 'important' much better. Seems like Queen Noor is afraid to either reveal to us or to herself what she was really feeling, thinking and doing and that, to me, is the essence of a good memoir.

I also really feel, despite questions about accuracy, that she gives an Arab perspective on the Middle East that you don't often hear in America.

I never had even a slight feel of who she is as a person and what her family problems were. It appears before she was married all she did was go to school, ride horses, and work.

This is a very candid memoir by a person that has little experience in writing. The book is well written and is easy to read. I found the history easy to follow since I was raised in the Middle East. I wouldn't take every word at face value though; most of the facts have been sugar-coated and are obviously biased. Having said that, I empathize with Noor's stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which I know is a huge morass. Everything said and done it's worth a read. I enjoyed it for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable insight on the Middle East and its people","review":"I am glad Queen Noor wrote this book and shared with others her unique experience. I've always admired her work but now I admire her even more as a person. The inside stories on the Middle East politics, the Arab-Israeli conflict and the United States government's less-than-commendable role in the region were told truthfully and candidly. This book also provides details of King Hussien's struggle to bring peace to the region. King Hussein and her also struggled to raise a family amidst all the turmoil in the region. Their genuine love for each other has helped them through a multitude of crises. This book is truly an eye-opener and I would recommend it to anybody!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leap of Faith","review":"An inspiring book about the real people of the Middle East-caring, warm, family oriented people. Such were the people I found when I visited Jordan while living in the Middle East.In this day, when we think all people of the region are terrorists, this book will change your mind. If you enjoy reading about the Middle East, another new book called \\"Single in Saudi\\" by Genia will give you another perspective on life in Saudi Arabia as the author takes you on a journey through this most mysterious of Middle Eastern countries."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Official View of My Life as Queen Noor","review":"Leap of Faith is interesting from the young all American becomes Queen standpoint. It really is amazing that a fairly regular young American woman gains the attention of the King of Jordan and becomes Queen.It is too bad she was not willing to be more real in her telling of a great story.The book ends up preaching about Queen Noor's view of the political world and quickly becomes tiresome and boring.It could have been a very exciting story given her exciting life but she had to go preach to us instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Semetic to the core...","review":"Interesting read - everything wrong with the Middle East and, indeed the world, is in her mind the fault of the Jews. Hitler felt the same way. I thought she had a more open mind but, then again, she's done virtually nothing to advance women's rights in Jordan either. She would have been better off telling her love story than trying to advance her highly prejudiced political views."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful in every way","review":"As a Jordanian, reading Queen Noor's book moved me to tears. Not only is it an insight into Jordan and its existence in a very difficult neighbourhood, but it is truly a love story between her and a man whose magnificence as a human being is often hard to put into words. King Hussein's humanity, his humility, his strength and faith, and perhaps above all, his kind heart was something every Jordanian knew and admired, and Queen Noor brings this to light in her eloquent and touching writing. This is a truly magnificent story of an extraordinary woman and a beautiful human being. I strongly recommend it to Jordanians and non-Jordanians alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth reading - in parts","review":"I confess that I was expecting a fairy tale of sorts. I didn't get it. I found the book hard to read for 2 reasons: it abounds with names that I couldn't keep track of, and the language does not flow for me. I don't know if it was partly ghostwritten, but I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't - and it's pretty clear that Lisa Halaby, aka Queen Noor al Hussein, has been mostly speaking Arabic for many years.I didn't read the entire book - put it down midway and doubt I'll ever pick it up again. I'm sure her life has been interesting, but it just doesn't seem well-told. However, I believe her attempt to put forward the Arab point of view on the Middle Eastern conflict is valuable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold and unrevealing","review":"This book is a disappointment. To call it an autobiography is misleading, since Queen Noor offers no genuine intimacy or personal revelation. The text is aloof and guarded and amateurish. I'll wait for a serious biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing: Queen Noor","review":"This book is a reminder why not to buy an autobiography. Queen Noor insults the intelligence of the reader by promulgating her strongly bias view of events and history. Please do not write any more books, Your Majesty, stick to fashion or social events. I feel I have wasted my money with this purchase. If you don't believe me, read a few chapters online or in the store. A rating of 1 star is too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally, an objective view of Middle Eastern History!!","review":"Israel is to blame for everything.The Jews are to blame for everything.The Jews control congress.The Jews control the world economy.Queen Noor has enlightened an entire generationon the true history of the modern Middle East.She is to be congratulated for her scholarshipand her objectivity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd, but not horrible","review":"It was difficult to fairly rank this book because, although I personally thought it was one of the most absurd pieces of literature I have ever had the courage to read until the end, some still will gravitate to this pretty memoire written by the regal Queen Noor. This is an absurd book, but not horrible. I know that a lot of people, mainly aging, white American women who are uneducated in world cultures and captivated by royal life will find this a classy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Queen of a Country in Which Jews Can't Own Land","review":"Before anyone gets misty eyed over the tender sensibilities of this lady, remember, that during the reign of her late husband through today, Jews are not allowed to own land in Jordan.

I always viewed King Hussein as a ray of hope for peace in the Middle East. I had thought that his widow would write a piece that would enhance his vision. I was disappointed that Her Majesty simply rehearsed the same old anti-Jewish, anti-Israel sentiment that have been expressed for generations. Queen Noor had an opportunity to make a difference. In the end, she simply revealed her prejudices. Tis a pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queen Noor","review":"Read in May, 2012formatPaperback (edit)reviewThe memoir of Queen Noor of Jordan was a very slow read. It was fascinating to hear about her life and how she had met the King of Jordan.

Instead I found myself reading a diatribe against Israel, the United States and even Egypt for the accord that Anwar Sadat signed at Camp David. It's a good book if you're interested in a one sided view of Arab affairs versus the rest of the world, otherwise give it a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 Star must read if you care about the truth","review":"Have admired this woman for over a decade and am proud to say we got involved in riding the world of land mines because of her. What a gift she is to both the people of Jordan, the Middle East and then to the world.So many of the positive reviews have covered so much of what I would like to say, so no need to repeat what has been said so well already. If there is one reason I would hope you would buy the book it is because she has the unique view of being both and American as well as a Middle Easterner and a Moslem, so she is able express her thoughts and beliefs in a manner that most literate Americans should appreciate and I hope learn from.Her book along with Ziauddin Sardars Why Do People Hate America should be must reading for those Americans who do not know much about the Middle East or why Americans as a people are liked but the American government policies are not."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Arab perspective through an American's eyes","review":"Most importantly, this book provides excellent insight into the life of an Arab leader including his relationship with other Arab leaders as well the leaders of Israel, the U.S. and other nations.Queen Noor describes her life from her American childhood through her marriage to King Hussein of Jordan up to his death in 1999. The book is written in a diary-like fashion complete with many personal details. King Hussein is portrayed not as an invincible deity, but as a very decent man trying to make the world a better place.An index is provided. A map of the Middle East and a Husein family tree would have been helpful aids in following the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self serving pack of lies","review":"I must admit; I didn't get very far, but this book is a self serving pack of lies by an apologist for the intransigence of the Arab world. For example, she refers to the \\"forced migration\\" of 1948 without ever mentioning that the ones doing the forcing were Arabs who promised their people that if they would get out they would \\"push the Jews into the sea\\". Nor does she mention the origin of the name \\"Palestinian\\" (hint: it is a Hebrew name).The saddest thing about the Arab world is that 1000 years ago they had the most advanced civilization on earth, and entirely due to problems of their own making they now preside over one giant hell hole.But if she came out and admitted this the Hashemite family would be in danger of losing their position of privilege in Transjordan.I would recommend that anyone who reads this book should also read \\"Warrior\\" by Ariel Sharon. At least he knows the history of Israel, Syria, and Egypt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revisionist History","review":"This is a disappointing, self-serving attempt at revisionist history in an attempt to glorify Queen Noor and King Hussein. She paints herself and her husband as saints who fail to elevate Jordon from a third world, impoverished, war torn country only because all the leaders of the world are against them and lie to them repeatedly. According to Noor, all Jordon's actions are taken with pure altruistic motives, trying to induce peace into the world. Queen Noor has no reservations about distorting history to paint King Hussein as the only world leader with good intentions. Like so many leftist liberals, she views the United States' aid to Jordon, forgiving Jordon's debt, and providing US weapon systems to Jordon as entitlements. Her one-sided view of the Arab/Palistinian cause is laughable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I had 10 long hours on the plane and couldn't finish this book. I understand it is written from the Queen's point of view so she can't avoid being unbiased, but the world just isn't black and white! The author's world definitely is, particularly when it comes to the King. Her husband seems almost a saint, who tries to keep his neighbors happy. The heads of other governments are not good people. They want to take advantage of the king's kindness. He suffers, but continues to believe in being honest, true and virtuous. His enemies continue to do him wrong.Maybe so. That's the way a loving wife would talk about her husband. But that's not what I was expecting to get out of it. If you want to read about a good man who was taken advantage of left and right, this is the book for you. If you want to read about a real man who tried to do good and made a lot of mistakes , whether intentionally or not, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leap of Faith","review":"It is in faith that when your order anything, that it is going to be what you anticipate. It is faith that allows blessings to be bestowed! I was very pleased with my purchase \\"Leap of Faith: Memois of an Unexpected Life\\". I received the Book on CD just as described and enjoyed listening to whole book. I read this as part of a Reading Program for our Women's Church Group to help expand and grow in our understanding of God's mission and God's people. Every book should allow you to grow, if you just have faith!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Arab Apologia","review":"It's unbelievable she was raised in the US. She seems to forget everything she was taught. This book is the most anti-semitic book I've read in a long time. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was so hoping for something better....","review":"Unfortunately the autobiography is boring and somewhat distant and impersonal. Actually, overall the writing is uninspired and quite frankly, flat. Queen Noor, obviously a beautiful, intelligent, well-educated woman uses the book as a platform for spouting some pretty blatant untruths about the modern history of the Middle East. I guess I should have expected that, but it was disappointing nonetheless. I might have gritted my teeth and gotten past her politics if the love story was interesting. But it wasn't simply because the writing was so unemotional and disconnected. As I read the book, it was as if I could hear someone speaking in a monotone voice and it was almost sleep-inducing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another third world ruler's wife profiting from the misery of her people","review":"I am sick and tired of one more method for the extremely corrupt Jordanian \\"Royal\\" family to benefit. They live a lavish life of luxury (both the old King and the current monarch) while the majority of the country lives in poverty. The Jordanian Royal family is one of the few Arabic and Muslim countries that play this public relation game to a point that makes some of us westerners truly believe that it is a democratic and peaceful country. A small percentage of Jordanians live in the wealthy suburb of west Amman (the capital). The rest of the Capital and the rest of the country is shanty towns and live below world standard's for poverty. She is nothing but a pretty girl who attracted a frivolous and womanizing king. The king died. A younger and more beautiful queen is married to the current frivolous king. Get over it. She gave nothing to Jordan and only took, her greed has no end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Public Relations Memoir falls Flat","review":"I was expecting a REAL insight into her life. Unfortunately what I got was a safe memoir that seemed written by a Public Relations flak rather than Noor herself. I was sorely disappointed. $14.50 wasted. If you must read it, borrow it at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Far from the insightful candor I expected, this book was a disappointing concoction of political propoganda and classy personal endorsement. Queen Noor conveniently glosses over the monarch's questionable decisions in an effort to promote the central and underlying theme of this superficial memoire: we never make mistakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Book shows how friendly the Arabs/Muslims are!","review":"Her book deserves FULL support; it shows how warm the Arabic/Muslim culture is. It describes how there are differences in the cultures between the West and East. But I think the book should also discuss the reasons why Arab women are treated a certain way among arab communities especially in the Gulf countries. I think this describes cultural differences better.Her Majesty is a symbol of globalization and human rights for women. She made it also clear at C-Span how Al-shorah in Islam is a wonderful modernalization tool. I think with the help of this tool women could be freed in the arabic world.But no Arabic country seems to have used this wonderful tool to its full potential to help free arabic women.So please read her book, to help liberate women, and let us stay one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A VERY DIFFICULT READ","review":"I found this book to be a very difficult read. The style of writing just does not flow well, and that is the least of my complaints.This book seems to be more about the history of Jordan, and very little to do with Noor herself.I was a little surprised at the uncalled for pot shots at the United States. She was born and raised an American. I understand she has a roll to play as a public figure, and I felt she was still playing that roll as a writer. I didn't feel that the book was very honestly written.In the end I think the book is more about her being a CHEERLEADER for the Arab cause, and her attempts to persude people to see them as the victims in the Mideast, and for most of us that is to hard a sell. Anyone who knows anything about the Mideast conflict, can see the obvious bias in this book, with regards to facts and events involving the Middle East."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok if you don't mind all the hatred and anti-semitism","review":"Unreal that this woman can be such an unabashed anti-semite. Her revisionist history ignores every arab atrocity against Israel and the U.S. What a joke! Her husband, a paid CIA operative according to Jimmy Carter, comes off as a prince among men despite his hand in terrorism. All she does is complain about how unfairly the palestinians were treated despite the fact that her gloriously tiny husband waged a war against them and kicked them out of his country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leap of Faith","review":"Where was the editor when this book passed through the publisher? While the author is obviously intelligent, her writing style is stilted, self-congratulatory, and non-introspective. She tries to be everything to every reader from a free spirit during her 1970's college days to the dutiful wife of an Arab monarch. She revealed very little about herself or her husband of any interest and expounded what could only be considered the Arab/Muslim party line. Yuck! I usually like to keep my books, treasured in my many bookcases but this one is going directly to the yard sale pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noor falls short","review":"I was extremely disappointed by this book. Noor's writing is difficult to follow as she skips from subject to subject. The chronology of events is scattered. I was also bogged down by the insistent references to all the \\"do-gooding\\" she felt compelled to tell her readers about such as, \\"I started this committee in Jordan and worked with this international organization, in addition I did such and such\\"...it was tedious to follow.I was also dismayed at Noor's evasiveness when she tackled tougher subjects such as King Hussein's prior wives. Also dismaying was her account of her first pregnancy and subsequent miscarriage. When she miscarries she decides to \\"not trouble the King while he is in the midst of business.\\" When Hussein does see her a bit later Hussein's way of dealing with her miscarriage is to take her skiing in the Alps and never once approaches the subject with her.A disappointing account of a woman who used to intrigue me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing \\"autobiography\\"","review":"A tedious, superficial and dishonest book about a beautiful and supposedly highly educated woman. Her relationship with King H. is all cream and roses. There is no depth or openess in the recounting of her marriage. And the book is laced with a generous portion of one-sided history - this has nothing to do with the trials and tribulations of a Christian woman changing her religion to her husband's and sharing her life with a man whose religious and cultural background is vastly different than her own. If I am interested in Arab history I would have chosen to read a book solely dedicated to this subject. After reading \\"Honor Lost - Love and Death in Modern-Day Jordan\\" I get the impression that royalty is far-removed from daily life just down the street. Compared to most women around her, Queen Noor seems to be inhabiting an ivory tower. A disappointing read - there are more honest books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Into to the Recent History of the Mid-East","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! It is a history lesson as much as a biography. I found it enlightening to read about the Palestinian side of the Arab-Israeli conflict (the US media and the US government are so biased toward Israel that we almost never receive a balanced perspective). Every conflict has two sides, and this book furthered my understanding regarding the question that has been gnawing at me since September 11, 2001 - \\"why do they hate us so much?\\" We've heard general statements about the cumulative effect of decades of myopic US foreign policy, but now the series of historical events that shape the Arab perspective has become much clearer to me. What an eye-opener! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting perspective","review":"I read this book because I wanted to read a woman's perspective of living and working in the middle east.I was fascinated by her decision to marry King Hussein of Jordan and her learning to become a public figure. I think some issues were glossed over. I hoped there would be more details about the transition from being a United States citizen to becoming Jordanian.I truly enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"CIV Set your goals","review":"Loved it when it first came out.

I can't get more then 1000 mAH out of any of them any more, even after massaging them with a fancy charger, and they are still virtually brand new (maybe 15 charge cycles on them max). The second issue is that about half of them start reading 0V after sitting on the shelf for a weeek and it takes applying a voltage for a short while to get the battery to read > 1.2V again.

It's seldom that a book effectively does both, i.e. make a point, and in the process, entertain. Mathews', LeRoi, is an exception. Written with great style, Mathews' has painted a portrait of life as it is lived, not as it is imagined, making for a realistic and compelling read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks, Mel Matthews","review":"This is a story of a man who is not afraid to be who he really is.

The sound quality is muddy and there is no documentation beyond basic credit. Where did they get these cuts? Who knows?

Appealing believable characters, both lead and secondary, great plot, lots of humor. I like this book so much that I read parts of it several times. And, unlike Balogh, there isn't a lot of porn.I would like to know what happens with the sister-in-law, she deserves better than to be stuck off somewhere even though she's presumably safe, but hopefully there's a book about her.

The Fortune Hunter is very well written, and Farr is ahead of all other new regency writers in my opinion. However, the Heyer-esque sense of fun and enjoyment I had come to admire was missing from this latest book. The Fortune Hunter has two interesting and vivid main characters and a lot of passion, if that is what you like you will love it. But, the secondary characters were weaker than in Farr's earlier novels, it wasn't very humorous, and all a bit intense, passionate and serious really. I couldn't help wondering if this was because she had made the jump from 'regency' to 'historic' fiction? It depends what you like, but I enjoyed Falling For Chloe far more."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as good as I'd hope it would be","review":"I liked the hero better in Falling for Chloe (the prequel).

I've read better by Farr."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I really did not enjoy this book in spite of all the wonderful reviews I had heard. The characters were boring and not believable and the plot was just slow and boring. I just did not care if Rival would be able to overcome Olivia's resistance to marriage or about all the little tasks she made him complete to remain in her company.

The most remarkable thing about him was his ability to contort or control his body enough to escape handcuffs, straight jackets, and other means of restraint of his day and age. Biographies of the man show him to be a remarkable individual. Tony Curtis' portrayal of Houdini is, in my humble opinion, both accurate and entertaining. It's the type of entertainment the whole family can enjoy. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves biographies and clean, wholesome entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"This video has an intersting story about a magic man.

Though not very accurate in details, I think this movie did a good job of capturing the aura and mystique of Houdini's life. This was my favorite movie as a boy. The movie has some stirring music and features authentic-looking period settings. It also has a few good magic tricks -- Dunninger, the great mentalist, who personally knew Houdini, was the movie's technical director. This movie has had such a profound impact on popular culture that 50 years after it was filmed, most people still believe that Houdini died in the Water Torture Cell as depicted in the movie. This is an entertaining film. I suggest that people follow it up with a good book on Houdini's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"houdini","review":"I thought Tony Curtis was wonderful in his portrayal of Houdini.

I hung in there hoping something relevant would happen. No such luck. I learned in beginning creative writing not to end a book in this manner.

Novice beware!","review":"This book is likely to frustrate true beginners. In attempting to work through the excercises, the C++ complier the authors recommend refused to compile the sample code. Two frustrating hours later pursuing solutions on the Borland web site, I managed to create two configuration files, edit my environmental variables, and finally get the code to compile. Such geek gymnastics are certainly beyond most \\"beginners,\\" and are likely to cause them to give up the whole idea of learning to code.Shame on Borland for providing a compiler that was apparently never beta tested on XP(!), and shame on Wrox for failing to provide adequate instructions. There are a few answers of varying quality and coherance on their forum, but you shouldn't have to resort to the forum to run the very first compiled program in the book.If you aren't familiar with how a compiler works BEFORE reading this book, you are likely to run aground sometime around Chapter 7.

This book was hard to put down. The characters were captivating. I also liked the folklore of the water babies and how it was tied into the story. From the fist chapter on you are hooked into this story. The only thing I didn't like about this book was the loose ends. For example, who took care of Christy after Miss Diana and why did the wind effect people. Also, why did Esperanza do what she did at the end. This is a must read and I look forward to my next book by John Saul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like getting to second base...","review":"With the easiest girl in school and then she asks to be taken home. You think you're going to score, but Miss Easy has turned into Miss Prude. Argh!Saul had an awesome premise in this book, and he came close to true fear a couple times, yet in the end he flirted with the trigger but never pulled it. Why, John Saul, why? The result is an unsatisfying, boring letdown of a book. I thought he was supposed to be in league with King and Koontz, but if this book is any indication, Saul owns the bush league. The murders are watered-down and PG. The significance of the wind is never explained. So many near scares that after a while you're convinced you will never darken the corner of third base, let alone home plate. Add to that the stiff characters and bad dialogue coupled with the withering suspense and you realize this is one date in need of a merciful abbreviation. Stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! But.............","review":"I loved this book. It was so great. The plot was very exciting and suspensful, and the characters were well-developed. We learned their motivations, which is great. I loved the character of Miss Edna. I thought she was spunky, and she made me laugh, though sometimes, she was alittle mean. I also loved the setting of it. The Victorian town,shrouded in legend and mystery. I would have gave it five stars, except that he left a few loose ends, in the book. Such,as why does the wind affect people the way it does? And, who adopted Christie at the end of the story, before the epilouge? Oh, well. Still a suspensful, spooky, book.

Well, I left the store without them. I'm glad I didn't order them here because they would have been sent right back. The newest versions are simply zoomed-in highway/road maps. I can get the same info at the gas station for a dollar and have 70 less pages of nothing to carry around. There are no elevation contours, half the details are gone, and the format is generally 'dumbed down.' These maps used to show all sorts of interesting things for those who ventured off the main roads. The new ones show major roads, pretty colors, and generally which Interstate takes you to the national forests. If you're cruising the Interstates and are looking for the triple latte of highway maps, you're set. Otherwise... worthless.Sorry, but Delorme REALLY blew it. They need to rehire the cartographers and fire the graphic artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"The scale is too large to be useful","review":"The scale of this Utah DeLorme atlas is too large and the maps in it are unsuitable for detailed recreation planning (in my case mountain biking). The scale is 1:233,000! You have to squint to see certain important Forest Service roads at this scale, and fine details are imperceptible. DeLorme needs to lower the scale by a factor of at least three.These comments refer to the Sixth Edition (2008). DeLorme revises these maps periodically so if you're reading this review years later check to see if they've fixed the problem before deciding not to buy it.For now, the question is, Where can one buy a suitable atlas for offroad trip planning? Once I've figured out where to go I can buy an excellent National Geographic Trails Illustrated or Latitude 40 map. But I need an atlas for identifying promising areas. And this one won't do the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"The DeLorme series is the best for detailed topo maps","review":"I have many Atlases from DeLorme. They are the best book for an entire set of topographic maps for a state. Thus, they are especially good for travelers who explore away from the main roads or are into 4-wheeling (4 wheel drive). They also have lots on printed information in the front of each book on points of interest and geologic features. However, they do not have any photos and are best for travelers with some other basic travel information with them. It can be useful to carry a magnifying glass with you to get all the detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bunch of Loops","review":"Well, we have 3 mixes of \\"Streamlined\\" by Sunshine, and two new jammies from ATDI. This is my first introduction to Sunshine, and the song on this disc is really nothing more than one drum beat with various guitar effects over it (and vocals). Nothing too exciting -- nor are the two remixes. As far as At the Drive-In is concerned, \\"Extracirricular\\" seems to be your standard ol' run of mill ATDI song...not earthshattering by any means (hey, I didn't really like \\"Catacombs\\" either, although that is different). But \\"Autorelocator\\" deviates into an electronic world that ATDI have never to this point explored so deeply. Its a very interesting song, once again built around one drum loop, but it seems to have a lot more lasting value to it than \\"Streamlined.\\" Overall, its a fair listen, but these three songs (and 2 remixes) are definately not worth ten bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"music fans from portland=bad taste","review":"At The Drive-In is one of my favorite bands ever.

I have not had any issues with rust. I did notice when I occassionally hand washed dishes, if I leave the flatware to dry in the drainer, it does have water spots ~ so if I do hand wash, I dry it. However, in the dishwasher it is no problem, no water spots - no rust; even if I put the flatware in the dishwasher and do not run it for days, it still comes out just fine. I do always rinse the dishes/flatware before loading in the dishwasher - so I cannot comment on how it would be (in the dishwasher) not rinsing the food off first.

When we are finished, I am sure cousins will be able to use it! Also, it came with an offer for a free flashmaster for the teacher.

It is an excellent tool to help students master basic math facts. Two ways I have found to \\"up\\" the fun value: (1) Have students track their results on an enlarged version of the form provided in the FlashMaster instruction book. (My students do 3 rounds of 90 second Practice and then a Special Problems round, if needed) When students actually see their progress from session to session, they are much more motivated! Each student is challenged to improve his/her personal best score.(2)Students challenge me to see if they can beat me! We set the Flashcard option for 1.6 seconds and then we each do the 30 flashcards and compare scores. You could compete at 1.6 seconds, and give your child a longer time of a 2.5 second or 3 second time to even the playing field.

IIt really emcompasses everything you need for mastery. YOu can study your tables \\"in\\" order or \\"not\\" in order, flashcards, timed tests and special problems.

I was researching some additional tools I could use to help him when I came across the FlashMaster. Within just a weekend of practicing with it, it was truly like a switch in his brain turned on.

In every way it is just as much if not more of a masterpiece than that album. From totally original and intricate beats, brilliant arrangements, long flowing songs -- everything about this cd is just perfect -- it's obvious a lot of time was spent on all these songs. As mentioned above, some of these songs are a few years old too, which implies these fellows have had a finger on the underground for awhile (not surprisingly, really). If you like Bukem or Shadow or the like, you MUST HAVE this cd (It's actually worth the import price, unless you can find it on vinyl somewhere)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tribute?","review":"How can an album be a tribute with so many cuts with awful, weak vocals? My first time through, I thought each song got progressively worse. Born on the Bayou is instrumental which works, but the vocal part where they echo \\"Born on the Bayou\\" is a hoot. But on my second listen I found a couple of gems, Have you seen the Rain by Frog Holler, I have a soft spot for banjo, and Lookin out My Back Door by John Jorgenson features some mean pluckin, picken and fiddlin. Up Around the Bend is interesting until the guitar blows his amp at the end. The rest ranges from weak to pittyful.

One interesting note though, is that Roberts' \\"co-star\\", (thankfully I don't know his name) is almost more annoying than Roberts himself! I've seen this movie around 5 or 6 times on daytime HBO, and it gets funnier every time. But I warn you, watch it only with a friend, because without one to help you through, the possibility of suicide becomes all too real.

It is amazing, what a good time you can have while going broke. I still think, network marketing is a great idea - the ultimate form of pure capitalism, but it is ultimately the integrity of the company and especially its leaders, which set the ethical standards. Whenever using half-truths and lies sneek into the culture of a company, it is doomed for failure - as Winston Churchill put it: \\"The truth is incontrovertible. Malice may attack it. Ignorance may deride it.

For those of us who believe in capitalism and have done direct sales with a well-run and fair company (Mary Kay Cosmetics), this book comes as a sad surprise.What particularly left me with respect for the author is that Styler makes no victim of himself, instead admitting his own culpability in everything that occurred; and makes no hero of himself for helping to bring down a selfish and dangerous man who gave direct marketing a bad name.Spellbound is a readable book.

I purchased the Accu-Chek Aviva due to it's reasonable cost, recent make, small size, efficiency of use, ability to take blood from places other than the finger, and requirement for only a very small blood sample.Overall, I am impressed with the device except one important thing. Despite numerous tries I could not draw enough blood from locations on my arm and leg that would meet the unit's minimum blood sample size requirement. I used the longest lancet setting and tried several times but received error messages on all tries with a code that tells you that you haven't used enough blood. This could very well be a problem for many meters but since this is my first, I find this fustrating that I have to go back to the standard finger prick method."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best oud players today","review":"This is an amazing oud player.

Natasha is a professional genealogist who is contacted by a mysterious young women's boyfriend after the girl's disappearance. The only clue to her identity is an old diary that Natasha uses to find out who she really is and why she's gone. At first I was a bit put off by the distant writing style Mountain uses throughout the book, but as I continued reading, I could see that it is merely Natasha's way of looking at the world and that Mountain's writing is brilliant at portraying that. I was hoping for more in the way of actual family tree investigation, but I can see that Mountain is really setting up Natasha with a series of minor characters who will make appearances in future novels, and perhaps there will be a bit more depth to everyone in those. (The next book Bloodline is already at the top of my stack)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Note impressed!","review":"Reads like a romance novel.

Only with ABBA she had her moments. Then the warmth in her voice came through and she turned out to be the pefect backing vocalist of star Agnetha. She gave Agnetha's voice more depth, at times. This second solo effort of Frida after ABBA turned out to be her (english) last. It is truely her worst ever! The merepart of the songs are simple and badly produced and arranged. Even the Benny and Bjorn contribution on this CD has not been treated the way is should have. Frida herself also sound uninspired, which could be because of the bad production or maybe she herself knew that she was working with badstuff.

Basically, it is a PFC class. The book leads you through PFC labs. You start by building a basic PFC application, you then continue by adding PFC services. Not a theory book, but a hands on guide with a detail for code examples. It was incredible that I even received timely e-mail support when I has questions or problems. After a while I felt like I was taken a correspondence course. On the down side, a more detailed table of contents is needed. Also, the book comes with the completed lab disk. It would be nice if it came with two disks - the completed one and one for the student to complete. All in all a good effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad if you need a crash course on the PFC","review":"I thought the examples were very good. The book does a good job helping the student build simple PFC applications. On the downside, you have to be careful and use the libraries the ship with the book. Some chapters use different lib paths. At first I had problems and had to call the publisher. Once this was worked out all was OK (in all fairness, on the first page, the book DOES tell you what libs to use for each chapter. But who REALLY looks at directions!).I have been developing in PB for three years, and this is my first dive into the PFC. This was a good place to start. Don't expect the book to be a reference though.

I found traits in them that are in people I know. Ian and dealing with his guilt and grief will stay with me for a long time. I think we all, at times in our lives, have that desire to know what we can do to make atonement for the wrong(s) we've done in our lives. Did Ian find that?

The plot and characters were mediocre at best, and a bizarre religion, The Church of the Second Chance, played a major part in the story. By the end of the book, it had completely taken over. The Church of the Second Chance fell somewhere between a strict religion and a cult. Yes, Ian Bedloe was close to a saint for looking after three children for the best part of his life, but why the book was named, \\"Saint Maybe\\" is still a mystery to me. One of the children in Ian's care made reference to Ian as perhaps being \\"Saint Maybe,\\" but who the heck is Saint Maybe??

When his older brother dies, the adolescent Ian takes on the care of three children---all of whom are unrelated to him (altho' there is a slightly possibility that the youngest child is his niece). The story follows Ian's attempts to raise the children---but also to find out who he really is.Tyler's writing is lyrical and the characters are memorable and very real.

Yet always previously thinking that had been a triumph for the Saxon peasantry over Norman monarchy. I'm still conflicted - about the history - but not about this book.Belloc also paints a portrait of how money overtook heredity as power over people's lives. And how money worked against the nation.

Some of the leaves were starting to curl and blacken, but I assumed that was from shock. I emailed Brussels directly over that weekend and phoned them on the 21st. I have yet to receive a reply from either venue. The tree itself is now about dead, though we have it in direct sun and have been keeping the soil moist.

The only trade-off was that I had to pay to have a jeweler adjust the band, but considering how much $$ I saved by ordering it from Amazon.com...it was still very worth it.

This volume by Dr. Culver is one of the finest anyone may purchase. I have it on the shelf with R.L Dabney, Louis Berkhof, Dr.Robert Reymond, and Rousas John Rushdoony. You need not agree with any theologian to have their book on your shelf. But having a volume such as this or even the likes of Pannenberg (such as I have) will help you to sharpen and focus what you do believe. I greatly enjoy Dr. Culvers perceptions.

So far so good. However, I could not stick with the book after reading Carol's belief that bad things happen to people who have chosen bad things for themselves. I think she is reflecting the law of attraction in this, that everyone makes a choice whether concious or unconcious, but I can't accept that an innocent person, such as a child or baby, could even have that choice. Even adults, who are strong, courageous people, have suffered violent crime or brutal accidents. I believe things do happen for a reason, and people who are seeking will learn and grow somehow despite adversity, without becoming \\"victims\\". Unfortunately, although this may not have been the author's intent, this statement came across as so absolute, as if somehow people who have had issues have chosen these situations, that it turned me off to the point that I could not continue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Handbook","review":"Carol Tuttle is right on target with this survival tool.

The idea that anyone committed to be a child molester or some other type of reprobate before coming to earth is an old new age saw. But here it is even more ludicrous. We get the touching story of how these brave and noble child molesters committed to do this evil act so that their victims could learn something but it always ends with the victim learning to forgive.The logical question is of course, if the offender is just doing their honor bound duty and providing a service to the victim (sounds like an idea lot of pedophiles could get behind) what on earth would there be to forgive?

The production and entire cast are simply perfect; I can't imagine this story done any other way.Sergei Leiferkus in the title role as the baron gives a ten star performance. Matilda Leyser, the aerialist who appears with the knight as a haunting, shadowy, creepy presence accentuates the brooding power of the music. She's like a demonic spider dangling within reach, revelling at the baron's twisted greed.

Ms. Williams is obviously a black-belt gardener, but the most surprising aspect of the book is that she can make you laugh and ponder miracles at the same time. The title has a double meaning, too. Apart from discovering how a green thumb can be cultivated, the reader also learns how to bring the lessons of gardening into daily life. With a deft and delicate sense of timing, Ms. Williams demonstrates that a garden's most important lesson is not just teaching us how to relax, but how to truly listen to the silent wisdom of plants. They neither toil nor do they spin; they just accept the free sunshine by opening themselves up. Read this book and do thou likewise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful friend for you and your garden.","review":"Carol Williams has written a gardening book that is as instructive as it is eloquent, as practical as it is spiritual.

Characters say \\"man\\" and use words like \\"gimme\\", \\"wanna\\" and \\"a__hole\\". Some of this kind of thing is appropriate, especially in \\"Clouds\\", but the translator is trying so hard to be wacky that it becomes a major distraction. A large sum of money is refered to as \\"a million bucks\\" and so on. A good example of one way in which a translation can go awry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Design","review":"These wrenches are very comfortable to use.

Also, extremely overpriced for the amount you get."},{"rating":"1","title":"superficial, narcissism posing as feminism","review":"The characters are shallow, the plot unbelievable, the dialogue tedious and one dimensional...Faulk's male bashing, upper-class \\"feminists\\" are distorted caricatures of what feminism is all about and an insult to women and to men as well. The protagonist seems nothing more than a narcissic fix for the author to play out her 'fantasies' as the \\"Baracuda\\" of Wall Street. Poor misunderstood quasi-feminist...never got along with other females...just with men....don't hate her because she's beautiful..just hate her because she's a joke. hated the book, resented the author's portrayal of women...bristled at her male bashing...and wished I hadn't wasted my time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too perfect to be worth the read","review":"The characters were too perfect, too simplistic and much too implausible. While feeling their own impowerment, the women in charge seem to almost ignore the women in less-than-perfect living environments, who are taking the brunt of retaliation. Granted, the author gives a small nod to those who are less fortunate, but as the movement grows we hear less from that segment. When was the last time any of us experienced such an overwhelming desire to \\"bond\\" with those more fortunate than ourselves? I hope I'm not the only reader who could see through the gaps in this plot. It led little to the imagination.As for the audio presentation of this book, I am hoping that the unabridged copy was better than what I heard. The narrator chosen did a good job of voice-changes, but instead of the confident, throaty voice of a woman in charge, she came out sounding like a high-pitched school girl who flirts her way through life. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb dumb","review":"This was a really stupid book. My husband warned me after he read it and I should've taken his advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and smart!","review":"This book probes feminist theory in a way that is more accessible and engaging than Camille Paglia's diatribes. It's witty, heartfelt, and honest in its depiction of an tragi-comic heroine and her political exploits. Truly thought-provoking and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit trashy for my effort","review":"Now my review will really reflect my taste in books. Jackie Collins, Olivia GOldsmith (etc) have never been my favorite reads. While I can admit that they may be a fun guilty pleasure as you lay by the pool the time it takes to read for the minimal plot is not a fair trade. Such style we read in Holding Out. Before buying be prepared for some explicit scenes (not exactly romantic but definitely HOT) and for a main character who is so stuck on herself I was actually embarassed for her. The dialog is a bit elementary and I felt idealistic to portray the cool,rich characters in a smooth way, but for me it didn't work. Maybe you might feel differently if you like a more \\"light\\" read, but this is not really book club material. I did get a laugh out of flipping to the Author photo in the back cover, who surprise surprise looks amazingly like the \\"heroine\\" of the book with their lives played out so much the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"HIGHLY overpriced!","review":"1 for $1.99 and $5 shipping?!

This examines the foundations of issues related to such literature, critiquing multicultural literature both individually and as a whole, and analyzing the role of authors and readers in contributing to the experience. The result is not the expected bibliography of works; but a critical assessment of the field as a whole which provides many important insights to parents and teachers alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm, not so great.","review":"This book was assigned to me in a graduate level library and information science class called Multi-Cultural Literature for Children and Young Adults. I was rather disappointed with this book. The author seems to have done very little original research and instead quotes extensively (too much) from many other researchers in the field. I also did not like the author's take on what multi-cultural literature is and how it should be handled in a class room setting. There were many more negative things I could say, but it would take too long here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two different Chester Thompsons....","review":"Just a note to correct the editorial review - Chester Thompson, the drummer and keyboard player, are two entirely different people, NOT one in the same.

My DVD player was set to send the bitstreams to my receiver, and I used my receiver to decode them. Moreover, my receiver reported that the 2.0 dts stream was in 96 kHz and the 5.1 dts stream was in 24 bits / 96 kHz. In other words this appears to be a rare DVD-video disc with higher resolution audio, if my receiver can be believed. (However, I wasn't aware that the DVD-Video format could include dts at 24/96, so people smarter than me may want to comment. I can say that this disc did sound sweeter and smoother in dts than DD, but my listening was subjective, not professional). I do wish that Amazon reviewers would list what the audio stream resolutions are for all DVDs, as it would affect buying decisions for people who care about higher resolution digital sonics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great expectations... Santana fan. Not keen on Shorter.","review":"The concert video is on Netflix, which we used to view it. The teaser looked good, and the initial energy was good. I am a fan of Carlos, and have only a passing familiarity with Wayne Shorter, and am not a fan of jazz, but do enjoy much of it. The Hermans, Glenn Miller, Django, Dave Brubeck, Buddy Rich, and Chick Corea are example of my preferences. Miles Davis I can tolerate some times, but only a couple of things in his catalog grab me.So, as great a jazz musician as Wayne is, I just don't appreciate his style of improvisation. Atonal ramblins played on an instrument that is a fraction of a semitone off key drive me up the wall. Carlos' contributions were sparse and had little impact in terms of pulling the mix into a cohesive energy producing experience. I turned it off after about 25 minutes.So, obviously it is a fine time for those who love the Shorter style, but I prefer less complicated fare when it comes to modal improv."},{"rating":"1","title":"surround sound issues","review":"2 1/2 stars.This is a very good concert teaming up a pre-\\"grammy\\" Santana with Wayne Shorter of Weather Report fame. great rhythm section, drums, conga, timbale. top notch musicians, first rate performance, very entertaining. my big problem comes with the quality of the DVD. I don't see the excellent picture others are raving about and when it comes to the audio options even if the back cover states DD 2.0, DD 5.1 and DTS, the menus are showing something else (DD2.0, DTS 2.0 and DTS 5.1) but neither DTS stream seem to be working. only DD stereo works. I own close to 200 DVD's and all work fine, DTS and all. Bought it directly from amazon, I had it replaced and the new one is the same. This is not part of the great Live at Montreux series productions which are all great, no matter how old the concert is.So the 2 1/2 stars overall rating comes from 4 star performance combined with a 1 star DVD quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare treat","review":"What a combination.

However, Clark is a powerful writer (see \\"The Track of the Cat\\" and \\"The Ox-Bow Incident\\") and he does a very good job of evoking time and place, especially the 20's and 30's, which are written as Fitzgerald might have done if Gatsby had grown up in Reno. The latter part of the book contains descriptions of artistic troubled souls loose in the American West that will be familiar to readers of the novels of the Beat Generation (Kerouac's \\"The Dharma Bums\\" comes to mind). There is also a Steinbeckian flavor to the book, especially the relationships, possibly because they are etched against that larger-than-life Western sky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stories of life, love, and inner conflict.","review":"This book is the story of Tim Hazard, a composer growing up in Reno, NV. The bulk of the book centers around his adolescence. The book is set in the 20s and 30s but it feels extraordinarily contemporary - almost as if you could feel that nothing has really changed since then. More than just a character development of Tim Hazard, it is a story of growing up a misfit, square-pegging it, and living to tell about it.There is no better book in existence (highly humble opinion)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why don't more people know about this book?","review":"When my now fiance handed me this book and said to read it, I really didn't know anything about it. Now that I've read it, I'm rather shocked that this book isn't better known. I really don't know how it's managed to stay obscure for so long. While reading it, I found myself traveling through the world I've always wanted America to be. The only book I've ever found to be comparable in even the most basic way is J.D.

I'm a huge urban legend junkie, so I was looking forward to reading many stories that I had never heard before, and though that did happen, the book is more of a textbook as it goes far into detail about what the urban legend means, where is comes from, and how it spread but doesn't actually have many urban legends. After every urban legend, and even before, there is some sort of explination about the legend, which I honestly skipped. Therefore I only read the few urban legends in the book, and finished it in a few hours. Though I tried to skim the summaries, it was just too boring for me.So though I love urban legends, this was dissapointing due to the heavy explinations that I honestly had no intention to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant Addition To Brunvard's Special Collection","review":"'The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends and Their Meanings'was, in a way, a huge disappointment and a huge gain. The book is a folkloric study of urban legends and their historical significance. The book features a small, trimmed version of anthologies. It is a very hateful book, but somehow I adore the nostalgia in it.If you like this book, I suggest these items:- Scream Series (DVD/BLU-RAY) (1996-2000)- Scre4m (DVD/BLU-RAY) (2011)- Urban Legend (DVD/BLU-RAY) (1998)- Carved (DVD) (2007)- The Eye 3 (DVD) (2009)- Campfire Tales (DVD) (1997)- Final Destination Series (DVD/BLU-RAY/3-D) (2000-2009)- \\"Be Very, Very Afraid\\" by Jan Brunvard- \\"Scary Story Reader\\" by the Dockery's- Babysitter Wanted (DVD/BLU-RAY) (2010)- Halloween (DVD/BLU-RAY) (1978)I would rate this novel: R For Depictions of Bizarre Horror Violence Throughout, Disturbing Images and Gratuitous Sexuality and Graphic Nudity"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Book About Urban Legends","review":"I bought this book thinking that it was a collection of short stories about urban legends.

It is not worth the money to buy it new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groundbreaking study of contemporary folklore","review":"Jan Harold Brunvand collects some of the most well-known urban legends in the US, traces them to their possible origins, and explores their importance to society as reinforcers of conventional morality. I remember seeing the author interviewed on the David Letterman Show back when the book was first published in the early 80s. It took me a long time to get around to reading it, but the topic is timeless and Brunvand's analysis has not aged at all. Today, we have websites such as Snopes to help us separate fact from legend, but this book was a groundbreaking work that helped popularize the academic study of contemporary folklore. Intended for use in college courses, it may seem a bit dry at times and even a little repetitious, but the inherent fascination of the topic shines through."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Relief","review":"If you don't believe that ADD is real, you'll love this book.

You can do this by draping fabric over a live body, but it takes time and skill to know if you are doing it right. Secondly, no one should use gingham as a grid for the body. Gingham rarely has perfectly square squares and the fabric is extremely difficult to get on grain because it usually has a high content of polyester. Finally the author sums up finalizing your custom pattern and what to do with it when you are done in just a few pages. The whole subject is far more complex.

If you follow the book, and you will most likely need a buddy, you will have a working map of your body and the directions to create patterns for the vast majority of basic styles we really wear. This is a customized sloper and introduction to patternmaking and design. There's a ton of valuable information crammed into this book, even if you don't create the bodymap. Bodymapping is not designed to help you alter commercial patterns. It is designed to free a serious sewer, enabling confident creativity."},{"rating":"2","title":"a non-traditional approach to fitting","review":"i am very pleased with the new concept of fitting to my body. since it has been difficult and impossible to fit a pattern to my assemetrical type body, this approach is the only one that has worked for me. once you understand that this book is intended to fit for each individual and not a book on pattern alterations, it is very easy to understand. one needs to look at this book as a new approach to fitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent information resulting in great fitting garments!","review":"I am an experienced home sewer and needed help fitting my ageing body. Many fitting books try to guide you through general body differences but with Bodymapping you actually end up with a pattern that has been draped on your own body and shows your own angles and curves and the result is a garment that fits.There are many steps in this process and you will need to spend some serious time doing this but my sewing buddy and I have used this book and found the fit of garments we made to be superior to any of the previous methods of fit.This book is not intended to show you how to alter commercially available patterns but to create one to precisely fit your own body. I found the instructions for making additional styles from the basic block to be clear. I have made the tanktop, and armhole princess styles with ease."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good guide to any Detroit newcomer","review":"Any newcomer to the Detroit area should pick up a copy of Global Journeys in Metro Detroit. I did so when I moved to the area in 2000 and have used my copy almost weekly to find area shops, restaurants and cultural events. Fortunately, and not surprisingly, the book's title and contents cover more than just the bombed out, decrepit, crime ridden, over taxed, city proper. (Much of Detroit's ethnicity resides in the safer suburbs.) As a bonus, the book includes a good amount of information on Detroit's \\"suburban\\" neighbor and occasional cultural superior, Windsor, Ontario, Canada. The lack of any useable index keeps this book from earning the highest rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best.","review":"I have been working with network cables for years in school systems. I have just spent a day working with these connectors, and I am not impressed. These look like quality connectors, and the metal casing makes them appear to be heavy-duty so they would stand up to the stresses that teachers can put on a patch cable when frequently plugging and unplugging cables into their laptops.BUT--- the connectors seem to have a hard time making the necessary connections both on the computer end and on the switch end. The pop up tab that locks the connector in place doesn't pop up high enough, and the cable will dislodge easily. When I bent the tab to make it work better, some of the tabs broke off, so I had to redo the fitting.In fairness, the cable connectors were easy to make up and crimp, but the frustration in getting the finished cable to stay in place will keep me from purchasing this brand again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"Cycle, remixed by My Bloody Valentine, is one of the loveliest songs I've ever heard and abides forever dear to my heart. I both love and mourn that it is obscure, that this album full of shimmering sweet music goes largely unnoticed, even though it is an homage of deepest authenticity and affection. Rather than rate it 5 stars, I'd prefer to rate it Pearl of Great Price. Simply beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"day trip","review":"you can lose track of time at moments listening to this album. you intend to get things done, make coffee and all that while listening to it...but somehow things just get put on hold, and you fall into the details of the lovely sounds and poignant chirping melodies. japan boy Cornelius delivers something really unexpected. his rendition of \\"windy hill\\" is like a mini world within an already precious one. and there are some funny bits, too, care of the 'remixers' making such excellent use of the Pastel's otherwise childish, oddly tuneless vocals. a real find--if you can set your coffee down."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Last! A Pastels Album You Can Enjoy (Almost)","review":"There are a lot of very clever and talented musicians on this - unfortunately, none of them are The Pastels. The remixers art has rendered the artist whose actually being remixed irrelevant - which when it come to The Pastels can only be a good thing. The most puzzling thing about this CD is why genuinely talented artists like Jim O'Rourke and Kevin Shields should waste their time with an indie dinosaur like The Pastels - I suppose the alchemical urge to turn base metal into gold must have been too strong.This is listenable, which is major advance for The Pastels, unfortunately there's still too much of Stephen's bronchial moose vocals and 40 year old adolescent whining for my liking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delightfully awful","review":"This game is a train wreck and one of the titles that hastened Atari's withdrawal from the industry. Basically, Virtua Racing on the Genesis looks and plays better. There is no texture mapping, the geometry has so few polygons it's hard to even tell what everything is, and the game often dips to what seems below 10 fps. And to be extra sadistic, the career mode makes you go through 10 to 15 laps to finish a race. the only redeeming aspect is that despite all the control flaws and glitches, the career mode is beatable, if your willing to commit the hours to even complete it, which is a bigger waste of time than using a vacuum cleaner on the sidewalk. It's a historic testament to the Jaguars dismal failure. Certainly an anti-classic for collectors only."},{"rating":"1","title":"...Lame","review":"I recently purchased this game to add to my Jaguar game collection. I remembered playing it when I had a Jaguar years ago, and remembered it being dull. Its pretty much the worst racing game I have ever played, it can't even compete with SNES/Genesis 16 bit racing games. The car is impossible to control and the game feels like they rushed development to meet some deadline. Virtua Racing for the Sega Genesis is worlds ahead. The cheap price reflects the poor quality of this game. Skip it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent graphics, sub-par sound effects, horrible controls","review":"For a Jaguar game, this game had decent Virtua Racer-style graphics, with choppy animation the only negative aspect of the graphics. Sound effects are surprisingly dull. What really brings this game down are the horrible controls...steering is way too difficult to make this game enjoyable. This game had the potential to be one of the top Jaguar games, but the shoddy controls actually make it one of the worst Jaguar games."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOBBI JOE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The first time I saw this movie (about 1988), I came in right when the elk head and the lamp and everything are laughing, and I was glued! I have never lost interest in this movie at all. I wore out my first VHS copy from rewinding little bits over and over (\\"Swallow this\\",\\"Groovy\\", etc.) Everytime I watch it I am brought to tears from laughing my ass off! Some may dismiss it as cheap, low-budget fodder. But the truth is that it is extremely sharp and clever, full of ideas I have never seen before or since in a movie. And the actor, Bruce Campbell, who portrays Ash, should be up there sharing Jim Carrey's popularity. It's one of those great movies you just gotta have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SAM AND BRUCE GET TOGETHER AGAIN TO KICK SOME MORE A**!!!!!!","review":"I am just gonna tell you how much this movie rules......Uh...IT RULES! What else can I tell ya? Ash is at it again with his sawed-off and he's gonna kick some zombie a**. Dead by Dawn makes a huge mark on the horror genre and has been quite the influence on movies like From Dusk Till Dawn and other such movies. Sam Raimi can really disturb you with his weird-a** camera angles and different crazy-a** camera shots. Its good to see that a director puts more into his movie then whats needed. I had a wicked time watching this movie. Its a true crowd pleaser and after all yallz, aint that what movies like this are all about?"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT IS NOT A REMAKE ! (LET ME EXPLAIN) -","review":"WHEN SAM RAIMI BEGAN THE MAKING OF THIS FILM, HE NO LONGER HAD THE RIGHTS TO THE FIRST MOVIE'S FOOTAGE : THAT IS WHY THE FIRST 10-15 MINUTES ARE SPENT WITH ASH GOING TO THE CABIN.

NOT REMAKE - SEQUAL."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive Evil Dead II DVD","review":"The is the best presentation of Evil Dead 2 I have ever seen. The image restoration is phenomenal, and the level of detail in almost every shot is now astounding. Its worth upgrading just for the new video transfer. The extra's are unfortunately mostly repeats from the previous special edition although a new documentary where the special effects suppervisor comments on a number of behind the scenes pictures is a welcome but not overly satisfying addition. THe movie speaks for itslef......its comic perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh? I thought I'd died.","review":"Phew! what a movie. Little weak points prevent this from becoming perfect, but Bruce Campbell goes down into Cult Movie history with his own more than hilarious little de ja vous. The choppy special effects mixed with perplexing photography made this satiric horror a guideline for Cult films to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Send Up of a Genre","review":"Evil Dead is a film every one should have in their collection. By no means a scary movie but there is plenty of edge of your seat moments ie. Ash realising their is something down in the cellar with him, to the comical Ash's Hand being only one example of the comedy. A film that has aged very well and is as good today as the day it was released.Buy it and Laugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More of less a remake than a sequal","review":"The begining of the film is a remake of Ash & his girlfriend. It doesn't include any other characters that where in the first one. Before I saw \\"Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn,\\" I saw film clips of it on a show on The Discovery Channel about horror films. The scene I saw on that show that was not in the theactrical release is after ash chops his hand off, the hand jumps up and chokes him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce Cambell is god.","review":"Hail to the king, baby! By far the best in the series. Bruce Cambell is the epitomy of groovy. Everything that makes a good movie is defined by this movie. Chainsaws, sawed of shotguns and zombies. Need I say more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ted Raimi was punished","review":"This is a pretty short film (or at least it is compared to all the other films I own), so I'll keep the review short. Evil Dead II is typical Sam Raimi, there is an abundance of flair and wit, there is a lot of gore (of all colours(not colors, I'm English). The tone is set early on and it builds to an interesting conclusion , it leaves you wondering, it left me wanting more. The story is not really anything that breaks new ground, but this doesn't matter, the way the film is made and the way that it uses the elements of the story is fresh, or at least this is the case for me. The commentary is fun and interesting and the featurette, although a sign of the age in which it was made, is also good. Many people think that this film is overrated, that's down to them. Everyone is different, and in the end it's whether you like it or not that counts. Just to let you know, I like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"and then there was doom.","review":"A very important movie, and one of the funniest I have ever seen. One of the few films I enjoy more with each viewing. Jim Carrey obviously took several lessons in physical comedy from Bruce Campbell and this film... too bad he became the megastar and Bruce is still more of a \\"cult\\" favorite. Maybe it's cooler that way. Watch the film, and you'll know where the inspiration for the \\"Doom\\" video game came from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Workshed","review":"This film is always a fun treat to watch, non-stop thrills, chills, and laughs. You'll moan in disgust and then before your done exhaling you'll be laughing till your sides split (literally). Ash is the greatest anti-hero EVER! Who else can slay demons, devils, and witches with a shotgun in one hand and chainsaw mounted on the other? Especially after having a real bad day like - killing your girlfriend (twice), being thrown out of a car, kicked repeatedly, chased by unseen demons, and cutting off your own possessed hand, not anyone that I can think of. Chock full of blood, guts, monsters, killer dialog, and impressive special effects, a very fun movie time and again - and what an ending! By far the best of the trilogy and a fantastic DVD package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evil Dead 2 Dead By Dawn","review":"I find Bruce Cambell to be a terriffic actor.His performance in this film should have been more recognizable than it was.This film was very bloody and horrifyingly funny.I would recommend this film to anyone who is a true horror movie fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"evil dead II..a sequel that rocks","review":"Anyone who follows the Evil Dead Trilogy knows that the first and last installments are polar opposites in terms of tone and content, but both were still incredibly entertaining..Evil Dead II strikes the perfect balance between the pure horror of part one and the prat falls of part III...and is my favorite of the trio. Hilarious and gorge-risingly graphic, it's a near perfect mix of horror and humor,and is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let the cover fool you !!","review":"Although the filming is somewhat better then the original, and the directing is better. This movie is still no better. I know hundreds of so called B movies that are better then this film. The acting is horrible, please don't waste your time you will never get it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror?","review":"Well, I think this movie isn't about horror. It's just a kind of child's playing! This is a real ridiculous movie. my advice? don't buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HUH?

Picture has a fuzzy quality to it. Not saying it's horrible but really there is no reason to upgrade from the dvd version. I also purchased Dawn of the Dead and there was an immediate quality difference, well worth the upgrade. Unfortunately there just isn't enough of a quality upgrade for Evil dead 2 to make an extra dip worth it. Real Bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil dead II wax fest.","review":"I did a blind buy on the Blue ray version, and its a good thing that I'm a fan of the movie (but then who else would buy this in any format) because the DNR makes the faces smooth and washes out most of the detail, its so clean it looks unnatural. This should be a $10 catalog buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I own it, and so should you","review":"gory, scary and funny. Not too many movies can pull that off. As a matter of fact, there has been alot of failed attempts at horror comedy, I think this succeeded!! The first time I seen this I was laughing so hard I couldnt stop. Although, it isnt non stop laughter, so dont get me wrong. If your new to the horror catagory of your video store, grab this, and hellraiser, and some popcorn, thats about all you need"},{"rating":"2","title":"stupidity as an art form","review":"This has to be the most idiotic movie I have ever seen.

Ash is back again with a new love......of course she doesn't last long. Ash has many loves in his life. This movie is sure to make you jump with surprise and laugh yourself silly, as Ash knows. Don't be a goody little two shoes!!!!! See this now!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Funniest horror movie in existense","review":"There's nothing better than a movie that's made to look so corny as this one ON PURPOSE! Director Sam Raimi, in my mind is a genius for making things hokey or corny on purpose, to increase their shock facter, or the laughs the certain scenes get out of you. This movie is lacking in plot, but I don't care, and I don't think anybody else should care. The lack of plot makes it an even better satire of you basic slasher horror flick. This movie makes me laugh almost as much as the 3 Monty Python movies, and its not even marketed as a comedy! But it is, we all know that. And that's why this is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come get some...","review":"This is by far one of the classic must-see horror films. If you are a fan of the genre or are trying to get a better idea of how it should be done, you need to see this film. ED2, more of a remake than a sequel, pits the reluctant hero Ash, played to perfection by Bruce Campbell, against the book of the dead and the spirits brought to life by it. Truly a wonderful mix of slapstick comedy and horror, ED2 is not to be missed. And do yourself a favor...see Evil Dead 1 and Army of Darkness while you're at it. If you like this one, which you will, you will enjoy the other two as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absoultly one of the greatest Horror Films of all time!","review":"The Evil Dead was an instant classic, but the sequel Evil Dead 2 Dead By Dawn made this series a cult following. I originally saw this on the Big Screen and my friends and I were the only ones Laughing our guts out while the rest of the audience was screaming!!! An all around good time. If you love GREAT HORROR! SEE THIS FILM AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy and cool!","review":"This movie is what started it all for me. Love this type of horror movie, not to serious not too silly but scary as hell. Sam Rami shows great direction skills and imagination. Bruce Campbell will always have a gig at comic book conventions for the rest of his life because of this role. Out of the three this is the best. Sam, come back and direct some real movies and leave spidy alone. This movie is just a bad ass, fun movie to pop in and make your kids watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's carve ourselves a witch!","review":"A chainsaw-wielding, shotgun-shooting enforcer of evil...enough said. Although the first Evil Dead had it's share of slap stick humor and gore, this sequel is definitely an upgrade over its predecessor. The gore is so over-the-top, you can't help but to laugh at the Kool-Aid spewing and syrup-spilling madness. The scene where the severed hand gets caught in the mouse trap and then flips off Ash is classic! A must own for any B-movie horror fan, or any horror fan for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird, then non-stop killing","review":"This movie was really movie at the beginning, but the killing parts (which was about the entire movie) were fun to watch. But the girl in shorts was stupid, why would she leave the injured red-neck next to the basement door where her undead dad is? But how come everytime when the main character gets a demon inside, he then turns back to normal. And was the huge monster in the cabin around the ending the demon all along? Good to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out!!!","review":"This movie is up there with the \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show\\". It is scary and funny. It is the precursor to the \\"Army of Darkness\\". Another hilarious hoot. I can watch these movies again and again. If you are in for some scare, blood and laughing. Get this movie. You won't be short changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"What can I say to anyone about Evil Dead 2 that they don't know already?

It's funny, it's gory, it's violent, it's silly, it's witty, it's clever, it's got snazzy one-liners... oh, it's just Evil Dead 2.Sam Raimi created what is quite possibly the greatest sequel to a horror film since Dawn of the Dead. This is a masterpiece of critical (and hilarious) madness. An orgy of slaughter, sawed-off shotguns, chainsaws, axes, hacked-off limbs, h0rny trees, laughing furniture, decapitated girlfriends, ravenous demons, grizzly decay, green/black/blue blood, demonic possession, blood-flooding, slow descent into insanity and other delightful things.Evil Dead 2 is pure brilliance. And one hell of a DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars!?!?!?!? YES - for it's genre (horror-comedy)!","review":"The Evil Dead II *IS* a remake and a sequel at the same time. In fact, the earliest releases of this on VHS said \\"Evil Dead Too\\" on the cover - as in \\"This is ALSO the Evil Dead\\".While the plot is basic that isn't a factor - I mean *all* plots are simple when you think about it.I once spent a dextromethorphan laced night watching and rewatching this movie for 8 hours straight. It was really cool - as I kept phasing back into and out of the state of consciousness commonly refrred to as \\"reality\\" I felt like I was actually in the movie and since my sense of time was all wacked out, I kept getting weird deja vu feelings as I watched it over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"Its nice to see a comedy with such wonderful pacing. The movie just keeps going and going. I never wanted it to end. Both the first and second films were hilarious, but humor wasn't the first films intention.

Nothing can top the chainsaw, the sawed off shotgun, and how its summed up by one word: \\"groovy\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"What a gorge-fest/damn fine belly laugh.","review":"Though not a huge horror fanatic,I have to say that this,for me,is the funniest,scariest and of course,most spine-tingling horror movie of all time.If I have a bad day at work,I just think of this movie and my day brightens.Thankyou Bruce et al,for your vision and artistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the greatest film of all time.","review":"If you have not seen this film, do yourself a favor and watch it at least five times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cult classic Horror/Comedy?

If you want a serious movie with an engrossing,twisted plot,not here folks,but it sure is fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This movie is half horror, half Gorey comedy.Just about the original Cabin-in-the-Woods type of movie. Required viewing for horror fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute masterpiece!!","review":"Put simply, this movie is an absolute shinning example of how a horror/comdie movie is done. It delivers on both elements completly. Bruce Campbell is legendary for his role here and in Evil Dead and Army of Darkness (films 1 and 3 in the tri-ology)as Ash who's primary bullet point on his resume is \\"Slayer of the Evil Dead\\". Sam Raimi wrote (along with Scott Spiegel) and direceted this flick. There are so many memorable lines and scenes in this film, it's foolish to list them all. If you've never heard of or like this film, you're not a horror fan. This movie is a timeless masterpiece for horror fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic on Blu-ray","review":"Evil Dead II is a classic horror film with cartoony overtones. This is the predecessor to Army of Darkness.If you already own the DVD and are not a huge fan of the Evil Dead movies, it is hard to recommend the Blu-ray version simply for audio/video quality. The picture does seem brighter and more clear in high-def, but can be subtle during a good bit of the picture. Since much of it was filmed in the dark, it tends to look grainy at times. Daylight scenes look outstanding compared to the DVD though with the exception of the final sequence when Ash gets sent back to the medieval period. For some reason, that did not look too spectacular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible movie - terrible looking transfer","review":"title says it all, the movie is a classic, but the source material (film, very old, very cheap, film) shows all of its flaws.

As the stalwart hero Ash, Campbell abandons the straight-faced terror of the first film and goes right for the diaphragm. His jut-jawed bravado elevates this film from standard horror-fare to true classic. It's much more tongue-in-cheek than the original, and it's more enjoyable for it.The blood-and-guts quotient is lavishly high - but it's too bad that the distributor mandated cutting some of the gorier scenes to avoid an X rating (they aren't even included on the DVD).As if the movie itself weren't enough, the DVD features one of the most entertaining commentary tracks on the market. All participants are affable and informative. It's like watching with a bunch of your buddies--and they just happen to be the ones who made the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding....","review":"The first time I ever saw this movie, I caught it about 15 minutes into the show. It was nearly 3am and I was really tired but I'll be buggered if I could turn it off. I just watched in morbid fascination as to what was going to happen next. The whole movie is an exercise in surrealism. Later, working in a small video store, I used to recommend this movie to choice customers on the bet that if they could turn the movie off after the first 15 minutes, I'd refund their money. Out of the 50 or so times I issued that challenge, never not ever once did anyone ever ask for their money back! In my opinion, that should say more good things about the movie that I ever could."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"So hot , they had to name the main character ASH!\\"","review":"Much better then the origanal, this is a true cult classic, more comedy and more gore. That's the way a movie should be made. Bruce Campbell is my favourate actor and if you see this movie you will find out why. Put it this way take Jim Carrey and place him into the Evil Dead series and you got Bruce Campbell. The simplist settings and most unreal funny speacial effects. This is a must see. Although this movie as no real connection to the first, infact I think it is just a remake of the first with a few little new scenes. But how it ends, is basically how the third version starts of.

Bruce Campbell and his wife go to stay in this cabin, little realising that the cabin is inhabited by murderous evil spirits.

Not for horror fans looking to be scared -- more of a hilarious spoof of horror films. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertainingly Disturbing!","review":"This movie was certainly interesting. My friends and I had to watch it a couple of times to actually get the full affect. Bruce Campbell's performance as \\"Ash\\" our, unlikely hero, is truly a credit to acting! The only thing is that it was just a remake of the first one! It seemingly took place afer the first Evil Dead, but everything happen again, and in the same order! But, despite that, it was truly a great movie. Not really a true horror film, but definately scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evil Dead 2 not what you think","review":"Ok, first off this is not actually a sequel to the first movie. It is more of a remake with a new twist, but nonetheless it is a great movie. Raimi and Co. could not get the stock footage from the first Evil Dead, so they decided to re-shoot the movie as a remake of sorts. I would say that ED2 is more of a black comedy than a horror movie, but it still carries enough scares to be good. The character of Ash comes into his own in this movie. It is a great movie alone or to be watched after viewing Evil Dead, but be prepared. If you are view both of them for the first time, it can be a tad confusing, but all in all I would recommend these movies to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts good, concludes in a tiresome manner","review":"I somewhat agree with the viewers from San Francisco and Atlanta below. This film isn't worthy of a five star review, but it does provide a good share of laughs. But by the conclusion, all the laughs are gone, but there aren't any scares to add to the film. Bruce Campbell's performance is not bad, but he should stick more with the one-liners from Army of Darkness, which is a much better film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evil Dead II. REVIEW","review":"Not so much a sequel as it is remake, EVIL DEAD 2 takes the horror comedy genre to a whole new level. Campbell is goofy hero, Ash, who once again does battle with the demonic forces that have been unleashed in the woods. Filled with gruesome over-the-top slapstick and some of the very best make-up effects (courtesy of the good people at KNB) ever seen in that time, \\"Evil Dead 2\\" is a ghoulish good time. Sam Raimi has clearly been inspired by The Three Stooges here as you get to see Ash borrow a whole lot of their old gags. Actor Bruce Campbell was correct when he called this \\"the mother of all sequels\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groovy.....another cult gem","review":"Here we are again,the eveil dead 2.if youve read my reviews for evil daed and army of darkness you should know im a big fan of this series.evil dead 2 is just like the first one with the thrills and chills we have come to love and expect.this time around ash has more dark humor and one liners(much like army of darkness)and that helps to lighten the tone a bit but by no means does it take away from the movie.all the bllod and gore you remember from the first is back,as are the deadites.overall if youve enjoyed the first part then your sure to love this one and army of darkness.and if not give a shot another because this movie is another MUST OWN for horror fans,diehard or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book Of The Dead","review":"I have to say that Evil Dead 2 is a great movie in popculture history, like Star Wars or the Blues Brothers. It is a great dvd to have in any collection, and in this awsome dvd case you get so much for your money. Its not only the DVD but the Necronomicon. its pages have special incantations that can be translated. the book is covered in a prosthetic rubber so it has that halloween smell to it and if you press its one good eye it screams. this is a great buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great horror film","review":"This is good horror film. The gore is pretty popular and violence is strong. I love this movie. Ash and his girlfriend take a trip to an old cabin and accidently plays a recording with a spell that brings the forest to life and posesses his girlfriend and also those who come to the cabin later on. Great special effects. Also, if you like this movie, rent Dawn of the Dead, The Evil Dead, Dead Alive, or Army of Darkness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh a minute fun","review":"A remake of its predecessor, EVIL DEAD 2 is done much better. With a higher budget, Raimi made a version with better film, sound, and adds some hilarious slapstick bits Three Stooges style.

Evil dead 1, 2 and the Army of Darkness. Each part can be seen seperatly, but for the best effect watch together, I have also seen 2 endings to the last part of this film. If you are interested in hearing about them mail me. These films are one of my all time favourites. This is a horror, suspence, comedy, film. Lots of blood. Also lots of really violent film deletions, or should I say sensoring. If you are unlucky enough to get a sensored version, then I would be very sorry for you, but this film doesn't rely on scenes's of incredible viloence anyway. so still worth the buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary,Funny,or Both","review":"If you have never seen a evil dead movie you are in for a treat.

Yeah, this movie is a little scary, not too much though. But it's more frightening than most of today's \\"scary\\" movies. It's also much more enjoyable.Bruce Campbell is the ultimate b-movie actor. He has the greatest facial expressions in history. For about 30 minutes during the movie, there are no words, just grunts and facial expressions by Campbell as he's getting attacked by the evil spirits. That part of the movie is great fun. These sequences of Campbell fighting off the spirits show how much of a genius Sam Raimi is.The sequences with Campbell were so good, it's possible to tolerate the non-Campbell parts of the movie.I highly recommend this movie. It is perfect for those nights when friends are visiting and you are all debating what to watch. Chances are they wouldn't have seen this movie and if they did, they'll be excited to know you have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great cult classic combining comedy and horror","review":"This is one of my all time favorite movies. The combo of gore and comedy is great. If you're a fan of movies like Re-Animator or Street Trash, you need this in your collection. I actually like this better than Evil Dead. For a sequel, I say this is one of the best ones I've ever come across. The effects and story are incredible and this is one of the movies I can never get sick of. Its not your basic Zombie or Living Dead movie, but its one with a twist. For any horror fan, this is a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is hilarious!","review":"Unitenntionally hilarity?

Where the hell are the other people? If you just glaze over the first 5 minutes, and skip up to where the last left off, when the Evil gets right up in Ash's face, you should be fine, because the movie is great otherwise from the part of the prologue with Ash and Linda.

It's still just about the most fun you can have on a Saturday night with a bunch of your buddies without getting arrested. A sense of humor is required; nerves of steel are not necessary. The movie is worth watching if only for the delightful scene in which Ash battles his possessed hand. Anyone who disparages Bruce Campbell's talent does not have the capacity to appreciate a true genius of physical comedy. Yes, there's gore, and a lot of it, but it is so (deliberately, I'm sure) overdone that it can't be frightening. It's a good starter horror flick for those with weak hearts. The ULTIMATE Halloween party movie! (For my fellow female viewers-- BC has cheekbones you could slice a salami on).

Just like most every other movie that has tried to be a horror and a comedy at the same time - it ends up being neither. Although I chuckled a few times, and, I will admit the gore effects were cool at times, since this is primarily supposed to be a horror film, I must point out that there is not a single scary moment in this entire film. I'm sorry but there is just nothing interesting about a severed hand giving it's former owner the middle finger. It's not scary and it's not funny. It's just plain stupid. I mention that scene because it's the perfect metaphor for the entire movie: not scary, not funny, just really stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Doesn't compare to the first Evil Dead.","review":"This movie was one and a half hours of torture. The first movie was bad, but at least it was humorous. This poor attempt at a sequel was nothing short of a dud. The jokes were too strained, and it was clear that there was an attempt at humor.

I guess you could call this movie a horror-comedy, but it's not even that really because there is nothing scary about it. Whatever you do, don't call it a pure horror movie because it isn't one by any stretch of the imagination. If you want to have slap-stick comedy and \\"Three Stooges\\" like antics then make a cheesy comedy like this one. In my opinion, this is a poor movie as far as the \\"horror\\" genre is concerned. It's one thing to be gory and imaginitive, but it's another thing to be just plain stupid and ridiculous and that's what we have here in the \\"Evil Dead II\\".

If you have never seen this movie, my best suggestion is that you also see Army of Darkness right after.

After the disappointing sales of their oddly experimental fourth effort, No Code, Pearl Jam's fanbase was waning. Consequently, the band's fifth effort, Yield, shows Eddie Vedder and friends learning from their previous mistakes. Such progression is evidenced on this single. \\"Given to Fly\\", presents a subtle lean toward adult alternative while still maintaining the youthful grit of grunge, not to mention the riffs bear an intentional resemblance to the Led Zeppelin classic \\"Going to California\\". \\"Pilate\\" follows a similar formula - minus the Zeppelin homage - with equally satisfying results. Ultimately, the \\"Given to Fly\\" single proves that Pearl Jam could still make music that balanced depth with accessibility, and with the humorous exclusive track \\"Leatherman\\" to boot, this release samples the lighthearted side of Pearl Jam during its finest hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"pj nut here","review":"i am a pj nut i will buy anything pj. the reason YOUI should get this is because it has LEATHERMAN an incredible unrealwased b side, it is as good as yellow ledbetter"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good collection of Short Stories","review":"There were some very good pieces in this book.

I have one of the first CDs manufactured for this and Late for the Sky and get a lot of speaker buzz at moderate sound levels; hope that has been fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Everyman ~ 30 Years and it has not faded.","review":"I first heard this album in the Spring of 1974, a friend of mine had just returned from serving in the U.S. Army in Germany. We were listening to his stereo and he put Everyman on the Dual turntable. I was blown away, the next day I went out and bought a copy of the album myself. I copied it to cassette so I could listen to it in my car. Over the years I played that original tape until it broke, I then made another copy of the plastic. A few years back I finally started converting to CD's, one of the first I looked for was Everyman, it has not faded one bit in the last 30 years. It is still one of Jackson Browne's greatest releases, with every song a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"just figured out something i'd never noticed before...","review":"I've had this album for probably about 25 years now, and I just realized something today about the song \\"Colors Of The Sun\\" that somehow had not occurred to me previously: The short, minor-key verses (which lead into the more majestic, major-key choruses) are exact haikus, following the 5-7-5 syllable pattern. A rather ingenius songwriting adaptation. I'd always been impressed by the way the verses contrasted with the choruses on this song -- they made the choruses really jump out, as if the sun was emerging from behind the clouds (\\"Suddenly, A Summer Night\\" from David Mead's excellent new disc *Tangerine* has this same quality) -- but I had no idea till just now that Browne wrote them specifically as haikus. Nice to have little things in old favorite albums that can still be revealing themselves half a lifetime later...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive early Jackson Browne","review":"When I think about the Jackson Browne songs that have meant the most to me over the years, \\"For Everyman\\" is always number one. This song in particular has been a source of inspiration to many who feel that the answers to life's nagging questions won't necessarily be found on the nightly news or in pop culture. \\"These Days\\" is a lovely example of Jackson's introspection coming to the surface in a fine melodic offering. Jackson always digs down deep when writing and reveals his heart to us. My other favorite songs from the album include \\"I Thought I Was A Child\\" and \\"The Times You've Come\\". (This album almost rated a 10 just because of \\"For Everyman\\", but the inclusion of \\"Red Neck Friend\\" and \\"Ready Or Not\\" brings it down to a 9.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"HOLLYWOOD BIOGRAPHIES-THE LEADING MEN","review":"BAD--BAD--BAD-SHOWS A BUNCH OF BAD QUALITY TRAILERS--DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY & DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING HOLLYWOOD BIOGRAPHIES-THE LEADING LADIES BECAUSE IF IT'S ANYTHING LIKE LEADING MEN THEN IT WOULD BE A WASTE OF MONEY TWICE--IF IT'S BIOGRAPHIES YOU WANT OF THE STARS THEN PLEASE BUY THE ONES FROM A&E TV--"},{"rating":"1","title":"Equally Bad","review":"This DVD set on the Leading Men, as well as the companion set on Leading Ladies, are done exactly the same, on the cheap.

Later I forgot the name of the collection and most of the tracks but one title stayed with me over the years: Earth Dance. I searched and searched for anything called \\"Earth Dance\\" in the hopes that I could find it once again...but I had no luck. As the years passed I basically gave up hope and then I remembered another part of a title: something about the word, \\"Mystic\\".

On my TV pops up Arrested Development season 2 which contains the episodes of Switch Hitter, Queen For A Day, Burning Love, Ready, Aim, Marry Mel, Out on A Limb and Hand To God. I check many times the cover on disc and the box. The title is Angel season 5 disc 3 on disc and Angel Season 5 on the box. Nothing's wrong on the cover. But, the inside of disc, who knows ? So, how come it happened ? Is this package actually the rejected product ? I paid for the good product, not the rejected product. Whom has the responsibility to check the product first before release them ?

Mild mannered Fred turning into an ancient powerwas a brilliant move. The women in this season were also the sexiest ever. Of course, there are the fatal attraction plots with the liason to Wolfram and Hart. Numero Cinqo about the 5 dead Mexican wrestlers is an amazing and compelling story. The soul swapping between Spike and Angel, and the \\"Necro\\", (Manager of the Dead)was frightening and compelling. The final final with the rain falling in the urban landscape, thousands of dead soulsto fight, and the \\"Let's Roll\\" ending bring back the reality of the never ending fight between good and evil, even among the dead. I really loved the final season. This is a \\"Must Have\\" for angel fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angel not the same as other 4 seasons","review":"As always, David Boreanaz and his supporting cast do an amazing job. However, this season was not the greatest. I thought they would be able to do much better things with Spike than what they did- why couldn't they do the same amazing job they did with him in Buffy? There's something off with Angel himself- he changes too much and there's no flow of character development like there was in the other four seasons. You could also tell they tried too hard to have light in this season- literal light, like sun rays. But Angel doesn't belong in the light; they tried to take the show places it doesn't belong, and they didn't really succeed. All in all though, it's great show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good review 1","review":"The DVD set was good, it completes my collection of the Angel series.

I LOVE both series, and admire Joss Whedon for bringing us great characters and ideas to Television.What I liked about Angel, is it seemed more \\"mature\\" and \\"adult\\" than Buffy. Seasons 1-3 were great. Season 4 was alright, not bad. As for this season, it's good. The main thing that's keeping this season from being a full 5 is the last episode.

It is not a true story. Slavomir Rawicz was a pole who was taken prisoner by the Russians, but he did not escape nor did he travel to India in 1942. Rather, he was let go as part of the general release of poles held by the Russians in 1942 and travelled with many others into Iran. The facts of the case were uncovered by private researchers and the BBC. The evidence includes documents from the polish exile archives in London in Rawicz own hand as well as documents from the former soviet union.The book is an ok adventure story and can be enjoyed in that sense.

There's not a single song that you would skip on this CD.

Cultural and religious values are also passed along in this manner.This book contains a set of stories from the culture of the Pueblo Indians of the American Southwest. It was a land of little rain, and the tribes lived in permanent structures near streams and farmed, raising corn and other crops. The natural dangers, the animals they were familiar with and the mythological creatures that they believed inhabited their world all appear in these stories.

Reminding me of some what a cross betwee folk and R&B at times I truly love the sound of many of these songs. \\"The Pretender\\" is probably my favorite tune off of this album but the very haunting strains of \\"Sleep's Dark and Silent Gate\\" and \\"Daddy's Tune\\" are also very emotional and stand out quite clearly in my memory.

The mood, the music, and the lyrics all come together to make this one heck of an album. Nearly every song is fraught with meaning, and nearly every song is infused with the virtuosity of Browne and his band. The songs are intellectual and they are introspective. They are thoughtful and they are tender. From the opening lines of The Fuse to the final notes of the title cut, this is a great album to listen to when you are in a reflective mood. There is not a song I dislike save perhaps Daddy's Tune. On The Pretender, Jackson Browne has come of age and shows he is certainly not one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic JB - beware first track on MP3","review":"I owned this album on vinyl back in the day and it's as good as I remember it. Though not as good as his other recordings of the period (Late for the Sky, Running on Empty), it puts to shame any of his albums that came after Running on Empty.For those who know the songs well, beware \\"The Fuse\\" on the MP3 download. Though not enough to drop the rating of the recording, the track starts mid-note which is a little jarring when you are used to hearing the song start truly at the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Browne at his best (again)","review":"Browne continues his survey of the human condition in \\"The Pretender\\". His band really kicks it into gear after their subdued, yet stellar, performance on his previous album, \\"Late for the Sky\\", and contributes more to the overall quality of this work than on any JB album to date. I wonder how many of us can relate to songs like, \\"Sleep's Dark and Silent Gate\\" or \\"Daddy's Tune\\"? \\"The Fuse\\" is a wonderful track, both in its instrumentation and its lyrics. This CD doesn't seem to suffer from the muting of Brown's voice and some of the instruments which seemed to plague \\"Late for the Sky\\", and thus I give it a five-star rating! Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"personal album","review":"Jackson Browne fans know of the personal losses for Jackson.

I was just getting into space and new age music and had purchased recordings from Kitaro, M Stearns, S Roach, Dana and Clement, et al. Jonn's music is a little more esoteric and rich with long \\"cruisers\\" which will take you on any journey you want. I would listen to this album while in my office in Summit County Colorado(elev 9100). Looking out my windows, one of which viewed Buffalo Mt(elev 12000) and the other viewed Peak 1(elev 11,700), I would drift like raptor thru the tall pines and rocky craigs between mountain top to mountain top! What a trip! My favorite of all of Jonn Serrie's tracks is on this album-it's \\"Stratos\\" 10 plus minutes soul lifting mind soothing harmony!

The only problem was sometimes as I'd read it on the Florida beach, I couldn't help laughing out loud and people would stare at me. The scene where Emily goes to a speculum party was one of the funniest things I've ever read.The main character is absolutely adorable. She's so well drawn-- good-intentioned, but repeatedly screwing things up-- that I couldn't help rooting for her throughout the book.My vacation was definitely more fun because I took this book along!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Katie takes on teendom and all its angst!!","review":"Katie Macalister - Queen of the first person proses - is not content with taking historical and contemporary romance by storm...she now takes on the trials and tribulations of being a teen. A transplanted one at that. A modern, hip Seattle 16 year old is uprooted and dropped into culture shock - to the very foreigner land of England. Done in the manner of email rants, it is funny musing on the difference in two cultures that share the same language, but somehow seem to mangle it in their own special way.It is a marvel romp for teens, but everyone can have a wonderful laugh at this culture rip-lash diatribe.There are more Emily rants to come, and I look forward to them. A breath of fresh air for teen reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious British/American Comedy","review":"After reading Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging (by Louise Rennison) I was dying for more diaries of the British, female type. Though The Year My Life Went Down The Loo isn't very similar, I completely LOVED this book! It was hilarious, and actually had a few important lessons.Emily is a down to earth, but hip young girl, who's forced to move to England because of her father's work. And England is a lot harder to adjust to than you might think! As Emily encounters various obstacles, you can see her bright personality, and the lovable comedy that is her life. I sincerely hope this is the beginning of a series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful love story","review":"This is one of the most visually beautiful films I've ever seen.The protaganist, a young woman, is married to a young boy, who is the only child of a couple who own a grain farm and mill. She is treated as little more than a servant and as someone who will eventually produce an heir (whenever the boy is old enough to become interested in that).While working the farm and basically babysitting her husband, the girl falls in love with a farm hand. Her situation becomes dire and potentially tragic and you cannot help but ache for her.Each of the scenes is punctuated by a beautiful, static image: wheat in the wind, rain on tile roofs, etc. It is a lovely, lovely film, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys poetry in their movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not all beauty","review":"I agree with a prior review that this is a powerful and beautiful film, but to simply call it a love story set in quaint rural China is sugarcoated at best. This film is powerful for its ascetics, yes, but it is even more powerful for the haunting revelation of the horrors of feudal China (arranged marriages, etc) and the abandonment and detachment between social classes, even post-revolution. On top of that, it almost glamorizes a rape, which somehow worked to make the woman love her forbidden interest. All of this makes for a complex and hauntingly powerful film, but we cannot separate it from both the lessons of poverty and the trap of feudalism. I do recommend the film, but only to be watched with both eyes open."},{"rating":"2","title":"SAM THE BUTCHER!","review":"THIS IS A GREAT CD SAM THE BUTCHER ARE PUNK WITH SKA HERE AND THERE BUT THEIR NEW STUFF IS PRETTY MUCH SKA PUNK.ANYWAY IF YOU LIKE AAA OR CHOKING VICTIM YOULL LIKE THESE GUYS.SO BUY THE CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"If I were to put 4 pairs of tighty whities on in a row, I would be more comfortable and have more protection than when I wear these.

Rather, it is clearly a reworked Ph.D. dissertation and as such has somewhat limited appeal to a broader audience, even in this case to a reader well read in Nabokov criticism.

The Hardys investigate a group of criminals who are boldly robbing pedestrians in Bayport and other towns. Also, Frank, Joe and Chet go to New Mexico to help Mr. Hardy's cousin Ruth when cowboys start mysteriously disappearing from her ranch. Are the two mysterys connected, well of course they are, but you have to read the book to find out how. The book was pretty good; it was well-written and the setting of New Mexico was used effectively without the book sounding like it was a tour guide. There were a number of interesting characters and a good amount of action. There probably would not be too many Hardy Boys fans that would be disappointed after reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was pleased","review":"It looks real.

I mostly purchased it hoping for something innovative, fresh and inspired, though what I recieved was certainly the opposite. All of the songs seem to drag, with hardly any interesting parts whatsoever. The breakdowns are some of the worst I've heard and the lyrics are a bit too pseudo-angst for my tastes. I'd say the one thing I do like about the album is the screams, for they're executed quite well, though that is the extent of it.I guess if emo is your thing, and you want some elementary heaviness with some screams, this may very well be for you, though if you're looking for something with some depth, definitely look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Album","review":"Great album of MM's songs from her movies.

It does what it needs to do and keeps putting out no matter what I run across it. I bought it at the same time as my miter saw after my deployment to Iraq due to it being on sale. It has power to spare and will cut what ever you want it to cut.My only con is that it can be cumbersome to move around while attached to the stand. Without the stand if is highly mobile. It is easy to use and versatile. I don't use it as much as my miter saw but it handles whatever I throw at it.

DeWalt went super cheap on materials when making this saw, they should have used a hardened rod (one that won't flex) to hold the gears and they should have used solid aluminum with bronze bushings for the pillow blocks. This saw is very frustrating to use every time I go out with it. I used to use an old Makita with the simple fence and as long as I have to check the blade every time with a tape on the DeWalt saw, it makes it no better than anything else out there.

Tried adjusting it via the owners manual to no avail. Amazon shipped another unit and to my dismay it also had a rack and pinion AND fence problem. The fence would hang on the right miter slot. And the pinion gears jumped off the track when trying to adjust the fence. I'm very dissappointed in the factory setup on these saws. Poor quality control.

That latter work involved using the production of surface plasmons to measure the dielectric constant as a function of the frequency of incident light. Where the light created a resonance at the interface, that produced surface plasmons.Much of the book's ideas can be understood as related. Though the geometries studied are now more varied.

As family movies go \\"BFL\\" is one of the best there is and is thoroughly enjoyable (and appropriate) for all age groups. I think our family has seen it a dozen times and it is just as funny the twelfth time as it was the first. Paul Giamatti is perfectly cast as big-shot, self-absorbed film producer Marty Wolf aka \\"The Wolf\\" aka \\"Wolfman\\" and his performance, as usual, is superb. Muniz and Bynes also give very good performances and all of the supporting actors are terrific as well.Bottom-line...watch this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny For Kids and Adults","review":"Marty Wolf is a self-centered and abrasive movie producer who uses an idea from a 14 year old's theme paper for a blockbuster sensation to be released the following summer. Muniz plays the 14 year old who wrote the paper but is notorious for not telling the truth. When he tries to explain that the upcoming blockbuster called Big Fat Liar is based on his homework, no one believes him. He and his friend, Amanda Bynes, who covers for his untruths on occasion, fly to Hollywood to set the matter straight. Marty Wolf turns out to be quite a liar himself and won't cooperate in returning the homework or calling the youth's parents to tell them the truth. The two teenagers recalibrate Marty's world with humorous pranks. Roses may be red, but sweet revenge is blue with red hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Fat Liar","review":"It's a great movie!

The pool had a blue dye, and the almost naked man emerged with his body dyed blue. Then, because of the kids' prank, his hair was dyed red. Then a mob of screaming children charged him, knocking him to the floor, and were shrieking delightedly at their victory. Male nudity (except for private parts), pranks, blue dye, raucous shrieking, and that utterly vulgar and tasteless wriggling, shaking, and twisting by the adult in a bathing suit....!

Really, is this the type of movie we want to pawn off on our kids? They deserve better.The key point of this movie is that lying is bad. Good point. A device used to bring out the truth is creative pranks. Also good. Unfortunately, the pranks fall flat as they are totally implausible (even kids will have a hard time believing a man can't tell he's been dyed blue until he looks in the mirror), and since they are the device used to bring the movie to its conclusion, the entire thing falls flat.Making films for children is a fine thing. They shouldn't be dumbed down or even given an uncritical eye just because they are for children, however. Quite honestly, I'd rather have a kid watch something like \\"Good Will Hunting\\" before this.Don't waste your children's time with this film. Read them a book ... a good book ... instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Fat Flop!","review":"This movie was absolutely horrible. Frankie Muniz acts great in Malcome in the Middle but this and the last piece of junk \\"My Dog Skip\\" he acted in takes the cake. Big Fat Liar Ha!

Throw in a couple of hasbeens nobodies an average stereotype friend, a few stunts that came off of ABC's 1 Saturday Morining cartoons and what do you get? A movie that makes people laugh? No indeed. Instead a grade F film that makes money for Hollywood. Amanda Bynes can act but she keeps throwing in horrible oneliners that sounds like it came from the Annoying Amanda Show.

I let out a surprised chuckle when I heard the kicking guitar on \\"Straightfaced.\\" I was pleased that Son Volt branched out from the familiar.The attraction of Son Volt's music is their no-nonsense approach to performing, writing lyrics, and putting together melodies. (If you ever have the chance to see them live, you'll know what I mean.) Hook up, lay it down, close it up and you're done. No time for pomp or circumstance.The only negative aspect of this disc is \\"Jodel.\\" Fortunately, it's only 45 seconds of torture. I can take it. Or press the 'skip' button on the CD player.Let's be fair. Wilco was given accolades for their musical stretch, Summerteeth. Allow Son Volt the same consideration.

The first time I listened, I liked \\"Straightface\\" and \\"Medicine Hat\\" a lot, but nothing else left much of an impression. I figured \\"Wide Swing Tremolo\\" was one of those albums it takes a few listens to get into. Well, after lots of attempts, I still can't get into it. In fact, the songs seem to get more lethargic and boring with each listen. There's just no life to this album aside from the two tracks I mentioned above.

The flap that slides out and is supposed to go under the spider is slightly folded upwards in the middle, this can result in pushing the spider to the front wall instead of scooping it up with ease. Eventually any bug will walk over the yellow flap at which point you can slid it shut.

The recipes are based entirely on the idea of using frozen and canned vegetables, jarred sauces and dried herbs, all in the name of putting food on the table in record time.

Ugh, it didn't. It was slow, dull and ultimately not satisfying. Definitely not up to the thought-provoking standard I have come to expect from Gregory Maguire. Skip this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My first experience with a Gregory Maguire book was Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister, which I thought was beautifully written and enjoyed very much. Since this was another re-imagining of a classic fairy tale, I had high hopes for it as well. But I was very disappointed. None of the characters were very appealing, and some of the \\"earthier\\" elements really did nothing to advance the story. The most interesting characters were the dwarfs, imagined as a sort of amalgamation of human and stone, which I did find creative. Otherwise I felt this one was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I have tried many times to read this book. I got to page 50 or so this time and stopped.

I can't remember the last time I didn't finish one. I was so irritated and bored that after 150 pages or so I chucked the book across the room. However, \\"Wicked\\" was so good that I will probably continue to attempt to read his books.

I wouldn't bother buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Confusing","review":"I'd like to give this book a decent review but that would be impossible because I didn't understand half of it. The dwarves were some sort of rock people that had to come to life. I didn't understand this were they rocks or people how does that work. There was a plot with the father that really seemed to drag along. The author took 300 pages to tell a story that could have been told in 50 pages. The author tried to stick historical characters in there but I don't know why, and I didn't know who the Borgias were until I looked it up. All together this book was very weird. It was a good idea but was poorly executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"boooooring!","review":"Mirror, Mirror is definately a FAR cry from Wicked.

The author lets the story play out against an actual historical and geographical backdrop--an intriguing idea.

I would only recommend this book to an insomniac...it put me to sleep after one page EVERY night. Even at the end I was still going \\"huh?\\" and yet so relieved!!!I'm reading Confessions... now.

Snow White, a fairy tale especially bittersweet to myself, is one of his very best works. His knowledge of history, time period, and the Church is impeccable. Maguire weaves historical facts into an archetypal myth creating a beautiful tapestry of novel. Recommended for anyone who loves fairy tales and/or the deeper meanings behind them.Amber LaShea Holmesauthor of SNOW WHITE ON ACID: NINE FANTASICAL NIGHTMARES"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I love a good story and Maguire has never failed me yet. I see where some reviewers felt the book was slow or jumped around in perspective.... I view that as part of the book's genius. The story and it's characters are both fleshed out through the differing perspectives with each chapter almost reading as it's own short story.The way Maguire develops the concept of the dwarves is wonderful. He takes the magical and mythical and makes it plausible. For me, it's only a bonus that the story enmeshes with the history of the Borgia siblings. Lucrezia Borgia as the evil queen from Snow White is made a perfect fit.I look forward to my next Maguire read."},{"rating":"2","title":"No wicked, but good","review":"I think, since publishing his first novel, Maguire has been fighting an uphill battle to replicate the absolute incredibleness of Wicked. His second novel, Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister, was good, with some interesting twists and turns, but did not even begin to compare to Wicked. Lost was completely unbearable. I couldn't even get through the first two chapters, although I tried several times. I was feeling discouraged about Maguire when I picked up Mirror Mirror, but found that not only could I get through it, but I ended up enjoying it more than Confessions.Maguire has a wonderful skill of making magic seem realistic, although it was almost a mechanical process and I think that this novel showcased that skill."},{"rating":"1","title":"good start, bad finish","review":"i read wicked and stepsister and fell in love with this author. i read lost, and got a disappointing wake up call -- i bought this one hoping for a return to form... the first half is full of wonderful descriptions and well formed characters. i loved it. i couldn't wait for the fairy tale to begin once all the subplots were in place: then it happened. the second half of this book. wow. it's almost like someone else wrote the last portion. i think i missed the point of the dwarves altogether, which is upsetting, because i genuinely wanted to like them. i did appreciate the mix of history with fairy magic; however, the narrative was right on the point of taking off when it simply didn't. i can still hope for a return to form, can't i?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DEAD END!","review":"Another disappointing Maguire novel. Maguire has top-notch ideas but he really needs someone else to write the books for him! So many insignificant pages are in this book that if you took all of them out you'd have a pamphlet left! Maguire takes the reader down so many dead end roads that you are left frustrated and bewildered. The bottom line: The Maguire books look good on the shelf thanks to superb cover art but reading them can be downright torture sometimes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After racing to the store to pick up the new Maguire book, I was very disappointed in Mirror, Mirror.

Would not recommend this book, actually I took mine back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"First impression of Gregory Maguire's works","review":"This is the first Gregory Maguire book I have read. I picked it up at the library because of the title and front cover illustration. The infusion of historical characters with a classic fairytale is very clever. But the dark, sometimes morbid thoughts and deeds of many of the characters leaves you wondering who this book is for. I wouldn't want anyone under 16 to read this book because of the content. It's dark and for only 200-odd pages, it's slow. There isn't enough history to make it a historical novel. And for fantasy lovers, there are tons of books out there that can keep you attention through 800 and more pages....Anyway, I'll probably not bother trying another Maguire novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than a sleep aid...","review":"Boring.

But this one was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"They didn't offer me a choice lower than one star.","review":"The books of Maguire were touted as \\"reimagining of classic fairy tales.\\" Ummm. . .no. I was sorely disappointed to find that the books merely took loosely adapted generic characters from classic fairy tales, and then used them in stale, overbearingly boring political stories. I ordered Mirror, Mirror. . Wicked. . .Confessions. . .and Lost. . . and reading them was pure punishment. While well written for what they are, I suppose, they are not as described. They are not for people who love fantasy, nor are they for people who remeber the classic stories of youth with fondness. They are for people who feel the need to punish theirselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOt that impressed","review":"I am not that impressed with this man's books.

I personally wouldnt read anymore of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Wicked, but has it's own charm!","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It's one of those books you wish you could read with your eyes closed so you could just drift off in your own fantasy world.

His novel \\"Wicked\\" has been adapted into a Broadway musical, and has opened to mostly positive reviews, and his new novel reminds people what he was so good at in the first place. His last book, \\"Lost\\" a modern ghost story seemed to be written by a competely different person from the man who reinvented both \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and \\"Cinderella\\". He has now returned to his fairy tale roots and concocted his own spin on the Snow White story. Blending the factual Italian Borgia family with a land owner named Don Vincente and his beautiful young daughter named Bianca, Maguire manages to tread very closely to the story many people are familiar with. The one area he diverges from is the dwarves. Gone are Bashful, Sleepy and Doc, and instead are creatures more of the earth than human.I also thought his \\"apple\\" was both inventive and clever. A well told retelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as other Maguire Novels...","review":"I want to start out by saying that I really enjoy Gregory Maguire novels. I think that they are fantastic and very imaginative.But...I found this re-telling of Snow White to be lacking. I enjoyed the new twists that Maguire added. The Borgias were a great addition and his Snow White was very sympathetic. But the story was very short and none of the characters, except for Bianca (Snow White) and Lucrezia Borgia (Wicked Step-Mother) were fleshed out at all.The mirror itself was a problem. Very little detail was given about how it became magical. There was a little bit of an explanation, but nothing substantial. I expected more from this author.In short, I was very disappointed. It seemed like Maguire wrote an outline and someone else actually wrote the book. And not very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond slow!","review":"I absolutely loved \\"Wicked\\", thought \\"Son of a Witch\\" was fascinating, and enjoyed \\"Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister\\", but this book failed completely, and I often wondered if the author needed a vacation to get his creative juices flowing again. Well over 1/3 of the way in, I was still waiting for the story to begin. Slow is an understatement, especially in light of his other works, which truly captivated me."},{"rating":"1","title":"An act of will to finish","review":"I really likedWicked, my introduction to Maguire's writing. It didn't just retell the story, it turned the story on its head. It had a leading character with real personality, someone I could care about. Given that experience, I had high hopes for this one, as well.I'm wrong a lot. The only characters that actually did enough to reveal their personality, other than Lucrezia, existed for only a few pages out of the whole book. Action? Not a lot. In fact, some of the major characters, the \\"dwarves\\", were never explained well enough for me to understand why they even bothered.It's happened before, that I loved one of an author's books and found myself bored half into a coma by another. Maybe Maguire has written some other good stuff, in addition to Wicked. I'm not going to put a lot of effort into hunting it down.-- wiredweird"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"This is Maguire's verison of Snow White and it was very different indeed.

The story is fun and it's a good time blowing stuff up.But that's about where the fun stops.The game is incredibly buggy. It freezes on a fairly regular basis, or allows your character to get stuck in situations that require a reboot of the system.And the game play has some serious flaws. The single most annoying element a game can have is rampant in Merc 2. Often, when you die, you respawn on the other side of the world map and have to spend the next 5 to 7 minutes walking or driving back to the mission where you died. That drives me insane.

I struck him from every direction and he didn't fall. The only thing that worked was shooting him. I've encountered similar problems in other parts of the game. They also seem to have designed this game to attract GTA fans -- there are missions that involve driving a car to a given destination within a certain time. Such missions were not part of the first version of this game and that was fine with me. I liked its straightforward approach.

It's not. I read about \\"Midori Days\\" in a magazine and was immediately turned off by the idea of a guy having a girl for a right hand. I finally ended up reading it, and I was very pleasantly surprised. The manga-ka does not take the obvious path and write a manga all about fan-service.\\"Midori Days\\" is above-standard in humor. I always get lots of laughs out of every volume. The best part is all the love triangles. There are sexual jokes, but they're pretty mild. Still I wouldn't suggest it to anyone under 13.There are a lot of sweet moments too, with Midori learning to be more outgoing and Soji to be more sensitive to Midori's feelings. The two have a good chemistry together, and the romance is very rewarding.Overall, I highly suggest this manga. It will keep you entertained with the humor and romance. It's unique, out-there, and it's one of the best I've read in a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raw power, unfettered by technique.","review":"Some authors can interpret and perform their own work, take John Le Carre for instance, his pacing and phrasing let the story emerge on its own merits. Harlan Ellison writes challenging material and then allows no room for interpretation with his uncompromising oral style.

He's good - no doubt about it.This collection has his most famous stories and they ought to be familiar because they've been retold and homaged and performed often enough to be mainstays of fiction. I have no complaints about the stories, no complaints at all. The only reason I gave this less than five stars is that I wanted more background from the collection - more insight into how the story's materialized and what makes the fiction writer tick. Other collections of suberb work do better in the 'fluff' or background material.I recommend it to all.CV Rick"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Old School science fiction","review":"Very descriptive, near the point of exhaustion.

He's not tough enough, angry enough, drunk enough, sad enough and -- perhaps most importantly -- certainly not funny enough. None of Rankin's dry, stinging wit is anywhere in evidence here. And I have to agree with the prior reviewer who said that the stories move way too fast, cramming too much plot into too little time. At least they got Cafferty right, he's pretty much as I imagined him. (Although just think what Brian Cox could do with the role!) I'm off to check out the later Rebus series.

Do not let this discourage you as you read, let it instead encourage you to learn to read the Chinese original.

This is an account of two bicycle trips through Greece, taken in his mid or late 60s, and both are described in loving detail.

On the whole this album strikes me as better than both the eponymous Trio and Dial 'S' if not quite the equal of Cool Struttin' or Leapin' and Lopin'---but then, Clark's sinewy lines and lucid sense of swing never fail to satisfy.

Item was not usable so they should have paid return shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensationalism passing for a Classic","review":"This immensely popular gothic novel desperately attempts to overload the senses with scenes of the most graphic, morbid, sexual, and shocking images Lewis could concoct. With no deeper themes than the immensity of temptation's power and the way even a devout man may fall, Lewis' main goal seems to be to make us cringe. Culminating in an incestuous rape and murder scene, the novel just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. In the year of its publication The Monk was a smash hit in England, mostly among upper-class women. It was, in essence, a soap opera of yesterday, with about as much depth as that trite form of entertainment. I do believe that its amazing popularity is its only credit for any continued study, as an historical phenomenon, but not as great literature.Years later Austen would satyrize The Monk and books like it in her Northanger Abbey. I would instead highly recommend (...)to leave The Monk on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Underread and Underappreciated Novel in Gothic Literature","review":"I'd never heard of this book until it was assigned reading for my graduate 18th Century Lit class. That said, \\"The Monk\\" should be on every high school's summer reading list.Ambrosio's story is strange, twisted, and ultimately horrifying. As I read and after I finished, I kept thinking this plot is worthy of Shakespeare. If Shakespeare had written a novel, \\"The Monk\\" would have been it. In fact I wrote a paper for class comparing Ambrosio to Macbeth.Finally, I can't believe it hasn't been made into a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run from this phone!","review":"This phone is absolutely useless!

So when he hit the big time he abandoned the thought of keeping that raw energy he brought to the table. This album seems as if he just slapped toghether some material without putting any thought in to it whatsoever. It's sad that the american public who listen to jay-z think this is his first album.

Jay-Z did just that. There isn't one song's lyrical content that doesn't make me think about the everyday struggle we all go through or one that makes me knod my head because the hook is all that. It's awesome to hear Sean Carter talk about where he came from and how he wears platinum jewelry and drives nice cars but hasn't forgotten where he came from.

Not only does he shine on his own, but he manages to colloborate with a ton of today's hottest stars like JD, The Lox, and many more.

The most impressive song on the album is \\"Coming of Age\\" with Memphis Bleek. Their back and forth dialogue rap is just incredible. Good performances are rare for Bleek, but Jigga really makes him shine on this one. Other good tracks are \\"If I Should Die\\", \\"Can I Get A...\\", and \\"N- What?

Jay-Z is just danceable, MTV-packaged NWA gangster garbage, a poor man's Biggie Smalls.I give Jay-Z credit for one thing. Unlike RZA's abhorent monstrosity, Bobby Digital, his songs are actually memorable. Is that because they follow the Puffy Daddy pop formula of simplicity?

So why do you have listen to him when you can get some other rapper with better flows, lyrics, and beats?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened Jay?","review":"The first couple times I listened to this, Ithought it was pretty solid. But after a few weeks, the album just starts to blend together as one song. It all starts to sound the same, and since none of the tracks are that good to begin with, that's real bad. The guest don't really add much either, but Jay hardly outshines them. This cd is not, I say again is not, worth the purchase. Buy another Jay-Z album, this one is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the all time worst hip hop artist ever","review":"I dont even rate this a one, I wanted to give it a zero, but I was not allowed. I have heard many rappers with bad rhymes and others with bad hooks, but he manages to combine both. I have honestly never heard anyone worse than jay z. The fact that he is popular means nothing when you consider that the backstreet boys and britney spears are at the top of the charts. My friend bought this album and hated it so much that he gave it to me. I hated it so much i threw it in the trash. He sounds worse than MA$E and his beats sound like a fourth grader composed them for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can You Say Sell Out","review":"As you already know, this is the album Jay-Z officially sold out on. If you don't believe me, listen to \\"Moment Of Clarity\\" from The Black Album where he admits in so many words that he sold out for the money. He changed his style and flow (for the worst) dramatically and it resulted in his most successful album at the time. Just like everyone back in 1998, Jay-Z decided to go with everyone else in the Timberland and Swizz Beats movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ain't nuttin' like his first album","review":"Jay-Z's first album: Reasonable Doubt: is by far one of the best classic rap CD's ever. I was looking forward to his second CD. However, when it came out. I was very dissapointed, the lyrics, beats, everything. Somehow he's east coast style has been washed away. He's not the same anymore. What shocked me the most was that he teamed up wit the Ruff Rydaz AND DAT WACK A$$ CAT NAMED D-M-X! GODDAMN, how can he do something like this? Jay-Z has gone COMMERCIAL! There are way too many commercial in rap today and it's just not worth it. This is Jay-Z's worst album. This IS the worst album I've ever bought next to B.G. and Master P's. This is a worst of money. Jay-Z needs to go back to his old style or else he is gonna be played out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanna check it out the new cd and wanna listen to it","review":"I wanna listen to Jay-z music because he is awesome and wanna see what's goods product do you have and you guys said that's you can listen to cd befoer you buy it, so let's me see if the thing yo say is true, if the cd is awesome I will buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was great and revitalizing.","review":"My review was that it was a very upbeat cd.I would it if Jay-Z would come out with more sounds like it.

He really sounds bored and asleep on the record. There are some nice songs, but most of them have been milked by MTV and BET so much that they make me sick. The only one I really like that wasn't played out was \\"Paper Chase\\", featuring Foxy Brown(a great female rapper). The rest is just commercial stuff. I really don't think Jay-Z is really a very good lyricist even though everyone says he is. Q-Tip, Nas and Kurupt are much better lyricists. Jay-Z probably won't make any more albums, but his first two were tight, this one isn't very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jay-Z is Burnin' it up!","review":"This CD contains multiple hits. All the BOMB ann i love them. You should deffinantly buy this cd.

Jay-Z changed his format. From a fast rhyming MC doing cameos on Original Flavor and Big Daddy Kane, to versatility in his previous albums, to just living the fantasy life in this album. The hip hop fans may boo me for this but it's freedom of speech so I'm not hating. It is basically fact that he bit the sell out apple. Only four tracks are hot and three of them are featuring Memphis Bleek. This album went from bad to worse. To all your Jigga fans: I don't follow trends. I listen to what's appealing to my ears. In my personal opinion, I do not listen to cristal popping, and drug pushing because I don't live it. If hip hop is about lying to the fans, play with their emotions about being a playa or drug pusher and actually do not live that lifestyle, then I must quit listening to the artform called hip hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Always, My NY Peeps Are Off The Hook","review":"This alblum is off the hook, just like his other ones.

While the music itself is acceptable, though not outstanding, the graphics are often totally unrelated to anything to do with Messiah, and a couple of scenes, in my opinion, are inappropriate. In addition, I find it many times more enjoyable to see the people who are singing, playing, conducting.

Although there isn't a caption option, the sound is clear and there is the option of either DTS stereo or 5.1 Dolby. I enjoy Handel's Messiah more now that I have this DVD.

At least that one had better than average tracks like \\"Futureal\\" and \\"The Clansman\\". DOD has NOTHING redeemable involved in it's content whatsoever.But AMOLAD is an improvement in songwriting, guitar soloing and tradition Metal guitar riffing (at times.) It shows a slight improvement in life in the band which was definitely lacking as of late. I am glad that they have slightly recovered, but that doesn't mean that they have recovered their past glories. To truly visit those times, all you need to do is go listen to any of their benchmark first seven albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"I can't stop listening to this album.

I know that fans were clamoring for Harder edge and I was one of them.I think we got what we asked for, as this is much heavier than the first two. The songs are the usual fare for an Iron Maiden album so there is really nothing new here in terms of lyrics, but the music that surrounds these songs is always great. I think the only thing left to tweak is the length of the songs, as the 7 minutes per track is a bit too long. This is not, Somewhere in Time\\" where the longer songs worked. I think 5 minutes would make most of these songs on MOLAD really great.Still this is good stuff and I cannot wait for the next albumto come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maiden Rules","review":"This is the latest cd by the most epic metal band ever. how can this be a bad album Iron Maiden are metal gods. All the songs on the album are long, so you get a lot of music for your moneys worth. They make three guitars work and sound great.

As a long time Maiden fan I purchased this CD over the weekend to listen on my long drive to my girlfriends house. I was very disappointed. Maiden have taken a more rough approach this time around. I guess \\"Alternative\\" would be the best way of describing the sound here. More of a Nirvana meets Maiden would be accurate.The days of \\"Seventh Son or Stranger ..

Brings back memories of 80's Maiden. True Maiden fans will like it. If you don't then just take a hike."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 very solid stars","review":"While this isn't the masterpiece that 'Piece of Mind' definitely is, this is an incredible addition to a great collection of metal music from one of metal's best bands. 'Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg' has to be one of their best songs ever.Simply put: If you are a fan of the band, you need their last 3 CD's including this one. If you're wanting to start somewhere... I'd say anything from the early to mid eightes (with Bruce on vocals) will do. I also have to note that 'bonus DVD's' are usually not a selling point for me, but this one was worth the watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"average cd","review":"Is it extremely necessary to put 7-8 minutes songs??It's kind of boring sometimes, is like another reviewer said here, a single song just with blanks within. This album could be called easily Dance of death II, why once again the word death on the album title, epic songs are good, but 1 or 2, not 10, bad bad bad, I'd rather listen to the old Maiden (killers, number of the beast, etc.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and tedious...","review":"Producer Kevin Shirley accepts the fact that Steve Harris calls all the cards in the band and we all testified the \\"high\\" production values utilized by Steve Harris when he produced the band in \\"X-Factor\\" and \\"Virutal XI\\"... So, since \\"Brave New World\\" produciton is muddled, really bad and it never improves.This album is another disappointment. Each song is long, long and more long, just for the sake of being long! Choruses are repeated infinitely, Bruce is straining his voice (sometime it's even annoying, believe it or not) and, worst of all, that guy Janick Gers continues there, adding nothing to this band with his crap solos.This album had potential if it had had better production, shorter songs (why, oh why are there the tedious long bass introductions all the time??!!) and a crisp, strong and clean sound??! I simply don't understand, but Steve Harris could not care less for my opinion, so..."},{"rating":"1","title":"a matter of life and death for Maiden?","review":"When I saw that Maiden had released a new cd, I was excited. I read the reviews, all were giving it around 4-5 stars. When I listened to it, I found myself hitting the skip button. I want to like this album, I really do, but I don't see anything special about this release. The intros are too long, too boring. Sure, the guitar work is awesome, but the songs all sound the same, to me there is no track that really stands out. I love Maiden, but I still long for the sound of the glory days. Even Brave New World was better quality metal. Don't run to the stores to buy this, \\"Run To The Hills\\" and pick up their older material, because this one is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plod.","review":"Plod. That's what this CD does. After the upbeat \\"Different World\\" this CD is all about the \\"Plod\\" Most every song has a slow 1-2 minute intro, and a slow 1 minute outro. BORING. I love Maiden, I started listening to them back in 1980 when a friend showed me the first album. This album does not match up. While it is not as bad as the two G-d awful Blaze Maiden albums, it is bad. It's not close to being on par with Brave New Worls or Dance of Death. It's just plain boring. This CD made me sad--I wanted so much more, but I got....this.One star, for \\"Different World\\", one star because it's Maiden and some of the songs have interesting middle sections. Sigh--should've been so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martin Birch, please come out of retirement.","review":"If I didn't know better, I'd suspect that Iron Maiden had become a progressive rock band. Then again, bassist/songwriter Steve Harris has always brought a progressive element to Iron Maiden. The lyrical content brings to mind the brooding, reflective mood of \\"The X Factor\\", but one must strain (even with a good set of headphones) to hear Bruce Dickinson's vocals at times in this album. It's always unfortunate to see a great album marred by subpar production, but it's a demon-ridden shame to see it happen to Iron Maiden after all these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maiden is Back","review":"This is what I've been expecting from them since they got the band back together!!!..excellent album, great Maiden songs, It's a most have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Un nuevo clásico.","review":"Este es un disco que está al nivel de los grandes clásicos de Iron Maiden, no digo que supere a ninguno pero me parece que llega al nivel de estos.

Un disco muy recomendable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Maiden In Years","review":"Maiden had fallen in a kind of confort state, when Dance of Death came and we saw the same maiden but a little bit less daring... but now, they just show the world that they still rock... and above this, that they are willing to experiment... and what an experiment.There is no bad songs in this one... and they all will rock your head in a new Maiden kind of way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight up Maiden","review":"Iron Maiden has done it again with another great album. This cd is a must have for any true Iron Maiden fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR PRODUCTION","review":"No matter how good the tracks(and there's only two good ones on this release), you are simply not going to enjoy it with this poor production. Sounds like it's playing in the next room with the door closed! I'm astonished that Nicko would permit his drumming to sound so flat. The guitars are pushed to the background. Bruce's mid B pitch is grating on the ear. Compare to how good he and the band sound on Brave New World and Dance Of Death. I bought this on CD, so it must be unbearable as a download(in case you don't know, downloaded music loses a significant amount of resolution)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Since Powerslave !!!!!!","review":"I have been a Maiden fan for 20 years. Been through their ups and downs. Hated when Bruce Dickinson left and loved it when he came back. ( Blaze sucked anyway) I don't expect them to ever make another album like Number of The Beast or Powerslave but this comes pretty damn close. The guitars are heavy and Bruce Dickinson proves that he is in the top 3 voices ever to come out of England for metal.(Dio and Ozzy of course need consideraton) This band is one of the greatest ever and will live on for ever. They stay true to their fans and their music. As a long time follower, that is the mark of a true metal band. Up The Irons Boys !!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected, but some songs are ok...","review":"If your expecting \\"Powerslave\\", \\"Piece of Mind\\" or \\"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\\", then this is not the album for you. I was hoping this was going to be a rockin' album, thinking maybe Iron Maiden would get back to some of there old roots. Well I was definately wrong and this album sounds similar to the last one \\"Death on the Road\\", which sounds more like a continuation.I am more of an old schooler, and I feel that Iron Maiden didn't put much effort into this album like they did with such albums like \\"Powerslave\\". Then again this is my personal preference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really anything new here","review":"First song \\"Different World\\" is fantastic. From there it just goes downhill. Songs are mostly slow and plodding, production is stripped down to the point it loses all the energy the band once had. The cover artwork is perhaps the least imaginative ever from Maiden. Looks like an old Stormtroopers of Death cover.Technically, of course all the playing is spot on, as it should be considering how long all these guys have been doing this. However, when you add it all up into a song, the sum is not really greater than the parts.Buy \\"Piece of Mind\\" and forget about this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best They've Ever Done","review":"I'm not sure if I'm in the minority in this, but I think this is the best work the boys have ever done. It starts out with a great hard rocking track and just whisks you away to incredible stories and grand epics in the entire disc. I just saw them perform the entire CD live, and its incredible too. If you are a TRUE Maiden fan, I think you will LOVE THIS DISC!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS ALBUM ROCKS!!!!!!!!","review":"I think that most of the reviews here have said it all. This new Iron Maiden album is a MUST HAVE! one of the best from Iron Maiden.LOVED IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still going strong","review":"Maiden seems to have gone in yet another new direction with this one. I get the feeling they are embracing their no radio play at an extreme level. Every song here is long and most have multiple tempo shifts. This makes for a lot of strong moments, but a few weaker ones as well.Personally, I found Dance of Death and Brave New World to have a few more catchy hooks, but A Matter of Life and Death contains some tremendously deep songs that any Maiden fan should appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maiden's best work EVER","review":"This is Iron Maiden's best work EVER.

She makes Dorothy sound like this twelve year old retarted child!Ethel Kitt and Micky Rooney were both horid cast as who they were! Mickey Rooney sounds like he could die any minute and Ethel Kitt is just not right for the Wicked Witch at all.The munskins voices are squeeky and anoying and arn't very good. And everyone else is just not up to scratch. They are following in the footsteps of very famous people here and they just DON'T cut it. Trust me I know how this musical should be and this is not it!

This show totally wipes away the visions of the movie and takes a new life of its own. Earth Kitt works wonders as The Wicked Witch of the West. Though Eartha Kitt is no longer with the show (but is on the CD), Lilliane Montevecchi tops Eartha's performance. Mickey Rooney is so delightful and Jessica Grove makes everybody forget that there was once a young actress named Judy Garland. Ms. Grove is very attractive and very talented. She should go far in life. This CD captures the magic that is the American fairy tale. Our only fairy tale. . .The Wizard of OZ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Bad Shipping","review":"Overall it was pretty much what I expected as far as quality goes. The wood finish is very glossy and decent quality. The latches and handle aren't the best, I had to tighten the screws so it wouldn't wiggle around as much when you use the handle to carry it. Aside from that it was exactly what I was going for, my boyfriend loves poker, I figured it was about time he had a decent set. What I wasn't pleased with was a dent in the front that I assumed happened during the shipping, its minor but noticeable. I wouldn't mind it much except that I'm giving this as a gift and would have rather it not been damaged. Also I had to glue one of the center supports under the chip holder back into place.

Album. The problem is it is too overridden with cocaine. It was o.k for back then, but not now. \\"Hold Out\\" is a change. More fueled with love and adolescent energy. It has that laid back L.A. sound, very cool, very breezey, just cruising chicks down the boulevard. Like in the\\"Fast Times\\" movie, but more innocent, more romantic, and more spiritual. \\"That Girl Can Sing\\" is a classic. His description of the two lonely souls is beautiful as is the melody.

Unfortunately when I sat down to read I found almost nothing helpful in actually creating a simple, useful room design. Instead there's page after page of beautiful photos, with some interesting but not useful accessorizing tips. For instance, leaving a pair of oriental slippers on the staircase strikes me as more of a navagation hazard than a decorating statement. Also the author's idea of simple seems to have very narrow limits, like using all neutrals with only touches of blue and pink. Or using 1950's style furniture (anybody ever heard of Shaker? Mission? apparently not this lady). If you run into it in a library, leaf through the photos, don't bother reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sames photos everywhere!","review":"I was known that it would not be a decorating book -- but I was expecting a lot of inspiration to make my home an enviroment of peace and relaxing.

There was a pair of pink shoes that appeared three times in different positions, as if their owner was relaxing in same place of this house! Three times!

Creating a pleasing fusion of what I would have thought were two incompatible styles.It's wonderful to see that uncluttered and open spaces don't have to look cold and barren, but can be soft, elegant, and romantic instead.Looking through this book inspires me to unclutter my home and create open spaces that are more suitable to the life I am trying to live."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not get this","review":"Very bad. makes mold and you can not clean it. very loud also. my kids can not sleep with it on. wast of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many areas for mold","review":"This was our second humidifer purchase and it didn't last long.

I followed the manufacturers instructions and still could not keep it clean. The fan housing is inaccessible and this is where the mold problem exist. I am returning the two I have. Do not buy this product, you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"My $50 mistake. I bought this on Consumer Reports' recommendation alone and didn't also read reviews as I usually do. The mineral deposits that this and apparently all mist-type humidifiers leave on your furniture are totally unacceptable. A horrible, filthy mess and we only used it at night on the low fan setting! Even if you can afford to constantly buy distilled water for the thing you're not completely safe. ANY mineral content in the water is going to get precipitated out and collect on every flat surface in the room.I'm trying a Lasko evaporator humidifier next. I have had evaporators before and know their problems, but at least they don't crud up your furniture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves Chalky Whilte Film on Entire Room!","review":"The number one reason I purchased this model was because it is filterless. Now I know why most humidifiers have filters. This model spreads a chalky white film on all surfaces in the room. It comes off with a dust rag, but it has covered my children's books, toys, shelves, blankets, ceiling fan, and every side and top of their furniture. The chalky film can be seen and/or felt on panel doors, window blinds, light switches, etc. The owner's manual recommends people with hard water use distilled water to prevent this film. I do not consider my water to be extremely hard. Why should I spend $1 or more a day on water when the only reason I purchased this model was its marketing promise that I could save many dollars a year because I would never have to purchase a filter?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mold Grower!!","review":"This is such a waste of money! We bought this for our baby to ease his breathing at night and 1 month later found mold growing inside the tank and all over. We cleaned it out and used the \\"purifier ball\\" but the mold still grew EVERYWHERE in it. The worst part is you can't even take the machine apart to properly clean it. So we are stuck with a moldy humidifier that you can NOT clean... whats the point??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy, vibrates, and creates much white dust!","review":"I purchased this at Target for $42, and was drawn in by the filterless idea. Big mistake! First the good: it does work fairly well (kept humidity up 10%). Now the bad: it rattles and vibrates (put it on a towel to make it tolerable). And the ugly: it creates an \\"enormous\\" amount of chalky white dust (the TV screen was covered after a week). Additionally, it was empty every morning, it just couldn't seem to make it through the night.Overall, it works, but at a fairly high trade off. After a week I returned it and purchased a humidifier with a permawick, and the dust is gone!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product!","review":"This humidifier has broken after 30 days of use! Lucky for me! The store where I purchased it from won't honor my return and now I have to deal with the company and the shipping and handling and the mess!I can't tell you about the mold because there hasn't been enough time for it to grow. It's noisy and the film it leaves on everything around it will drive you mad!Avoid this product and avoid this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"$45 worth of noise","review":"Like others, we picked this up without bothering to read the reviews. I hooked it up in my 14 mo old's room to try and give him some relief from his congested nose and chest. Even on the lowest \\"sleep\\" setting, this thing is way too loud. I'm all for white noise and I'm sure there are people out there who don't mind it, but for a child having trouble falling and staying asleep, it's not worth it at all. We'll be returning this for a quieter model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learn from my mistake","review":"I don't review many products but this one is such a stinker I thought I should. It leaves a slight dust over anything in the area. It stopped working for no reason. And, call me crazy, but this was the second one I owned. (I was desperate the second time). It is hard to clean and gets mold on it quickly.On a positive note, Kaz cconsumer relations were great and offered to fix it if I sent it back. It cost me close to 12 dollars to ship it back so I opted not to do so because I am going to just purchase a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"IMPOSSIBLE TO CLEAN","review":"HORRIBLE PRODUCT. I USED IT 2 DAYS IN A ROW AND WHEN I TOOK IT APART TO CLEAN IT, I WAS MORTIFIED. THE BASE WAS BLACK FROM THE MOLD.

DO NOT BUY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with do not buy","review":"I typically do not post reviews, but wanted to add to the 1-star ratings, because had I looked up the customer reviews first (I bought the humidifier at Target on the spot without reviewing), it would have saved a lot of hassle. My primary complaint is the \\"white dust\\" that others have described--and this white dust/film was all over my toddler's room (the closet door was slightly open, and the white film/dust somehow found its way in; so I had to clean books, shoes, toys, etc.; soap and water did not work, but fortunately vinegar did). My other main complaint is the noise. My toddler is a light sleeper so the noise was helpful in acting as a white noise machine, but it was very, very loud, even for that purpose. I am hoping Target will take it back, because I will be returning or otherwise getting rid of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk.","review":"Worked okay the first few days. However, this unit is a pain to keep clean, and if you slack off even a little, it creates a nasty smell and visible mold on the unit itself. We used it for two months before giving up. It got to the point where it would just create a big wet spot around the unit itself without actually increasing the humidity of the room noticeably (we have a hydrometer). Don't waste your money on this piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk!","review":"Vicks claims this unit is 20% quieter than previous models, what did the previous model sound like? A jet liner? This thing had to be designed by an engineering drop out, the fan is made of all plastic and it warps after 3 hours of being on after which point it starts to come into intermittent contact with the unit itself causing a clunking noise. It has so many \\"lights\\" on it it literally lights the whole freaking room up, I had to get tape out and tape the the freaking thing up so I could sleep in a dark room! I also paid a 100 bucks for this piece of garbage at Target, so yeah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Health Hazard- Don't buy","review":"I wish that I had read reviews before buying this thing. EVERYTHING that is written about this humidifier is correct.1. You can't clean the basin with the fan. It grows mold that you can NOT clean. This is a major health hazard and for this reason, no one should ever buy this humidifier.2. Pink mold grows like wildfire. Even after cleaning the bottom basin, the humidifier still makes the room smell like rotting food.3. The little cleaning protec balls do nothing.I am disgusted with this humidifier. Save yourself the money. Don't buy this thing. You'll be healthier for it!! If you have a child, please don't even consider this humidifier."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY VERY NOISY","review":"Got this for my newborn and needed to use it in my room while he was in a bassinet next to me. It starts off quiet enough but after running for just a little while it is so loud its very hard to sleep. Sounds like the motor is knocking agaist the side or something. I would definately not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst purchase of my entire life","review":"I bought this piece of junk at target without reading any reviews first. It made my pregnant wife and me sick. Mold and germs grow inside it and there's no way to clean it out. We are going to have to throw it away and take the $60 hit. I've never been so upset w/ a product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to clean well","review":"It does a satisfactory job of adding humidity to the air, but I've just disassembled it as far as I can, and there are still places I can't reach to clean (I also cut my hand on a sharp edge).I hate the thought that I'm breathing that pink stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Health Hazard","review":"We bought this to use for our 5 month old who was congested.

Do NOT buy this humidifier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but is sooooo NOISEY!!!","review":"The unit is effective in putting moisture into the air but is the noisiest humidifier that I have ever owned. I would not reccomend this to anyone and would take the unit back to the store from which I purchased it but i waited too long. And, people should realize just because it is a filter free unit DOES NOT mean that you never have to clean it. You have to clean it regularly. In fact the instructions suggest you clean it DAILY. If you clean it at least weekly with a weak solution of bleach it seems to retard any yucky growth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke the Same Night I Bought It!","review":"I learned my lesson; didn't read the Amazon reviews before buying this at a local drugstore- for 2x the price, I might add.It started working well, but by halfway through the evening it stopped dead quiet.I reset it this morning and it worked for all of 5 minutes before dying again. I will be returning this, so frustrating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldnt buy this product.","review":"Its loud but I like that for the white noise. I was really alarmed when I noticed a white film all over everything. So my 5 month old has been breathing in this white crap.

I bought this humidifier because I was tired of being overly warm from a warm mist model and because it was filterless, which I interpreted as \\"easy to care for\\". I am no expert, but it seems that the cleaning instructions are intense as well as costly over time, and even when I have followed these to the letter, there is orange and black mold that grows in places that are inaccessible to clean. Even with q-tips and lots of patience. In addition to that, it has filled my entire bedroom with a white film which feels chalky to the touch. The latter issue may be related to the local water, but never in three years did this film appear with my old warm mist model. Did it humidify the room well: yes. Was is quiet: yes. Would I ever in a million years buy it again or recommend it to someone: NO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy, Lousy Piece of Plastic Junk","review":"This is the worst humidifier we have ever owned. It is ranked in the top 5 of Consumer Reports. Obviously the person who reviewed it never slept the night with it. Our baby woke every 2 hours because the unit rattled and made so much noise that the poor little guy could not sleep. We returned it after a week. In its place, we purchased the Sunpentown SU-4010 - now that is a piece of quality engineering. Vicks should stick to just making cough syrup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I wish I had read these reviews prior to my purchase.

I don't use it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!","review":"We unfortunately bought this for our newborn and it is a disaster! He loves white noise, but this unit is making a lot more than white noise (as described over and over in other reviews here). It also is impossible to clean. Literally, the mold gets in places that I can't clean with a Q-tip. My baby's room now smells like mildew - a very strong smell.

After a short time of use, BLACK MOLD developed and it is impossible to clean. Black mold forms on the base and in the inner workings that cannot be reached. Dust builds up at the vent that is impossible to clean. After spending hours trying to clean it and getting frustrated, I finally gave up and threw it in the trash. This was a complete waste of money. It is hazardous to your health. I wish I could give it ZERO stars. Please don't waste your money. The room you place it in will smell like stinky mildew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged Humidifier","review":"This product came from a company that sells through Amazon. I will never do that again. The V4500 humidifier (Vicks) made a very loud noise when in operation. (It got a top rating from Consumer Reports). I had to email the people that sold it to me through Amazon.....they said my account would be credited and I should discard the item.......still, much time spent to accomplish this. I called the manufacturer....they heard the noise over the phone and said a part was not working properly. I discarded it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 3 months, like all Vicks humidifiers","review":"We've had the less-expensive Vicks humidifiers in the past, and they always break. We figured an upgrade to the \\"fancy\\" filterless model would mean higher quality. No such luck. The plastic casing broke after a month, and the entire apparatus that draws the water from the tank into the humidifier broke a couple months later. Now it's yet another Vicks humidifier filling up the landfill, only at a higher price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just stoped working havent even had it a year.","review":"I dont know whats wrong with this product.

Thinking that it was the sample Vicks vapor scent pad, we took it out, scrubbed the floors down, and continued using it. Unfortunately, the grime kept coming back every time we used the unit. Fortunately, we have not used the machine long enough to see any mildew/mold like some other reviewers have experienced.DO NOT BUY THIS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too loud!","review":"Do not buy the filter free Vicks humidifiers. When running, even in the lowest setting, it sounds like someone is running a chainsaw or leaf blower in my room! Neither I, nor my boyfriend, can sleep with this machine running. We both hate this machine. It is too noisy! I can get used to noise but this machine doesn't make one consistent noise...it instead keeps making different loud noises, just like a chainsaw does. Instead buy the Vicks Ultrasonic cool humidifier that comes with a filter. I purchased that later and it is much quieter and works well.EDIT: I contacted the company and they told me that this unit should not be this loud. There may be something wrong with it that I have to fix or have the company fix. Leaving up original review only because a unit right out of the box should work correctly and the other unit I reviewed (that Vicks makes) did work correctly out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This is the worst humidifier ever, gets moldy even with daily cleaning with vinegar.

It is pretty loud regardless of the setting (I use the lowest setting). It can also make a small room quite cold. My biggest complaint is the film that is produced. Even with cleaning this thing constantly, there is a thin white film that builds up on ANYTHING within 4 feet of this thing...windows, furniture, & probably my baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIRT AND MOLD IMPOSSIBLE TO CLEAN","review":"I agree with the reviews about the dirt and mold build up that you cannot clean. I've tried getting my hand down into the machine to clean the build-up, but all i managed to do was scrape up my hands. The more i've tried to clean the housing, the worse it's gotten. This morning i just have given up and will be throwing this humidifier in the garbadge. Also, after using for a while, it did start vibrating a lot so that my kids would complain about the noise. we would stick a wipe between the fan unit and the water tank to stop lessen the vibration."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNHEALTHY","review":"I wish I would have read the reviews first. Instead I bought this at the local drugstore. Filterless sounds like a good idea, I should have known better. I have cleaned and cleaned this machine of black and pink mold and it still smells horrible in the room. I stayed awake last night thinking of all the crud that is being taken in by our lungs. I really don't know how this can legally be sold, it has to be a health hazard. Not to mention it is loud, and I mean loud and the light, oh my goodness. I put duct tape over it and then clipped a washcloth over it. It looks and sounds like a landing field and smells worse. This machine is going in the trash today. Give me a machine with a filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR QUALITY & NOISY","review":"Just bought this yesterday & after one night I cant wait to return it. I was trying to decide between this and the Crane Frog humidifier which we had last time (was dropped and broken, but worked great! This one was SO LOUD that it sounded like my neighbor was cutting his lawn and it vibrated the whole table it was on. This machine also has two nightlights on it that are like 2 headlights in the room - way too bright. I will buy the Crane Frog humidifier again instead, which made almost NO noise whatsoever and the tiny light on it was not bothersome.

We finally replace them but don't waste your money of this model - it's absolutely crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cleaning nightmare","review":"I asked my cleaner lady to help clean this thing after a couple of uses and she threatened to quit.The instructions that come with this piece of junk mention that it needs cleaning every week but with daily usage, it needs cleaning every day and oh by the way you need white vinegar to clean it. If you don't an ugly looking pink stuff (mostly bacteria) starts formning in the vents and there's nothing you do can clean it.The only good thing is that it does humidify the room pretty quickly. I am now in the process of throwing away this as I need to take half a day off to clean this beast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful and dangerous!","review":"My husband bought this for me (it has one knob though, not two) and I only got two days out of it. It doesn't have an automatic shut-off and my husband mistakenly put it on the highest setting. I was too sick to notice and the motor burned up when the tank emptied. We didn't know til the 3rd attempt to use it- first the setting would only go on high, the first two wouldn't work, then we could smell the motor burning. When I picked it up off the folding tv tray, the tray was COVERED in mold. I mean really bad and it's permanently stained. We cleaned it out after each use too. Although this is a user error, I would never buy one without an automatic shut-off ever again. The unit was also very loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Deserves no stars.

Even if you could clean it, they stop working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy","review":"I completely agree with everyone who says this humidifier is horrible. I have had two for two winters now, and they develop a smell and are impossible to clean because you can't reach the part where all the dust accumulates. Silly me, I thought all humidifiers developed that horrible smell until I read all these reviews. Like many others, I tried cleaning the tanks, using these cleaning balls, and other things, but the smell always eventually comes back. What a shame, I wasted over $90 dollars and now have to invest in something new. Thanks goodness for reviews on Amazon. I will read reviews before buying a new humidifier."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not buy this again","review":"This humidifier worked great for a few days. Then it grew mold even though I emptied and dried it everyday. And it grew the mold in hard to reach places so I couldn't clean it. Then after 3 months it started to make loud noises and the mold inside was growing everywhere. I couldn't wait to get rid of it at the end of winter even though it was still under the 2 year warranty. I did not want to replace it under warranty because I didn't want another one so I tossed it at the end of the winter. We used it for about 4 months and that was it - and I could barely stand using it that long! The only positive was that the water tank has a big hole so you can reach and clean the inside but none of the mold grew inside the water tank!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy Loud","review":"Cant believe they can sell something capable of making this much noise.

It is noisy, had a lot of buildup on the vents, mold grew inside which had a bad odor, and finally it stopped working. I called the company and they want me to pay to have it shipped back. I have a feeling that they've had a lot of calls about this unit. On a previous call, I was also told that I should buy some pipe cleaners to clean out the mold and buildup.

I am on my laptop, listening to music, typing this review and I mostly hear the humidifier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frickin Loud!","review":"Seems to do a good job at humidifying but I returned it for two BIG reasons. First; because on high it sounds like a diesel generator (even louder heard through ceiling downstairs.) Second, because if you try to move it, water spills internally and then drains out of a little hole all over your floor, I'm talking a LOT of water! You have to take it apart and drain the tray before you move it to avoid a giant mess.I used it for about two weeks and couldn't take it anymore. I replaced it with a 'Venta-Sonic VS207' which ROCKS. So nice, so quiet, fantastic output, digital humidity indicator. etc... Costs $40 more but WELL worth it. Best humidifier I've used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildew and scale build up","review":"I had opted for a cool mist unit over a warm mist unit because I wanted to avoid the molds that frequently build up with the warm mist units. This unit worked well for a while, although running all night significantly cooled the room down a few degrees. I cleaned it regularly with white vinegar, etc, but it still developed a pink scale throughout the interior of the unit, some of it I couldn't remove because it wasn't accessible by hand. I unplugged the thing, called Kaz (the manufacturer) and they claimed the pink build up is due to the water I am using, but still offered to replace it, as long as I sent it back.I will likely send it back for a replacement, but I don't think I would opt to buy this unit again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a vaporizer","review":"My biggest complaint is that this model is not a vaporizer, but rather a cool mist type of humidifer. Meaning that it uses an impeller to break up the water and emits a mist, rather than heating up the water and emitting steam.My second complaint is that the thing stopped working after one night. It just gets no power when plugged in now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clearly I'm the minority here...","review":"I don't have a problem with this humidifier. It's set up in my bedroom right now for my sick 5 year old. I've had it some time now, right around 3 years I believe. I don't use it non-stop, and I don't use distilled water with it either. I have yet to see anything in my home be \\"covered\\" by \\"filth\\" from it. We also have harder water here and I still have no issue with mineral buildup. It is substantially quieter than a fan, and quieter than the computers in our bedroom as well. I had an old Vapor Pad in it and just put some eucalyptus essential oil on it and all has been well.I like it just fine, and I suspect that we will continue using it for a number of years when it is needed by my family to help alleviate the effects from illness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Extremely loud.Mineral dust coated everything after just one use.

After just a few weeks of use, it started to get louder and louder- rumbled like a freight train even at the lowest setting. Not exactly ideal for a sleeping infants room. So we contacted Vicks, because surely we though that the one we purchased was either broken or defective in some way. They honored their warranty, and sent us replacement of the same model free of charge, which was very kind of them. Within a week the new one started to rumble louder and louder, to the point where the noise from the humidifier would wake us through the baby monitor! Needless to say we are extremely dissatisfied with the product, we expected a higher quality from the Vick's brand. The only positive thing I could say was how their customer service was fantastic, too bad their product stinks. We are now looking for a new humidifier, and we will be sure to steer clear of the Vick's brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible to clean","review":"I got this as a gift off my baby registry and I regret registering for it. I was impressed with the non-filter aspect of the humidifier but I never realized how hard it was to clean. I would rinse this out every day and wash it with vinegar once a week. I still had a mold build-up and white powder. I even tried distilled water. The screws that keep the cover in place needs to be removed in order to wash the interior. Somehow they rusted and when I called Kaz to ask for suggestions all they could say was to soak it in vinegar. It did not work. The unit is just sitting on the floor of my closet now collecting dust since I can't seem to clean the interior parts- what a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS USELESS MACHINE","review":"So I just bought this humidifier from Target a couple of days ago and I have been testing it out for almost a week now and it ABSOLUTELY sucks!It was expensive for no reason.

Although the tank is easy to clean, everything else isn't; there are a lot of little parts that you have to detach in order to clean inside the spout where the air comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"on sound alone, this thing is horrible.","review":"This is one of the the loudest, cheapest humidifiers I have ever owned, and Ive owned alot. Its great that its filter free, and the idea of putting a little drop in cleaner is wonderful, but you can't have this thing on within 10-15 feet of where you sleep if you plan on sleeping. I will be returning this to Target (where I bought it) and trying something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very quiet because it's broken after 10 days!","review":"This worked great at first. Noisy but that helped me sleep. After 5 days it stopped working, but I somehow managed to get it going again. It lights up, and you can hear a slight click when you move the humidity % dial, but it never cuts on.Now again it's doing the same thing and Vicks has 0 support information for the product. P&G; doesn't even recognize the product either. My feedback would be to the Holmes products. Just as noisy but they consistently work (I have 2 different models). Don't waste money on this one - as you'll spend more to get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasteful/uncleanable/harbors mold/takes a lot of time to maintain","review":"The directions say to empty the tray and clean daily.You have to dump the water from the tray, take off the bottom, soak in vinegar or bleach waterThen put it back together.Mold still forms in the bottom and inside the unit and fan area that you cannot reach or get to.We also have a lot of minerals that are stuck in the machine and have made it a reddish tinge.Totally will NOT buy another one.NOT worth the trouble of not buying a filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish my highlander guinea pig did not nibble on the cable","review":"This is really bad.The noise is really extreme...everything else is good but that makes you not want to use it.

After roughly a couple of weeks, this humidifier develops black mold (really disgusting) and even into the motor housing, where you cannot clean. The maintenance require you to clean it every day (roughly an hour of your time), and once a week you're to take the whole unit apart (including the engine housing!!) and scrub it down. Many people have complained about the mold problem and the response from the manufacturer is to clean it even more and run the motor daily WITHOUT water for an hour to allow the fan to dry from within. This is completely unacceptable and out of the norm. There are many better products out there. Stay away from this disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kept this less than one day","review":"Not only is it noisy, it puts out so much 'mist' that everything near it was dripping within an hour.

We bought 1 for my oldest daughter last year (end 2006) as she had croup and it worked just fine. A few months ago my youngest daughter had also a cold and cough at the same time as my oldest so we went back to buy a second one.We don't have mold issues (even though very often if it is not in use we forget to take the water out...and to take the water out is recommended)It makes the room humid enough (windows are wet the next morning) the best thing for cold/coughing instead of dry air.Yes it makes quit a lot of noise when it is running but it doesn't cause a problem for my 2 girls to feel or stay in sleep.And yes we had the first time we used also the waterproblem as we didn't put it back right. But after that never had a problem again...They are both still working!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful - Don't be attracted to \\"filterless\\"","review":"Having a filterless machine appealed to me so I tried this one. After using it for 4 months with my newborn, I threw it out. It's extremely noisy and the noise varies unpredictably. It vibrates so much photos hung on the other side of the wall vibrate. It's impossible to clean. I replaced the protec beads often and used vinegar regularly but still got buildup and grime. You can't get the interior cavity clean at all. I went back and got the most basic model with a filter and am thrilled with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure it is worth the money","review":"I read all of the reviews about this product before purchasing. I took a chance. The humidifier works OK, and so far is easy to clean. It is noisy. If you are looking for something really quiet, get an ultrasonic humidifier! This was too loud for my kids bedroom at night, but it work well in the living room during the day. If I had to do over, I would not have purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Clean","review":"I agree with so many others. It worked while it worked, but now there is pink grime built up in the motor part that I can't clean.Update: I just took an hour to take apart and clean the motor part of this humidifier that is hardest to clean. With my OCD efforts, I was unable to truly clean it. That, and it now only works on the highest setting. Definitely going to be replacing this soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"works but quite noisy ---bring it back to the store","review":"I bought Vicks V4500 because it was supposed to be quiet. There were other cheaper models in the store but no I bought this higher priced one because on the box it said \\"quiet\\". Well it is not.

Didn't last 2 weeks without smelling like mold and every time I cleaned it as the manual, it smelled like mold after 2 days. When I called KAZ, the girl didn't even ask me what the issue was. Once I told her which model it was she was very nice and said \\" Return that model and go get one with a filter. These models are awful and the mold is harboring in the motor which you can't clean.

It is noisy and causes mold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Sleeping Next to a Engine","review":"Loud. Loud. Loud. It does humidify the room effectively, but the noise is just too much to warrant purchasing this product. Oh, and the \\"night light\\" illuminates the entire room in a green glow. I thought I was in 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' with this thing on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Purchase this product","review":"I am so disgusted with finding a decent humidifier. This was another complete and total waste of money.It is impossible to clean.After 1 month of use, the motor is so loud that it keeps you up at night - the white noise goes from white to intolerable.There is hair growing at the tip of spinner. I assume it's black mold.Really, why would you put out a product like this? The manufacturer should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I, as others, were attracted to the filter free aspect of this humidifier. I also liked that it was a Vick's and I could use the scented pads for my baby girl. Unfortunately it would gunk up constantly and even though I tried cleaning several times after a few uses, it never got fully cleaned. The noise didn't bother me, even though it's louder than our other humidifier. My daughter liked the white noise and it never bothered her. But the humidifier would smell and eventually after continued use at night in her room, it started leaving a white film on the walls and things nearby that I had to clean. I only used the low setting and really did want to keep it but it got so disgusting that I gave up using it for fear that she would be breathing in the stinky fumes. I would not recommend this product and currently we are looking for a replacement for her room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy!!!!","review":"Hate it!! Awful product. Sounds like a lawn mower in my bedroom and adds a new vibration and sound every night. A piece of junk!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and hard to clean","review":"I totally regret this purchase and will be looking for another humidifier. Even through the closed door of the nursery I can hear this thing in the middle of the night. Every once in a while, it will not make such obnoxious noises, but that will only last for a few seconds. Also, the only area you can easily clean is the tank itself. Which will only last for part of a day on the lowest settings."},{"rating":"1","title":"white stuff everywhere","review":"Don't waste your money.

After couple weeks, it sounded louder. louder and louder. Then mold and minimal built up which was expected. However, it is hard to clean up when they were built up deep inside the compartment which my finger could not get to the area. And it suddenly died after less than 4 months into service."},{"rating":"1","title":"The noisiest humidifier on the planet","review":"My wife bought two of them from Target a few weeks ago. We noticed one of them got incredibly noisy, as other people have said, like a diesel generator that's about to die. So we returned it and got another one. Within a week, the new one also started making that horrible noise. We haven't had them long enough to know that mold develops in the housing unit, but as if the noise wasn't reason enough, I'm definitely tossing these in the trash. We regretfully tossed out the boxes so now we can't return them. Great. I did see that the Vicks UV 99.999% Germ Free Humidifier was well reviewed so we might get that one. It's more expensive but I think worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOLD EVERYWHERE!!!!!","review":"This product does NOT deserve 1 star. They should have a negative rating scale...I spent $75 for it at my local drug store because I thought the idea of not having a filter to change would be great. What a MISTAKE! I bought this for my 8 month old daughter's room and cleaned the machine religiously according to the booklet instructions only to find a month later that the fan housing (which you are NOT supposed to clean) was filled with pink and black mold EVERYWHERE. I am scared that my daughter has been breathing in this junk for over a month now, 10-12 hours every night!When I called the manufacturer they told me to use pressurized air to clean the fan housing. This did NOTHING to remedy the problem. Buying this machine was a huge mistake!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mold...pink film...after SIX weeks!","review":"I got a great deal on this (normally expensive) product about 6 weeks ago. I was thrilled to see it actually provided moisture, because I have a two year old in day care who needs a humidifier run every night. I went to do the weekly maintenance a few nights ago, and THROUGHOUT the motor housing is a pink film (we get this in the shower too) as well as mold spores. You can't clean the motor housing, so it's ruined. I called Vick's and they will send us a new one when I send this one back. Not sure if I will. The only option they gave me to clean it was to use pressurized air! Well I don't trust it enough to clean in the places I can't see...so no thanks. I did ask if they had this issue before with this machine and they told me \\"no.\\" Looking at the other reviews, I see this isn't true. My son will probably be labeled asthmatic when he is old enough for the diagnosis, so I am obviously concerned about a product that grows mold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"This humidifier is a piece of junk. One of the other reviewers said it should be called a \\"mold machine\\" instead of a humidifier - I can't agree more. There is no easy way to take this thing apart and clean it.And like the other reviewers, our humidifiers (we bought 2) sounds like a tank. It started out fairly quiet, but even if it didn't spew mold in the air we wouldn't be able to use them because of the noise... Terrible product - I would give this humidifier a negative number of stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minimal moist putout","review":"This humidifier makes more noise than necessary especially when it can never make my small room moist even when running on high all day long. Do not waste your money. I'm not sending it to goodwill for people to waste their money. I'm gonna brake it and it's going in the trash because that's what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this humidifier! I miss my one with a filter!","review":"I bought this one because I clean my humidifiers very well and figured I can save some money on filters and just keep it clean.. Well, If I ever try to clean it well, I end up hurting myself trying to get the stuff off of the inside that smells. I cut my self last time. I am going to toss this one and get back my old one with a filter so I can just replace that and clean the parts that need the cleaning... not trying to deep clean it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do they make and sell this?! It's awful!","review":"I wish I had read the reviews for this humidifier before I purchased it. Initially, it had a louder hum, which I didn't mind as it created white noise for my baby. I consistently clean my humidifiers weekly. Regardless, this started to stink (like body odor) after 1 month. You can't get under the major plate and can actually peek and see the mold growing. In addition, without using purified water, it will spread the minerals/white film over EVERYTHING in the room. Now, after 3 months, the motor makes a loud roaring sound. I immediately unplugged it, and threw it out. Why do they still make this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw mine away.","review":"I know this product is pretty much condemned by all reviewers, but I can't help putting one more nail in the coffin.I threw away my functioning Vicks V4500 Humidifier today because I refused to clean it any more. If I missed a cleaning in 3 days, the item would be as loud as a tractor. Cleaning was not an easy job as the unit had to be taken apart and all the nooks scrubbed with a bottle brush. When I did clean it, I constantly imagined taking a hammer to it, Office Space style, seeing all the dirty buildup right in front of my eyes yet I could not reach to remove. I can't imagine how anyone would leave this churning germ factory in the middle of a room in plain sight, so to the landfill it goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Loud!","review":"One of my key requirements for a humidifier is that it is quiet. This one is the very loud. I'm returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing roars","review":"It usually seems to me that people exaggerate a little in their reviews of \\"noisy\\" appliances, but his thing IS ridiculously loud on low speed. I put it around a corner in my bedroom area because it was so noisy, and even that didn't help. I expect a noisy humidifier on high, but also expect to be able to have it do it's job quietly on low. I purchased this locally, and am returning it today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious health hazard,worst humidifier","review":"There was too much of moisture in room which made my carpet, walls and bed damp and the Corner were I kept was wet alongwith floors and tables too.

Complete wastage of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"FORGET MOLD WHAT ABOUT THE RUST ?!?!?!?","review":"I bought this product when my 1 year old son came down with a cold. It seemed to work pretty well.....then I took it out of his room to put it away. The whole inside was completely covered in disgusting black mold, but wait there's more.....I understand that wherever there is water you run the risk of developing a mold problem, so I decided to take it apart, clean it up, dry it off, and pack it away for future use. A couple months later my son developed a terrible cold, so of course I took out the humidifier and not only was it not working, but further investigation showed that it was totally inoperable due to a SEVERE rust problem. This thing was created for use with water! There should NEVER be such rust and corrosion in an item like this ESPECIALLY AFTER JUST 2 USES!Vicks should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such a terrible product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time!","review":"We really tried to give this machine a try. We purchased it a little over a month ago. Worked great at first, after about 3 weeks the thing just died and would not turn on. The manual said the overheat switch must have came on and to call customer service for help. I called for nothing, I got the impression you would be able to reset the switch and the machine would resume working. Not!! The agent said the machine did indeed die and we should return it to the store or they could send us another one.Well, we took it back to the store and got the same model hoping the one we had was a dud. After just 8 days the new one just stopped working last night. But this one starting making a funny smell the last two days before it gave out. I called the customer service again to complain and they said they would replace the machine with any other product they carried (not necessarily vicks).Do not waste your time on this piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"I purchased this unit at Rite Aid because of pneumonia that I had earlier.

This book has an interesting premise--that of a child abandoned during World War II after she has been shipped to Canada for safety's sake. My interest was piqued by the geneology involved when trying to identify the child's family 55 years later--possibly due to my own interest in our family heritage and our European \\"roots.\\" The protagonist, Erin, is a solid, dependable woman and daughter.

White, applies his knowledge and experience to enable one to effectively steer their professional endeavors. I would recommend the book to anybody looking to either establishing a career, or further strengthening a nascent one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel good book, but filled with anecdotes and lots of gray","review":"This book is much like Prof. White's class at Northwestern, it sounds great at first, but if you actually stop and think about what is being said (ironically employing a lot of what White is recommending) you start to realize that it is just a collection of anecdotes and quotations that are intended to make you feel good and to get motivated.This book isn't horrible and I am sure many new hires, fresh out of college, will feel good about what is being said and will gain some self confidence in the process. Unfortunately much of the statements in this book are corollary, have little or no factual basis and are not all that insightful, but rather common sense stuff. Call this book what it is, a self-help guide, a motivational text, but certainly not an insider's guide, nor insightful advice from a CEO."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read for those starting out in business","review":"From Day One is a great read for those who are looking to learn the ropes of corporate life from a seasoned professional. I was a student of Prof. White at Northwestern. The tone of the book reads very much as he teaches his class: instructive, personable and populated with fascinating antidotes from his experiences.The most important thing I learned from the book is to do as much for others as you can and build out your personal network. In the beginning stages of your career you will have much to learn and not much to offer. However, by spending the extra time to make the lives of those around you easier, you will be noticed and appreciated. The hard work that you do up front will pay dividends down the road.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a terrific read","review":"Despite it being targetted obviously at those who're starting out, this book is really for everyone who're just looking for some ways to better manage their careers. Its extremely insightful and uses Prof. White's and others' experience to provide realworld examples to go along w the guidance. It sets out scenarios that one may encounter and just basically offers a good healthy, ethical way of doing things as you move forward (even in your life beyond the job in terms of diversification of your activities). A read well worthed, and something I would definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fundamental knowledge needed for success is in this book.","review":"This book has provided me the knowledge I need to position myself for great success in my career.

I highly recommend this to anyone who has aspirations to succeed and do well in their careers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical, applicable, and supported by real-life experience","review":"This book is a must read for all twenty-somethings. White draws on his own success in business and lets the young professional in on the secrets of what it takes to make it to \\"the corner office.\\" Behind every successful business person is a mentor or trusted advisor; someone who believes that you are capable of great things. White is allowing himself to be a mentor for the reader of his book by instilling in him or her the confidence needed to succeed.White's discussion of life diversification and servant leadership are two ideals covered in the book that are critical to the young professional. By highlighting the real world applications of these concepts, White's book transcends mere corporate success and shows how to be truly successful in life.I highly recommend \\"From Day One\\" to anyone looking to further their career without any regrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, fast read with invaluable tidbits of advice","review":"This was DEFINITELY worth the read. It zips by and before you know it, you've finished the book with three pages of notes full of invaluable tidbits of advice that will help you throughout your career. What I liked most about it is that the author doesn't waffle. He tells you what he thinks should be done in each circumstance. It's direct, justified advice that we can all afford to hear. If you aren't just starting out after college or grad school, it is still valuable, but not as much as if you are starting from the beginning. Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Advice to Jump-Start Your Career","review":"I have to say, this book is great!

While we all know of these horrors their sheer magnitude renders them hard to assimilate: it is therefore generally easier and so much more comfortable to forget about them as people do with the Holocaust, the Armenian genocide, the killing fields of Cambodia and so on. Each photograph in this book shows a heart-breaking human tragedy that completely personalises the horror and thereby forces us to become emotionally involved with those who suffer. This book should be in every public library."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"It's a good book, very large and with very good quality paper.

This self indulgent wallow in self importance has convinced the photographer and the editor that this is serious art. Don't be fooled. Natchwey's high fashion compositions cheapen the suffering experienced by the subjects. Thanks to the photographer, I expected to see Naomi Campbell walk through the horror of refugee camps in Zaire. As Natchwey voyeuristically fetishsizes his subjects, he loses all sense of time and place. The viewer can't tell if photos are of Chechnya or Kosovo and I don't Natchwey knows either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"This is one of the most powerful books (experiences) I have ever read.

Although meant for pre-school children, it delivers a sophisticated message...against stereotyping, and acting with prejudice towards \\"the other.\\" Rouss creates an all-too-human situation in which the animals refuse to accept a pair of termites as passengers on Noah's ark. Their fear turns them into an angry mob. But, much to their surprise, the termites devise a scheme to save them when the storm makes the ark lunge perilously from side to side. The apologies at the end conclude with the significant admonition by Noah: \\"It's important to accept each other's ways. We're all God's creatures and to God, we all matter.\\" Its universal moral makes this book suitable for children of all ages and faiths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I have always loved commissioned and still do they are a highly anointing group of men who can definitely bring words to life in a song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best value in a notebook","review":"When I researched the market for the best notebook/laptop that fit into my budget, this model stood out.

Now, upon trying to boot it makes a horrible popping sound and shuts itself back off again. From all research materials I have found this make and model is plagued with overheating and shorting problems. My recommendation would be to go with a little more expensive better quality machine.

What I look for in music is mood and atmosphere, compositions which are able to paint pictures and create worlds in my mind. Music for me is also very emotional, and much of what I listen to evokes certain pleasant feelings in me. Such is the case with Canyon Dreams. Even before I ever saw the accompanying video, I felt immersed in a private world of brilliant red rock formations and crystal-clear water rushing through the organic nooks and crannies that only water itself can create in rock. My favorite tracks are Water's Gift and A Matter of Time, and it's no surprise that those are my favorite videos as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music to soothe the mind","review":"In our home we listen to Country-Western, Classic Rock, Oldies and more.

Verbiage just sort of lays there and is not as inspired as the artwork nor the tale.Two Stars. [D+]. Interesting artwork. Bad Read-aloud. Interesting story - if it were only told in more pleasing form. There is much here that parallels the Judeo-Christian stories of creation and flood."},{"rating":"2","title":"At their best","review":"Heirs to the twin traditions of 60s psychadelic pop and British 80s indie (a less cynical Smiths, at times), The Boy With The Arab Strap is Belle and Sebastian at their best - sweet, literate indie which isn't quite as fey as some of their other releases, and just glides through the course of an album. The best track by a country mile is the utterly gorgeous 'Sleep The Clock Around', which features wide-eyed vocals, an aching melody, and a burgeoning arrangement which gradually builds into a gentle cascade of tumbling drums, bleeping synths, and later, quirkily, bagpipies. But there are other good tracks: in particular the upbeat 'Dirty Dream Number Two', which contains a great melody and a perfectly executed string arrangement, along with some almost funk-influenced guitar work, and the jangle-pop of the lovely 'A Summer Wasting'. Reccomended even to the sceptical."},{"rating":"2","title":"SEVEN WEEKS OF STAYING UP ALL NIGHT","review":"Who else can pull off such calm, melodic sounds coupled with somewhat off-the-wall and melancholic imagery?

People, people -- Belle & Sebastian is flat out boring, and they are musical thieves to boot (unless Lou Reed is collecting royalties...)

I heard them a few times, then went out and bought 2 full lengths and 2 eps. And you know what... when i actually think about it, and put this disc on. I REALLY don't like this type of music at all. It's very pansey and weak. This music is for people who are weak, both physically and mentally. The guys voice is just plain annoying. I'm sick of this \\"psuedo experimental\\" indie pop. This disc sucks, and so does the band. B&S are just too trendy for me. I'm either missing something, or not \\"cool\\" enough to be into it. The songs are boring and tired.

All of the hoity-toity people with one pinky in the air fall all over themselves talking about the \\"paradoxical dichotomy of the painfully beautiful, even uplifting music, juxtaposed with world-weary, deviant, subversive lyrics.\\" Yes, if you want to be a critics' darling, you have to do something snickeringly cool like that.

As for the enlightened few who've had the pleasure of hearing this bands soaring music; please excuse us while we kiss the sky. I don't really understand the purpose of juxtapositioning Belle and Sabastion with the Smiths, insofar that there's no Johnny Marr clone to found here. And they really don't share Morrissey's self-loathing ruminations, lyrically.

Listen carefully to old Herman Hermits records (or maybe even the Monkees), and you'll see there's not much difference between the two. Belle and Sebastian is an awfully sentimental group; their lyrics are maudlin and preening, and even when they concoct a catchy hook, the arrangements are slight and wispish. The lead singer doesn't have an ounce of grit; your average coffee-shop singer voice, I guess. Please...trust me.

It is totaly forgetable and leads you to complete nothingness. Its like eating the main course only to find yourself still hungry, ordering another meal to eventually find yourself broke and starving. Its as harmless as raindrops in a puddle and there is no beauty or melancholy here - rather a complete and utter experience of blandness.Perhaps the ultra-fragile types on the verge of a physical and mental breakdown might find temporary sedation in this and no doubt intellectuals and critics worldwide will praise it."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated tripe","review":"I was heartened to see the bad review of May 8, because I was starting to wonder if the world had gone mad. \\"If You're Feeling Sinister\\" at least had some dynamic to it, something moving it forward. This is just excruciatingly fey, innocuous pap - I can imagine nothing more embarrassing than having to listen to it in a room with other people. All that recommends it is its softness, its background-musickishness.I think it appeals to people who desperately want something soft - very soft - but don't know where/how to find good soft stuff. Or perhaps they're just too shallow to \\"get\\" Nick Drake.This will probably cause howls of protest - the wimpier the band/singer, the more intolerant the fans, Morrisey's being a case in point - but if you haven't bought a B&S; CD before, give the sample tracks on Amazon a good hard listen first.

This album would be flawless except for Seymour Stein (sounds as if an amateur wrote it simple and boring) and Chickfactor (argh it's soo dull). But with songs like Brillant Career, Sleep the Clock Around, Summer Wasting, Space Boy Dream, and Dirty Dream 2 it's hard not to absolutely love this after the first listen to. And i love it when a band pays as much attention to its cover art as its music, this album just stares at you from the music shelf. And it's available in vinyl, oh how i love vinyl it's like this band knows me! I feel like i've found some rare gem. I think it's great that not many people know about this band, it's like being apart of secret club.

I'm a fan of classic rock mostly, I kind of despise modern pop. I accidently reached this page at amazon, and i'm glad i did! Some of the reviewa are a little exaggerated. I mean, b&s cannot be compared to R.E.M. or Velvet Underground, hell, how could anyone think of such ridiculous comparison! However there is no doubt that b&s is a fantastic pop band. The melodies are simple and cute, and the vocals are beautiful.

As far as the rest of New England, there must be something better. We found ourselves in the middle of some great towns with nothing more than a couple of sentences, if that, about the area. After getting out of the car and exploring, we found many interesting sites and attractions. If we made our decisions based completely on the book we would have passed up many interesting stops. Next time we travel in New England, we will buy a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!!","review":"I am very angry that I wasted good money on buying this CD on the basis of false information. As a keen fan of Thelma Houston, I bought this album purely to get the unknown track \\"Here I Go Again\\". After receiving the CD, I was extremely annoyed to find out that there is no such song - it's just her well-known Motown track \\"I'm Here Again\\" (which I already have on CD), under a false name.If this was originally a genuine mistake, why wasn't it rectified when the album was reissued with new artwork?There are only a few other good tracks on the album, but I already had those on CD too. The majority of the album is DULL DULL DULL!! Beware!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is One of the Best","review":"This book is among one of the best books in this subject.

Not only is it published by 1st Books, a vanity publisher, but it's chock full of grammatical errors. Obviously, this book wasn't cleaned by a copy editor (or any editor for that matter).

Teh reasin they allowed China to take over tibet, its because there's a bigger stake in Christ. Which they got soo wrong.Iraq invaded KuwIT AND there was a war. But China invaded Tibet and there was no war. I saw americans discover ancient sanskrit texts in a temple which is now china [tibet] and their commentary was \\"Oh! here are some more ancient chinese texts\\".

With the exception of the issues featuring Jim Lee, the art is horrible. The coloring is atrocious, some of the worst I have ever seen in a comic book story. Even though some of the writers are quite good, here they all collectively sucked, even Chris Claremont. Claremont's dialogue has never been his strong suit, but here it's just rediculous. The scripting by the rest of the crew is even worse. The only thing I could think about while reading this was how much money I wasted on it. Even the title is stupid. Avoid \\"X-Tinction Agenda\\" at all costs. If your looking for a good X-men crossover, pick up \\"Bloodties\\", which is kinda/sorta the same story as this, but much better.

He loves his fans and makes sure he meets everyone when he plays his concerts. He just recently played at a Disciple Now retreat in Richmond,Tx and it was an awesome experience. \\"So Completely\\" was a song off the album he sang that grabbed my attention. Other songs I enjoy on the cd are \\"Anybody?\\", \\"Turn Around\\", and \\"Perfect Day\\". If you've never heard Wayne's music before, he plays music like you would hear from Chris Tomlin. Wayne also has another cd out called \\"The Mountain\\", but can only be purchased at WayneKerrMusic.com.

The footage of Sharma and Loskot deepwater soloing in Mallorca was awesome but other than that it was pretty sub-par. I think what really killed it for me was Ivan Greene. I hate seeing this lifestyle and sport being represented by someone like that. It was painful to watch the whole segment on him. Great climber, but when I think of BigUp I picture Sharma or Graham dominating a crazy V14, not some ego-maniac misrepresenting the sport of rock climbing. I've come to expect a lot out of Josh Lowell after seeing some of his amazing work, so maybe this was just a minor bump in his career."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"i watched this after having already seen vols 3, 4 and 5 so it seemed a little 'old school' to me in terms of production quality and the routes/problems OVERALL weren't as wickedly intense as the more recent offerings but it is still a good one to watch.I for one like to see all the different personalities in this sport; this is an activity that appeals to a broad range of people and it may as well be represented as such so the \\"Ivan\\" section doesn't bother me in the least. Then again I am from NYC so not only do I see that type of guy all the time but i was pretty stoked to see some hometown spots in the vid.All in all I can tell you that I own every vid in this series and I have watched this one (vol 2) more than once and will watch it again so there you go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SpeedStream 5100","review":"This is a BRIDGING modem, not a routing modem.

I agree with the other reviewers that you should have friend help put this thing together. I was able to do it myself in about eight hours total over two days. Also before you finish tightening all the bolts on the frame, put it all together first, square it up, then tighen them all at the same time. It will save you alot of time having to loosen parts back up to make other parts fit properly. As far as the function, it works as advertised. It is sturdy enough to do 400 pound smith squats. The bushings that the guide rods ride on are pretty flimsy, but keep in mind this not a gym quality machine, that is going to cost 3-4 times as much.

After searching for a replacement band for months (including from Seiko directly), I gave up. I liked this watch so much that I ordered this one through Amazon just to replace the bandHopefully the clasp wont be an issue this time. The band is fairly unique.

I have owned about 7 of these transmitter and they all suffer from: cheapness, inefficiency(bad battery life), fragility, weak transmission.This device is really strong.

About half the book is interviews with former Wooden players, with Wooden's family, his friends, and even his former teachers. These interviews prove Wooden truly walks what he talks. The biography section is as in-depth as anything I've seen on Wooden and the amount of new information revealed is daunting. If you are a Wooden fan, or want to learn more about the former UCLA coach, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRUTHFULLY, I'LL PROBABLY NEVER USE IT.","review":"TRUTHFULLY, I'LL PROBABLY NEVER USE IT UNLESS I'M IN SOME SORT OF A SOLDERING REMOVAL PINCH.

The idea of a Romeo & Juliet story played differently in a parallel universe is charming, but probably only merits a short-story or novella length work. 400 pages of tiresome infighting between the houses of swaggering Italian stallions causes the eyelids to droop. The characters of substance are peripheral, and we're expected to care about the traumas that befall the vain & vacuous.

This album is simply awful. I've heard tighter and more substantial melodies on \\"Barney\\" (not that I watch \\"Barney\\"). Aqua's music is as refreshing as a saturday morning commercial, and the lyrics will leave you wishing you could blast Yoko Ono at full volume on a shoddy stereo, just to drown them out. This album is indeed shameless, with the female vocals that could shatter glass, ballads probably thrown out by Madonna in her earlier more annoying years, and male rap vocals that will leave you with a deer-in-the-headlights vacant gaze.

Other eurodance/bubblegum tracks \\"Happy Boys & Girls\\", \\"My Oh My\\" and \\"Roses Are Red\\" are also nice. \\"Heat Of The Night\\" is not euro, but is nice !!! The 3 others are quite good too. But I only give 4 stars because those horrible high pitched voices are soooooooooo annoying !!!! This bad point really disappointed me, because the music is amazing !!!! If you don't like high pitched voices, you might listen before buying, and if you don't like this, then I recommend you Daze's album \\"Super Heroes\\".

I was hooked after listening to the album at a store and some encouragement from a DJ friend who found one of the songs (\\"Roses are Red\\") club-friendly.My opinion? A very solid album. I just like the songs. I find them upbeat and I've recently started listening to the album after not listening for a while. I rarely do this for old albums (even if I liked them before).Note, I'm a eurodance/dance, etc fan and also slow songs. Thus the faster songs (Roses are Red, Calling You, etc.) are good along with \\"Turn Back Time\\". I'm glad Aqua can branch out and not be a \\"dance\\" act.My favorites songs are: Lollipop, Roses are Red, Calling You, Turn Back Time, Happy People, and My Oh My. The others are decent. One song I don't listen to much is: Barbie Girl. A lot of people liked it and it's ok, but it's not a favorite of mine.Check this album out!

After a while, I didn't like listening to this song, so I decided to explore the rest of the CD.Be A Man...\\"for once in your life, be a man.\\" How many times have you hear that?Lollipop...this is one of my favorite songs on the album.

I do have to admit, the CD makes a good frisbee, and the case doesn't do too poorly as a coaster!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aqua rocks.","review":"Aqua the Europop group from Denmark. They bursted out onto the late 90's Dance music scene with Barbie Girl. But There are other songs on Aquarium that are awesome like Roses Are Red and Turn Back Time. Roses Are Red highlights Rene Dif's awesome unique voice, Just because his voice is really deep doesn't mean he can't sing . He CAN sing He's the Villan where as Lene is the good girl. Speaking of Lene her voice is really sexy to listen to. As She is very sexy. Both her and Rene's voices makes the songs unique and fun to listen to. Aqua are an awesome group. Claus and Soren do a great job with the music itself. and Soren's backing vocals are very good both here and on Aquarius. Aqua's second and final album. So all in all Aquarium is the best dance album. And Aqua is the best Dance group of the 90's. I wish thier career together lasted longer though. Highly Recommended for Rene and Lene's awesome vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"This CD is really good!! If you like dance music you will like this CD.

The best track is 'Turn Back Time' which is a far cry from 'Barbie Girl' (but don't take my word from it, check it yourself). Speaking of being a far cry from 'Barbie Girl', try listening to 'Be A Man' and 'Good Morning Sunshine'. In those three songs, Lene Grawford Nystrom, the lead vocalist, has a truly magnificent voice! And if you listen to the last song, 'Calling You', the music might remind you of the video game, Sonic the Hedgehog in a way. I give Aqua four stars, because it's good, but might be more enjoyed by younger kids, knowing how happy the music is! : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music that will make you puke, and have a good time doing it","review":"Aquarium, a nice sliver pancake, is oldschool disco with a near lethal injection of techno. The first time I listened to this funny looking frisbee, I thought it was yicky techno-bop, not even worth bothering to file it into the collection. I was embarrassed at the prospect of confessing that I paid money for this foil&plastic sam'mich, BUT I kept listening to it. I thought it was awful, but I couldn't stop listening. I couldn't abstain from playing it ad nauseum. Listening to aqua is like having a knack for narcotics. With just shy of half a million plays logged on my disc shaped music cartridge, I'm proud to say that AQUA is a good band.I don't call this \\"fresh\\", mind you, nor is this \\"tight\\" or \\"phat\\".

For one, it has catchy songs, fast paced music, and entertaining vocals to keep you awake. My favorites on the disc include \\"Happy Boys, Happy Girls.\\" It just wants to stay in your head forever and never come out. Another is \\"Doctor Jones\\" and the controversial \\"Barbie Girl\\" (you'll know why once you listen to it). Though repetitive and a nuisance after awhile, Aqua still maintains a fresh sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, Done that","review":"Average read until the last third. The monster is a cliche, but that's not all. The storytelling is stilted and the characters relatively shallow. What really bothered me, though, was the ending. The description of the monster was unnecessarily and crudely pornographic. I mean, to the point of nausea. This description wasn't necessary to enhance the mood or setting either. Nothing really added up in the end, and the demise of the monster was laughable. I bought this after reading the other reviews, which were mostly favorable. I regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Breed!","review":"Breed features one of the best things about classic old horror (particularly Lovecraft-type horror), in that Owl allows your imagination to portray the monster by offering only little hints as to what it looks like. As you follow a handful of characters through snippets of their daily lives, not only is he able to portray a great sense of reality through dialogue and reaction, but there is always a lingering sense of giddy anticipation and fear whether he is unleashing the terror in that particular chapter or not. The story feels familiar, but Owl is creative enough to keep throwing unexpected events abruptly in the way, constantly changing what you thought was coming up next, never letting you completely second-guess him. It's his sense of reality and his sense of humor which really keep the pace fast and fresh. I hope to see a lot more out of this talented young author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost in the graveyard","review":"When some Wiccans accidently open the psychic doorway in an old Florida cemetary the blood starts to flow freely. The killer is not human, nor a simple ghost, but a shape shifting monstrosity that tears humans to shreads.The newest novel by Goingback contains a well fleshed out, unwilling herione who is contacted by the spirit of a dead indian chief. Many of the scenes between these two characters are somewhat tongue in cheek, and you may get as many giggles as chills. The hero, a burnt out workaholic cop, is less interesting and more formulaic. Also, there are some chills but not many suprises in store for seasoned horror readers. Still, if you are looking for an easy reading, fast paced horror yarn BREED will satisfy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Westernizing of an Irish Lad","review":"L'Amour takes a raw lad from Ireland ans sends him west for a railway laboring job.

Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci did a really good job, and Christopher Walken (I think that's his name) also did a really good job playing the Headless Horseman. (with his head on, of course. When he didn't have his head it was all a stunt man.) Besides for the gruesome decapitations, it was all in all pretty good. (but then, gross killings are Burton's style.) Added to the fantastc soundtrack by Elfman it made a stupendously good film. I would recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. And if you can, see it on DVD. It's got special features on it that aren't on VHS."},{"rating":"2","title":"eerie","review":"the little town of Sleepy Hollow is host to a phantom murderer who beheads his victims.

It moves along slowly, has some very stiff acting and a hard to follow plot.If u want to check out Johnny Depp's better work then get \\"What's eating Gilbert Grape\\", (also Leonardo DiCaprio's finest work.) Christina Ricci does some bad acting here, but i think the script stinks. The film is also unnessessarily gory, it seems like the gore is suposed to make up for the lack of storyline. I was bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Folklore Classic........","review":"Tim Burton did a fantastic version of Sleepy Hollow. The dreary and dark landscapes, odd characters, and the special effects were classic Tim Burton. The decapitation scenes were at times grusome. The true star of the movie was the Headless Horsemen and his horse. I enjoyed the segment on the DVD how the movie was developed and the special effects used in the movie. I would recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blew me away!","review":"I don't think I have actually ever seen anyone give this bad marks. How can you with over-excellent special effects, art direction, story, direction, costumes and casting! It is impossible to dislike!For your information Sleepy Hollow is my 2nd favourite movie and is becoming very close to been my favourite no. 1.I am anything but a Johnny Depp fan, but he deserves an Academy Award nominaation for his role as Ichabod Crane, a small-town counstable who has been sent to investigate the decapiting murders of the town of Sleepy Hollow!You'll scream, you'll laugh, you'll have fun! Don't miss \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" - the best film of 1999!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful and gory","review":"Usually i don't like too much gore in a movie (or in our country =P) But this movie really did catch my eye. It had many twists and turns and it really catches you in the end. I enjoyed Johnny Depp, who seems to have blossomed since 21Jumpstreet. Christina Ricci's fake accent did bother me though. All in all I loved this movie, come on Christopher Walken as a bad guy, who'da thunk it. Good movie, very suspenseful and worth the price. you'll like it for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, HORRIBLE Blu Ray Transfer","review":"So far, this is the worst quality Blu Ray disc I have seen, which is a shame because this is such a visually stunning film. The Blu Ray is extremely grainy and details in many shots almost seem to have a smudged look. Paramount should recall these discs and tranfer the film over again. Don't buy this Blu Ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic! Destined to be a classic!","review":"While Burton's \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" isn't Washington Irvings', the fact is that the movie is simply wonderful. Forget the book for a while and enjoy it. The photography is amazing and the idea of using Ichabod Crane to parody the image of the image of the distant, calculating detective is brillant! The pacing and infusion of comedy makes the entire film a joy to watch. The sequence of the horseman stalking a small child in a home will make you hold your breath. The performances are flawless and the special effects are done to enhance the story line, rather than being an end in themselves. Which is what special effects are supposed to do, in my view. Burton and Depp are a wonderful team together and I hope they do many more projects in the future. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Second Bluray/Excellent Quality","review":"I first saw this on cable which I no longer subscribe to since I don't like most of the popular shows many do, preferring to watch things that appeal to me and not the general masses, especially TV sitcoms and reality shows. So I purchase things I enjoy. This film is one of those and the added benefit is looking at Johnny Depp. It's really a well done scary sort of movie that I happen to like without being excessively and graphically gory. I own all of the Scream movies and love those as well, but I must admit I wind up watching parts of those through my fingers especially if it's late at night and I'm alone! I am really impressed with difference that Bluray makes...and I thought it was all hype! This is a good film even for children I think because while it's spooky it really isn't overly graphic. Just depends on how suggestive your children are and some are more so than others so watch it first if you're considering it for family viewing with younger ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the average horror movie","review":"I'm not a huge fan of horror movies so perhaps it helped that I watched this at 1 am in the middle of the woods at a camp like area. With the average teeny horror flicks, I can tell who the killer is immediately but I must say, I was quite baffled over who was controlling the headless horseman. I was pleased by the plot being so convincing. Overall, definitely a movie to see, it will make the hairs on your back stand up if you watch it online or at night in the woods like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"TIM BURTON FANTASY","review":"Except for the images of a young, industrial New York City, \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" is rather lifeless.

This time around he gives us goth with a touch of class and elegance. Who better than to use once again but Johnny Depp, and the beautiful Christina Ricchi, as Ichabod Crane and Katrina. This movie is probably the most scary and edge of your seat Burton film. It is full of great scares and chills, and it is a wonderful movie to watch on a dark spooky night. This may have not been Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, or even Batman, but it is definately one of Tim Burton's greatest movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heads,Laughs, and Jumps","review":"Sleepy Hollow was a delightful version by Tim Burton. Johnny Depp is Incabob Crane, and i must say a very funny version of him. I didnt find the movie to be terrible scary, more of a movie to enjoy for the little jumps and humor, along with the handsome Johnny! In the movie the the story is a little different, such as how the headless horseman came to be and that he can go anywhere not just staying on the one side of the bridge. I highly recommend the movie for ATLEAST a one time viewing!I ALSO RECOMMEND EDWARD SCISSORHANDS!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Depp and Burton together again","review":"I loved this movie almost as much as Edward Scissorhands. It is a fantastic moody atmospheric horror movie. The story is fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good departure from the original","review":"This is very far from the original by Washington Irving, so far that it is really a completely different work of art. While in the original Icobod, is a kind of local twit of a teacher - pompous, lacking self awareness, ridiculously awkward - in this he is a big city \\"scientific\\" investigator who comes to the provincial town. Moreover, Irving's tale never quite enters the supernatural, but instead is a parody that leaves much to the imagination.That being said, Depp creates a very good character: a bit of a dork, but courageous in overcoming his fear. THe atmosphere is as vivid and dense as one would expect from Burton, with excellent actors adding to it. It is more of a traditional horror story that is tied off rather than left open, which I regretted.Recommended for fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleepy Hollow is wide awake on Blu-ray","review":"The incredible production values and performances really shine on this Blue-ray edition of Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow. Tim Burton's rendition on the classic tale is a creepy fall take shrouded in mystery in tune with Halloween.

People that like this film seem to come from a group that have only seen ersatz films such as the new Mummy have nothing of real movie value to compare them to. This must also be a group that has never seen a live play or an old German film.The filmmakers attempted to capture a cross between Nosferatu. It may have worked in 1920 however the film is to clear and sharp. It comes off looking more like a cross between a cartoon and a graphics ad.The actors outweighed the characters and looked like they were reading the script. I could swear that some were watching the teleprompter. And who's idea was it to cut up a three day old corps to get covered in blood that if was any, had lone ago coagulated? I could go on with quite a few examples. But you get the idea. This should be helpful even if you liked the movie.If you are driving by a place that rents this DVD, stay in the car!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH! Washington Irving must be turning in his grave....","review":"How sad it is to see what hollywood does to American Folk Lore!

Christina Ricci (Mermaids, Adams Family), Johnny Depp (What's Eating Gilbert Grape?), director Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Batman), a well casted array of character actors, it should have been great.

Sadly, the pluses and minuses barely add up to the two star level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull jelly-splasher","review":"This was a disappointing mess.

I expected much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 STARS: This movie sucks.","review":"Tim Burton's horrible depiction of the classic \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" is utter trash...the movie is actually just named \\"Sleepy Hollow\\". What a disgrace it is for such a classic story to be defamed and ridiculed with this horrible garbage. Depp along with the rest of the cast were absolutely horrible in this stupid flick and the movie just isn't scary folks...simple as that, but this movie is very stupid though. This is the only Burton film that I have seen and it is going to be the last. I threw my money down the toilet when I saw this in the theatre...now, you can believe the glowing reviews of this gargage if you want, but if you are looking for a \\"real\\" horror flick, then avoid this DVD like the plague...if you are looking for garbage, you have come to the right place.

Tim Burton is a lousy director and writer, but often brings some interesting visuals and ideas to a movie if he is controlled (usually by someone else writing the script).He has made some great stuff: Batman, Big Fish, Sweeney Todd (Nightmare before Christmas was not directed by him)He has made some awful stuff: Planet of the Apes, Batman Returns, and this movie.The movie is spared a one star because of some cool looking sets and a great (non-speaking) performance by Christopher Walken. Everything else in the movie (maybe I'm forgetting something, Johnny Depp was ok, but well below his usual level) is pure garbage. I would strongly recommend spending your DVD dollar elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like Grandma used to make","review":"Oh, it's no masterpiece, but it EXACTLY captured what I used to see in my head when Grandma told me bedtime stories.My Grandma was pretty scary, but it was fun scary, the kind that made you scrunch down under the covers but not far enough so that you couldn't hear every word.That's what this video is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful acting ...

Ichabod Crane , played very well by Johnny Depp is a forerunner to modern Forensic Science as he goes to investigate the killings. The camera work and lighting is suburb is this movie and this is one film that you should watch on the big screen.

There is so much gore and violence, so much that it earned an R rating. If it weren't for the violence in this film, it probably would've gotten away with a PG rating. Anyway, the acting was shallow, and the story was so hard to follow...by the end of the movie I had given up completely as to trying to figure out what was going on.

I couldn't eat him with a knife because he would just slide off the edge of it, i couldn't eat him with a fork because he would just fall through the cracks, maybe if he's lucky, an arse crack. So a spanner wouldn't b ideal as it has a hole in the end of it and if he was on it he would try and make a secret window out of that hole.

'Sleepy Hollow' could be subtitled 'Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Beheadings (during and after).' Two examples: a whole happy family is beheaded, one by one, with each member seeing a loved one's severed head before being killed; and a man is impaled with a fence post before his daughter's eyes and dragged outside to get beheaded. Outside of that, 'Sleepy Hollow' is all atmosphere with a daffy storyline. As a friend's teenage daughter commented afterward, \\"It wasn't even scary.\\" If this wasn't a mainstream film, one would think the deliberate, choreographed sadism is the product of sick minds. It's probably just a sign of the times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Johnny how could you?","review":"This movie HAD potential and was interesting up to a point. But basically this whole film turns out to be an infomercial promoting WICCA. This movie blows big time.

Burton's Headless Horseman even finds a head with a scary face on it. Wow! I am really scared. This movie is all about big bucks but is no movie. What a waste of money! If a movie maker wants to make a good movie, he should try very hard to capture on film Washington Irving's (1783-1859) masterpiece.So far, the only good Tim Burton film is Edward Scissor Hands.

It is funny, scary, exciting and a visual masterpiece. The cast are all great especially Johnny Depp who is fantastic as the nervous detective, though one of the (unbilled)stars is slightly wasted - you'll know who I mean if you watch it. The most impressive thing about the film is its visual look. You can tell that every single frame was carefully planned and the special effects are fantastic. The executions/beheadings are gory but highly stylised (have you ever seen a head spin round twice before it falls off! ). Not the best Tim Burton film, but certainly a welcome return to his gothic sensabilities after the kitch of Mars Attacks.

While its characters are based on the those depicted in Washington Irving's \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,\\" and the tale takes place in Sleepy Hollow, New York, the story varies greatly from the novel. Tim Burton's approach gives a new twist to the tale, and the performances by the leading actors are remarkable. The added features provide insight to the making of the film. However, it is not for the faint of heart. While the beheadings aren't over bloody due to the \\"power\\" of the horseman's sword, they are explicit and may not be suitable for young viewers. Also, for anyone who is a stickler on details, while the panoramic views of the Hudson River at the beginning and end of the film are breathtaking, Sleepy Hollow is on the OTHER side of the river.

To be fair, the film was entertaining at times, and I'm sure a lot of people will love it, but I walked away wondering exactly what it was trying to achieve.

So, when I heard he was making a movie called \\"Sleepy Hollow,\\" I was very excited since my favorite story of all time is \\"The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow.\\" However, when I saw the movie, I was disgusted with what Mr. Burton did. He took characters from my favorite story...a classic of American literature...and put them in a glorified slasher movie. It had nothing to do with Washington Irving's famous story! If Tim Burton wanted to make a horror film, why couldn't he come up with something original like he has in his other films? Better yet, he could've made a faithful adaptation of the original story!What upsets me the most is that some people, after seeing this film, will then expect to find a \\"horror\\" story if they read the original story, only to be \\"disappointed\\" to find that its actually just a good natured, old-fashioned ghost story. Believe me, reading \\"The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow\\" by Washington Irving is a much better experience than sitting through this film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Washington Irving is rolling over in his grave.","review":"I took great exception to the fact that this movie borrowed the name and a few (FEW) plot elements from its namesake short story.

The faces are most unusual."},{"rating":"2","title":"wECOME tO hELL","review":"Genius. The blood that cauterizes into something like wax to close the contract of dread with the seal of evil. Heads fall like guilt before the judge, and the terrible mechanical instruments of truth are born to divine the guilty from the innocent. Evil-doers are supported by those in power, while the clean spirited are burned and hurt and misused.That's just the first 5 minutes of the thing. Faces so pale, it may as well be in Black and White. Evil created by so \\"righteous\\" a crew, that one might as well forsake all that he has learned and give up to the truth.Abandoning everything that you've been taught by this society about good and evil and the givers and the perpetrators of them is the only way you'll understand this master work.Forget too the Edward Scissorhands, and the Nightmare Before Christmas, and that BeetleJuice. This story has to stand by it self! to be understood.If you have eyes and ears, use them, and enjoy what has to be one of the few masterpieces of this age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"A true masterpiece of film making. Only Tim Burton could do this classic tale justice. Christopher Walken's performance as the Hessian Horseman is terrifying. The weak-of-stomach should beware, this film contains 18 graphic decapitations, an impalement, the slaughtering of an entire family, among other sick and twisted themes. But the gore is necessary to prove just how terrifying the Headless Horseman is. Recomended to all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Twisted Tale of Horror and Romance...

The Disney interpretation is so pale, that I never even thought to read the book. Well, it looks like Tim Burton has read it.Few directors are able to tell a story as deliberately as this character. I always enjoy his work, even if I don't enjoy the story. But what a plus when the story's really fun as well? I saw this on pay-per-view, then I watched a tape - twice, I watched it again when my sister rented it - now I'm buying the DVD. The more I see it, the more enjoyable it becomes. Burton really stands up to scrutiny. And I'm grateful to have this new interpretation of the story available to me.Plus, this movie is just plain fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do NOT miss this one!","review":"This film is an American horror classic, just like Washington Irving's story. I can't think of anyone better than Tim Burton to do it; and can't think of anyone better than Ray Park to be the stuntman in the costume.

Icubod Crain is played very well by Depp playing a detective way over his head in unnormal goings on in the small town he visits. Christina Ricci is also grate as Depp's' love intrest. But the person who realy steels the screen is the headless hourseman played by a truley ugly looking Christopher Walken whith a hair cut strait from hell itself.

Once again, the dark misterious athomsphere famous from Tim Burton's movies really shine here. The story is well-known to many, but told in a manner of great imagination and mistery. The fighting sequences are great, dual wielding swords flash in the air and blood everywhere, some o the most impressive violent-sword-fighting scenes in this movie as well some of the most impressive misty environments ever created. The actors were very well chosen too and play their parts very nicely. All in all a great movie from a great master, dont miss if you like fighting sequences with weapons and misterious stories with a bit of terror to spice it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love it!","review":"I loved Sleepy Hollow. Burton really hit the nail on the head with this. Over a span of 2 years, I went from a person that watched comedies and Disney films to movies like Sleepy Hollow and I Know What you did Last Summer. I have a very healthy respect for this movie, and everyone that has watched it knows why. I loved the horse scenes and how talented the headless horseman was, but was upset that I didn't get to see Icabod's head hacked off. Darn. =/ It was different from the book in some ways, but in many others was alike. All in all, Sleepy Hollow is one of my favorite movies now, and-though I am surprised it is rated R- was very interesting.(I loved the part where the people's heads came ou of the tree and were moving around. cool! <3 Jess)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful movie, great performances by Depp and Ricci","review":"This movie is a must see.

Although there were more added to the original story such as the backstory on Miranda Richardson and the romance between Christina Ricci's character with Johnny Depp, this is one version of Sleepy Hollow that sends chills down your spine and still manage to entertain both genders. A date film? Yes, definitely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastically dark and suspenseful","review":"I absolutely love this movie. I had not had the luck to see it in the theatre, but after renting it I had to buy my own copy. Tim Burton does a fantastic job of creating a dark mood. Even the photography has muted colors, which adds to the atmosphere of the movie. Johnny Depp's character, Ichabod Crane is a quirky and amusing. The best is Christopher Walken as the Headless Horseman. I could not think of anyone better to play this part. Overall, this is a horror movie that actually has horror, not just blood and gore, not to mention a believable plot, which most horrors fall short on."},{"rating":"2","title":"WATCH YOUR HEAD","review":"I have this on original dvd. The HD is real good for some reason I thought the sound would be better but definitely worth the purchase. Buy it on Amazon you wont be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Genius of Burton & Depp","review":"What a wonderful take on the old chestnut. Tim Burton has a vision that is undeniably eclectic and strange. Depp is the perfect choice for the only slightly less hapless Ichabod Crane character. Burton weaves the tale perfectly, leading Depp down a giddily frightening sequence of increasingly wild events culminating in a satisfying and mind-blowing climax. Dark, scary, humorous, an eccentric, fun take. Washington Irving would enjoy it immensely, I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and sad","review":"I just read a review by Michael D Ward, entitled UGH that said it perfect. I could not agree more.This was a sad remake of a chilling story, 'improved' to the point that is no longer the same story other than the names. And what was wrong with the original? It only lasted centuries, unlike this which will only last that long as landfill. The storyline was paper thing and very easy to guess what was happening next. There was no fear or horror, just a sad boring film.If you want to see this, I sugest renting and not buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...","review":"Terrible. Just terrible. Screenwriters must take some liberties in adaptations, but Irving's story was raped. Not only was the storyline impossible to follow, the special effects (which I assume were added in such abundance to try and blanket the terrible plot) did nothing to add to the film.The excessive gore was simply distracting and gratuitous. It's as if the goal was to put as many disturbing scenes as possible into the hour-and-a-half flick. Burton is okay in that mild gothic humor he likes to do, but this quasi-serious attempt fell flat. If excessive gore and gray skies can keep your attention for any length of time, you may enjoy this. Otherwise, do not waste time or money on this film.Really. It's that bad. Really."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had a few good points but was mostly just drivel...","review":"I had pretty high expectations when I popped this in the DVD player. After about 20 minutes those expectations turned into prayers..... prayers for something good to save this movie but it never happened. The first scenes were OK and there was some intrigue, but it quickly got dull and just plodded along not knowing what to do next.Ichabod Crane isnt sure what his plan is, he just wanders from place to place without much direction. Depp played the character well, I just didnt like the character! Christina Riccis character seemed totally disinterested with what was going on. It might have been Ms. Ricci since I consider her a pretty low-grade actress. The rest of the cast was OK but noone jumped out as special or well-thought out.This *might* be worth a rental if you're desperate but I really do NOT recommend this film. Those that like it must be fans of Depp or Ricci. The many high reviews puzzle me...???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleepy Hollow","review":"Great movie, wrong format. HD is dead and stinkin'.

She works to get the characteristic lilt and lightness in her voice now with whispers. The songs, however, are middle-age circumstance, lyrics right on the money and touching a familiar chord with anyone over 40. But for a legendary songwriter who has been so prolific over more than three decades, \\"Taming The Tiger\\" comes up short, literally -- it's LP-length (44 minutes), including a totally uninspired instrumental, \\"Tiger Bones,\\" (length 4:22) plus the worst CD technical indexing mistake I've ever heard on a compact disc -- 50 seconds of nothingness between tracks 10 and 11.

There are flashes of lyrical insight mixed with some that are genuinely awful: \\"I can't get thru the day/Without a big boo-hoo\\"??!?? Echhh!!! Joni has a reputation as a poet, but these lyrics sound more like essays or complaints grafted onto the music. Sometimes she sounds less angry than crabby. Musically, though, she still writes on a level that few artists can dream of, much less achieve, but all the musical richness seems like a background track to a series of ill-tempered grumblings. I kept waiting for the knockout song like \\"The Magdalen Launderies\\" or \\"Borderlines,\\" but it never came. This disk is short and sweet, without the sweet.

It seems that everytime I turn around I find there is another young group ripping off the name of yet another steller band from yesteryear.I was afraid that THIS \\"Big Daddy\\" might not be the same band from Rhino Records' formative years of the early 80's, who issued several albums, taking 'current' songs and cleverly reworking them in the musical styles of the 50's & 60's. (Sadly, very little of their catalogue has been issued in CD format, other than the available \\"Best of...\\" disc and the out-of-print reworking of the Sgt. Pepper's album.)Unfortunately, I was right. This is just another unimaginative, late 90's group doing nothing particularly inventive. Least of all, coming up with an original name of their own. And, unfortunately, I had to waste my money to find this out.

At times they flip back and forth between shots in a manner best suited to some MTV video, not a scenic portrayal. Then there are the \\"shot out of the car window\\" pieces that don't really seem up to the task. My final gripe was that no matter what I did to the color settings I could not get a realistic rendition of what I've seen in person a number of times..

We were able to get it to zip back together and it seemed fine once we got it closed, but I was worried about our expensive car seat during the flight. We had the same problem coming back. It seems like they should get a much stronger industrial zipper that does not have teeth that will just come apart. I was especially surprised because our car seat is one of Britax's smaller seats - as I understand it the popular Marathon model is wider.

The trip will gain Nancy a new friend, but will also plunge her into the midst of an international crime ring. So, there are clearly some elements of a good mystery. There's also plenty of elements to remind the reader that this is a rather old book- instead of flying with luggage, Nancy and her friends are taking a steamship, and bringing trunks. But really, those elements are part of the charm. What I found far fetched were things that seemed entirely inconceivable. For example, Nancy gets kicked out of the school group with whom she's to travel because a parent finds her 'unseemly.' Those issues aside, this is a rather good story, though I think some of the newer Nancy Drew books do a better job of creating Nancy's environment. Aside from some Spanish references, one would hardly know that Nancy is in Buenos Aries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Mystery Here","review":"This review concerns the original 1940 edition. The trunk which Nancy takes with her on a cruise to South America, along with a similar trunk owned by another passenger, appear to be at the center of a mystery. This book was alright, but I found that it really didn't have a mystery to it until the last few chapters. The first part of the book concentrates on the efforts of the mother of one passengers to keep Nancy from sailing. Ultimately, the mystery is somewhat dull and predictable and the book lacks much action. The book is probably worth reading, but I doubt that it will be one of many people's favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST Nancy Drews","review":"This is one of the best Nancy Drews! the other one is the Tolling Bell.

I did get them to actually seal my ears, but I had to sit perfectly still on the soffa. These would never work for any sports application.After trying several different types of music,(Rock, Jazz, Video sound tracks and techno), it became very apparent that there was practiclly no low end. I coud increase the low end slightly if I jammed them in my ears to the point of pain.These babies are not for everyone.

I really liked the etymotic buds for the fit; no matter how hard my workout was they stayed in place. The wires are sensitive to noise though and I could pick up on the rustling of my shirt or jacket against the wires; and they are fragile, so mine eventually were worn down by wear and tear. UE do not fit well, no matter what choice of tip I use. They are heavy in the ear, the cord is heavy, both causing them to fall out constantly, or feel like they're falling out. The sound is good though, and I don't hear rubbing from the cord while I run.

If you like alot of bass, I would look into the super.fi 5EB instead of these, but otherwise these seem to be a good buy for the price.There have been a few people who have said these aren't worth buying, but if someone does their own research, these were made for jazz, classical, and other music genres that generally don't require that much base.

The music is still tolerable but and I can still use them, but I will give it one star because of the price. $25 or so might be a fair price. I would advise you to avoid this product.

The company doesn't even have email support to ask the question, the link goes to a non-functional Logitech page as of 10-13-09.

So I did some browsing and decided on these UE Super Fi 3. They are so worth the $$$!! The sound quality is superb! It is similar to switching from a two speaker stereo system to a 7.1 surround sound system!! You can hear all the ambient sounds in the music, just as if I was using my 7.1 surround sound at home. Not to mention since they are ear buds with superior noise cancellation I do not need to turn my IPOD volume as high as I did before, therefore saving me from further loss of my hearing!!

I'm amazed at the things I can't hear when I'm listening to music with these. It's really great for tuning out distrations or unwanted noise. The headphones themselves have very thick, sturdy cables, and somehow the first inch or two of cable outside of the earbuds holds their shape, so you can bend them in a nice position to tuck behind your ears. The supplied metal case is a nice addition, and the earbuds comes with all kinds of tips, so you shouldn't have a problem getting a nice fit, which is essential if you want a nice low end response from the earbuds.

They isolate you very good from environmental noise and are very musical for Classic and Jazz music. For Pop and Rock I would wish for a lot more bass. The earbuds are a bit uncomfortable, since it takes some time to fit them correctly every time you use them. Only when adjusted correctly you can really benefit from the sound and isolation.

I'm guessing that the higher priced Ulitimate Ears are probably much better, but these are definitely not worth $60+ . I also found them awkward to wear and uncomfortable, but I probably could have gotten used to that if they had performed anywhere near to my expectations.

I have a Bosch 4000 that I truly love & believe its the best 10\\" saw in it class, but its heavy and I don't always need the capacity of that saw. This \\"little\\" DeWalt is perfect for ripping 1x stock for trim work & the like. I've even had it up on my scaffold. I've found the fence to be dead on and very easy to adjust. The motor has plenty of power. I think DeWalt hit a home run with this saw...Now if it only came in a cordless version!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Saw","review":"Wow!!! What a great saw...

I've been very happy with this saw through 4 months of building cabins for a summer camp. Enough power for all framing duties and enough accuracy for the quality of my finish work. Blade and fence seemed pretty square right out of the box, although I imagine my buddy with his $4000 cabinet saw would have a laugh at this. I thought the mechanicals which move the fence felt pretty solid for this price range. This is a very light, compact, easy to move saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lemon of a tablesaw","review":"The saw I received had an incorrectly cast motor trunnion, which caused the blade to be positioned about 3/16\\" off of the blade insert centerline. Setting the blade beyond a 30deg angle caused an interference with the blade insert. I checked it against a display unit at a local store, and the copy I received was indeed incorrectly made. It was so out of wack that adjusting both the rear and front trunnion mounts could not solve the problem. Needless to say, it was sent back and Amazon dealt with the return like a champ.All table saws need to be adjusted to work properly, but this one shouldn't have left the factory."},{"rating":"1","title":"METALIC SURFACE BROKEN","review":"THE METALLIC SURFACE ARRIVED BROKEN IN BOTH ENDS OF THE TABLE, VERY DESAPPOINTED.WHAT CAN I DO ???IT 'S INCREDIBLE IN A NEW DEWALT TABLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic rip capacity","review":"With 16-in max rip capacity, I can hardly make a decent sized drawer with it.

The Dewalt is the smoothest working portable table saw I have ever used and the size and weight are perfect, easy to move from job to job and the steel frame is durable, no plastic base to hit the ground and break or crack, and the rack and pinion fence is the nicest thing to use, and very accurate. The one and only complaint is the miter guide, come on Dewalt, if you put half the money into the guide, which gets used a lot, as you did into the guard, which just gets thrown away, this would be the perfect saw, I have never seen such a piece of junk as the plastic miter guide that comes with a high quality, well built saw. You ALMOST got it PERFECT Dewalt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value table saw","review":"The DW745 is a lot of saw for the money. The fence adjusts smoothly and very accurately (metal rack and pinion gears, not plastic!), with solid locking for repeatedly even and exact cuts. While short, the miter gauge slides nicely in its track, and the plastic angle piece has a handy screw hole to allow you to attach an extension if you wish. The working surfaces are aluminum, helping to keep the overall weight light while retaining durability. Even the saw height adjustment uses metal gears with large, solid teeth. It really feels like DeWalt obsessed over each detail of the tool, making it a standout bargain and a joy to operate."},{"rating":"2","title":"dw745 table saw","review":"the blade was not square with the guide but was easily adjusted. its handy and very portable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to create a smooth cut!","review":"I borrowed one of these saws for a few weeks and it performed well...it was a \\"TYPE 1\\".Several months later I bought a \\"TYPE 2\\" (which is printed clearly on the specification stickers on all Dewalt tools...TYPES 1,2,3 and 4)The saw that I bought had to be returned because the arbor had such bad run-out,(the blade moves up and down so bad) that I could not get any where near a smooth cut!The second saw was the same (also a Type 2) I returned one more time, only to get the same results!

The portabality feature is what I was looking for and it is good. I did do some reading regarding several other saws and because of the fence comments being a little negative on several other saws and the comments on this saw being real good I did acquire it. The fence design is much better than I expected. The fence sits nice and square with the blade and quite accurate. This saw is empressive right out of the box.And the portable fold up stand has longer legs on the rear with rubber feet so when you push your material into the saw it stays nice and firm and does not slide or tip backwards.Brian"},{"rating":"2","title":"DW745","review":"The Dewalt DW745DEWALT DW745 10-Inch Compact Job-Site Table Saw with 16-Inch Max Rip Capacitysaw is a good, portable job-site work horse.

Until about halfway through the book, I considered abandoning it, and I hardly ever put down a book after starting it. Granted, the second half of the story was much better than the first, but even the second half wasn't great.The writing is inconsistent, many of the characters are painfully flat, and for all of the criticisms that I've read concerning this book's close resemblance to a tawdry romance novel, I've read better sex scenes in a Harlequin paperback.If you don't mind the unfocused, meandering plot and shrewish women that fill the first 300 pages, the last 200 pages are somewhat enjoyable.

This pseudo medical man blabbles on about Life strategies and other foul clichés in an overall boring and uninspirational manner.

What is it?,horrible predictable orchestrations, ..., face it! Listening to it twice means you don't have a life. Boredom sets in just after one minute for me, and most,musically there is nothing there but bleak content masquerading as serious music, and I'm not an elitist.

Listening to this you will hear syncopated rhythm, repeating chord progression, and deep string tone. Symphony no. 3 is the stongest part of this CD. Interludes from the Civil Wars was composed for a pause in the stage action in Robert Wilson's Civil Wars. This features a descending scale theme. In Mechanical Ballet we have shades of Glass's Einstein on the Beach. The Light is perhaps the weakest piece on this CD, it's a little too long. It begins with a slow romantic introduction and proceeds to a rapid pace and it goes on and on. With the Light being the one small caveat I have about this CD I still recommend this CD strongly if only for Symphony no. 3 which represents some of Glass's best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent listen...","review":"When considering Glass it is good to remember that initially Mozart was criticized for having too many notes in his music. The most often repeated complaint about Glass's music is its repetitiveness. While Glass leans closer to John Cage then Mozart he shouldn't be so easily dismissed as evidenced by this wonderful compilation.His 3rd symphony is a delight and is executed with precision and heart by the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra. But the real gem on this CD is the final piece called 'Light'. It is astonishing in its simplicity and hides the obvious mastery needed to execute it.This disk is marvelously put together and should go a long way to quell the criticisms of this great composer.(Please Note: As I, in principal, believe that the altruism of review system has been diminished by rating the reviewers, I ask that you DO NOT indicate whether this review has helped you or not.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic page-turner.

The flip-cover on the back pops open way too easily, and the fact that the belt clip mounts to this cover makes it virtually unusable. Slight movement such as walking makes it pop open and hang out from the belt.The design is unimaginative, and contrary to the description, the item I received contains no leather -- rubbery plastic only. If they had placed the clip mount towards the bottom of the phone, it would hang upside down -- a bit odd-looking perhaps, but far more functional because it would (a) be visible/readable without fully unclipping it, (b) place no stress on the camera lens protective cover, and (c) would be about 3-4mm thinner. As it is, there's no real reason to keep this case, even if the removable clip itself is rugged and well-designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ever","review":"The buttons that snap this thing together come apart every time I get into my car or bend over to pick something up. It looks pretty cool and slim in the picture, but it makes the phone incredibly fat.

If you use the belt clip often, then this weakness can be a major problem.Lifetime Warranty - sending your case in for warranty service or exchange is not practical because this Krusell is based in Sweden, so you must send you case to Sweden for service. The least expensive shipping I can find to Sweden is for about $7."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not great","review":"Ugly orange trim color might be cool for kids, but looks ridiculous on an adult.

The cover was so loose that the phone kept twisting around in it, blocking the keys on the right side. There is no access to the memory stick port, you have to uncase the phone to change it out. The flap that covers the camera snaps to the top so you have to be very careful taking pictures or your phone will hit the floor.

Explore Creation Myths, Flood Myths, Hero Myths, and Object Myths, for a few examples, in a way that crosses cultures and time periods with ease. A truly diverse selection is in this work, this is not just your typical compilation of Greek and Roman myths.

Below is an excerpt from the text.\\"Christianity and Judaism in particular - regard themselves, like Islam regards itself, as a final, divinely revealed truth. Yes, they too proselytize, and they have their occasional religiously motivated murderers. But those are aberrational and instantly condemned by the rest of the faithful.

I bought it when it first came out, but even then I recognized it as basically a cut-and-paste job (literally -- the text blocks sit askew on some pages like they were manually pasted up in someone's dining room) culled from any number of press sources that gives precious little insight into Price, as either a man or an actor. Worse, the write-ups of his films are so smugly dismissive that one wonders why the authors bothered publishing a book about a figure they clearly seem to disdain.

We ordered this seat & received it 2 days later with Amazon's free shipping! My kids couldn't wait to get it out of the box! She climbed in by herself & sat with the biggest grin. I love the neutral color scheme, comfy padding, moveable armrests, & cupholder attached to the base. I really love that this seat has many great reviews out there (not just on amazon). My 6yr & 4yr old boys that use a booster seat also thought this seat was 'really cool'. It was a breeze to position the harness to fit her correctly & installed in my minivan in under 10 minutes. She used to cry when I buckled her in her old convertible car seat; she hasn't since we got this one. If I need another car seat/booster, I'll definitely buy another one of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Seat","review":"The Cosco Deluxe is wider than other booster seats which makes it easy for winter jackets and coats. The recliner is an added bonus. The harness is a little time consuming to connect each time compared to a regular carseat, but if your child meets the weight guidelines, then it is farely easy to use the vehicle's seatbelt. It also has 2 straps that attach to the rings in the seat of the vehicle (don't remember the technical name) but it is an added safety measure that our old car seat did not have. Also, it is cushioned throughout the back and seat instead of just against your child's back. The Cosco Deluxe is reasonably priced, is very light weight, yet sturdy. It's a good buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical car seat, if you get it on sale","review":"This appears to be a pretty decent car seat. We've been using it for a little over a month. Our two year old likes that it boosts him up a little higher than his previous seat. It's easy to use/install/adjust. I think it had a $120 price tag on it, but was on sale for 50% off. It's a reasonable value as a $60 car seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Carseat","review":"I absolutly love this car seat. It is big and comfy and my little girl loves sittin in it it seems. the seat cover is WONDERFUL for spills which was the only hesitation i has about buyin one online- i could not see the fabric and i wanted one that was easy to clean. But it turned out perfectly.The reclining feature is by far one of my favorites. I can just reach rite back while driving and recline her if she falls asleep. it is easy to install, and while it is a little tricky to get the seat cover on and off, as long as you follow the instructions it is no problem.The only reason i gave it four stars was the packing. the box was a bit smashed when it got here and there was no kind of protection inside the box for the seat. However the seat was in no way damaged- they just need to work on better packin methods, cuz not every seat may arrive as well as mine.I would reccommend this car seat to anyone- the price is amazing and the product is wonderful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall great for the price!","review":"Seat is easy to install, and my 2.5 year old loves it. He switched over to it easily.The buckles do slip down, but it's not too terribly difficult to get them back up ... a bit annoying but that's alright.Another annoying thing is the cup holder ... great feature, but it's only on the left side of the car seat. If you put the car seat on the left side of the car, then the cup holder is pushed up against the door frame and totally unusable. If the seat is in the middle or right side of the car, then it's okay. Again, slightly annoying but nothing serious."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this seat.","review":"My husband had it in his truck and I had a Britax Marathon in my car. He had trouble securing the seat, the straps are flimsy and I hate the buckle. When my brother gave us one of those little booster seats that are just a bottom and 2 arm rests, we ditched the Eddie Baur and are just using that in my husband's vehicle. My son is 5yrs and 50lbs so well within the age to use just a booster. My husband did not want to keep the Eddie Baur as a booster b/c he said it flopped around too much when son was getting into and out of it. My husband would have to climb in the back of his truck to hold the seat steady so my son could get in and out. I do not have that problem with my Britax Parkway booster seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfortable but of Questionable Safety","review":"I purchased this car seat without having done a lot of research.

Not a bad price either. The only thing that gave this a 4-star rating was the box was partially opened when it was delivered. After inspecting to make sure there weren't any defects it was fine.

This is hardly history, and could be more accurately described as pure propoganda. Aside from being largely factually incorrect, this book is nothing more than an opportunity for a militant feminist to spout her rantings. Our class noted an unbelievable error on p.150 in the book. It stated that 10 million soldiers fought for the Confederacy and that one-fourth of those soldiers (2.5 million) perished. This is ridiculous. At the time, only nine million people lived in the South, and on both sides only 600,000 people lost lives. The unfortunate student who takes this book at face value will believe that Molly Pitcher had a more significant role in the Civil War than did Ulysses S. Grant.

Sure, this book will give you a general idea of women's history. But it is full of generalities that are unexplained, unsophisticated, and sometimes just wrong. For an understanding of women's lot in America before the women's movement, I recommend Mary Beth Norton's \\"Liberty's Daughters\\", or Laura Ulrich's \\"Good Wives.\\" In these books you will find a much more nuanced telling of women's history, and a history that is footnoted to boot -- so we know where the author is getting her information."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Old Favorite","review":"This book was required reading for my first Women Studies Course in college .

Some highlights of the album:\\"No te vayas\\": Begins with a dramatic a capella prologue. \\"Angel\\": A Spanish language, salsa version of a song that was also recorded in English by Jon Secada. \\"No quedan lagrimas\\": A slower, gentler song; a good complement to the aggressive salsa style that characterizes many of the other songs. \\"Princesa\\": A wonderful romantic song that combines salsa style with musical elements that remind me of a 50s \\"doo wop\\" song. \\"No se que haria sin ti\\": In my opinion, the best song. Frankie tears into the material with joyful enthusiasm. This song also has wonderfully romantic lyrics.Overall, an excellent CD.

I didn't appreciate the preachy tone of this book either. I know it is important to broaden the horizons of the reader but Cavitches style was off-putting rather than transforming.

There is a great amount of information regarding the different types of oils and additives you can use. But, being a beginnger, I found the recipes waaay to intimidating and extremely large. I almost got turned off of soap making thinking that I would need a scale to measure lye to tenths of grams! (i.e. lye weight 567 7/10 gm) Also her recipes call for you to make batches of at least 40 bars each, an amount I was not interested in making.

It's more fun for me to make several small batches of soap for variety. It would have been more helpful had Cavitch included information on making half batches as well.The author uses no animal products in her soap, which may be a plus for some, but I find lard and tallow to make nice soaps for much less money.

Rose is just direct and captivating, providing a pathway for Simpson and Jones to follow while incorporating their unique artistic talents.

I continued casting 1/8th,1/4th and 1/2 ounce jigs. casts were all very short and again it came off the reel like a 20lb.

Yet, when I read this book, where the setting is in Kenya, I did get the feeling of the East African country. For example, most family do not hop into a car-they are too expensive- and go on a picnic. Also, when you do ride down the road in a matatu, you will not see giraffes lined along the street. Furthermore, the author had the family traveling to the lake. I had no problem with a family enjoying time together because families do that in Kenya. However, anybody who ever been to East Africa knows that most famous lake in Kenya in Lake Victoria(Ukerewe), a source of the white Nile river.

The Ship of the Law was made of the fragments of Earth. The crew of the ship are children who survived the death of Earth.The story begins slowly.

Still a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent X-Rated Sci-Fi...","review":"Personally, I found this book, overall, to be decent. This is mainly due to the theme of Earth's survivors getting revenge on the planet-killers, which I found quite interesting. However, the main story is not what struck me as memorable. Rather, Bear's ultra-graphic descriptions of sexual situations between the \\"children\\" is what I remember best. For a sci-fi novel, this is a shame. In fact, many of the sex scenes could be labeled X-rated. Obviously, I can't be explicit, but he describes EVERYTHING. Imagine an XXX film put into words and that's what you have.I realize that these situations are natural, but so is defication, and I don't need a description of that in detail (maybe in a Romance novel, but not hard sci-fi)!As a result, Bear's main story often got lost for a few pages while the \\"children\\" were pleasuring themselves.Maybe I'm too used to the Asimov/AC Clarke style of writing, but I just couldn't get into this book, mainly due to the excessive sex scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good technological/astronomical fiction, annoying characters","review":"First off let me say that the science part of the science fiction was very interesting.

However...The human interactions, and plot lines concerning the relationships of a few dozen adolescents packed into a confined space... were no more captivating to me than any other novel written in any other genre would be. I could not develop any attachment to any of the characters, and I found the dialogue tedious and the \\"fleshing out\\" of characters lacking.Finally: the person who said it could be a \\"Rated XXX\\" novel...

Anvil contains a lot of compelling ethical questions, and they already make it worth reading. Plus I found the main character (Martin, from Forge of God) sympathetic. I disagree with some of the previous readers on a couple of points: (1) I think the ending could actually have been more interesting if it were different (just the last 5 pages) and (2) I'm not sure what the reader who complained about homosexual sex was bothered by, in that my copy only seems to contain allusions to homosexual sex as having happened.Whatever. I'd definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a failed sequel","review":"Unlike the Forge of God which really kept me on the edge of my seat, and had me caught up in the emotions of the horrifying ending, this left me cold.

It slips on and off your belt without trouble yet I never had it slip off accidentally.This didn't matter to me but... if you want to slip your Palm in and out of the case while still on your belt, it is a bit cumbersome to flip open a hinged case while still on your belt.

The case is always, always slipping off the belt whenever you move! Then you stand up and the case falls from your lap onto the floor. I stopped using the case after it dropped to the floor and my Treo flew across the room. It happened too many times. Why doesn't the case have a belt loop so that the case stays securely on the belt? Why use a metallic clip that always slips loose? Also, as noted in other reviews, the case opens to less than 90 degrees which causes difficulties when the phone is ringing and you want to grab it quickly. The case can only be worn on your right side and opened conveniently with your right hand. The Treo can be easily scraped on the metallic closure fixture unless you're careful.

Something is lost in the translation here ... I've been ripped off!! While Elliott Smith's music deserves 5 stars, the piece of vinyl I received from Plain Recordings is unlistenable.

This is a brilliant album. Maybe it doesn't stand up to the monumental Either/Or, but it's strong. It's original, daring, and lovingly produced.To condemn this album based solely on it not being acoustic and slow, is idiotic and narrow-minded.You won't hear many albums like this. Making an album rich in sounds and in heart and feeling is the trickiest thing to do in music. It's always a balancing act between production and feeling. And I think Smith nailed a perfect pitch througout this album.If you have an open mind, listen to the album. If you don't, please just ignore it and stick to the old stuff.

Elliott - what happened?!? I realize that since signing on to Dreamworks, Smith has been able to make music at a production level he's for some time dreamed of playing with, and that his pop sensibilities have now been allowed to take flight. But with this new direction we lose the intimacy and also the edge that we've come to know with the first 3 LPs. That may sound like kind of a lame complaint, but in addition to that, I find the songwriting on this album downright atrocious. Think hard before you buy this.

Buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get over it","review":"Elliot has become a progressively better producer over the last decade but \\"Figure 8\\" proves that it has been at the expense of his songwriting skills. There is not one, Not One, track on here that ranks with his classics or even the average song from \\"XO\\". This is a dreary, bitter album that disgusts me as a former admirer of E. Smith; too many tracks seem to be jealous, snide attacks on other musicians who have sold out. I fail to see what other people see in this record. It just proves to me that today's college radio has become a glut of Good Old Boys who rule by the strength of past successes, current failures be damned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even one song could make it onto \\"XO\\"","review":"Elliott's previous effort, \\"XO\\", is far superior and possibly my all-time favorite CD. I can't describe my anticipation for \\"Figure 8\\" or my disappointment in the results, even after several listens. I really hope he gets back to the \\"XO\\" or \\"Either/Or\\" sound, preferably the former."},{"rating":"1","title":"A serious disappointment....","review":"About one week ago, a friend of mine came over and played Elliot's XO disc for me and I really liked it. A lot. And I'd heard snippets of the songs from Figure 8 on the web and thought they sounded pretty interesting.After buying and listening to Figure 8 a couple of times, I must say I'm very disappointed. The vocals are barely audible and the arrangements are so ridiculously complex that, even when I WAS trying to focus on what Elliot was singing, I couldn't make them out because everything else in the mix was so distracting. Now don't get me wrong...I DO like smart arrangements and good songwriting and that's what I heard on XO...but that's not what I found on Figure 8."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff!!!","review":"This is a terrific album. Buy it! If you're reading these reviews you obviously have some interest in this kind of music!Elliot and the Like! (Matthew Jay, Travis etc..) have come out of the shadows and in their quiet way are fast becoming a refreshing force in the music world... and to a degree being left alone to do their thing.Elliot's songs take me back to early Simon & Garfunkel, a little Brian Wilson, and undoubtedly Paul McCartney without a deliberate stealing! His writing reflects a similar poetic colloquialism that was very much in Paul Simon's early work! It's a welcome return!This collection of songs also show Elliot growing up without losing his root which made us all take notice in the first place!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very much the same","review":"Elliot Smith is very consistent.

Figure 8 was always the album I overlooked, and I regret that.

Otherwise, you could just post this, that would be neat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Wonderful, I LOVE this CD!","review":"Well, I don't understand why some people don't like this CD. So what if it's well-produced? I agree with the previous critic, is Abbey Road the worst Beatles album if well-produced means bad? This is the opposite of selling out, if he just tried to keep up his success by making another Either/Or or XO, then that would be selling out, but he remains innovative and makes great music. I've loved Elliott's music for some time now, and I don't see anything wrong with the way this album turned out. I'd recommend it to anyone, whether they're a fan of his previous work or not. This is a beautiful album, and every song on it has a life of its own. Buy it, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"**FRESH**","review":"When I first heard this song in a DC club I thought it was a a remix to \\"Fresh\\" by Daft Punk.

If you like this song, definitely check out Armand van Helden's You Don't Know Me and Phats and Small's Turn Around...these songs where hot all summer in Europe! peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"Anyone 25 and over will recognize the sampling of a much earlier tune which escapes me. However, the tune is eminently danceable. Not the hyper, \\"jumping-bean\\" type of dance music, more a funky, cool - chic, even - track. Seems to beckon all types to the dance floor. That said, the song is very simply constructed and uncomplicated. Track 1 is perhaps the best version - even track 2 as it's merely an extension or 1. But the simple recording is so tasty, the remixes pale in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Benchmark For All Subsequent House Music","review":"This album is to House what \\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\\" by Led Zeppelin is to Rock. No matter how many times you hear it it still sounds just as good as the first time you heard it. Does that mean it's The Perfect House Song? I'd say so... What, you're still sitting down at your computer? Well get up and go get this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stardust takes the cake","review":"Stardust, formed out of Daft Punk, a French band, have hit the jackpot with \\"The music sounds better with you\\".

The viseo for this song is excellent, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what good music is made of","review":"Ok folks. Most singles you buy, you listen to them for, say, 1-2 weeks tops, then they go on the shelf for awhile. And after listening to them 3 times in a row, you are sick of them. Not Stardust. This song simply kicks @$$. There's so much music and so many subtle changes in the tunes that I have yet to put it in my rack. I've had it about a month and a half and still listen to it for extended periods of time on a regular basis. And even though it's the same song over and over, it don't matter. It's just one of those songs you can't get tired of. Any if you've had good experiences with it on the dance floor, more power to ya. If you go to clubs, you know it, if you don't, check it out -- it's a genuine rarity"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"This is not real music! Absolute trash.

The concept, so I thought was a wonderful idea combining my love of gore, and strippers. But the dissappointment starts from the 1st scene and doesn't end until probably months after the credits have finished. I received this DVD as a gift(at my request) thinking what a great idea! For a movie to be produced, a large number of people have to think that it is a good idea. I truly hope that the group who thought that the Gore Gore Girls was a good idea are banned from using a movie camera for life."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first, and probably last, HG Lewis film I'll ever see.....","review":"This is the only Herschell Gordon Lewis film I've seen, and it will be the only one. It's pretty awful. I rented it because HG Lewis fans swear this is the best one, but it's just crappy, and, no, not good crap. The gore is actually pretty fake looking, and the performances here are damn abysmal. You're not expecting grade A award winning material here, but dammit it should be at least passable. The plot is just another run of the mill serial killer plot. There's really nothing worth seeing here. It was a chore to sit through this, but it taught me something worthwhile. I'm not a fan of Lucio Fulci, but his films are better than this one. I never thought I would say/write that."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been so much worse!","review":"Yes this movie was awful in every way. Bad acting by actors who were drunk or just some yahoo pulled off the street to say a line or two. Bad editing and no continuity what so ever. The effect could have been done by Mrs.Brown's third grade class from household items from around the kitchen. The movie may have been bad, so bad in fact it's fun to watch! Better than Ghost Dog that's for sure! This is just the perfect movie to sit around with a bunch of friends and have a good laugh. then pick up your camcorder and make your own better movie. This movie isn't a horror movie...unless you think about the clothing, but more of a comedy spoof. Want a big laugh. Watch the commentary the director thinks he's a genius. Now that's a hoot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE VULNERABLE SOULS READ THIS","review":"I have not seen the dvd edition of this film, in fact i have not watched it in years, but I have to add my voice to the reviews, This is a seriously scary film. it totally warped my brain when I saw it 6 years ago and I have still not recovered from watching it. I love my gore and gruesome films but this film did something awful to my mental health. If you are of a strong mental type then go ahead and watch it, HG Lewis never intended that his films would warp people but this film will never leave me. Even if it is wanky ancient special effects, the sheer brutality of this film is not to be underestimated. If you can handle it - go ahead by all means. I wish I could do so. But if you are a troubled soul don't bother. I have lasting nightmares.Even if HG Lewis didn't intend it, thats how it is........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This isn't even a good sleaze movie. Some one with black glovesis chopping up strippers in the cheesiest ways possib le. The goreeffects are really bad in this movie, this is about as realistic as spraying red Kool Aid everywhere. Pathetic gore effects, really horrible acting (that was expected), and really stupid jokes but the ending where the woman falls out of the window and her head gets ran over by a car is hilarious. You can tell its a watermelon.I can't believe this made it to DVD, its not even worth renting. Go get some real gore, see some Peter Jackson or Lucio Fulci movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the better HGL films","review":"Gore-hounds take note, \\"The Gore Gore Girls\\" is perhaps the most gruesome film made by Herschell Gordon Lewis. Of course, the viewer gets to witness some rather trashy strip sequences that contain more scares than the movie itself! Everything else is pretty standard: gross effects, bad acting (though there are a few surprises here, such as a guest appearance by \\"The King Of the One-Liners\\" Henny Youngman), and some absolutely awful directing! For the most part, I felt that this film was a meager step up from earlier Lewis films like \\"The Gruesome Twosome\\", and the jokes actually seemed more intentional this time!The DVD is a well-done project, featuring a wonderfully candid HGL interview/commentary that tells you everything you wanted to know, or didn't want to know, about \\"The Gore Gore Girls\\". The other extras, especially the Goddess Of Gore segment, are also interesting for early-gore film fanatics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banned in Australia?","review":"This film has been banned in Australia and will not have a dvd release. How the censorship board could find a badly made horror film from 1972, too graphic for public consumption is confusing. This film plays more like a comedy because of the bad production values (yes gore also), why is this unavailable to adults? Yes, there is violence against women, but have the censors seen the brutal violence on display in \\"Irreversible\\"? Have they released the dvd? Yes!What is happening to our freedom of choice?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trinity Twin Pack (They Call Me Trinity / Trinity is Still My Name) (1971)","review":"It is still a good flic even though some of it was cut out and i could still remember the parts 20 years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absurdly funny","review":"I never watched Westerns as a kid, so my recent introduction to the Trinity movies was a real treat. These movies aren't of the best quality (production-wise), but I understand from other reviews that this particular version is far superior to any others out there. But the stories are hilarious, and everyone in my family loved them - from my 60-ish dad on down to my 8-year-old little sister. Trinity's laziness is legendary, his filth is unparalleled, and these movies can't really be compared to anything other than Blazing Saddles.

The packaging is pretty good and a master list of all the sketches per episode are included for each season. It's helpful if you're looking for a particular sketch.

Lord Tyndale, his guardian, is investigating the sisters, to determine whether Prudence is a worthy match for his cousin. He finds himself more and more interested in Charity. Do I need to tell you that it all ends happily?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A time warp and back again!","review":"George N. Park's is my idol, and when I read this book (cover to cover in one sitting) I was amazed. He starts off with a trip back in time to what the art of drum majoring is all about, then slowly brings you to now with tips and tactics on everything you need to know. From conducting, to commands, to whistle use, even down to how to wrap a mace, Parks has it all. From the book alone, you learn how to be the best drum major you can be. With one of his Drum Major Acadamy experiences (2 years for me and running) it's a perfect way to become one of the best.

The problem is that Cochrane tries too hard to make things appear simpler than they are. In particular, when using random variables he switches without much warning between treating them just like scalars and treating them as members of a vector space. When doing the latter he does not explicitly mention that the inner product he is using is x.y = E(xy) and not the usual Euclidean dot product. The proofs are sketchy and full of hand-waving. With enough care and effort and a sufficiently thorough mathematical background you can convince yourself that everything turns out to be right at the end, but if you are going to put in that much of an investment you may as well read Duffie'sDynamic Asset Pricing Theorywhich is much more precise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typos","review":"I don't think most of this people who reviewed this book actually read this book.

Then an elephant comes along dressed as a Princess and they all have fun. My older kids noticed that the elephant has a boy voice, but he's dressed up as a Princess...

However, it doesn't last. I have had this on my desk since August - as of October 27, I have had to throw mine away. It was irretrievably jammed. My husband and I both had a go at it but couldn't get the staple tray to open now matter how many levers and joints we tweaked and tugged. This wasn't the first time it had jammed; over the past couple months of use, it had jammed severely twice - the staples didn't come through cleanly and sometimes got twisted. I could always open the staple drawer and pull it out with tweezers or staple remover. The third time's the charm I guess, and now it won't unjam at all. Apparently it doesn't have the stamina to last 2 months. Perhaps I got a lemon? Still, I guess it's back to the cheaper manual stapler for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"I own both these and the Sennheiser pxc300's. The Sennheisers win hands down, The Sennheisers also cost about 7 times as much. These Kensingtons are much larger and cover more of the ears, but nowhere near the noise-killing quality of the others. (but the price is also much less) These kill a little bit of noise, but they introduce a hiss.. basically, it is like turning Dolby NR off and hearing the hiss (if you remember those days). I will use these around the house to watch vids on my machine, but when I am sitting in the back row of a MD80 next to a P&W..I am not gonna use these. No problems with weight or comfort. Sound is good enough. Cellular interference is awful. So.. were they worth the price? yeah, but not too functional as noisekillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"I 'm happy with these headphones.","review":"The price was right and they've worked well in noisy environments. I travel for work and they've helped with airplane noise and background noise in airports, etc. I find them to be comfortable. The only downfall is their size. They fold down to be pretty compact, but they definitely aren't as small as earbuds.Note: Don't forget to turn them off when you put them away, or you will go through a lot of AAA batteries.

There is a switch for on/off but there is no difference in the sound background sound in either setting.

Not at all. It only reduces background noises such as fan noise. The battery didn't last a week even though I turned them off every time I went home, except once -- next morning the battery was dead and noise cancellation wasn't working. Sometimes when noise cancellation is ON I would hear a sudden loud sound, like a horn, lasting half a second -- not a good feeling. There is also sound leakage -- other people can hear what you're listening.Overall, this product isn't up to 21st century standards: noise cancellation technology have existed at least a decade, and such flaws aren't excusable. The headphones should turn off automatically when aren't in use to extend battery life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing performance","review":"After reading many reviews about these headphones, I was quite excited to order them. However, I was very disappointed once I received them. In my opinion, these headphones did a very poor job cancelling out background noise.

I haven't flown with them yet but using them while cutting my grass told they are very comfortable and seem to lack that somewhat annoying hiss ever present in lower priced n/c headphones. I think by now most purchasers of these type of headphones know they don't completely shut out the outside world but these do a much better job of that than most. I'll reserve a 5 star rating for the $299-$349 Bose but these actually are a 4*+!Very nice product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing quality for a fair price","review":"I've never really been a sound snob, so simple ear bud headphones have been my routine, but I got sick of not being able to hear stuff with ear buds if I was mowing the lawn or using a snowblower.I bought these a couple of months ago and love them. I have a REALLY loud snowblower and I was amazed at how well I could hear while snow blowing the other day. I listen to podcasts on my iPod, and spoken word was always impossible to hear while doing anything noisy. But these headphones make it so that even the loudest noises become a very low hum while the music or spoken word comes through really great without seeming too loud.Like I say, this is my first pair of noise-cancelling headphones I've ever owned so I can't compare them other brands, but I'm very impressed at this pair and how the outside noises are greatly reduced or eliminated."},{"rating":"2","title":"They work great","review":"Great deal for the money.

The Kensington noise cancelling headphones were another matter. The first time I used them in flight (on a 17hour non-stop to Africa) they broke at the right hand hinge and no amount of effort was I able to make a satisfactory repair. Most disappointing. On closer examination back home, it was apparent that the hinge was of an inferior design and,in my opinion, was not fit for purpose. Very disappointing. To return them from where I stay in South Africa is not an option as the postage would exceed the cost of the original purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice headphones for the price","review":"These headphones are pretty nice. They cancel out alot of the noise, I had some f16's flying over last night and it canceled out the roar of the engines. I think they will do the trick for what I bought them for which is beeing able to hear what I'm watching on an airplane. I'm sure this is better out there but for the price these can't be beat. They are comfortable (i wore them for 4 hours last night and barely knew they were on). They are portable with a good pouch to store them in. I'm happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like the ones from Sharper Image","review":"A few years ago I bought noise cancelling headphones from Sharper Image for $50. Recently the cords were in a terrible accident involving sharp cat teeth. Very upset I tried to find them again online. While I couldn't get them from Sharper Image, I stumbled upon these from Kensington. Exact same headphones except there was now a blue piece on them but the price was now $20 less! I really like these headphones. I have been using them for years everywhere - buses, cars, waiting rooms, home, gym, by the pool, in a park, and airplanes. I do notice an odd tinny noise if I try to use these with tape players or turn on the noise cancelling without listening to anything. Otherwise, with CD players, DVD players and MP3 players I have really enjoyed them. I find that most sound is blocked and the quality of sound is excellent. They work perfect for my needs. If you don't want to pay $300 for a pair of Bose and your needs aren't extensive get these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect a miracle","review":"Bottomline is, they are below average in noise cancellation and somewhat at the average in sound quality. I took them on a plane once, they did nice job in cancelling the plane's low-frequency humming, but I still could hear my neighbors very clearly. The best usage I find for them is while working in my home office to suppress disctructing outside noises.There's also a concern about quality, the rubber strip that goes around the top of a head ripped off after only a year. After inspecting the way it was attached I figured out I would have given up anyway even if it treated them if they were golden.I guess the only attractive part in these headphones is the way they collapse.

They fold so they are easy to store in the briefcase. They work either with your mp3 player/ cd player/ computer or the airplane system.

I now remove the battery when not in use, and it is fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product; exactly what I was looking for at amazing price","review":"These headphones are great! I'm a college student, so I was looking for an affordable pair of noise canceling headphones, and I got exactly that. I only paid $30, but these headphones fulfill the same functions as a pair of $300 headphones. They only require 1 AAA battery which is actually included in the package. Even without the noise canceling option turned out, the headphones do a very good job blocking out outside noise. The sound quality is also fantastic; with high-quality bass, etc. They are adaptable to the normal outlet as well as the 2-prong outlets you find on airplanes. Also, you are able to fold them up; and they come with a carrying case. The ear part is very comfortable, not putting too much pressure on your ears, and adapting to heads of different shapes and sizes.Pretty much, I am extremely pleased. Thank you, Kensington!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly worthless","review":"I am prompted to write this review as I am have just thrown these headphones in the trash.

They work great when not using the noice cancellation function.

There are probably better sources for this.I would also point out that the book discusses theories about the \\"true\\" identity of some of the Egyptian pharaohs; i.e.; King David, Solomon, Jesus, etc. This is merely the latest in a long list of theories about Egypt, some of which are plausible, and some of which have no foundation (such as this).

The next four chapters focus on four different hunter-gatherer cultures and what roles women play within them.Frankly, the only flaw is how short it was.

It's much more interesting than all the many 1960's folk versions, even the original byIan and Sylvia-- and yes, even the one byThe Chad Mitchell Trio.As for the rest of the album, it's fine and special. Because most of the songs were recorded in different years, with different musicians, in different studios, it is left to John Denver to provide consistency and over the dozen years here he does very well. It is indeed jarring when the ballads give way to the ouside enthusiasm of the funny rowdy songs but that's why we have shuffle. Although I LIKE those cowboy songs. It's a good collection and I'm glad to have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"The author misses many significant changes from the 2002 to the 2005 NEC.Article section 110.26(C)(2) has wording from the 2002 NEC rather than the 2005 NEC.The author calls attention to revised wording in Article section 210.12(B) of the 2005 NEC, but then is inaccurate in his paraphrase of the exception because of his choice of the word \\"or\\" to replace the word \\"and\\".In Article 250 the author calls attention to only two of the twenty signifcant changes from the 2002 to the 2005 NEC."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST GUIDEBOOK EVER WRITTEN-DANGEROUS!","review":"DO NOT EVEN LOOK AT THIS VILE,PESTILENT BOOK!

I wasted days getting lost from this awful book, as he yakked endlessly about flora, fauna, and geology. Meanwhile, you the sucker stand there at unmarked trail intersections getting no help.

It doesn't mention preparation, weather, seasons, services, rest stops, food drops, transportation...nothing. I quickly shelved this book and moved on to Ray Jardine's bible of the PCT.

Most notable is the intro to, and the bridge of \\"54-46 Was My Number\\", both being completely ommited. Many of the edits eliminate the R&B and gospel influenced parts of the tracks that make Toots and Maytals unique.I would reccomend instead of this collection, you should try \\"20th Century Masters, The Best of Toots & The Maytals, The Millenium Collection\\" The edits are not present, and song choices are better (contains all the great songs the previous reviewer reccomended)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A near-perfect introduction to the wonderful music of Toots","review":"Toots Hibbert is a reggae/ska forefather whose infusion of American rhythm and blues into the sounds of reggae have earned him a respectable following. It's unfortunate that Toots is not as popular as he should be. His music is infectious, danceable, intense fun and should be heard by anyone who loves reggae and R&B. This collection may not be his best, but it's the only one I have. It contains some of his best cuts, like \\"54-46 That's My Number,\\" his wonderful cover of \\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\\" and \\"Pressure Drop,\\" which is stunning in its simplicity but is quite plainly one of the most irresistibly catchy songs I've ever heard. Unfortunately, the disc is marred by a few cheesy keyboard-driven early-eighties cuts, apparently in an effort to cover Toots' entire career. No matter. Skip the cheese and concentrate on the good stuff...you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"My barber uses this, it's an amazing machine.","review":"Closest comparison to a razor without the razor bumps!

The Master Clipper is bigger than this trimmer, but rather heavy. I decided to try this trimmer out to see if it was a bit less tiring. It is definitely more manageable. However, the teeth are rather smaller than the Master Clipper, so with curly beard hair it takes several passes to get everything clipped where the Master Clipper generally gets everything on the first pass.

Its filled with truly practical advice from a very experienced pediatrician.

This man obviously has lost his license to practice. I turned to this book because I do not vaccinate my children and I was looking for alternatives to modern medicine. Instead of finding ANY usefull information, I was struck by the sheer stupidity of this man. He says not to worry if your child has a fever of 105.

I have to wonder if Dr. Mendelsohn truely believes what he professes, or if this is just another extremist approach to sell a book. I am sure that anyone who reads this book will form an opinion--either that all doctors are opportunistic child abusers or that all parents who want to dicuss integrative ways to treat their child are lunatics.

But where bands like Electric Wizard have succeeded, this is where Sahg's music fails. It simply doesn't grab your attention. Sure, the standard and in-your-face nature of the compositions here might win fans of the old-school doom bands, but doom bands- being limited to the options they have-often struggle to create something that will expand an already limited sub-genre. Sahg does create at times some good moments in their music, but the rest of the music is simply stuff we've heard before. Doom fans will most likely devour this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show over priced set","review":"I have found similar sets for a fraction than what's being asked for here.

This book focuses mostly on Africa in the 20th century, which, for most of the continent saw the last decades of colonialism and first decades of independence. Davidson draws on lessons learned over a lifetime to describe the nation-state both in Africa and Europe (a surprising amount of the book describes the advent of the European nation-state). He also describes many personal experiences from decades spent studying Africa. This is one of many fine books by one of the 20th century's best historians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to find the gold dust","review":"I echo many of the comments in the above 3 star reviews but wish to add that this is one of the most poorly written books I have forced my way through in many years.

Tom and Danny share a wide range of musical styles, and much of it is tamer than the title might suggest. Don't get me wrong - this is a terrific CD. There's plenty of smart, tasteful guitar throughout, as you'd expect from two such bonafide musicians. There are some smooth jazz and jump numbers, R&B sounding tracks, blues-ish efforts, country-tinged ballads, and a little rock. Neither of these guitarists have ever settled on a single style, so it's not surprising that this collaboration is a little all over the place too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aswad/Awesome","review":"The first time i ever heard this CD was in California, I was at a party and my friend had suggested Reggae music.I myself did not want to hear any Reggae music especially a band named Aswad and he told me how do you know if you don't like it if you haven't even heard it yet.Well to make a long story short he put the CD on and i was totally blown away.I had never heard Reggae music sound so perfect coming from his speakers.I knew right there and then.I was now an Aswad fan and i spent my entire next day searching for this disc.Believe you me,If you've never been to a reggae concert in your life.Buy this CD.take it home and crank it as loud as you can.Believe me it will be like if you were there live at the Notting Hill Gate Carnival 1983.Oh yea don't forget to buy a referee whistle to blow during the songs.

I hesitated and then said I would call Amazon first. I did. The first thing the rep. said after my story was, \\"would you like a refund or another presenter?\\" I said another presenter. He said \\"It's on its way.\\" I had to ask if he wanted the other one returned. He said \\"OK... Let me give you a number to access and you can print off a return label.\\" No charge. No hassle.

Without the tape, when I stopped, the whole thing would come out of the dash about an inch or so. This is probably a defect with MY car and not the kit seeing as how my car is a '99.

Be aware that yes, there is a lot of material on here that is old. Basically stuff you might have seen Jerry perform on an HBO special back in like 1982. I think since he regrettably never released a stand up record before he decided to use a lot of this to preserve it on a CD. That in conjunction with the fact that he might not have had that much new material. I wish he had vintage stuff of him recorded from small comedy clubs back in the 80s. I always prefer on a comedy record that it is performed in a small club as opposed to a huge arena or hall. You definitely lose all of the intimacy that I think makes for the best stand up comedy experience. All in all since this is Jerry's one and only comedy record it is certainly worth checking out, let's face it a mediocre Jerry output is better than a lot of comedians best stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic comedy, pure classic comedy.","review":"Jerry Seinfeld hit the big time when he did this totaly humor filled comedy routine.

They also have slots in the end so you can easily use a screwdriver on them if you want.The first time I ordered this cable, the vendor sent me the wrong one and I had to re-order from another vendor.

It really gets on to your nerves. I played a whole season, every match, so that I will get used to the passing. But no, i conclude it is the game developers' mistake, not mine.

It is difficult to find unbiased reporting on life in Cuba because most people have very strong feelings about this island. Cramer carefully considers all opinions but actually talks to the people who live there. He doesn't just interview those who love Castro -- in fact, most think Castro should step down. He interviews people who feel that Cuba is racist and those who feel that the \\"social experiment\\" has eliminated racism. The book is very intellectually honest which is rare any work but especially one on Cuba. Cramer demonstrates why he is horserace betting's most effective writer. He can teach while he tells amazing stories.Cramer has written a fascinating look at an amazing island."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Disappointment","review":"I am a big Susan Mallery fan, especially her longer novels.

This disappointment could be nullified if the book were better, but sadly it is not. The plot line is boring, the writing is not up to her normal standard and the characters lack their normal spark.

It has it everything -- the struggle and sacrifices of writing professionally, heartfelt tributes, horror convention adventures, and a plethora of fascinating characters. I can't wait for volume two. Although I enjoyed reading Brian Keene's zombie books, I'm surprised how much more I like his non-fiction. He really has a natural ability to speak the truth, no matter how much it hurts. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WE HELP MOMMY","review":"I had these books when I was a child and bought them for my own children who are now grown. I've lost them in moving over the years and I'm buying them again for my own grandchildren to grow up with and love too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable book","review":"Both my 4 year old boy and 2 year old girl LOVE this book. It is really sad that my family has to read books from the 50s to find examples of a loving caring family working together in their God given roles. This book does not have any religious themes, but does show children being caring and respectful to their mother and father. Also it shows parents being thankful and greatful that they have such well behaved and helpful kids. All in all if we could put 21st century convenances together with this book's examples of good old common since and work ethic this world would be perfect!Chilren enjoy reading this book because of the love and thankfulness that this book pours out on the sweet respectful and helpful chilren in it's pages. It also teaches children simple ways to fulfill their role in the family. Parents get a lesson in child training and how important it is to be positive, calm, and loving in dealing with our little preschoolers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the cover so much that I ordered another!","review":"Product is much better than expected. Cover is nice and has a lot of room. Length is about 6 ft so good size to cover most umbrellas and material appears of good quality that will last for a couple of years for sure. I would have liked a different color other than pearl (for dirt reasons) but it looks great and is an excellent deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"If it aint broke, don't fix it","review":"So, So happy i am with this 28th release of GU. The sound of Progressive House has proven it's uniqueness, and the reason for this is that progressive sound came about from a natural evolution of House music's different flavors. It was not forced to be, it just came to be, which is unlike the tech/electro sound that everyone is trying to force on us including Sasha, who happens to be one of my favorite DJs. Nick Warren knew this and he was absolutely right to stick with it instead of jumping on the band wagon with the rest of the (LET'S MAKE THE NEXT BIG SOUND DJs); like Anthony Pappa with his Balance release (awful), Sasha with his fundacion release(poor), Chris fortier with his Balance CD (what the heck was that), James Zabiela (please no) and many others.On to the GU28......well, WOW.Just get it, listen to it and listen to it again.

The Limited Edition (Long) Set may be worth the few extra bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only the contents were as good as its packaging","review":"I found this to be much more 'techy' than progressive.

I'd probably give this away if it was not for the inner sleeve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice timing","review":"I appreciate the timely arrival of the book, one I had trouble finding. I will definitely do business with this seller again as I am a collector of the Ballantine series. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"For anyone who has read the classic Pomeroy series 'Grand Prix Cars', this book will be a disappointment. Pomeroy set the standard by describing what made each particular winning car successful. Whether it be dual the overhead camshaft engine in the 1912 Peugot or the extremely light ladder frame and nitro-benzene powered engine of the 1934 Mercedes. Each of these chapters gave the reader a thorough understanding of what secret breakthrough made the car quickest.None of that is in this book. Systems described in detail are those that are the norm for F1 design. There are several areas where Wright states explicitly that he isn't allowed to describe the unique 'secret' aspects of the Ferrari that set it above its competition. Without that insight, this is nothing more than a pretty photo album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for every Formula One enthusiast","review":"This book is very well put together with a right blend of images & text. Covers every aspect involved in designing & building a formula one car with a focus on the Ferrari F1-2000.Being an engineer I would have loved it to be bit more technical but there are a lot of other books that achieve this. This book is for any enthusiast introducing himself to the technical aspects of a modern F1 car.Keeps away complex equations & explains everything in simple & elegant manner.I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album","review":"Hurl was one of my favorite bands back in the day. They just had a really interesting, unboring approach to rock without getting too out and unlistenable. This album is good because above all it exemplifies a true BAND: a true BAND is one that plays as a unified whole, and the playing is GOOD at that. On that note, the chimey altered guitar tuning is great, as is the \\"metal pipes\\" bass (for some odd reason, I always associate heavy water pipes colliding with each other with the tone of the bass guitar in tunes by Hurl).And Bob Weston engineered it, as with the rest of their LP's.Amen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Matter","review":"Isles is a great writter.

Seems like something James Patterson (quantity vs quality) would do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't buy this old book with a new title.","review":"If even one person is fooled into buying this book then it is a shame. This book is the Footprints of God book that Iles released a few years ago. Iles is probably one of my favorite authors and all of his books are great, except this one. I don't know whose idea it was to rerelease an old book with a new title to try and sucker people into buying the same book twice. I hope it wasn't the author's idea. In conclusion, this is a rerelease of \\"The Footprints of God,\\" written only a few years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Matter","review":"I have every book by Greg Iles.

I cannot say that I was disappointed with the book and there are many interesting parts to it. The first is of course the fact that the book raises questions as to the relationship between science and spirituality. this is of course an old question and remains still unanswered. The other part I did enjoy was the study it makes of relationship between Government and Industry.In this instance the NSA has contracted a corporation to build a revolutionary type of computer. The coterie of bureaucrats, businessmen and even scientists involved in the project are bound together by vested interests, which at time vary. Hence in this story it is not clear which group has the upper hand and whose agendas will prevail."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Description","review":"From Back Cover:Amanda Roberts was ignoring the rules every woman knows.

But this rendezvous promised to boost her ego with the hottest story of her reporting career. Amanda's anonymous source was supposed to deliver the goods on a crooked fast-lane bank operating in slow-paced Atlanta, where it was allegedly breaking trade embargoes and brokering big bucks arms deals. Amanda found her finacial \\"Deep Throat\\" joining the dead in the graveyard, his account closed forever.

You can hear the whistle, I have tried to adjust it but it still makes noise. There are few directions on how to adjust or use the whistle. I would not buy one again. I have had it for about a month and it has been laying in a drawer most of that time. The shipping was fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Function as Directions Indicate","review":"The directions on the package say to turn the adjustment screw until an audible pitch is heard and then to continue to twist until the tone disappears.

The whistle I received is without the dust cover. As far as the whistle it works fine BUT the adjustable nut can unscrew very easy and I have lost many whistles in the field. The dust cover usually has a tight fight keeping the nut in place.I give this ONE STAR because the seller should not show a picture w/dust cover if they are selling or sending a different whistle."},{"rating":"1","title":"whistle DID NOT WORK-waste of money","review":"Threw it away....tried to adjust it numerous times ...never worked.

The frame feels more in balance even on uneven surfaces, and the braking system is unique from the other two, and hopefully more substantial (Time will tell.) Also the wheels have flat surfaces (rather than tapered) so the sense of stability is more acute. It comes with a carry basket, which will do when needed. I prefer the under seat storage on my HUGO Elite, which comes in a very close 2nd, with its excellent customer service. Both are available at Amazon.com at very affordable prices.The worst experience is with DRIVE Medical Design's D-Lite 750 because of a very sub-standard parts and repair service policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works OK, but there is a problem.","review":"Bought this item to replace a walker without wheels and this item works okay but there is a problem with no apparent solution. The material that the grips on the handlebars are made of has an extremely foul odor that you cannot get rid of. The odor is so profuse that it can make you ill feeling and it rubs off on your hands. I contacted customer service at the manufacturer, Invacare, and they were aware of the problem but had no suggestions to correct the problem. Even though they had been aware of this problem for a period of time no action had been taken to correct it, such as, a change in material. They only said to live with it and eventually the odor would wear off.

But the cross bar on the bottom is bolted on both ends, and I had 1 end snap off after about a week.

Smelling and initially feeling pleasant, the lipsticks still have poor overall performance compared to non-hypoallergenic brands.While it may be hypo-allergenic, this specific option would be of little good if the product continously has to be reapplied and it readily melts in room-temperature settings where the product was reasonably expected to remain solid. Attempting to apply a perpetually half-melted lipstick wastes valuable time, and definently did not make me feel beautiful.I have the option of using other brands, but imagine this product's performance is a big disincentive for people who actually must be selective about makeup brands. Surely these same people are entitled to a product actually performing well?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most powerful book i've ever read","review":"This book has hit me so hard like a tonne of bricks..his whole life story is amazing & inspirational,his words are very powerful as are his sermons he offers after each chapter.After reading this,my whole outlook of this world from my perspective has changed,i would like to follow in mason betha's footsteps,wash out all the evil things that are in my life today, & start living for god."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Message of Love","review":"Revelations was an excellent book.

I am really proud of his decision and I pray that he continues to do well in Gods work. For any one who is thinking about reading this book, don't think no more and just buy it.

The contributor really allowed Mason to express himself. This book was written the way I would imagine a conversation with him. I could almost hear him speaking as I read.

I am glad that I read this book, I always knew that there was something special about him. I see his love and dedication to God in his words."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT READING","review":"I Absolutely fell in love with this book! I recommended it to everyone I new. This book touch my heart and my spirit. God truly had a plan for him the minute he was born, but let him do his thing(the rapping)until God was ready to change his life. It is such a great example of life's journey, that everthing that we experience has a purpose. I would give this book to every high school kid if I could.

Thanks for the walk down memory lane!It's a great great thing when young black men declare their love for God and his son Jesus Christ.

I guess when you are at peace with a higher power, what the world thinks honestly doesn't matter. I have written an encouraging teenage novel that will go hand and hand with this book.

May God continue to bless him, and I am well on my way to reaching today's youth too! \\"Keep doing what you are doing Mr. Betha, Most of the young brothers in the industry want to do what you have done but for some reason... they don't know that the devil has a way of blessing people too!.

It is only 200 pages long with large print. I finished it in a day. I'm an emcee myself so I was interested in why Mase would leave rap so suddenly to follow God. I respect him for that no doubt but he spends most of this book preaching and the rest completely trashing hip-hop as a product of the devil. He rambles on saying things like \\"What if Tupac and Biggie had been pastors\\" and so on. The book doesn't deserve to be called a biography/autobiography because if you take away the preaching and the anti-hiphop rants the book would be about 10 pages long. Don't waste your money...if you're like me and were just interested in why he made the move from music to the church then get it at the libary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational Till The Last Page","review":"This book is an amazing read. Mason says he'll mever return to rap, but he has. I'm not insulting this decision at all. I think his religious life will now help him spread the good word through music. Now to the book.The book was inspirational to the very end. I am a fan of Mase's music and that's why I bought this book. His story is so amazing. He came from nothing and became a major selling rapper, only to drop it all for God. I personally love the ways God showed him that he wasn't supposed to be a rapper at that time.The main point is this book is amazing and I suggest everyone needs to get this and get his return album, \\"Welcome Back\\", when it hits stores Aug. 24."},{"rating":"1","title":"none","review":"Only if there was a preview/some kind of introduction of the book, I could have bought it and then maybe written a review.

The author explains here many of the political concepts that lie at the foundation of disputes not only between Saudi Arabia and many in the West, but also between Saudi Arabia and many of its Islamic critics who argue that \\"monarchy\\" is incompatible with Islam, and with democracy. In a very in-depth discussion of the system of \\"Majlis al Shurah\\" or Consultative Council,and how it works to achieve representation, Dr. Al-Saud explains how traditional Islamic institutions are being modernized to meet the needs of a younger, better educated, and more politically astute Saudi Arabia. The book does not talk enough about issues like elections, and women's rights, yet, it is a welcomed discussion, and one that I believe most Middle East political observers, and analyst will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"If you are a Cape Bretoner,or just love the Island and are interested in it's history,then this is the book to read.A little hard to understand some of the phrasing(old english I suppose),but very informative.....up to 1869 anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get real, you illiterates!","review":"This book was compelling enough that I am writing this review several years after having read it as I go order a copy for a sailor friend. Does it win top literary awards in any category? No. Will it walk away with the Booker prize? Hardly. Is it a FABULOUS read while on vacation or when wanting a brief respite from the grind. You bet! I think I'll read it again. And if you haven't, so should you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A first-class techno-sf thriller.","review":"A sweeping story that never loses the narrative thread. There's a lot going on in Mother of Storms, but it always makes sense, and you don't feel overwhelmed with scene-changing the way you do in many books. It's such a good book that I've found it hard to read his \\"Timeline Wars\\" series because it's so much weaker by comparison. If I hadn't read \\"Mother of Storms\\" I probably wouldn't mind, but since I have those books seem shallow and uninteresting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Cyberpunk Novel not by Gibson or Stephenson","review":"Calling Mother of Storms a cyberpunk novel is a bit inappropriate, as it is also a fine plain old hard SF novel in the Fred Pohl (Gateway) tradition. This is one of the most memorable novels I've consumed in the 1990s, and probably the first (I read Snow Crash later :) that made me go \\"hmm.\\" It turned me into a voracious and loyal consumer of John Barnes prose, and I haven't regretted it. But Barnes is a tricky fellow to pin down. He writes in several different styles; heck, he might be several different people. Perhaps it's narrowminded to expect someone to always write the same old same old. I don't mind that he doesn't. Not at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross Fantasy Unrelated to Description","review":"I was interested based on the description. An end of the world story... what I got was a bunch of non-topical man checking women out and much worse treatment to women that was pointless and didn't at all further the plot of the story.Much better end of the world battle stories out there. Go look for those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off exciting and slowly peters out.","review":"This book begins with an exciting and plausible premise of tremendous storms hurling across the world. Unfortunately, the author departs from the storms to bring in dozens of semi-relevant characters, lots of politics, ridiculous sex, and turns the book into a mess. While the storm scenes were written well, by the end of the book I didn't care who lived or died or evolved or how the crisis would be resolved. This book has a lot less to do with storms than a mishmash of the author's ideas that might be better explored separately in a number of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting subplots drown good science fiction","review":"In some ways I liked this book. The stuff about the hurricane was pretty cool. But the endless, tiring subplots about VR child porn and the one orgasm-per-page average got really tiring and downright disgusting. If he had kept the book down below 350 pages and eased up on the endless sexual escapades, I might have liked this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this book really sucks!","review":"This inane, silly novel begins slowly and and then proceeds to go downhill. If you are into cartoonish, unrealistic sex, this novel is for you. All the characters act and sound the same. The science in this novel is ridiculous, and the preposterousness of the ending will simply annoy you. This is one of those books that you wished that you had never invested any time or money in. Since I cannot get back my time or money, I can at least warn other readers how bad this book truly is. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly science, not plausible","review":"This book starts out as a good complex science fiction thriller, set in the very near future, but as it goes along the science becomes sillier and sillier, to the point that it is no longer possible to \\"suspend disbelief\\" and stay interested in the science. Which forces you to fall back on the characterizations which are, as is usual for sci-fi and pop stuff, pretty flat. I tossed the book without finishing it. Two stars because the author did have some good story ideas going in, and a couple of the storm scenes were quite gripping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possible triggers.","review":"This book has possible triggers for rape survivors.I will update this review once I am done with the book, but I thought this was important to get out there.I haven't finished this book and I won't finish this book. The one star rating remains. It's trash. Boring for the most part, with flashes of horrible rape scenes and sexual fantasies. I even flipped to the half of the book and promised myself that if there were no sex scenes or rape scenes for three pages I would continue with the book. Instead I was instantly at a page of a graphic rape scene. The author has been married three times. Somehow, after reading this, I'm not surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly organized and written","review":"This book is one of the worst I have ever started to read (\\"started\\" because I couldn't finish it). At first glance, the plot sounds interesting; but upon actually reading the text, it is lost in a miasma of cardboard characters and uninteresting subplots. The author goes on at great length about a wholly unbelievable technology (which allows one person to experience another's experiences), much to the detriment of the story. On top of this poor organization, the writing itself is amateurish -- not at all helped by being entirely in present tense, as if the author is hoping to distract the reader from the weak plot and characters. There have been very few books which I've started and been unwilling to finish, but this is one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borring, waste of my time and my money!","review":"First I got this book because it was suggest that I buy it because I brought \\"Heavy Weather\\" and I thought okay I bite for it. Boy, I was wrong with this novel, totally borring and so borring that I couldn't get past the first 20 pages of the novel.Another thing that I didn't like about how John Barnes writes is the fact that his chapters are extremely long, he dose not break up like the rest of other authors do."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the edge, but a terrific hard-science SF read","review":"On the surface Mother of Storms is a tale of climatological disaster writ large. What I found more fascinating and engaging though were the incredible evolutions in technology Barnes proposes, and the geopolitical changes occuring up to and throughout the story. Barnes draws very plausible and I think subtle rationale to each of the political and technological changes in Storms. I will spare the reader here the details, as I don't want to deprive you of the excitement of discovering each nugget. However, Barnes outperforms his peers at extrapolating from the world of today and creating a surprisingly believable world of tomorow. I highly recommend Mother of Storms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic machine! Price is too high","review":"This is a fantastic notebook! The 15\\" display is beautiful, the ATI Radeon 9000 allows you to play the latest games, and the build quality is excellent (these Powerbooks are made by the same company that makes high end Dell laptops). In my mind this is the only G4 to get. At 1GHz you have more than enough cpu horsepower, however if you start going much below this, the venerable G4 starts to show its age. I strongly suggest you don't buy a Powerbook unless you can afford at least an 800MHz machine (and that is entry level only!). I also feel Apple should reduce the price on these by a third. I know from my job pretty much dead on what they pay to have them built, and it is *well* below a grand. I think a 200%+ markup is not warranted. You could buy a much more powerful P4 system for this money (of course then you're stuck with Windows). Apple should try to be a little more competitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Machine!","review":"This computer does it all and is great for anything that you can throw at it. The speed on this computer is fantastic, I use all my graphic programs on it including photoshop, quark, and illustrator, and it runs very smooth. You will be very happy with this machine. Also the screens large format size is perfect for watching movies when you are away from your tv on the road, or anywhere. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a computer with power and the portability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Clothes Steamer","review":"It produces great steam, just in big clouds that are better suited for getting wrinkles out of clothes instead of cleaning bath and kitchen. I steam scrubbed my bathtub, grout on bath floor, bath walls, kitchen sink, drip pans on the stove, and outdoor chairs. For the bath, the steam didn't do anything elbow grease couldn't do. The drip pans are better with a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser. The outdoor chairs were actually pretty good with the Lysol concentrated and scrubby sponge. It did power through deep down dirt and bird poo, but evaporated so quickly, the dirty soapy foam dried in place. I had to rinse the chairs off to get them completely clean.However, my sister's linen blouse came out great after some quick blasts of steam from the naked nozzle, much better than the actual clothes steamer she purchased. Plus it came with a bottle of Lysol concentrate, so not a complete loss. But as far as actually doing what it is advertised to do, pretty useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"returned unit replacement just as bad","review":"bought orginal steamer a year ago afer four months did not work even after de calcifying unit sent the unit back it was replaced and this one again only lasted four month am in the process of decalcifying again but i have little hope of it ever being a great cleaning tool which can be used longer than four months would never bother buying another one or even exchanging it again pris reynolds"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable product \\"performance\\" and/or quality...","review":"Recently purchased this item latter part of Dec 2007. It's going back as soon as a return authorization is obtained. This unit is big and bulky and does NOT lend itself well to being a very useful \\"handheld\\", everyday tool, and I found it's accessories uncomfortable to use. Also, I felt it was slow getting \\"up to steam\\" and it felt \\"heavy\\" with a full load of water. Additionally, it seemed to not want to work properly when the unit wasn't particularily level. Steam cleaning, in principle, is a great idea, but it seems this product's adaptation and implementation of the principle is not good. Save your money or look elsewhere if you must have a handheld steam cleaning unit; this unit was too expensive and did not work well in this user's opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not work","review":"This product doesn't work. I used it on my stove. After going thru every attachment i gave up and used my Mr. Clean eraser and hot water. That worked better than the steamer. The steam was weak and it wasnt that hot even though the steamer's \\"ready\\" light was on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"The steamer was better than I expected especially for the price. However the unit once filled with water is very heavy and its a challenge to lift up and push the nozzle at the same time. If you are purchasing this item for yourself be prepared to use all your arm strength to activate the steamer. I know if I had arthritis or had any arm injuries I would have been unable to use it. However as I already said for the price it was a great deal and gets the job finished quickly and satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work very well.","review":"It only makes a small amount of steam at at time and it comes out in such a small volume that it only cleans a small spot at a time.

The music is timeless, not an album that sounds like it is stuck in the 80s or 90s, but rather an excellent collection of brilliant beats and lyrics.I am admittedly not a reggae aficionado, however I find myself drawn to some Bob Marley (Buffalo Soldier is a favorite), as well as other reggae tunes from the last 30 years. I do however appreciate this album in its entirety.My favorite tracks (they are all good!) are How U Livin and Hole In Ya Head.I have purchased the newly released album (2 cd album - remastered?) and like this album better.If you are looking for dance beats like Here Comes the Hotstepper song - this album is not for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"It great, you don't need a lot depending on what you are doing.

Prof. of English, Univ. of Maryland Baltimore County), about personal disorientation among the streets of history that may or may not have taken place. Bridging the hypothetical and the mythical into a word where secrets are revealed piece by piece, Gagarin Street provokes deep thought at the changing nuances of personality and environment with the passage of time. \\"Four Autobiographies\\": 1) I tried to write it down: // how I abandoned the sinking ship, / washed up on the indifferent shore / among people whose words I couldn't understand, / though I had mastered every language of the world. // (See it's already distorted.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poems of tension, apocalypse, and solace","review":"I'll start this review by admitting my bias: Piotr Gwiazda is one of my professors, and a very good one at that, so I'm of course inclined to be kind to him. Fortunately, his poetry is very deserving. Apocalyptic imagery runs throughout, and Gwiazda captures a peculiar (but all too familiar in the era of 24-hour news) disconnection from it. More than anything tension pervades these poems - tension between past and present, public and private, self and projections of self, expectation and result. That is not to say there is not some levity, though; he more than once invites the reader, as in one of my favorites, \\"Canticle,\\" to relax and \\"have a drink.\\" These poems do seem to find solace in language, however - in my favorite poem of the collection, \\"July,\\" the poet describes how he \\"survived on bread and Tolstoy.\\" Language, it seems, is what keeps the poet connected to an alienating world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable content","review":"This is the black and white version of the book - the color version is worth spending the extra money.

That's is what this book is a push to have their ALCAT test performed to tell you what foods you shouldn't eat. A test this is regarded as unproven and is opposed by the major Allergy associations. I was hoping to some insight into an elimination diet or the science behind food allergies but instead each chapter was some flimsy argument on why modern medicine is failing or someone that was saved after they had the ALCAT test...

I was hoping they would explain further how to get into pin up modeling and what to expect when you are on sets and such. I wish they touched on other resources and where to go if you need help getting started. I do have to agree with the other reviewer that this is very amateur and the models seemed nervous at times and there was very little editing when it was needed such as the makeup mess up.

I love the movie all-together, kind of more corny than the other 3 due to the acting on some of the other actors, but the Hilliker brothers are why I am in love with the movies. Especially 4.

I was hoping that the series would get better. It was better than Wrong Turn 4, but just a pale shade of the original movie. I have noticed the make-up and sets are just not as grissly or hard core as the original movie. The story was better than Wrong Turn 4. But the make up on the hill billy trio looked terrible. The only redeeming quality was adding in their normal looking relative played by Doug Bradley ( Pinhead from the Hell Raiser series ).

Shame on me for not checking when I rented it, but I'd kind of figured a direct to video feature like Wrong Turn 5 would be available for longer than 24-hours after my $3 or $4 investment. I've rented movies from Amazon with a much higher pedigree that were available anywhere from 48-hours to 5-days after I purchased it. My bad for not waiting for this flick to find its home amongst similar offerings on Netflix. Here's to hoping Amazon extends the shelf-life of low grade \\"B-Horror\\" rentals to...I dunno...72-hrs.

The camera/monitor make it very easy to judge distance while backing up. However, after about 3 months the camera lens fogged up and I called customer service from the manufacturer to get an RMA.

I had it professionally installed, so I was concerned about the removal and subsequent re-install but everything went very smoothly. The new camera arrived within the same week I sent the old camera which was a very pleasant surprise. Well, the second camera now is starting to fog up, so I'll see if they'll send another.

Foolish me, I thought wireless meant no wires. For those of you who don't have degrees in electrical engineering or electrician's tools, this is a useless piece of equipment. The price is right, but the average person is then going to have to have it professionally installed to the tune of another $100-$200. Wireless my arse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"This book is a must read eventually because of its incredibly detailed account of glass working. However, it is a poor book for beginners. Very few and old pictures are a blaring tell tale sign, as is the fact that they seem to make stained glass a lot more complicated than it needs to be for the beginner. If you're looking for a good starter book, keep looking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good text but very poor photographs","review":"This book has lots of good information and fairly comprehensive text, but I was very disappointed in the poor quality of the photographs. They seem to be snapshots rather than professional photographs illustrating techniques and equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fairly amateur look at stained glass","review":"Back in the 60's and 70's when there was nothing else available, the first edition of this book was still a poor resource Manuel. This book promoted the idea that 50/50 solder should be used in lead came construction and 60/40 should be used when doing copper foil construction. This is just the opposite of what should be done since 60/40 has a lower melting temperature and so should be used with came to lessen the risk of melting the came.Now that there are many more good to great books on stained glass, give this tired tome a rest and get one of the newer, better illustrated books a try. Even a video on stained glass would be better than this poor attempt to educate.Beginning Stained Glass"},{"rating":"2","title":"Service from this seller was excellent.","review":"I recieved the book within a few days of my order, in excellent condition as advertised. I would never hesitate to order again from Four Corners Books.
